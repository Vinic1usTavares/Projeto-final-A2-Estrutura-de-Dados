agrippa a book of dead is a work of art created by science fiction novelist william gibson artist dennis ashbaugh and publisher kevin begos jr in 1992 work consists of a 300 line semi autobiographical electronic poem by gibson embedded in an artist s book by ashbaugh gibson s text focused on ethereal human owed nature of memories retained over passage of time title referred to a kodak photo album from which text s memories are taken its principal notoriety arose from fact that poem stored on a 3 5 floppy disk was programmed to encrypt itself after a single use similarly pages of artist s book were treated with photosensitive chemicals effecting gradual fading of words and images from book s first exposure to light origin and concept impetus for initiation of project was kevin begos jr a publisher of museum quality manuscripts motivated by disregard for commercialism of art world who suggested to abstract painter dennis ashbaugh that they put out an art book on computer that vanishes ashbaugh who despite his heavy art world resume was bored with abstract impressionist paintings he was doing took suggestion seriously and developed it further a few years beforehand ashbaugh had written a fan letter to cyberpunk novelist william gibson whose oeuvre he had admired and pair had struck up a telephone friendship shortly after project had germinated in minds of begos and ashbaugh they contacted and recruited gibson project exemplified gibson s deep ambivalence towards technologically advanced futurity and as new york times expressed it was designed to challenge conventional notions about books and art while extracting money from collectors of both project manifested as a poem written by gibson incorporated into an artist s book created by ashbaugh as such it was as much a work of collaborative conceptual art as poetry gibson stated that ashbaugh s design eventually included a supposedly self devouring floppy disk intended to display text only once then eat itself ashbaugh was gleeful at dilemma this would pose to librarians in order to register copyright of book he had to send two copies to united states library of congress who in order to classify it had to read it and in process necessarily had to destroy it creators had initially intended to infect disks with a computer virus but declined to after considering potential damage to computer systems of innocents release and replication work was premiered on december 9 1992 at kitchen an art space in chelsea in new york city performance known as transmission consisted of public reading of poem by composer and musician robert ashley recorded and simultaneously transmitted to several other cities poem was inscribed on a sculptural magnetic disk which had been vacuum sealed until event s commencement and was reportedly although not actually programmed to erase itself upon exposure to air contrary to numerous colourful reports neither this disk nor embedded in artist s book were ever actually hacked in any strict sense academic researcher matthew kirschenbaum has reported that a pirated text of poem was released next day on mindvox an edgy new york city based electronic bulletin board kirschenbaum considers mindvox an interface between dark web and global internet to have been an ideal initial host text spread rapidly from that point on first on ftp servers and anonymous mailers and later via usenet and email since gibson did not use email at time fans sent copies of pirated text to his fax machine precise manner in which text was obtained for mindvox is unclear although initial custodian of text known only as templar attached to it an introductory note in which he claimed credit begos claimed that a troupe of new york university students representing themselves as documentarians attended transmission and made a videotape recording of screen as it displayed text as an accompaniment of jillette s reading kirschenbaum speculates that this group included offline persona of templar or one of his associates according to this account ostensibly endorsed by templar in a post to slashdot in february 2000 students then transcribed poem from tape and within hours had uploaded it to mindvox however according to a dissenting account by hacktivist and mindvox co founder patrick k kroupa subterfuge prior to transmission elicited a betrayal of trust which yielded uploaders text kirschenbaum declined to elaborate on specifics of kroupa conjecture which he declared himself not at liberty to disclose on december 9 2008 sixteenth anniversary of original transmission agrippa files working with a scholarly team at university of maryland released an emulated run of entire poem derived from an original diskette loaned by a collector and an hour s worth of bootleg footage shot covertly at americas society source of text that was posted on mindvox cryptography since its debut in 1992 mystery of agrippa remained hidden for 20 years although many had tried to hack code and decrypt program source code was lost long ago alan liu and his team at agrippa files created an extensive website with tools and resources to crack agrippa code they collaborated with matthew kirschenbaum at maryland institute for technology in humanities and digital forensics lab and quinn dupont a phd student of cryptography from university of toronto in calling for aid of cryptographers to figure out how program works by creating cracking agrippa code challenge which enlisted participants to solve intentional scrambling of poem in exchange for prizes code was successfully cracked by robert xiao in late july 2012 there is no encryption algorithm present in agrippa binary consequently visual encryption effect that displays when poem has finished is a ruse visual effect is result of running decrypted ciphertext in memory through re purposed bit scrambling decryption algorithm and then abandoning text in memory only fake genetic code is written back to disk encryption resembles rsa algorithm this algorithm encodes data in 3 byte blocks first each byte is through an 8 position permutation then bits are split into two 12 bit integers by taking low 4 bits of second byte and 8 bits of first byte as first 12 bit integer and 8 bits of third byte and 4 high bits of second integer as second 12 bit integer each is individually encrypted by taking them to power mod bits are then reassembled into 3 bytes encrypted text is then stored in a string variable as part of program to shroud would be visible and noticeable text it is compressed with simple lzw before final storage as macintosh common lisp compiler compresses main program code into executable this was not that necessary in order to prevent a second running of program it corrupts itself when run program simply overwrites itself with a 6000 byte long dna like code at a certain position archival documents suggest that original plan was to use a series of ascii 1 s to corrupt binary but at some point in development a change was made to use fake genetic code in keeping with visual motifs in book genetic code has a codon entropy of 5 97 bits codon much higher than any natural dna sequence known however ciphertext was not overwritten weakness a memory dump of mini can be obtained with linux or a similar tool after agrippa program has been loaded executable code could be reverse engineered encryption itself due to block cipher exhibited a regular pattern due to repeated text in original plaintext lzw compression itself does not hide letter frequencies scramble display has exactly same letter frequencies as underlying plaintext content and editions book was published in 1992 in two limited editions deluxe and small by kevin begos jr publishing new york city deluxe edition came in a 16 by 21 1 2 inch 41 cm x 55 cm metal mesh case sheathed in kevlar a polymer used to make bulletproof vests and designed to look like a buried relic inside is a book of 93 ragged and charred pages sewn by hand and bound in stained and singed linen by karl foulkes book gives impression of having survived a fire it was described by peter schwenger as a black box recovered from some unspecified disaster edition includes pages of dna sequences set in double columns of 42 lines each like gutenberg bible and copperplate aquatint etchings by ashbaugh by peter on tiepolo paper monochromatic etchings depict stylised chromosomes a hallmark of ashbaugh s work accompanied by imagery of a pistol camera or in some instances simple line drawings all allusions to gibson s contribution deluxe edition was set in monotype gill sans at letter foundry and printed on rives heavyweight text by begos and sun hill press final 60 pages of book were then fused together with a hollowed out section cut into centre containing self erasing diskette on which text of gibson s poem was encrypted encryption was work of a pseudonymous computer programmer brash assisted by electronic frontier foundation founders john perry barlow and john gilmore deluxe edition was originally priced at us 1500 later 2000 and each copy is unique to some degree because of handmade or hand finished elements small edition was sold for 450 like deluxe edition it was set in monotype gill sans but in single columns it was printed on mohawk text by sun hill press with reproduction of etchings printed on a canon laser printer edition was then smythe sewn at spectrum and enclosed in a solander box a bronze boxed collectors copy was also released and retailed at 7 500 fewer than 95 deluxe editions of agrippa are extant although exact number is unknown and is source of considerable mystery victoria and albert museum possesses a deluxe edition numbered 4 of 10 a publicly accessible copy of deluxe edition is available at rare books division of new york public library and a small copy resides at western michigan university in kalamazoo michigan while frances mulhall achilles library at whitney museum of american art in new york city hosts a promotional prospectus victoria and albert museum s copy was first exhibited in a display entitled book and beyond held in museum s 20th century gallery from april to october 1995 same copy was subsequently also included in a v a display entitled digital pioneers from 2009 2010 another copy of book was exhibited in 2003 2004 exhibition ninety from nineties at new york public library gibson at one point claimed never to have seen a copy of printed book spurring speculation that no copies had actually been made many copies have since been documented and gibson s signature was noted on copy held by new york public library in 2011 bodleian library s special collections department at university of oxford acquired kevin begos copy of agrippa as well as archive of begos papers related to work poem alt head shot of a short haired man wearing rimless glasses his eyes are in shadow thumb william gibson author of agrippa poem pictured in paris on his 60th birthday may 17 2008 construction of book and subject matter of poem within it share a metaphorical connection in decay of memory in this light critic peter schwenger asserts that agrippa can be understood as organized by two ideas death of gibson s father and disappearance or absence of book itself in this sense it ephemeral nature of all text theme and form poem is a detailed description of several objects including a photo album and camera that took pictures in it and is essentially about nostalgia that speaker presumably gibson himself feels towards details of his family s history painstaking descriptions of houses they lived in cars they drove and even their pets in its original form text of poem was supposed to fade from page and in gibson s own words eat itself off of diskette enclosed with book reader would then be left with only memory of text much like speaker is left with only memory of his home town and his family after moving to canada from south carolina in course of poem as gibson himself did during vietnam war mechanism poem contains a motif of mechanism described as forever dividing that from this agrippa pt ii l 4 5 and which can take form of camera or of ancient gun that misfires in speaker s hands technology mechanism is agent of memory which transforms subjective experience into allegedly objective records photography it is also agent of life and death one moment dispensing lethal bullets but also likened to life giving qualities of sex shooting gun is l ike first time you put your mouth on a woman agrippa pt ii l 41 42 poem is then not merely about memory but how memories are formed from subjective experience and how those memories compare to mechanically reproduced recordings in poem mechanism is strongly associated with recording which can replace subjective experience insomuch as memories constitute our identities mechanism thus represents destruction of self via recordings hence both cameras as devices of recording and guns as instruments of destruction are part of same mechanism dividing that memory identity life from this recordings anonymity death critical reception and influence agrippa was extremely influential as a sigil for artistic community to appreciate potential of electronic media for extent to which it entered public consciousness it caused a fierce controversy in art world among museums and among libraries it challenged established notions of permanence of art and literature and as ashbaugh intended raised significant problems for archivists seeking to preserve it for benefit of future generations agrippa was also used as key of a book cipher in cicada 3301 mystery agrippa was particularly well received by critics with digital media theorist peter lunenfeld describing it in 2001 as one of most evocative published in 1990s professor of english literature john johnson has claimed that importance of agrippa stems not only from its foregrounding of in an assemblage of texts but also from fact that media in this work are explicitly as passageways to realm of dead english professor raymond argues that poem s stanzas form a metaphorical dna fingerprint that reveals gibson s life to be paradoxically a novel repetition of his father s and grandfather s lives cambridge history of twentieth century english literature which described poem as a mournful text praised agrippa s inventive use of digital format however academic joseph remarked in a 2008 paper that agrippa was among those works that are canonized before they have been read resisted and reconsidered among fellow authors within an institutional environment that persists in time and finds outlets in many media in a lecture at exhibition of agrippa at center for book arts in new york city marshall blonsky of new york university drew an allusion between project and work of two french literary figures philosopher maurice author of absence of book and poet stephane mallarme a 19th century forerunner of semiotics and deconstruction in response to blonsky s analysis that t he collaborators in agrippa are responding to a historical condition of language a modern skepticism about it gibson disparagingly commented honest to god these academics who think it s all some sort of big time french philosophy that s a scam those guys worship jerry lewis they get
