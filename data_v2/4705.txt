portage glacier highway or portage glacier road is a highway located in u s state of alaska highway is made up of a series of roads bridges and tunnels that connect portage glacier area of chugach national forest and city of whittier to seward highway most of highway travels through mainly rural areas just north of kenai peninsula with anton anderson memorial tunnel passing under maynard mountain part of chugach mountain range parts of route were first constructed in early 1900s and entire highway was completed on june 7 2000 as part of whittier access project highway has not been extended or rerouted main portion of highway traveling from western terminus to begich boggs visitors center is designated as national forest highway 35 by united states forest service usfs route description portion of portage glacier highway traveling from seward highway to begich boggs visitor center is designated as part of forest highway 35 a federal forest highway ffh forest highways are funded and administered by usfs and federal highway administration system was created by federal aid highway act of 1921 ffh 35 is one of 33 forest highways that are currently designated in alaska

campgrounds maintained by usfs roadway bends eastward passing usfs williwaw campgrounds as well as several small gravel roads road continues for a short distance before passing begich boggs visitor center and associated buildings comprising headquarters of portage glacier unit of chugach national forest highway continues onto portage creek bridge which is long it allows highway to cross over small portage creek which drains portage lake in turn fed by portage glacier bridge ends at start of portage lake tunnel tunnel is long and constructed of concrete route proceeds on to a portion of road known as rock cut at portage lake by alaska department of transportation public facilities dot pf this road passes along coast of portage lake and borders a large man made cliff to north hence name rock cut this portion of route terminates at placer creek bridge bridge which is just long spans over placer creek smaller of two creeks feeding portage lake highway continues to six lane bear

portage glacier entrance alt entrance to tunnel anton anderson memorial tunnel often called whittier tunnel after town at its eastern terminus is a dual use bimodal highway and railroad tunnel that passes under maynard mountain at a length of it is second longest highway tunnel and longest combined rail and highway tunnel in north america tunnel was upgraded to bimodal use by kiewit construction company between september 1998 and mid summer 2000 redesigned tunnel is fitted with a single highway lane floor of tunnel is constructed of 1 800 concrete panels each with railroad tracks sunken slightly below road surface interior is exposed rock and contains several safe houses which are small buildings that are used in case of severe earthquakes vehicle fires or other emergencies tunnel also contains several pull outs which are reserved for disabled vehicles as motor vehicle speed in tunnel is limited to 25 miles per hour 40 km h it takes about ten minutes to travel from end to end tunnel uses a combination of portal fans and reversible jet fans to ensure proper air flow and air quality throughout tunnel there are two backup generators to ensure that computerized traffic controls and safe house ventilation systems in tunnel continue to function in event of a power failure because eastbound traffic westbound traffic and alaska railroad must share tunnel rail and road traffic are coordinated by two computer based systems tunnel control system and train signal system these systems control timing of vehicles entering tunnel spacing them for safety and lower railroad gates when a train is approaching tunnel s entrance portals are designed in an a shape with a large train sized garage door which allows traffic in and out of tunnel entrance portals are designed to withstand force of an avalanche tunnel s eastern terminus is in whittier staging areas on either end of tunnel can accommodate as many as 450 vehicles waiting to pass through vehicle convoys enter tunnel in alternating directions every half hour tunnel operates from early morning until late evening on a schedule that varies seasonally and according to construction and maintenance needs pedestrians and bicycles are prohibited in anton anderson memorial administrative code title 17 transportation and public facilities chapter 17 38 anton anderson memorial tunnel section 17 38 035

and onto whittier street road crosses over alaska railroad before bending southeastward and traveling past a large parking lot whittier parking and camping headquarters traveling past several businesses making up central whittier highway turns east and intersects glacier avenue as well as a short pedestrian pathway roadway continues through central whittier before reaching a four way intersection with blackstone road eastern avenue and depot road after which route transfers to latter road continues along passage canal for a short distance while traveling towards alaska marine highway amhs pier depot road splits away from highway which continues for a short distance along dock access road before reaching its eastern terminus amhs pier traffic highway is maintained by alaska department of transportation public facilities akdot pf part of job of akdot pf is to measure traffic along highway these counts are taken using a metric called annual average daily traffic aadt this is a statistical calculation of average daily number of vehicles that travel along a portion of highway estimated aadt for portage glacier highway is 1 030 vehicles in addition to taking aadt akdot pf also takes monthly and yearly counts for highway road s yearly traffic count for 2010 was 234 738 vehicles roadway s highest monthly traffic is in mid summer when an average of nearly 50 000 vehicles use tunnel each month highway s lowest monthly traffic is in late winter when average monthly traffic is only about 6 000 monthly and yearly counts are taken at entrance to anton anderson memorial

single direction before alternating to other tunnel is open from 5 30 a m to 11 15 p m during summer months and from 7 00 a m to 10 45 p m during winter months history native trail earliest evidence of portage valley being used for transportation dates back to early a d when inuit people used flat low lying valley as a pass through chugach mountains dena ina people continued using valley as a passage between cochrane bay and turnagain arm they used portage creek for fishing purposes and established a series of trails along creek russian fur traders and early settlers continued to use valley establishing a trail along creek and portage and burns glaciers it was possible for boats to travel through valley by using passage canal and creek up until 1913 trail was usable until 1939 due to continuous recession of portage glacier final party to attempt to use trail that year was forced to climb up portage shoulder to avoid drop offs and crevasses that had formed along trail railroad development in 1940 u s government realized that it needed to reevaluate its territories including alaska alaska was declared a vulnerable attack target as was existing railroad connecting anchorage and seward u s armed forces began planning for new roads and railroads and on october 15 1940 general simon bolivar buckner jr announced those plans plan called for existing railroad to be transferred to whittier and for construction of a road to seward seward highway a road to richardson highway glenn highway and tok cut off and a road to portage valley portage glacier highway less than a week after announcement of plan surveying of area around whittier was taking place in order to make sure of safety of building railroad terminal project was strongly opposed by city of seward but after survey was complete project was definite in early 1941 large groups of people from kenai peninsula traveled to washington d c to protest moving of railroad protests were useless and on april 3 1941 u s congress passed a bill providing project with 5 3 million equivalent to respectively in in late april u s army s 177th engineering group began work on clearing and grading former native trail u s army hired west construction company of boston ma to assist in construction of future railroad s two tunnels west construction and army began working on tunnel under mount maynard in late august 1941 first boring of tunnel began on east side of mountain and shortly afterwards construction on west side began winter hindered construction of tunnel until mid november when a small building was constructed u s entered world war ii on december 8 1941 after japanese bombing of pearl harbor this sparked need for completion of tunnel earlier than expected by end of 1941 workers had tunneled more than into maynard mountain work on tunnel rapidly increased into summer of 1942 large areas of rock were blasted away with dynamite material removed from tunnel was used as grading material for other parts of railway supplies were received behind schedule mainly due to war this hindered progress on tunnel in june 1942 japanese forces attacked and invaded alaskan islands of attu and kiska again provoking need to complete tunnels sooner winter conditions of 1942 and 1943 slowed progress of tunnels work on railroad continued until april 23 1943 when project was completed anton anderson lead engineer for tunnels and namesake for tunnel to whittier was not present when railroad was used for first time fearing whittier tunnel was not ready early roads thumb right alt a detail from a map with several roads and railroads road preceding portage glacier highway in 1955 u s army established a series of simple earthen roads while constructing railroad spur this was first road to exist in portage valley whittier began to grow after completion of railroad spur port boomed in mid 1940s with population reaching over 1 000 city including roads began to form by 1953 earthen road in portage valley had generally been relocated near location of present highway also around that time a road in whittier in location of present highway existed as a graded dirt road highway was probably paved sometime between 1965 and 1967 and three small bridges along route were constructed all of which are still used today portage creek overflow no 1 portage creek overflow no 2 portage creek overflow no 3 highway studies and proposals between late 1950s and early 1960s u s military pulled out of whittier allowing town to grow as a commercial port whittier s location made it a large tourist location and after military pullout travel to whittier grew massively in addition to state s paving of highway alaska railroad began offering shuttle services between portage and whittier in mid 1960s alaska railroad would allow vehicles to drive onto flatcars which would then be transported by train through anton anderson memorial tunnel to whittier number of people visiting whittier grew progressively bringing with it a larger number of requests for a more convenient and affordable way of transportation to whittier during late 1970s a proposal was put forward for a road to whittier in preparation for highway anchorage businessman pete purchased buckner building and planned to convert it into a resort however highway proposal fell through in 1981 akdot pf began to study possible alternatives to railroad which would have cost anywhere between 10 million and 68 million in 1993 akdot pf finally initiated study for alternative transportation system to whittier project would be named whittier access project akdot pf authorized hdr alaska to conduct study study presented five solutions increasing existing service installing a high speed electric rail service constructing a series of highways over mountain range building a highway and tunnels through mountain range and constructing a highway to existing railroad tunnel and expanding tunnel to withstand motor vehicles after consulting with members of alaska railroad general public and highway and tunnel engineers akdot pf decided to proceed with last option involving expansion of anton anderson memorial tunnel and construction of a highway in november 1995 an environmental impact statement created by hdr alaska was approved by federal highway administration allowing project to proceed whittier access project in march 1996 state of alaska announced its final plans for construction of whittier access project project was predicted to cost around 50 million and project was planned to begin later that year however project was met with much controversy and by december 1996 project still had not begun cost of construction was reevaluated to be around 60 million and project was planned to begin in march 1997 construction of whittier access project finally began on may 6 1997 then governor of alaska tony knowles began construction when he detonated six pounds of explosives located on begich peak although this was unrelated to project on may 22 1997 construction of project was halted carl s armbrister director of office of planning and program development for federal highway administration s 10th region and head of project was sued by several environmental agencies and tourism groups headed by alaska center for environment ace ace brought suit against armbrister on grounds that project violated section 4 f of department of transportation act of 1966 which requires that all environmental impacts of a project be assessed and that a project has no feasible and prudent alternative ace held that a new highway was not needed and improving existing rail service was a prudent and feasible option however one day after construction was stopped a judicial ruling was issued permitting work to continue construction continued for a week until may 31 but was then halted again due to lawsuit work on project was ruled off until at least mid july of that year james keith singleton jr district judge overseeing case ruled in favor of armbrister and federal highway administration and stated that agency was correct in its decision against improved rail service suit was compared to landmark 1971 case citizens to preserve overton park v volpe wherein supreme court of united states ruled in favor of memphis tennessee citizens attempting to protect overton park from a plan to route interstate 40 through of its forest however unlike in that case whittier access project was found to be only feasible solution for a link to whittier ace appealed decision and case went to ninth circuit court of appeals court upheld singleton s decision finding that project only affected a very small amount of parkland and that road was necessary to meet requirements for a link to city these rulings were legally significant as they appeared to overturn precedent established in overton park case which was interpreted as saying that it must be shown that implications of not building a highway pose an unusual situation thumb left a view of rock cut at portage lake which was constructed as part of project alt a view of a lake and highway in portage valley work on project was finally approved following ninth circuit s decision lawsuit had put project which had been planned to be completed by end of 1998 far behind schedule first phase of construction consisted of building portage creek bridge and construction of a new tunnel through begich peak contract for phase had been awarded prior to lawsuit but work on components was not completed until very late in 1998 a temporary bridge was built over portage creek so that tunnel could be constructed final part of phase was replacing temporary bridge over portage creek structure was designed so that it would appear to fit with environment but could also withstand regular seismic activity of region and have a minimal impact on surrounding fish and plant populations hill was selected to design approximately of highway that would connect existing road to anton anderson tunnel construction of highway done by herndon and thompson inc was finished before tunnel work began kiewit construction company based in omaha nebraska was awarded contract for phase two redesigning anton anderson tunnel kiewit began planning tunnel design in june 1998 and began work on project sometime around september first part of tunnel construction involved vertically and horizontally expanding existing rock walls beginning from western entrance kiewit drilled away several feet of rock face from top of tunnel and installed a net to prevent any potential rockfalls they then drilled sideways clearing space for nine vehicle turnaround areas however work on tunnel was hindered by several different events while crews were working on tunnel a drunken whittier resident drove his or her truck into tunnel and got it stuck on rails on october 23 a thirteen car train derailed at western entrance although no workers were injured a substantial amount of equipment was destroyed in addition to accidents crews had to work in extreme weather kiewit claims that workers had to deal with winds of more than 120 mph minus 40 degree temperatures and snow up to 43 feet deep and wind chills that would drop to around an avalanche also at one point halted construction for four days thumb right inside of tunnel which was expanded and redesigned during project alt tunnel interior with train tracks in roadway and safe house visible despite conditions crews were forced to do much of work during winter since project had to adjust to train schedule trains ran daily during summer so work was restricted to about nine hour shifts during night during winter months trains were only operating during four days each week when a train was scheduled to come through tunnel crews reported they had to spend up to two hours breaking down equipment getting it all outside and waiting for train to pass before heading back into mountain following expansion of tunnel one of first steps crews took was to demolish existing entrance portals once they were destroyed existing rail was removed in sections pre cast panels were laid where tracks had been before old rail was put back and secured to panels while that was being completed some crews installed a series of anti icing insulation panels and drainage pipes to keep tunnel clear during winter months construction work was completed on schedule in early 2000 town of whittier began a number of improvements to help adjust for road s opening among these were more parking facilities and increasing public restrooms town government also approved of several long term changes to city that would begin after road was opened including a second harbor a bicycle trail a new sidewalk system and shopping center official opening ceremony was held on june 7 and was marked by protests from environmentalists a group of three of them chained themselves together in middle of road in an attempt to block traffic while another group of about twenty hung banners and waved signs ceremony was attended by around 300 people then governor knowles performed a ribbon cutting and rode through tunnel in a 1954 model cadillac major junctions related route forest highway 35 ffh 35 is a federal forest highway located entirely within chugach national forest highway is approximately
