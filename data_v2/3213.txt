social order emperor was at apex of han society and government however emperor was often a minor ruled over by a regent such as empress dowager or one of her male relatives ranked immediately below emperor were kings who were of same liu family clan rest of society including nobles lower than kings and all commoners excluding slaves belonged to one of twenty ranks each successive rank gave its holder greater pensions and legal privileges highest rank of full marquess came with a state pension and a territorial fiefdom holders of rank immediately below that of ordinary marquess received a pension but had no territorial rule officials who served in government belonged to wider commoner social class and were ranked just below nobles in social prestige highest government officials could be enfeoffed as marquesses by eastern han period local elites of unattached scholars teachers students and government officials began to identify themselves as members of a larger nationwide gentry class with shared values and a commitment to mainstream scholarship when government became noticeably corrupt in mid to late eastern han many gentrymen even considered cultivation of morally grounded personal relationships more important than serving in public office farmer or specifically small landowner cultivator was ranked just below scholars and officials in social hierarchy other agricultural cultivators were of a lower status such as tenants wage laborers and in rare cases slaves artisans technicians tradespeople and craftsmen had a legal and socioeconomic status between that of owner cultivator farmers and common merchants state registered merchants who were forced by law to wear white colored clothes and pay high commercial taxes were considered by gentry as social parasites with a contemptible status these were often petty shopkeepers of urban marketplaces merchants such as industrialists and itinerant traders working between a network of cities could avoid registering as merchants and were often wealthier and more powerful than vast majority of government officials wealthy landowners such as nobles and officials often provided lodging for retainers who provided valuable work or duties sometimes including fighting bandits or riding into battle unlike slaves retainers could come and go from their master s home as they pleased medical physicians pig breeders and butchers had a fairly high social status while occultist diviners runners and messengers had low status marriage gender and kinship han era family was patrilineal and typically had four to five nuclear family members living in one household multiple generations of extended family members did not occupy same house unlike families of later dynasties according to confucian family norms various family members were treated with different levels of respect and intimacy for example there were different accepted time frames for mourning death of a father versus a paternal uncle marriages were highly ritualized particularly for wealthy and included many important steps giving of betrothal gifts known as and dowry were especially important a lack of either was considered dishonorable and woman would have been seen not as a wife but as a concubine arranged marriages were normal with father s input on his offspring s spouse being considered more important than mother s monogamous marriages were also normal although nobles and high officials were wealthy enough to afford and support concubines as additional lovers under certain conditions dictated by custom not law both men and women were able to divorce their spouses and remarry however a woman who had been widowed continued to belong to her husband s family after his death in order to remarry widow would have to be returned to her family in exchange for a ransom fee her children would not be allowed to go with her apart from passing of noble titles or ranks inheritance practices did not involve primogeniture each son received an equal share of family property unlike practice in later dynasties father usually sent his adult married sons away with their portions of family fortune daughters received a portion of family fortune through their marriage dowries though this was usually much less than shares of sons a different distribution of remainder could be specified in a will but it is unclear how common this was women were expected to obey will of their father then their husband and then their adult son in old age however it is known from contemporary sources that there were many deviations to this rule especially in regard to mothers over their sons and empresses who ordered around and openly humiliated their fathers and brothers women were exempt from annual corvee labor duties but often engaged in a range of income earning occupations aside from their domestic chores of cooking and cleaning most common occupation for women was weaving clothes for family sale at market or for large textile enterprises that employed hundreds of women other women helped on their brothers farms or became singers dancers sorceresses respected medical physicians and successful merchants who could afford their own silk clothes some women formed spinning collectives aggregating resources of several different families education literature and philosophy early western han court simultaneously

and recommending nominees for high office he could appoint officials below salary rank of 600 bushels imperial counselor s chief duty was to conduct disciplinary procedures for officials he shared similar duties with chancellor such as receiving annual provincial reports however when his title was changed to minister of works in 8 bc his chief duty became oversight of public works projects

for official bureaucracy and armed forces who handled tax revenues and set standards for units of measurement minister steward shao fu served emperor exclusively providing him with entertainment and amusements proper food and clothing medicine and physical care valuables and equipment local government in han dynasty excluding kingdoms and marquessates was divided in descending order of size into political units of provinces zhou commanderies jun and counties xian a county was divided into several districts latter composed of a group of hamlets each containing about a hundred families heads of provinces whose official title was changed from inspector to governor and vice versa several times during han were responsible for inspecting several commandery level and kingdom level administrations on basis of their reports officials in these local administrations would be promoted demoted dismissed or prosecuted by imperial court a governor could take various actions without permission from imperial court lower ranked inspector had executive powers only during times of crisis such as raising militias across commanderies under his jurisdiction to suppress a rebellion a commandery consisted of a group of counties and was headed by an administrator he was top civil and military leader of commandery and handled defense lawsuits seasonal instructions to farmers and recommendations of nominees for office sent annually to capital in a quota system first established by emperor wu head of a large county of about 10 000 households was called a prefect while heads of smaller counties were called chiefs and both could be referred to as magistrates a magistrate maintained law and order in his county registered populace for taxation mobilized commoners for annual corvee duties repaired schools and supervised public works kingdoms and marquessates kingdoms roughly size of commanderies were ruled exclusively by emperor s male relatives as semi autonomous fiefdoms before 157 bc some kingdoms were ruled by non relatives granted to them in return for their services to emperor gaozu administration of each kingdom was very similar to that of central government although emperor appointed chancellor of each kingdom kings appointed all remaining civil officials in their fiefs however in 145 bc after several insurrections by kings emperor jing removed kings rights to appoint officials whose salaries were higher than 400 bushels imperial counselors and nine ministers excluding minister coachman of every kingdom were abolished although chancellor was still appointed by central government with these reforms kings were reduced to being nominal heads of their fiefs gaining a personal income from only a portion of taxes collected in their kingdom similarly officials in administrative staff of a full marquess s fief were appointed by central government a marquess s chancellor was ranked as equivalent of a county prefect like a king marquess collected a portion of tax revenues in his fief as personal income thumb upright a han dynasty era pottery soldier with a now faded coating of paint is missing a weapon military at beginning of han dynasty every male

diameter han dynasty inherited ban liang coin type from qin in beginning of han emperor gaozu closed government mint in favor of private minting of coins this decision was reversed in 186 bc by his widow grand empress dowager lu zhi d 180 bc who abolished private minting in 182 bc lu zhi issued a bronze coin that was much lighter in weight than previous coins this caused widespread inflation that was not reduced until 175 bc when emperor wen allowed private minters to manufacture coins that were precisely 2 6 g 0 09 oz in weight in 144 bc emperor jing abolished private minting in favor of central government and commandery level minting he also introduced a new coin emperor wu introduced another in 120 bc but a year later he abandoned ban entirely in favor of wuzhu wu zhu coin weighing 3 2 g 0 11 oz wuzhu became china s standard coin until tang dynasty 618 907 ad its use was interrupted briefly by several new currencies introduced during wang mang s regime until it was reinstated in 40 ad by emperor guangwu since commandery issued coins were often of inferior quality and lighter weight central government closed commandery mints and monopolized issue of coinage in 113 bc this central government issuance of coinage was overseen by superintendent of waterways and parks this duty being transferred to minister of finance during eastern han taxation and property aside from landowner s land tax paid in a portion of their crop yield poll tax and property taxes were paid in coin cash annual poll tax rate for adult men and women was 120 coins and 20 coins for minors merchants were required to pay a higher rate of 240 coins poll tax stimulated a money economy that necessitated minting of over 28 000 000 000 coins from 118 bc to 5 ad an average of 220 000 000 coins a year widespread circulation of coin cash allowed successful merchants to invest money in land empowering very social class government attempted to suppress through heavy commercial and property taxes emperor wu even enacted laws which banned registered merchants from owning land yet powerful merchants were able to avoid registration and own large tracts of land small landowner cultivators formed majority of han tax base this revenue was threatened during latter half of eastern han when many peasants fell into debt and were forced to work as farming tenants for wealthy landlords han government enacted reforms in order to keep small landowner cultivators out of debt and on their own farms these reforms included reducing taxes temporary remissions of taxes granting loans and providing landless peasants temporary lodging and work in agricultural colonies until they could recover from their debts in 168 bc land tax rate was reduced from one fifteenth of a farming household s crop yield to one thirtieth and later to a one hundredth of a crop yield for last decades of dynasty consequent loss of government revenue was compensated for by increasing property taxes labor tax took form of conscripted labor for one month per year which was imposed upon male commoners aged fifteen to fifty six this could be avoided in eastern han with a commutable tax since hired labor became more popular private manufacture and government monopolies thumb a han dynasty iron ji halberd and iron dagger in early western han a wealthy salt or iron industrialist whether a semi autonomous king or wealthy merchant could boast funds that rivaled imperial treasury and amass a peasant workforce of over a thousand this kept many peasants away from their farms and denied government a significant portion of its land tax revenue to eliminate influence of such private entrepreneurs emperor wu nationalized salt and iron industries in 117 bc and allowed many of former industrialists to become officials administering state monopolies by eastern han times central government monopolies were repealed in favor of production by commandery and county administrations as well as private businessmen liquor was another profitable private industry nationalized by central government in 98 bc however this was repealed in 81 bc and a property tax rate of two coins for every 0 2 l 0 05 gallons was levied for those who traded it privately by 110 bc emperor wu also interfered with profitable trade in grain when he eliminated speculation by selling government stored grain at a lower price than demanded by merchants apart from emperor ming s creation of a short lived office for price adjustment and stabilization which was abolished in 68 ad central government price control

iron which can be remelted in a cupola furnace to produce cast iron by means of a cold blast and hot blast were operational in china by late spring and autumn period 722 481 bc bloomery was nonexistent in ancient china however han era chinese produced wrought iron by injecting excess oxygen into a furnace and causing cast iron and pig iron could be converted into wrought iron and steel using a fining process thumb upright left a pair of eastern han iron scissors han dynasty chinese used bronze and iron to make a range of weapons culinary tools carpenters tools and domestic wares a significant product of these improved iron smelting techniques was manufacture of new agricultural tools three legged iron seed drill invented by 2nd century bc enabled farmers to carefully plant crops in rows instead of casting seeds out by hand heavy iron plow also invented during han dynasty required only one man to control it two oxen to pull it it had three plowshares a seed box for drills a tool which turned down soil and could sow roughly 45 730 m2 11 3 acres of land in a single day to protect crops from wind and drought grain intendant zhao guo zhao guo created alternating fields system dai tian fa during emperor wu s reign this system switched positions of furrows and ridges between growing seasons once experiments with this system yielded successful results government officially sponsored it and encouraged peasants to use it han farmers also used pit field system ao tian for growing crops which involved heavily fertilized pits that did not require plows or oxen and could be placed on sloping terrain in southern and small parts of central han era china paddy fields were chiefly used to grow rice while farmers along huai river used transplantation methods of rice

han wooden architecture is a collection of scattered ceramic roof tiles oldest surviving wooden halls in china date to tang dynasty ad 618 907 architectural historian robert l thorp points out scarcity of han era archaeological remains and claims that often unreliable han era literary and artistic sources are used by historians for clues about lost han architecture though han wooden structures decayed some han dynasty ruins made of brick stone and rammed earth remain intact this includes stone pillar gates brick tomb chambers rammed earth city walls rammed earth and brick beacon

capitals chang an and luoyang still stand along with their drainage systems of brick arches ditches and ceramic water pipes monumental stone pillar gates twenty nine of which survive from han period formed entrances of walled enclosures at shrine and tomb sites these pillars feature artistic imitations of wooden and ceramic building components such as roof tiles eaves and balustrades courtyard house is most common type of home portrayed in han artwork ceramic architectural models of buildings like houses and towers were found in han tombs perhaps to provide lodging for dead in afterlife these provide valuable clues about lost wooden architecture artistic designs found on ceramic roof tiles of tower models are in some cases exact matches to han roof tiles found at archaeological sites thumb left an eastern han vaulted tomb chamber at luoyang made of small bricks over ten han era underground tombs have been found many of them featuring archways vaulted chambers and domed roofs underground vaults and domes did not require buttress supports since they were held in place by earthen pits use of brick vaults and domes in aboveground han structures is unknown from han literary sources it is known that wooden trestle beam bridges arch bridges simple suspension bridges and floating pontoon bridges existed in han china however there are only two known references to arch bridges in han literature and only a single han relief sculpture in sichuan depicts an arch bridge underground mine shafts some reaching depths over were created for extraction of metal ores borehole

used to pound grain han era mechanical engineering comes largely from choice observational writings of sometimes disinterested confucian scholars who generally considered scientific and engineering endeavors to be far beneath them professional artisan engineers jiang jiang did not leave behind detailed records of their work see also han scholars who often had little or no expertise in mechanical engineering sometimes provided insufficient information on various technologies they described nevertheless some han literary sources provide crucial information for example in 15 bc philosopher and writer yang xiong described invention of belt drive for a machine which was of great importance to early textile manufacturing inventions of mechanical engineer and craftsman ding huan ding huan are mentioned in miscellaneous notes on western capital around ad 180 ding created a manually operated rotary fan used for air conditioning within palace buildings ding also used gimbals as pivotal supports for one of his incense burners and invented world s first known zoetrope lamp modern archaeology has led to discovery of han artwork portraying inventions which were otherwise absent in han literary sources as observed in han miniature tomb models but not in literary sources crank handle was used to operate fans of winnowing machines that separated grain from chaff odometer cart invented during han measured journey lengths using mechanical figures banging drums and gongs to indicate each distance traveled this invention is depicted in han artwork by 2nd century yet detailed written descriptions were not offered until 3rd century modern archaeologists have also unearthed specimens of devices used during han dynasty for example a pair of sliding metal calipers used by craftsmen for making minute measurements these calipers contain inscriptions of exact day and year they were manufactured these tools are not mentioned in any han literary sources thumb upright left a modern replica of zhang heng s seismometer waterwheel appeared in chinese records during han as mentioned by huan tan about ad 20 they were used to turn gears that lifted iron trip hammers and were used in pounding threshing and polishing grain however there is no sufficient evidence for watermill in china until about 5th century nanyang commandery administrator and mechanical engineer du shi d 38 ad created a waterwheel powered that worked bellows for smelting of iron were also used to power chain pumps that lifted water to raised irrigation ditches chain pump was first mentioned in china by

water clock waterwheel and a series of gears court astronomer zhang heng ad 78 139 was able to mechanically rotate his metal ringed armillary sphere to address problem of slowed timekeeping in pressure head of inflow water clock zhang was first in china to install an additional tank between reservoir and inflow vessel zhang also invented a device he termed an earthquake yi hou feng di dong yi which british biochemist sinologist and historian joseph needham described as ancestor of all seismographs cited in this device was able to detect exact cardinal or ordinal direction of earthquakes from hundreds of kilometers away it employed an inverted pendulum that when disturbed by ground tremors would trigger a set of gears that dropped a metal ball from one of eight dragon mouths representing all eight directions into a metal toad s mouth account of this device in book of later han describes how on one occasion one of metal balls was triggered without any of observers feeling a disturbance several days later a messenger arrived bearing news that an earthquake had struck in longxi commandery in modern gansu province direction device had indicated which forced officials at court to admit efficacy of zhang s device mathematics three han mathematical treatises still exist these are book on numbers and computation arithmetical classic of gnomon and circular paths of heaven and nine chapters on mathematical art han era mathematical achievements include solving problems with right angle triangles square roots cube roots and matrix methods finding more accurate approximations for pi providing mathematical proof of pythagorean theorem use of decimal fraction gaussian elimination to solve linear equations and continued fractions to find roots of equations one of han s greatest mathematical advancements was world s first use of negative numbers negative numbers first appeared in nine chapters on mathematical art as black counting rods where positive numbers were represented by red counting rods negative numbers were also used by greek mathematician diophantus around ad 275 and in 7th century manuscript of gandhara south asia but were not widely accepted

measured tropical year at 365385 1539 days and lunar month at 2943 81 days however emperor zhang later reinstated sifen calendar han chinese astronomers made star catalogues and detailed records of comets that appeared in night sky including recording 12 bc appearance of comet now known as halley s comet han dynasty astronomers adopted a geocentric model of universe theorizing that it was shaped like a sphere surrounding earth in center they assumed that sun moon and planets were spherical and not disc shaped they also thought that illumination of moon and planets was caused by sunlight that lunar eclipses occurred when earth obstructed sunlight falling onto moon and that a solar eclipse occurred when moon obstructed sunlight from reaching earth although others disagreed with his model
