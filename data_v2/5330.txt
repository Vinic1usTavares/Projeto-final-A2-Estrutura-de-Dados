quite rare was a giant huntsman whom zeus or perhaps artemis placed among stars as constellation of orion ancient sources tell several different stories about orion there are two major versions of his birth and several versions of his death most important recorded episodes are his birth somewhere in boeotia his visit to chios where he met merope and after he violated her was blinded by her father oenopion recovery of his sight at lemnos his hunting with artemis on crete his death by bow of artemis or sting of giant scorpion which became scorpio and his elevation to heavens scholia on homer iliad 18 486 citing pherecydes most ancient sources omit some of these episodes and several tell only one these various incidents may originally have been independent unrelated stories and it is impossible to tell whether omissions are simple brevity or represent a real disagreement in greek literature he first appears as a great hunter in homer s epic odyssey where odysseus sees his shade in underworld bare bones of orion s story are told by hellenistic and roman collectors of myths but there is no extant literary version of his adventures comparable for example to that of jason in apollonius of rhodes argonautica or euripides medea entry in ovid s fasti for may 11 is a poem on birth of orion but that is one version of a single story surviving fragments of legend have provided a fertile field for speculation about greek prehistory and myth orion served several roles in ancient greek culture story of adventures of orion hunter is one on which there is most evidence and even on that not very much he is also personification of constellation of same name he was venerated as a hero in greek sense in region of boeotia and there is one etiological passage which says that orion was responsible for present shape of strait of sicily legends homer and hesiod orion is mentioned in oldest surviving works of greek literature which probably date back to 7th or 8th century bc but which are products of an oral tradition with origins several centuries earlier in homer s iliad orion is described as a constellation and star sirius is mentioned as his dog il s 486 489 on shield of achilles and kh 29 respectively in odyssey odysseus sees him hunting in underworld with a bronze club a great slayer of animals he is also mentioned as a constellation as lover of goddess dawn as slain by artemis and as most handsome of earthborn l 572 577 as a hunter e 273 275 as a constellation s 487 489 e 121 124 l 572 77 l 309 310 rose a handbook p 117 notes that homer never identifies hunter and constellation and suggests that they were not originally same in works and days of hesiod orion is also a constellation one whose rising and setting with sun is used to reckon year ll 598 623 thumb daniel seiter s 1685 painting of diana over orion s corpse before he is placed in heavens legend of orion was first told in full in a lost work by hesiod probably astronomia simple references to hesiod below will refer to lost text from astronomia unless otherwise stated this version is known through work of eratosthenes on constellations who gives a fairly long summary of hesiod s episode on orion eratosthenes catasterismi translation in whether these works are actually by hesiod and eratosthenes themselves is doubtful pseudo eratosthenes does not specify work of hesiod he is summarizing but modern assumption that it is same work which other authors call astronomy is not particularly controversial it is certainly neither theogony nor works and days according to this version orion was likely son of sea god poseidon and euryale summary of hesiod simply says euryale but there is no reason to conflate her with euryale gorgon or to euryale amazon of gaius valerius flaccus other ancient sources say explicitly euryale daughter of minos daughter of minos king of crete orion could walk on waves because of his father he walked to island of chios where he got drunk and attacked merope apparently unrelated to merope who was one of pleiades daughter of oenopion ruler there in vengeance oenopion blinded orion and drove him away orion stumbled to lemnos where hephaestus lame smith god had his forge hephaestus told his servant cedalion to guide orion to uttermost east where helios sun healed him orion carried cedalion around on his shoulders orion returned to chios to punish oenopion but king hid away underground and escaped orion s wrath orion s next journey took him to crete where he hunted with goddess artemis and her mother leto and in course of hunt threatened to kill every beast on earth mother earth apollo in some versions disapproving of his sister s relationship with a male objected and sent a giant scorpion to kill orion creature succeeded and after his death goddesses asked zeus to place orion among constellations zeus consented and as a memorial to hero s death added scorpion to heavens as well scorpion is here a type of creature greek not a proper name constellation is called scorpius in astronomy colloquially scorpio like related astrological sign both are latin forms of greek word cicero used nepa older latin word for scorpion see kubiak s paper in bibliography other sources although orion has a few lines in both homeric poems and in works and days most of stories about him are recorded in incidental allusions and in fairly obscure later writings no great poet standardized legend rose a handbook p 116 117 ancient sources for orion s legend are mostly notes in margins of ancient poets scholia or compilations by later scholars equivalent of modern reference works or encyclopedias even legend from hesiod s astronomy survives only in one such compilation in several cases including summary of astronomy although surviving work bears name of a famous scholar such as apollodorus of athens eratosthenes or gaius julius hyginus what survives is either an ancient forgery or an abridgement of original compilation by a later writer of dubious competence editors of these texts suggest that they may have borne names of great scholars because they were abridgments or even pupil s notes based on works of scholars oxford classical dictionary under apollodorus of athens 6 it describes bibliotheca as an uncritical forgery some centuries later than apollodorus it distinguishes hyginus 4 author of fabulae and astronomy from hyginus 1 c julius adding of former that absurdities of this abbreviated compilation are partly due to its compiler s ignorance of greek under eratosthenes it dismisses surviving catasterismi as pseudo see frazer s loeb apollodorus and condos s translation of other two as star myths of greeks and romans 1997 for editorial opinions margin of empress eudocia s copy of

of orion s birth here gods zeus hermes and poseidon come to visit hyrieus of tanagra who roasts a whole bull for them ancient sources for this story all phrase it so that this could be either a bull or a cow translations vary although bull may be more common a bull would be an appropriate sacrifice to male gods when they offer him a favor he asks for birth of sons gods take bull s hide and urinate into are represented by same greek participle ourion thus explaining orion s name version that has come down to us as pseudo on unbelievable tales uses to spread seed and infinitive of ourion in different sentences latin translations by hyginus are ambiguous ejaculation of semen is more obvious interpretation here and kerenyi assumes it but john peter oleson argued in note to p 28 of a possible physiological basis for term diver american journal of philology vol 97 no 1 spring 1976 pp 22 29 that urination is intended here robert graves compares this to an african including urination as mentioned below and bury it in earth then tell him to dig it up ten lunations greeks spoke of ten lunations as normal term for childbirth later when he does he finds orion this explains why orion is earthborn a second full telling even shorter than summary of hesiod is in a roman era collection of myths account of orion is based largely on mythologist and poet pherecydes of leros here orion is described as earthborn and enormous in stature this version also mentions poseidon and euryale as his parents it adds a first marriage to side before his marriage to merope all that is known about side is that hera threw her into hades for rivalling her in beauty it also gives a different version of orion s death than iliad eos dawn fell in love with orion and took him to delos where artemis killed him bibliotheke 1 4 3 1 4 5 this book has come down to us with name of apollodorus of athens but this is almost certainly wrong pherecydes from fontenrose orion p 6 another narrative on constellations three paragraphs long is from a latin writer whose brief notes have come down to us under name of hyginus hyginus de astronomia 2 34 a shorter recension in his fabulae 195 according to ghislane vire s 1992 teubner edition modern scholarship holds that these are not original work of hyginus either but latter condensations a teacher s possibly a student s notes it begins with oxhide story of orion s birth which this source ascribes to callimachus and aristomachus and sets location at thebes or chios aristomachus of soli wrote on bee keeping oxford classical dictionary bee keeping hyginus has two versions in one of them he omits poseidon in astronomia fabulae have poseidon a modern critic suggests this is original version fontenrose orion same source tells two stories of death of orion first says that because of his living joined in too great a friendship with oenopion he boasted to artemis and leto that he could kill anything which came from earth gaia personification of earth in greek mythology objected and created scorpion prope amicitia hyginus ast 2 26 in second story apollo being jealous of orion s love for artemis which might even have made her willing to marry him arranged for her to kill him seeing orion swimming in ocean a long way off he said that artemis could not possibly hit that black thing in water feeling challenged she sent an arrow right through it and killed orion when his body washed up on shore she wept copiously and decided to place orion among stars hyginus ast 2 34 quoting robert graves divides greek myths into his own retelling of myths and his explanations in retelling hyginus graves adds that apollo challenged artemis to hit that rascal this is for narrative smoothness it is not in his source he connects orion with several constellations not just scorpio orion chased mother of pleiades for seven years until zeus intervened and raised all of them to stars 2 21 in works and days orion chases pleiades themselves canis minor and canis major are his dogs one in front is called procyon they chase lepus hare although hyginus says some critics thought this too base a prey for noble orion and have him pursuing taurus bull instead hyginus 2 33 35 36 which also present these as dogs of a renaissance mythographer adds other names for orion s dogs maera natalis comes mythologiae translated by mulryan and brown p 457 ii 752 whatever his interpretations he is usually scrupulous about citing his sources which he copies with stenographic accuracy here however he says merely which have implied subject ancient writers dog s names mean white black or perhaps gray sparkler runner yearned for shining wolf slayer fear eater and bear slayer variants there are numerous variants in other authors most of these are incidental references in poems and roman poet virgil shows orion as a giant wading through aegean sea with waves breaking against his shoulders rather than as mythographers have it walking on water 10 763 767 there are several references to hyrieus as father of orion that connect him to various places in boeotia including hyria this may well be original story although not first attested since hyrieus is presumably eponym of hyria he is also called oeneus although he is not oeneus pack p 200 giving hyginus s etymology for but describing it as fantastic oeneus from kerenyi gods citing servius s note to aeneid 10 763 which actually reads oenopion but this may be corruption other ancient scholia say as hesiod does that orion was son of poseidon and his mother was a daughter of minos but they call daughter brylle or mulryan and brown trans of natalis comes vol ii p 752 n 98 cites scholia in vetera 322 ed martin stuttgart 1974 sch to hesiod op fr 63 194 respectively there are two versions where artemis killed orion either with her arrows or by producing scorpion in second variant orion died of scorpion s sting as he does in hesiod although orion does not defeat scorpion in any version several variants have it die from its wounds artemis is given various motives one is that orion boasted of his beast killing and challenged her to a contest with discus another is that he assaulted either artemis herself or opis a hyperborean maiden in her band of apollodorus bibliotheke and frazer s notes artemis is called opis in callimachus hymn 3 and elsewhere fontenrose orion p 13 aratus s brief description in his astronomy conflates elements of myth according to aratus orion attacks artemis while hunting on chios and scorpion kills him there aratus phaenomena i 634 646 quoted in kubiak p 14 nicander in his theriaca has scorpion of ordinary size and hiding under a small stone nicander theriaca lines 15 20 most versions of story that continue after orion s death tell of gods raising orion and scorpion to stars but even here a variant exists ancient poets differed greatly on whom aesculapius brought back from dead zeus slew aesculapius for his presumption in raising dead

was son of dionysus dionysus sent satyrs to put orion into a deep sleep so he could be blinded one source tells same story but converts oenopion into minos of crete it adds that an oracle told orion that his sight could be restored by walking eastward and that he found his way by hearing cyclops hammer placing a cyclops as a guide on his shoulder it does not mention cabeiri or lemnos this is

ancient greece orion had a hero cult in region of boeotia number of places associated with his birth suggest that it was widespread a birth story is often a claim to hero by a local shrine a tomb of a

geographical order like a modern tour guide and he puts cerycius next after tomb in his list of sights of tanagra maurice bowra argues that orion was a national hero of boeotians much as castor and pollux were for dorians he bases this claim on athenian epigram on battle of coronea in which a hero gave boeotian army an oracle then fought on their side and defeated athenians boeotian school of epic poetry was chiefly concerned with genealogies of gods and heroes later writers elaborated this web loeb edition of hesiod introduction several other myths are attached to orion in this way a

images of orion in classical art are difficult to recognize and clear examples are rare there are several ancient greek images of club carrying hunters that could represent orion for example 75 78 but such generic examples could equally represent an archetypal hunter or indeed heracles for example these three interpretations have been made of a panel at temple of apollo at some claims have been made that other greek art represents specific aspects of orion myth a tradition of this type has been discerned in 5th century bc greek pottery john beazley identified a scene of apollo delian palm in hand orion for attempted rape of artemis while another scholar has identified a scene of orion attacking artemis as she is revenged by a snake a counterpart to scorpion in a funerary group supposedly symbolizing hope that even criminal orion could be made immortal as well as an astronomical scene in which cephalus is thought to stand in for orion and his constellation also reflecting this system

of general agreement between them for example that attack on opis is an attack on artemis for opis is one of names of artemis fontenrose orion p 13 and note but also graves kerenyi and rose there was a movement in late nineteenth century to interpret all boeotian heroes as merely personifications of constellations farnell greek hero cults p 21 doubts it even of orion there has since come to be

graves kerenyi dionysus several mentions observation on homer is from rose a handbook p 117 early nineteenth century mythographer karl otfried muller considered orion only purely mythological figure

classical scholar erwin rohde viewed orion as an example of greeks erasing line between gods and mankind that is if orion was in heavens other mortals could hope to be also hungarian mythographer karl kerenyi one of founders of modern study of greek mythology wrote about orion in gods of greeks 1951 kerenyi portrays orion as a giant of titanic vigor and criminality born outside his mother as were or dionysus kerenyi believes story of hyrieus to be original and that pun on orion ourion was made for myth rather than other way around kerenyi places great stress on variant in which merope is wife of oenopion he sees this as remnant of a lost form of myth in which merope was orion s mother converted by later generations to his stepmother and then to present forms orion s blinding is therefore parallel to that of and oedipus in dionysus 1976 kerenyi portrays orion as a shamanic hunting hero surviving from minoan times hence his association with crete kerenyi derives hyrieus and hyria from cretan dialect word meaning beehive which survives only in ancient dictionaries from this association he turns orion into a representative of old mead drinking cultures overcome by wine masters

potent than ordinary men and violent lover of divine huntress other heroes of same type are actaeon leucippus son of cephalus teiresias and zeus as lover of callisto fontenrose also sees eastern parallels in figures of aqhat dumuzi gilgamesh and prajapati as pursuer of ushas in greek myths 1955 robert graves views oenopion as his perennial year king at stage where king pretends to die at end of his term and appoints a substitute in this case orion who actually dies in his place his blindness is from a picture of odysseus blinding cyclops mixed with a purely hellenic solar legend sun hero is captured and blinded by his enemies at dusk but escapes and regains his sight at dawn when all beasts flee him graves sees rest of myth as a syncretism of diverse stories these include gilgamesh
