grenier had completely sold vince s downward spiral he continued there s something half jokey about his manner that makes me think he s about to break up laughing as in a blooper reel in contrast

grenier s performance opining that it was his best performance to date a v club writer kyle ryan gave episode a b grade ryan wrote last episode up tonight s many confrontations for a show that has specialized in spinning its wheels these were surprisingly high stakes he was critical with development of vincent chase as well as his storyline with sasha grey commenting that vincent and his coterie just aren t that interesting blair marnell of craveonline gave episode an eight out of ten rating noting that episode hit its dramatic points marnell commended grenier s acting as he opined i ve never hated vince before this season but that s reaction that he was meant to elicit vince has always been a little bit shallow but never to this extent vince never told his friends that they needed him more than he needed them before and while it s definitely true to a certain extent part of vince s charm was that he never threw that back in their faces in concurrence tv fanatic eric hochberger expressed that lose yourself was a stellar season finale with plenty of unanswered cliffhangers for next season concluding his review hochberger gave episode a 4 5 out of 5 stars references
