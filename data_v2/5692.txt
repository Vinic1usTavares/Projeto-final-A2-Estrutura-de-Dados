polistes exclamans is a social wasp and is part of family vespidae of order hymenoptera it is found throughout united states mexico bahamas jamaica and parts of canada due to solitary nest founding by queens p exclamans has extended its range in past few decades and now covers eastern half of united states as well as part of north this expansion is typically attributed to changing global climate and temperatures p exclamans has three specific castes including males workers and queens but dominance hierarchy is further distinguished by age older wasp is higher it is in ranking within colony in most p exclamans nests there is one queen who lays all eggs in colony physiological similarities between worker and queen castes have led to experiments attempting to distinguish characteristics of these two castes and how they are determined though males have easily identifiable physiological characteristics since p exclamans live in relatively small open combed nests they are often subject to predators and parasites such as chalcoela iphitalis elasmus polistis and birds p exclamans have defense and recognition strategies that help protect against these predators and parasites taxonomy and

though eggs in smaller nests and that are laid later in season take much longer to develop about thirteen to eighteen days for larva to develop about thirteen days for pupa to develop and about a total of six to eight weeks for an egg to develop into an adult reproductive wasps emerge later in august or september queen queen characteristics p exclamans lives in a hierarchical society with one queen that lays eggs however all of females have same morphology and they all have physiological capability of taking over egg laying if necessary queen death queen migration since queen has same morphology as rest of workers in colony this raises question as to how queen role is assigned and what makes her special studies have found that queens and males have higher levels of glucose fructose and trehalose than workers leading to higher cryoprotectant levels p exclamans use these sugars as cryoprotectant which work by increasing solute concentration in cells this results in a greater survivability in colder weather it was found that queens have a 76 survival rate in weather compared to 17 survival of workers over a 15 day test period queens also have a 0 5mm layer of fat surrounding their bodies this allows them to live longer into winter and possibly extend their mating season queens seem to be only ones capable of diapause queen development and determination while there aren t many external morphological differences between queens and workers there are some internal traits that can be signals of a wasp s social status it has also been found that caste determination is irreversibly determined by temperature during immature stages of development in one experiment some wasps emerging in june were kept in long day chambers or chambers set at 26 degc with 16 hours of light and 8 hours of darkness these individuals had larger and more active ovaries as compared to those who were incubated in short day chambers which are set at 22 degc with 14 hours of light and 10 hours of darkness it is thought that this phenomenon may occur because of a juvenile hormone secretion that determines castes and a suppression of workers ovaries by environmental or hormonal factors gerontocracy given that polistes exclamans nests are often destroyed or suffer through death of queen most often through natural circumstances it is necessary and adaptive for there to be a specific system for replacement of queen current system in place can best be described as gerontocracy furthermore it is also closely related to dominance system within colony as well in dominance hierarchy older individuals are higher in rank whereas younger individuals serve in lower ranks these older female workers are generally more aggressive and forage more frequently in reflection of this dominance ranking and behavior of female workers it is seen that when a queen is no longer present in colony next eldest worker becomes new queen this may be due to genetics of next eldest queen as replacement queen affects overall relatedness of females in brood thereby allowing future brood to be more related to adult workers rearing them queen s role p exclamans tend to have smaller nests than other wasps with typically fewer than one hundred individuals in a given nest because of size of nest queen tends to be most active individual in nest this is because queen has to monitor and directly control activities of nest in addition to her reproductive role queen must also act as pacemaker of nest and synchronize worker activity these last two points have recently been disputed and workers may be self organized it has also been observed that queen will act aggressively towards individuals that are least active development and reproduction sex determination system p exclamans are haplodiploid insects as are other polistes species including polistes polistes and polistes annularis this means they have haploid males that produce identical haploid sperm and diploid females that produce haploid eggs through meiosis this has consequences for genetic relatedness within colonies since sisters receive identical sperm if they share a father and normal half identical contribution from mother this results in sex biased conflicts between queen and workers with respect to sex ratio with workers preferring a more female biased sex ratio and queens preferring equal investment in queens and males sexual investment in polistes exclamans equal sex ratio is obtained when only 46 3 of investment is devoted to females as female wasps are 1 16 times larger than male wasps in a study done by strassmann it was found that sexual investment is female biased especially during years of high predation and when nests are generally less successful it has been seen that in polistes exclamans females are produced before males this female investment bias may result from ability of females to become either a worker or a reproductive this is more adaptive for nest as it gives nest increased flexibility compared to that of males and may be important for overall nest success or because females provide colony with greater nest defense furthermore even when original queen is no longer present sexual investment is still biased towards females which is not expected given genetic implications of a new queen early males workers first emerge between may and july during this first emergence reproductive males also emerge with this first brood and are called early males these males provide a great adaptation because they allow for presence of reproductive males nests with a greater number of early males produce a greater number of workers cells pupae and emergences although it is uncertain as to why queen deaths are common in polistes exclamans most frequently in may majority of original queens are dead by july well before eggs that became autumn reproductive were laid as reproductives emerged from late august through september thus queens must remain alive post june in order to birth future reproductives and if they are not able to do so eldest former worker then becomes new queen reproductive early males produced may be adaptive for deaths of queens so that colony will not die and will be able to continue sexual attraction as with many other insects p exclamans use sexual pheromones to attract members of opposite sex researchers have attempted to determine exact role that sexual pheromones play in sexual attraction in paper wasps they set up a wind tunnel where males and females were exposed to a sexual pheromone wick that was isolated from males and females these pheromones were taken by hexane extracts from wholes bodies and thoraces of unmated females male extracts were taken from ectal mandibular and seventh sternal glands it was found that opposite sex was attracted upwind of scent and results were intensified when a fan was turned on range of scent was found to be around 2 metres in nature it was observed that males would venture away from nest in order to attract females males would press their gastral sterna against a perch and rub their mandibular against it this is used to attract females and females were observed to visit these branches and sample scents it was also found that on some occasions males were attracted to other male scents behavior and ecology presence of brood and caste differentiation polistes exclamans have comparably smaller nests and colonies compared to certain other eusocial wasps species thus it is common for nest to be destroyed for queen to die prior to end of season or for nest to fail through other means such as predation parasitisation or worker mortality leading workers to help rear broods that are less related to them than are their sister wasps c r solis j e strassmann presence of brood affects caste differentiation in social wasp polistes exclamans viereck hymenoptera vespidae functional ecology vol 4 no 4 pp 531 541 1990 https www jstor org stable due to this it would be advantageous for there to be wasps that remain till adulthood allowing female wasps reproductive capabilities to be plastic it has thus been predicted that polistes exclamans worker wasps would act as workers if a brood were present and would begin to develop gyne characteristics if a brood was not present exhibiting aforementioned adaptive plasticity experimentally this has been found to be true solis and strassmann conducted a study in which an experimental group had eggs and larvae removed in experimental group wasps began to behave like future queens and even developed characteristic layer of fat common to queens in control group wasps continued to behave as workers this is indicative that presence of brood affects caste differentiation and that polistes exclamans female workers exhibits adaptive reproductive plasticity relatedness recognition nest mate recognition is widespread in many eusocial insects however when there are no physical differences in either diet or nesting materials many can no longer discriminate nest mate from other conspecifics j l allen k schulze kellman and g j gamboa clumping patterns during overwintering in paper wasp polistes exclamans effects of relatedness journal of kansas entomological society vol 55 no 1 pp 97 100 1982 recently however it has been indicated that many insects have ability to discriminate relatives even having lived in identical environments with their non relative counterpart studies have indicated that in polistes fuscatus former nestmates would nest in areas located close together near their natal nests following spring social halictid bees also are able to recognize their relatives in polistes exclamans it has been indicated that discrimination of relatives from non relatives even having lived in identical environments is possible this was found by allen schulze kellman and gamboa through an experiment in which hibernating wasps from different nests were put in a box together after being raised in identical environments as number of unrelated groups of wasps increased more clumps were formed in box this indicates that wasps were capable of differentiating relative from an adaptive ability in defense of their nest hibernation many polistes species aggregate over winter polistes exclamans clump in rather large aggregations while hibernating j m gonzalez

aggregations are frequently found in protected places called hibernacula that can be as varied as crevices and cracks of rocks or trunks beneath bark of trees between walls of buildings or any other natural or artificial structures that provides protection during hibernation although polistes exclamans have been found in organ pipe muddauber nests a mud nest that can provide a certain level of protection it is not thought to actually house hibernating polistes exclamans over winter worker mortality a typical p exclamans worker will live somewhere between 14 16 days oldest wasp to be observed in a natural colony was 102 days old queens typically live 6 times longer than workers there has been some variation observed with life expectancy of p exclamans this has typically been attributed to colony of origin it also must be noted that while there is variation between colonies there typically is less variation between original nest and satellite nest variation inside a single colony may also occur because of presence of different castes foragers those who frequently travel outside nest lead a riskier life and tend to have lower life expectancy than those who stay in nest though it was observed that colonies with high foraging rates also had higher reproductive rates to compensate for lower life expectancy another aspect that was observed in one nest was that an increase in female population led to lower longevity this was because females were more focused on competing to become next queen than foraging and fulfilling their roles worker death is an important factor in colony failure and is cause of 13 76 of colony failures this may be in part due to small colony size because colonies are small worker longevity is crucial for survival of nest range extension throughout 1950s and 1960s polistes exclamans was extending its range spreading into midwestern united states between 1958 and 1967 following states had new state records of polistes exclamans illinois indiana kentucky maryland missouri new jersey new mexico tennessee and virginia behavioral basis behind range expansion could be based upon exceptional capability polistes exclamans has in colonization of new sites and solitary nest founding behavior polistes exclamans exhibits this capability could be assisted by associated tendencies of p exclamans foundresses to disperse and to move into newly available nesting sites meanwhile species with social foundresses reproduce near place of origin and therefore do not extend their range as far satellite nests thumbnail right an example of a typical polistes exclamans nest satellite nests are common among p exclamans a queen will fly somewhere between 0 15 and 11m away from original nest to settle in a new location about 16 39 of nests create satellites from may to july similar to wasp species constructing multitude of nests in clusters in order to create protection through dilution effect satellites are used as an insurance against attacks by predators and parasitoids krebs j r and nicholas b davies living in groups an introduction to behavioral ecology 4th ed vol 1 oxford blackwell scientific publications 1989 147 78 print of 12 nests that were knocked down by birds that had satellites 66 7 of colony survived by moving to satellite compared to reproductive success of nests with no satellite that were attacked 5 7 when chalcoela iphitalis invades prevalence of satellites didn t increase survivability however it did have an effect when elasmus polistis were introduced it gave p exclamans a place to escape to workers who are older typically start satellite nests and have more developed ovaries younger and lesser developed workers join satellite after its establishment distribution of workers between main nest and satellite is very important because they are needed for establishment of satellite and for continued running of main nest although after several months main nest can become abandoned if not enough workers follow initial worker to new nest then it will most likely fail as a satellite interaction with other species parasitoids polistes exclamans live in social nests that are open combed this leaves nests very susceptible to attacks by predators and by parasitoids attack by parasitoids will occur in nest brood as invader will attempt to insert its own offspring into host s nest two most common parasitoids are chalcoela iphitalis and elasmus polistis c iphitalis and e polistis p exclamans take several countermeasures against invasions if wasps detect an intruder they will violently bite and sting location where c iphitalis moth has passed by this will cause vibrations inside of nest and wasps inside will become alarmed and will move around jerkily this phenomenon is known as parasite dance this will continue for up to 10 hours after moth has been detected if moth is found it will be eaten immediately however this is not likely to happen moth lays its eggs in nest and when they hatch they will take over nest as a result many wasp pupae are aborted this is commonly seen in late summer when moth is most abundant second common parasitoid elasmus polistis also has disastrous effects on p exclamans nest up to 80 e polistis will hatch out of a single cell males emerge first and then will exit nest and wait until females emerge once female moths emerge males will mate and reproduce quickly destroying p exclamans population in some cases invading e polistis will hide larvae in nest so that p exclamans cannot find them this is important to survival of p exclamans hosts will attempt to remove as many parasitoids as possible to prevent them from spreading to nearby nests this defense mechanism has not been proven to be effective as more often than not e polistis larvae go undetected by hosts in one experiment conducted it was found that over 60 of all nests lost brood to parasitoids e polistis or c iphitalis in 1981 it was also observed that larger satellites have a greater risk of being parasitized this is due to fact that large nests are typically older this relationship between age and parasitism can be seen with fact that older queens nests tend to be parasitized more than younger queens nests predation thumbnail left an overpopulated polistes exclamans nest p exclamans has several different predators their most dangerous predators are birds which will fly by and knock nest to ground this phenomenon was discovered by disappearance of nests and wasp nests being found on ground near bird s nest it has also been found that birds eat larvae from p exclamans nest this attack kills whole nest but it isn t very effective against adults from colony when attacked adults fly away either to another colony or a satellite colony attack by ant crematogaster is different from attacks by birds rather than knocking down nest ants swarm all over nest and remove brood from it ants destroy entire brood but they are unable to kill adults other predators attack adults while they are foraging or traveling to satellite nests it is difficult to determine number of adults that are killed away from nest because they are difficult to track however it has been observed that queen s flight to satellite nest isn t dangerous and does not reduce its survivability idea of group living has been discussed by many evolutionists for its costs and benefits alexander predicted that cost to large groups is that they are more likely to suffer from parasitism but at same time they benefit by defense against predation this theory is not supported in case of p exclamans because parasitism does not always increase with nest size and predation rate was independent of size colony defense facial patterns some animals may assess rivals through specific characteristics that are relevant to their fighting abilities however some animals instead use conventional characteristics to determine competitive ability of their rivals e a tibbetts m j sheehan facial patterns are a conventional signal of agonistic ability in polistes exclamans paper wasps ethology pp 1138 1146 2011 doi 10 1111 j 1439 0310 2011 conventional characteristics are signals that are indicative of rival s abilities but are not a reflection of animal s physiological or physical agonistic abilities polistes exclamans uses facial patterns as a conventional characteristic to determine agonistic abilities of competitive rivals larger wasps have a greater amount of brown pigmented clypei wasps use these pigmented clypei to determine viability of challenging a rival more pigmented clypei or larger polistes exclamans more likely polistes exclamans will be willing to challenge a rival less pigmented clypei or smaller polistes exclamans less willing it would be to challenge a rival this assists in minimization of costs of conflict during dominance competition among nest founding queens alarm response polistes exclamans exhibit an alarm response typical of many higher level eusocial hymenoptera although it has been previously indicated that nest mates may alarm rest of nest through jerky movement and buzzing of wings polistes exclamans is capable of alarming rest of nest and attracting attacking wasps through chemical means by releasing a non species specific venomous alarm pheromone although a chemical signal to warn against attack would be evolutionarily adaptive polistes exclamans only releases a response post initial attack from and on predator as venom is only released during sting this venom is capable of warning and coordinating a response from nest and attracting nearby heterospecific or conspecific females from nearby colonies to attack predator this helps deter predator from further attacking and is especially adaptive for defense of nest although certain other insects have been able to adapt release of pheromone to other means of communicating alarm polistes exclamans has yet to do so indicating that it is still in its primitive state in evolution of complex systems of communication of alarm seen in higher social insects in one experiment pheromones were extracted from female glands and sacs and were spread onto venom paper it was then found that females were attracted upwind of venom paper and some even attempted to sting it this also had a heterospecific response where others also reacted to it while it was found that one wasp couldn t release enough pheromones to elicit a response if many individuals were alarmed they would elicit a response from rest of nest however this scent is not strong enough to reach other nests and so neighboring nests must be alarmed by physical movements and wing flapping queen response after being invaded a queen may be forced to leave her nest if a satellite has not been established queen may usurp another queen in a different nest thus not having to invest any valuable resources queen can then use these resources on reproducing a new brood references exclamans category fauna of plains midwest united states category fauna of great lakes region north america category hymenoptera of north america category insects
