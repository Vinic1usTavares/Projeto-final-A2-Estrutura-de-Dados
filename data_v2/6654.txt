carpenter s film assault on precinct 13 1976 at milan film festival independent film producer irwin yablans and financier moustapha akkad sought out carpenter to direct for them a film about a psychotic killer stalking babysitters carpenter and debra hill began drafting a story titled babysitter murders but title was changed at yablans request suggesting setting be changed to halloween night and naming it halloween instead moustapha akkad fronted 300 000 for film s budget even though he was worried about tight schedule low budget and carpenter s limited experience as a filmmaker he finally decided to finance film after carpenter relayed entire film to akkad in a suspenseful way almost frame for frame and opted not to take any fees for directing film low budget forced wardrobe and props to be crafted from items on hand or that could be purchased inexpensively this included trademark mask worn by michael myers throughout film production designer art director location scout and co editor tommy lee wallace created michael s mask from a william shatner halloween mask purchased for 1 98 limited budget also dictated filming location and time schedule halloween was filmed in 21 days in spring of 1978 primarily in south pasadena california an abandoned house owned by a church stood in as myers house two homes on orange grove avenue in hollywood were used for film s climax we investigated a number of 3 d processes but they were far too expensive for this particular project also most of projects we do involve a lot of night shooting evil lurks at night it s hard to do that in 3 d debra hill writer producer on putting halloween ii into 3 d following success of halloween yablans and akkad began working on halloween ii there was initial discussion about filming halloween ii in 3 d but idea never came to fruition after halloween ii was released carpenter and hill were approached about creating a third halloween film but they were reluctant to pledge commitment pair agreed to participate in new project only if it was not a direct sequel to halloween ii which meant no michael myers most of filming for halloween iii took place on location in small coastal town of loleta in humboldt county california familiar foods a milk bottling plant in loleta served as silver shamrock novelties factory but all special effects involving fire smoke and explosions were filmed at post studios after halloween iii was released michael myers was brought back into franchise with 1988 s return of michael myers where he has stayed for remainder of series four more sequels would follow between 1988 and 2002 before series would take a break for five years on june 4 2006 dimension films announced that rob zombie director of house of 1000 corpses and devil s rejects would be creating next installment in halloween franchise bob weinstein approached rob zombie about making film and zombie who was a fan of original halloween and friend of john carpenter jumped at chance to make a halloween film for dimension films before dimension went public with news zombie felt obligated to inform john carpenter out of respect of plans to remake his film carpenter s request was for zombie to make it his own film zombie s film would combine elements of prequel and remake with original concept with considerable original content in new film zombie also wanted to reinvent character as he felt michael along with freddy krueger jason voorhees and pinhead had become too familiar to audiences and as a result less scary zombie delved deeper into michael myers s mythology michael s mask was even given its own story to provide an explanation as to why he wears it instead of having character simply steal a random mask from a hardware store as in original film zombie wanted to bring michael closer to what a psychopath really is and wanted mask to be a way for michael to hide in 2008 a sequel to 2007 remake was announced with french filmmakers julien maury and alexandre bustillo in negotiations to direct instead zombie was resigned to write and direct sequel with film taking place directly after end of his remake in an interview zombie expressed how exhaustion of creating first halloween made him not want to come back for a sequel but after a year of cooling down he was more open to idea writer director explains that with sequel he was no longer bound by a sense of needing to retain any john carpenter ness as he could now do whatever he wants to do instead of focusing on michael zombie chose to look more at psychological consequences on laurie after events of remake as zombie explains after michael murdered her friends and family laurie became a wreck who continually sinks lower as film moves forward rob zombie declined to return to film second sequel to 2007 remake second sequel halloween 3d was cancelled in 2012 a new effort to make a halloween film halloween returns was attempted in 2015 unrelated to rob

paul brad logan and chris bernier were announced to co write halloween ends music john carpenter composed music to first three films for halloween carpenter chose to use a piano melody played in a 5 4 time rhythm instead of a symphonic soundtrack critic james berardinelli calls score relatively simple and unsophisticated but admits that halloween s music is one of its strongest assets carpenter stated in an interview i can play just about any keyboard but i can t read or write a note in end credits carpenter bills himself as bowling green orchestra for performing film s score but he did receive assistance from composer dan wyman a music professor at san jose state university score for halloween ii is a variation of john carpenter s compositions from first film particularly main theme s familiar piano melody played score was performed on a synthesizer organ rather than piano used for halloween one reviewer for bbc described revised score as having a more gothic feel reviewer asserted that it doesn t sound quite as good as original piece but it still remains a classic piece of music music remained an important element in establishing atmosphere of halloween iii just as in halloween and halloween ii there was no symphonic score much of music was composed to solicit false startles from audience soundtrack was composed by john carpenter and alan howarth who had also worked on score for halloween ii score of halloween iii differed greatly from familiar main theme of original and its first sequel carpenter replaced familiar piano melody with a slower electronic theme played on a synthesizer with beeping tonalities howarth explains how he and carpenter composed music for third film music style of john carpenter and myself has further evolved in this film soundtrack by working exclusively with synthesizers to produce our music this has led to a certain procedural routine film is first transferred to a time coded video tape and synchronized to a 24 track master audio recorder then while watching film we compose music to these visual images entire process goes quite rapidly and has instant gratification allowing us to evaluate score in synch to picture this is quite an invaluable asset following carpenter s departure from series howarth would stay on board as sole composer for next two sequels and also acted as lead composer on halloween curse of michael myers with paul providing additional music when initial edit of film was substantially re filmed while halloween h20 credits john ottman as its sole composer in reality most of soundtrack was provided by scream composer marco beltrami using a mixture of music from that film and a few original cues written by beltrami after producers disliked ottman s score danny lux provided soundtrack for halloween resurrection halloween resurrection music review at music from movies while tyler bates composed soundtracks for both 2007 halloween reboot and its 2009 sequel allmusic

one issue special but eventually two sequels spawned halloween ii blackest eyes and halloween iii devil s eyes all of stories were written by phil with daniel farrands writer for halloween curse of michael myers assisting on first issue david brewer and worked on illustrations tommy doyle is main protagonist in each of issues focusing on his attempts to kill michael myers first issue includes back story on michael s childhood while third picks up after events of film halloween h20 these comics were based on daniel farrand s concept for halloween resurrection he had been approached by producers to pitch a follow up to halloween h20 his idea was to have tommy doyle incarcerated at smith s grove for michael myers crimes only to escape and reunite with lindsay wallace together they study journals of dr loomis and find out more about michael s childhood movie would have explored michael s time at smith s grove and his relationship with dr loomis before returning to tommy and lindsay who are attacked by adult michael myers upon defeating him and removing his mask they discover laurie strode who has taken over her brother s mantle farrand s logic was that since jamie lee curtis was contracted to cameo in halloween resurrection they should make that cameo as significant and surprising as possible although studio did not follow up on his pitch farrands was able to tell his story in comic book form one good scare was released in 2003 it was written by stefan hutchinson and illustrated by peter fielding main character in this comic is lindsey wallace young girl who first saw michael myers alongside tommy doyle in original 1978 film hutchinson wanted to bring character back to his roots and away from lumbering jason clone film sequels had made him one good scare came about because hutchinson wanted to produce a comic book to celebrate series twenty fifth anniversary it was to be sold as a collectible at a halloween convention in south pasadena due to positive reception to one good scare hutchinson hoped to use comic as a demo for getting a distribution deal but was unable to do so due to rights issues while waiting to acquire rights to publish more halloween comics stefan hutchinson worked on documentary halloween 25 years of terror with malek akkad together they developed ideas for possible halloween stories that would be connected into a larger tale so idea was that it would use serial aspect of comic books to create different storylines than would be possible in films on july 25 2006 as an insert inside dvd release of halloween 25 years of terror hutchinson released halloween autopsis written by hutchinson and artwork by marcus smith and nick dismas story is about a photographer assigned to take pictures of michael myers as photographer carter follows dr loomis he begins to take on loomis s obsession himself until finally meeting michael myers in person which results in his death a lot of readers found in comic books what they had been missing from films in later sequels our books are very faithful to source material and by that we mean original film itself in our stories michael myers is very much again shape undefined bogeyman of 1978 rather than family killer of 80s and 90s stefan hutchinson on fan support of his halloween comic book series rob zombie s reboot of film series ensured that any halloween comics would not be contradicted by upcoming films allowing hutchinson creative freedom malek akkad was approached by devil s due publishing with possibility of producing a line of halloween comics and he and hutchinson worked to make them a reality hutchinson was convinced by strong support of one good scare that comic books would have an audience in 2008 stefan hutchinson released first issue of his new comic book halloween nightdance this is a four issue miniseries and it does not contain any characters other than michael from films four issues are titled a shape in void silent clown a rainbow in one color and when stars came crashing down first issue a shape in void takes place on october 31 2000 so that it falls between halloween h20 and halloween resurrection issue one follows michael as he stalks lisa an eighteen year old girl with insecurities and a chronic fear of darkness hutchinson explains that nightdance was an attempt to escape dense continuity of film series and recreate tone of 1978 film michael becomes inexplicably fixated on lisa just as he did with laurie in original halloween before sequels established that a sibling bond was actually his motivation for stalking her aim was to once again establish michael myers as a credible and dangerous force august 2008 saw release of devil s due s halloween 30 years of terror to celebrate thirtieth anniversary of halloween franchise this comic book one shot is a collection of short stories inspired by john carpenter s original trick or treat features mackenzies unseen characters from first film who tommy and lindsey run to for help p o v shows a murder from point of view of both michael and his victim visiting hours sees laurie strode reflecting on how her life could have been had her brother never found her in 1978 while tommy and boogeyman reveals that tommy doyle grew up to write comic books featuring michael myers in final story repetition compulsion dr loomis tries to predict where michael will strike next on halloween 1989 writer hutchinson explains that came about because unlike previous decades there was no halloween film coming out in 2008 to acknowledge occasion devil s due released three issue miniseries halloween first death of laurie strode in late 2008 written by hutchinson with artwork from jeff story bridges gap between halloween ii and halloween h20 by focusing on laurie strode in aftermath of 1978 murders hutchinson explains that laurie is trying to get better and trying to repair but where do you even start after going through such horror how do you even try to resume normality when you don t know what that is anymore although michael appears in series it is not clear whether he is real or if traumatised laurie is seeing things hutchinson is not a fan of revelation that laurie and michael are siblings and took steps to address that problem in story he wanted to avoid bloodline plot of middle sequels which he felt demystified character of shape and approach story so that it becomes almost incidental that she s his sister hutchinson believed that laurie strode s evolution into keri tate was fertile ground for a storyline he says it s not faking of death that s interesting at all but it s fall that leads to that happening faked death is just simple mechanics and can be covered in a sentence but state of mind and events leading to that are full of rich character and dramatic potential online stories all of stefan hutchinson s halloween comic books take place in halloween h20 timeline which retconned halloween 4 6 from continuity hutchinson comments that while retcon was unpopular with a lot of fans for ignoring previous movies he preferred simplicity of this storyline over needlessly convoluted mythology that last three films had created however he admits that one of downsides of h20 timeline is that fans do not know exactly what happened to dr sam loomis after halloween ii to remedy this hutchinson pitched halloween sam as a way of paying tribute to character written by hutchinson and featuring illustrations from autopsis marcus smith sam is a prose short story available exclusively for download at website com it explores life of dr loomis including his backstory and relationship with elizabeth worthington a journalist he met during world war ii in 1995 michael myers visits ailing dr loomis in a hospital and
