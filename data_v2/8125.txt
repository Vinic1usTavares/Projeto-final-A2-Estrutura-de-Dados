toledo war 1835 36 also known as michigan ohio war was an almost bloodless boundary dispute between u s state of ohio and adjoining territory of michigan poor geographical understanding of great lakes helped produce conflicting state and federal legislation between 1787 and 1805 and varying interpretations of laws led governments of ohio and michigan to both claim jurisdiction over a region along border now known as toledo strip situation came to a head when michigan petitioned for statehood in 1835 and sought to include disputed territory within its boundaries both sides passed legislation attempting to force other side s capitulation while ohio s governor robert lucas and michigan s 24 year old boy governor stevens t mason helped institute criminal penalties for citizens submitting to other s authority both states deployed militias on opposite sides of maumee river near toledo but besides mutual taunting there was little interaction between two forces single military confrontation of war ended with a report of shots being fired into air incurring no casualties during summer of 1836 congress proposed a compromise whereby michigan gave up its claim to strip in exchange for its statehood and about three quarters of upper peninsula compromise was considered a poor outcome for michigan voters in a state convention in september soundly rejected proposal but in december michigan government facing a dire financial crisis and pressure from congress and president andrew jackson called another convention called frostbitten convention which accepted compromise that resolved toledo war origins thumb right map of northwest territory as established by congress of confederation in northwest ordinance shown with present day state borders and correct spatial relationship between lakes michigan and erie in 1787 congress of confederation enacted northwest ordinance which created northwest territory in what is now upper midwestern united states ordinance specified that territory was eventually to be divided into not less than three nor more than five future states it was determined that north south boundary for three of these states was to be an east and west line drawn through southerly bend or extreme of lake michigan now known to be approximately 41 62deg n near marquette park gary indiana thumb left mitchell map of region from late 18th century used to create ordinance line of 1787 southern tip of lake michigan is depicted as being farther north than lake erie thumb left map by david burr from u s house report 380 24th congress 1st session highlighting contested land area between michigan and ohio territories at time actual location of this extreme was unknown most highly regarded map of time mitchell map placed it at a latitude near mouth of detroit river approximately 42 05deg n this meant that entire shoreline of lake erie west of pennsylvania would have belonged to state that was to become ohio when congress passed enabling act of 1802 which authorized ohio to begin process of becoming a u s state language defining ohio s northern boundary differed slightly from that used in northwest ordinance border was to be an east and west line drawn through southerly extreme of lake michigan running east until it shall intersect lake erie or territorial line with british north america and thence with same through lake erie to pennsylvania line aforesaid because territorial boundary line between u s and british north america specifically province of quebec until 1791 and upper canada thereafter ran through middle of lake erie and then up detroit river combined with prevailing belief regarding location of southern tip of lake michigan framers of 1802 ohio constitution believed it was intent of congress that ohio s northern boundary should certainly be north of mouth of maumee river and possibly even of detroit river ohio would thus be granted access to most or all of lake erie shoreline west of pennsylvania and any other new states carved out of northwest territory would have access to great lakes only via lakes michigan huron and superior during ohio constitutional convention in 1802 delegates allegedly received reports from a fur trapper that lake michigan extended significantly farther south than had previously been believed or mapped thus it was possible that an east west line extending east from lake michigan s southern tip might intersect lake erie somewhere east of maumee bay or worse might not intersect lake at all farther south that lake michigan actually extended more land ohio would lose perhaps even entire lake erie shoreline west of pennsylvania addressing this contingency ohio delegates included a provision in draft ohio constitution that if trapper s report about lake michigan s position was correct state boundary line would be angled slightly northeast so as to intersect lake erie at most northerly cape of miami maumee bay this provision would guarantee that most of maumee river watershed and all of southern shore of lake erie west of pennsylvania would fall in ohio draft constitution with this proviso was accepted by united states congress but before ohio s admission to union in february 1803 proposed constitution was referred to a congressional committee committee s report stated that clause defining northern boundary depended on a fact not yet ascertained latitude of southern extreme of lake michigan and members thought it unnecessary to take it provision at time into consideration when congress created michigan territory in 1805 it used northwest ordinance s language to define territory s southern boundary which therefore differed from that in ohio s state constitution this difference and its potential ramifications apparently went unnoticed at time but it established legal basis for conflict that would erupt 30 years later creation of toledo strip thumb left upright michigan territory governor lewis cass 1813 1831 right thumb upright former ohio governor and u s surveyor general edward tiffin who commissioned harris line survey location of border was contested throughout early 19th century residents of port of miami which would later become toledo urged ohio government to resolve border issue ohio legislature in turn passed repeated resolutions and requests asking congress to take up matter in 1812 congress approved a request for an official survey of line delayed because of war of 1812 it was only after indiana s admission to union in 1816 that work on survey commenced u s surveyor general edward tiffin who was in charge of survey was a former ohio governor as a result tiffin employed surveyor william harris to survey not ordinance line but line as described in ohio constitution of 1802 when completed harris line placed mouth of maumee river completely in ohio when results of survey were made public michigan territorial governor lewis cass was unhappy since it was not based on congressionally approved ordinance line in a letter to tiffin cass stated that ohio biased survey is only adding strength to strong and making weak still weaker in response michigan commissioned a second survey that was carried out by john a fulton fulton survey was based upon original 1787 ordinance line and after measuring line eastward from lake michigan to lake erie it found ohio boundary to lie south of mouth of maumee river region between harris and fulton survey lines formed what is now known as toledo strip this ribbon of land between northern ohio and southern michigan spanned a region wide over which both jurisdictions claimed sovereignty while ohio refused to cede its claim michigan quietly occupied it for next several years setting up local governments building roads and collecting taxes throughout area economic significance land known as toledo strip was and still is a commercially important area prior to rise of railroad industry rivers and canals were major highways of commerce in american midwest a small but important part of strip area around present day toledo and maumee bay fell within great black swamp and this area was nearly impossible to navigate by road especially after spring and summer rains draining into lake erie maumee river was not necessarily well suited for large ships but it did provide an easy connection to indiana s fort wayne at time there were plans to connect mississippi river and great lakes through a series of canals one such canal system approved by ohio legislature in 1825 was miami and erie canal that included a connection to ohio river and an outflow into lake erie via maumee river during conflict over toledo strip erie canal was built linking new york city and eastern seaboard to great lakes at buffalo canal finished in 1825 immediately became a major route for trade and migration corn and other farm products from midwest could be shipped to eastern markets for much less expense than older route along mississippi river in addition migration of settlers to midwest increased sharply after canal was finished turning buffalo and other port cities into boomtowns success of erie canal inspired many other canal projects because western end of lake erie offered shortest overland route to frontiers of indiana and illinois maumee harbor was seen as a site of immediate importance and great value detroit was up detroit river from lake erie and faced difficult barrier of great black swamp to south because of this detroit was less suited to new transportation projects such as canals and later railroads than was toledo from this perspective on rapidly developing midwest of 1820s and 1830s both states had much to gain by controlling land in toledo strip in addition strip west of toledo area is a prime location for agriculture because of its well drained fertile loam soil area had for many years produced large amounts of corn and wheat per acre michigan and ohio both wanted what seemed strategically and economically destined to become an important port and a prosperous region prelude to conflict thumb right upright ohio governor robert lucas 1832 1836 in 1820 21 federal land surveys had reached disputed area from two directions progressing southward from a baseline in michigan and northward from one in ohio for unknown reasons surveyor general tiffin ordered two surveys to close on northwest ordinance fulton line rather than harris line perhaps lending implicit support to michigan s claims over ohio s thus townships that were established north of line assumed they were part of michigan territory by early 1820s growing territory reached minimum population threshold of 60 000 to qualify for statehood when michigan sought to hold a state constitutional convention in 1833 congress rejected request because of still disputed toledo strip thumb left upright michigan territory governor stevens t mason 1832 1839 ohio asserted that boundary was firmly established in its constitution and thus michigan s citizens were simply intruders state government refused to negotiate issue with michigan territory ohio congressional delegation was active in blocking michigan from attaining statehood lobbying other states to vote against michigan in january 1835 frustrated by political stalemate michigan s acting territorial governor stevens t mason called for a constitutional convention to be held in may of that year despite congress refusal to approve an enabling act authorizing such a state constitution in february 1835 ohio passed legislation that set up county governments in strip county in which toledo sat would later in 1835 be named after incumbent governor robert lucas a move that further exacerbated growing tensions with michigan also during this period ohio attempted to use its power in congress to revive a previously rejected boundary bill that would formally set state border to be harris line michigan led by young and hot headed mason responded with passage of pains and penalties act just six days after lucas county was formed act made it a criminal offense for ohioans to carry out governmental actions in strip under penalty of a fine up to 1 000 up to five years imprisonment at hard labor or both acting as commander in chief of territory mason appointed brigadier general joseph w brown of third u s brigade to head state militia with instructions to be ready to act against ohio trespassers lucas obtained legislative approval for a militia of his own and he soon sent forces to strip area toledo war had begun former united states president john quincy adams who at time represented massachusetts in congress backed michigan s claim in 1833 when congress rejected michigan s request for a convention adams summed up his opinion on dispute never in course of my life have i known a controversy of which all right was so clearly on one side and all power so overwhelmingly on other war thumb upright right u s president andrew jackson who sided with ohio in conflict and dismissed mason as governor acting as commander in chief of ohio s militia governor lucas along with general john bell and about 600 other fully armed militiamen arrived in perrysburg ohio southwest of toledo on march 31 1835 shortly thereafter governor mason and general brown arrived to occupy city of toledo proper with around 1 000 armed men intending to prevent ohio advances into toledo area as well as stopping further border marking from taking place presidential intervention in a desperate attempt to prevent armed battle and to avert resulting political crisis u s president andrew jackson consulted his attorney general benjamin butler for his legal opinion on border dispute at time ohio was a growing political power in union with nineteen u s representatives and two senators in contrast michigan still being a territory had only a single non voting delegate ohio was a crucial swing state in presidential elections and it would have been devastating to fledgling democratic party to lose ohio s electoral votes therefore jackson calculated that his party s best interest would be served by keeping toledo strip a part of ohio response that jackson received from butler was unexpected attorney general held that until congress dictated otherwise land rightfully belonged to michigan this presented a political dilemma for jackson that spurred him to take action that would greatly influence outcome of war thumb left upright richard rush of pennsylvania a representative of president jackson who helped to present a compromise to both governors on april 3 1835 jackson sent two representatives from washington d c richard rush of pennsylvania and benjamin chew howard of maryland to toledo to arbitrate conflict and present a compromise to both governments proposal presented on april 7 recommended that re survey to mark harris line commence without further interruption by michigan and that residents of affected region be allowed to choose their own state or territorial governments until congress could definitively settle matter lucas reluctantly agreed to proposal and began to disband his militia believing debate to be settled three days later elections in region were held under ohio law mason refused deal and he continued to prepare for possible armed conflict during elections ohio officials were harassed by michigan authorities and area residents were threatened with arrest if they submitted to ohio s authority on april 8 1835 monroe county michigan sheriff arrived at home of major benjamin f stickney an ohio partisan in first contact between michigan partisans and stickney family sheriff arrested two ohioans under pains and penalties act on basis that men had voted in ohio elections battle of phillips corners thumb right a box labeled toledo mi that may have been used by michigan militia during toledo war following election lucas believed that commissioners actions had alleviated situation and he once again sent out surveyors to mark harris line project went without serious incident until april 26 1835 when surveying group was attacked by fifty to sixty members of general brown s militia in what is now called battle of phillips corners battle s name is sometimes used as a synonym for entire toledo war thumb right site of battle of phillips corners surveyors wrote to lucas afterwards that while observing blessings of sabbath michigan militia forces advised them to retreat in ensuing chase nine of our men who did not leave ground in time after being fired upon by enemy from thirty to fifty shots were taken prisoners and carried away into tecumseh while details of attack are disputed michigan claimed it fired no shots and had only discharged a few musket rounds in air as ohio group retreated battle further infuriated both ohioans and and brought two sides to brink of all out war bloodshed in 1835 frame upright ohioan two stickney who caused sole serious injury in toledo war by stabbing a michigan sheriff s deputy in response to allegations that michigan s militia fired upon ohioans lucas called a special session of ohio s legislature on june 8 1835 to pass several more controversial acts including establishment of toledo as county seat of lucas county establishment of a court of common pleas in city a law to prevent forcible abduction of ohio citizens from area and a budget of 300 000 to implement legislation michigan s territorial legislature responded with a budget appropriation of 315 000 00 to fund its militia in may and june 1835 michigan drafted a state constitution with provisions for a bicameral legislature a supreme court and other components of a functional state government congress was still not willing to allow michigan s entry into union and president jackson vowed to reject michigan s statehood until border issue and war were resolved lucas ordered his adjutant general samuel c andrews to conduct a count of militia and was told that 10 000 volunteers were ready to fight that news became exaggerated as it traveled north and soon thereafter michigan territorial press dared ohio million to enter strip as they welcomed them to hospitable graves in june 1835 lucas dispatched a delegation consisting of u s attorney noah haynes swayne former congressman william allen and david t disney to washington d c to confer with president andrew jackson delegation presented ohio s case and urged president to act swiftly to address situation throughout mid 1835 both governments continued their practice of one upmanship and constant skirmishes and arrests occurred citizens of monroe county joined together in a posse to make arrests in toledo partisans from ohio angered by harassment targeted offenders with criminal prosecutions lawsuits were not only rampant they served as a basis for retaliatory lawsuits from opposite side partisans from both sides organized spying parties to keep track of sheriffs of wood county ohio and monroe county michigan who were entrusted with security of border on july 15 1835 tensions and emotions finally overflowed and blood was spilled monroe county michigan deputy sheriff joseph wood went into toledo to arrest major benjamin stickney but when stickney and his three sons resisted whole family was subdued and taken into custody during scuffle two stickney son of major stabbed wood with a pen knife and fled south into ohio wood s injuries were not life threatening two stickney s brothers one and three were also active in fight when lucas refused mason s demand to extradite two stickney back to michigan for trial mason wrote to president jackson for help suggesting that matter be referred to united states supreme court at time of conflict it was not established that supreme court could resolve state boundary disputes and jackson declined offer looking for peace lucas began making his own efforts to end conflict again through federal intervention via ohio s congressional delegation in august 1835 at strong urging of ohio s congressmen president jackson removed mason as michigan s territorial governor and appointed john s little jack horner in his stead before his replacement arrived mason ordered 1 000 michigan militiamen to enter toledo and prevent symbolically important first session of ohio court of common pleas while idea was popular with michigan residents effort failed judges held a midnight court before quickly retreating south of maumee river where ohio forces were positioned frostbitten convention and end of toledo war mason s successor horner proved to be extremely unpopular as governor and his tenure was very short residents disliked him so much they burned him in effigy and pelted him with vegetables upon his entry into territorial capital in october 1835 elections voters approved draft constitution and elected popular mason as state governor same election saw isaac e crary chosen as michigan s first u s representative to congress because of dispute congress refused to accept his credentials and seated him as a non voting delegate two u s senators chosen by state legislature in november lucius lyon and john norvell were treated with even less respect being allowed to sit only as spectators in senate gallery thumb left upright journal of 1836 michigan territorial convention often called frostbitten convention on june 15 1836 jackson signed a bill that allowed michigan to become a state but only after it ceded toledo strip in exchange for this concession michigan would be granted western three quarters of what is now known as upper peninsula easternmost portion had already been included in state boundaries because of perceived worthlessness of upper peninsula s remote wilderness a september 1836 special convention in ann arbor michigan rejected offer as year wore on michigan found itself deep in a financial crisis and was nearly bankrupt because of high militia expenses government was spurred to action by realization that a 400 000 surplus in in united states treasury was about to be distributed to 25 states but not to territorial governments michigan would have been ineligible to receive a share of money thumb right upper peninsula of michigan congress offered region in red to state of michigan in exchange for toledo strip as a compromise war unofficially ended on december 14 1836 at a second convention in ann arbor delegates passed a resolution to accept terms set forth by congress calling of convention was itself controversial it had only come about because of an of private summonses petitions and public meetings since legislature did not approve a call to convention some said convention was illegal whigs boycotted convention as a consequence resolution was rejected and ridiculed by many michigan residents congress questioned legality of convention but accepted results of convention regardless of its concerns because of these factors as well as because of notable cold spell at time event later became known as frostbitten convention on january 26 1837 michigan was finally admitted to union as 26th state without toledo strip subsequent history toledo strip became a permanent part of ohio while upper peninsula was considered a worthless wilderness by almost all familiar with area vast mineral riches of land were unknown to settlers until discovery of copper in peninsula and iron in central upper peninsula this discovery led to a mining boom that lasted long into 20th century michigan s loss of of agricultural land and port of toledo was balanced by gain of of timber and ore rich land differences of opinion about exact boundary location continued until a definitive re survey was performed in 1915 re survey protocol would ordinarily require surveyors to follow harris line exactly but in this case surveyors deviated from line in places this prevented situation of certain residents near border being subject to changes in state residence or land owners having parcels on both sides of border 1915 survey was delineated by 71 granite markers wide by high upon completion two states governors woodbridge n ferris of michigan and frank b willis of ohio shook hands at border traces of original ordinance line can still be seen in northwestern ohio and northern indiana northernmost boundaries of ottawa and wood counties follow it as well as many township boundaries in fulton and williams counties many old north south roads are offset as they cross line forcing traffic to jog east while traveling north line is identified on united states geological survey topographical maps as south boundary michigan survey and on lucas county and fulton county road maps as old state line road while border on land was firmly set in early 20th century two states were still in disagreement on path of border to east in lake erie in 1973 two states finally obtained a hearing before united states supreme court on their competing claims to lake erie waters in michigan v ohio court upheld a special master s report and ruled that boundary between two states in lake erie was angled to northeast as described in ohio s state constitution and not a straight east west line one consequence of court decision was that tiny turtle island just outside maumee bay and originally treated as being wholly in michigan was split between two states this decision was last border adjustment putting an end to years of debate over official boundary line in modern times although a general rivalry between and ohioans persists overt conflict between states is restricted primarily to michigan ohio state rivalry in american football and to a lesser degree to rivalry between detroit tigers and cleveland indians in american league
