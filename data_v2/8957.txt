nilgai or blue bull literally meaning blue bull boselaphus tragocamelus is largest asian antelope and is endemic to indian subcontinent sole member of genus boselaphus species was described and given its binomial name by german zoologist peter simon pallas in 1766 nilgai stands at shoulder males weigh and lighter females a sturdy thin legged antelope nilgai is characterised by a sloping back a deep neck with a white patch on throat a short crest of hair along neck terminating in a tuft and white facial spots a column of pendant coarse hair hangs from dewlap ridge below white patch sexual dimorphism is prominent while females and juveniles are orange to tawny adult males have a bluish grey coat only males possess horns long nilgai is diurnal active mainly during day animals band together in three distinct kinds of groups one or two females with young calves three to six adult and yearling females with calves and all male groups with two to 18 members typically tame nilgai may appear timid and cautious if harassed or alarmed it flees up to or even galloping away from source of danger herbivores nilgai prefer grasses and herbs though they commonly eat woody plants in dry tropical forests of india females become sexually mature by two years while males do not become sexually active until four or five years old time of year when mating takes place varies geographically but a peak breeding season lasting three to four months can be observed at most places gestation lasts eight to nine months following which a single calf sometimes twins or even triplets is born as typical of several bovid species nilgai calves stay hidden for first few weeks of their lives lifespan of nilgai is around ten years nilgai prefer areas with short bushes and scattered trees in scrub forests and grassy plains they are common in agricultural lands but hardly occur in dense forest major populations occur in terai lowlands in foothills of himalayas northern india but antelope is sparsely found in nepal and pakistan it was first thought to be extinct in bangladesh but it was found there on 22 january 2019 daily star 23 january 2019 page 2 nilgai were first introduced to texas in 1920s and 1930s as of 2008 feral population in texas is nearly 37 000 nilgai is categorised as least concern by iucn nilgai has been associated with indian culture since vedic period 1500 500 bc hindus revere nilgai as sacred and associate it with cow mother animal in hinduism through its name and loosely similar physical features they were hunted in mughal era 16th to 19th centuries and are depicted in numerous miniatures nilgai have been considered a pest in several north indian states as they ravage crop fields and cause considerable damage in bihar authorities have classified nilgai as vermin etymology vernacular name nilgai comes from fusion of hindi words nil blue and gai cow word was first recorded in use in 1882 alternative origins could be from persian cow nilgai has been referred to by a variety of names and constructions referring to other blue animals they are also known as white footed antelope during mughal emperor aurangzeb s reign 1658 1707 of india nilgai was known by name nil for blue and ghor for horse taxonomy scientific name of nilgai is boselaphus tragocamelus nilgai is sole member of genus boselaphus and placed in family bovidae species was described and given its binomial name by german zoologist peter simon pallas in 1766 he based his description on a 1745 account of a male nilgai by british physician james parsons in 43rd volume of philosophical transactions now known as philosophical transactions of royal society nilgai has one other relative in tribe boselaphini four horned antelope sole member of generic name boselaphus comes from combination of latin bos cow or ox and greek deer specific name tragocamelus comes from join of two greek words tragos he goat and camel binomial combination was first used by english zoologist philip sclater in 1883 boselaphus has often been misspelled as first used by ludwig reichenbach in 1845 for red hartebeest and first used by thomas horsfield in 1851 when he mistook a nilgai specimen for a hartebeest in a museum catalogue of east india company evolution a 1992 phylogenetic study of mitochondrial dna sequences showed a strong possibility of a clade consisting of boselaphini bovini and tragelaphini bovini consists of genera bos african buffalo bison and extinct tragelaphini consists of two genera taurotragus eland and tragelaphus a closer relationship between boselaphini and tragelaphini was predicted and seconded by a similar study in 1999 though tribe boselaphini has no african representation today fossil evidence supports its presence in continent in prehistoric times as early as late miocene two living antelope species of this tribe have been found to have a closer relationship with earliest bovids like eotragus species than do other bovids this tribe originated at least 8 9 million years ago in much same area where four horned antelope lives today and may represent most primitive of all living bovids having changed least since origins of family extant and extinct boselaphine forms show similar development of horn cores central bony part of horn though extant nilgai females lack horns historic relatives of antelope had horned females fossil relatives were once placed in subfamily cephalophinae which now contains only african duikers fossils of and dating back to late miocene have been discovered not only in asia and southern europe but also in formation kenya and are thought to belong to boselaphini other miocene fossils of discovered are of and tragoportax fossils of miotragoceros are not apparent in africa only m cyrenaicus has been reported from continent but have significant presence in hills in india and pakistan as do several tragoportax species a 2005 study showed migration of miotragoceros to eastern asia around eight million years ago alan w gentry of natural history museum reported presence of another boselaphine from langebaanweg south africa remains of nilgai dating back to pleistocene have been discovered from caves in southern india evidence suggests that they were hunted by humans during mesolithic period 5 000 to 8 000 years ago description thumbnail left close view of a male nilgai showing facial markings throat patch beard and short horns thumb skull of a nilgai nilgai is largest antelope in asia it stands at shoulder head and body length is typically between males weigh maximum weight recorded is females are lighter weighing sexual dimorphism is prominent males are larger than females and differ in colouration a sturdy thin legged antelope nilgai is characterised by a sloping back a deep neck with a white patch on throat a short mane of hair behind and along back ending behind shoulder and around two white spots each on its face ears cheeks lips and chin ears tipped with black are long a column of coarse hair known as pendant and around long in males can be observed along dewlap ridge below white throat patch tufted tail up to has a few white spots and is tipped with black forelegs are generally longer and legs are often marked with white socks while females and juveniles are orange to tawny males are much darker their coat is typically bluish grey ventral parts insides of thighs and tail are all white a white stripe extends from underbelly and broadens as it approaches rump forming a patch lined with dark hair almost white though not albino individuals have been observed in sariska national park rajasthan india while individuals with white patches have been recorded at zoos hairs typically long are fragile and brittle males have thicker skin on their head and neck that protect them in fights coat is not well insulated with fat during winter and consequently severe cold might be fatal for nilgai only males possess horns though a few females may be horned as well horns are long but generally shorter than smooth and straight these may point backward or forward horns of nilgai and four horned antelope lack ringed structure typical of those of other bovids maximum recorded length of skull is dental formula is milk teeth are totally lost and permanent dentition completed by three years of age permanent teeth get degraded with age showing prominent signs of wear at six years of age nilgai has sharp ears and eyes though its sense of smell is not as acute ecology and behavior thumbnail left a group of nilgai resting nilgai is diurnal active mainly during day a 1991 study investigated daily routine of antelope and found feeding peaks at dawn in morning in afternoon and during evening females and juveniles do not interact appreciably with males except during mating season groups are generally small with ten or fewer individuals though groups of 20 to 70 individuals can occur at times in a 1980 study in bardiya national park nepal average herd size was of three individuals in a 1995 study in gir national park gujarat india herd membership varied with season however three distinct groupings are formed one or two females with young calves three to six adult and yearling females with calves and male groups with two to 18 members thumbnail a nilgai running typically tame nilgai may appear timid and cautious if harassed or alarmed instead of seeking cover like duikers it would flee up to or even on galloping away from danger though generally quiet nilgai have been reported to make short guttural grunts when alarmed and females to make clicking noises when nursing young alarmed individuals mainly juveniles below five months give out a coughing roar whose pitch is highest in case of juveniles that lasts half a second but can be heard by herds less than away and responded to similarly fights take place in both sexes and involve pushing their necks against each other or ramming into one another using horns fights can be gory despite protective skin deep lacerated wounds and even deaths might occur display behaviour focuses on throat patch and beard and threatening opponents by pointing horns toward them a young male was observed making a submissive display in sariska reserve by kneeling before an adult male who stood erect nilgai mark their territories by forming dung piles as much as in radius defecation process is elaborate antelope stands with his legs about a metre apart with rump lowered and tail held almost vertical it stays in same posture for at least ten seconds after relieving itself process is not as elaborate in females as it is in males thumbnail left sparring india nilgai shares its habitat with four horned antelope chinkara chital and blackbuck its association with gaur and water buffalo is less common in ranthambore national park rajasthan india nilgai and chinkara collectively prefer area rich in acacia and butea species while sambar deer and chital preferred forests of anogeissus and grewia species in india indian tiger and lion may prey on nilgai but they are not significant predators of this antelope leopards prey on nilgai though they prefer smaller prey dholes generally attack juveniles other predators include wolves and striped hyenas diet thumbnail nilgai can reach for high branches herbivores nilgai prefer grasses and herbs woody plants are commonly eaten in dry tropical forests of india studies suggest they may be browsers or mixed feeders in india whereas they are primarily grazers in texas nilgai can tolerate interference by livestock and degradation of vegetation in its habitat better than deer possibly because they can reach high branches and do not depend on surface vegetation sambar deer and nilgai in nepal have similar dietary preferences diets generally suffice in protein and fats protein content of nilgai s should be at least seven percent nilgai can survive for long periods without water and do not drink regularly even in summer however a nilgai died in dwarka india allegedly due to heat wave and acute shortage of water a 1994 study of nilgai s diet in sariska reserve revealed its preference for herbs and grasses grasses became more important in rainy season while during winter and summer it fed additionally on flowers butea foliage anogeissus pendula capparis grewia flavescens and zizyphus mauritiana pods acacia nilotica a and a leucophloea and fruits zizyphus mauritiana preferred grass species include cenchrus species cynodon dactylon and woody plants eaten include acacia nilotica a senegal a leucophloea indigofera oblongifolia morus alba and zizyphus herbs favoured are hirsutus euphorbia hirta and sida seeds of occurred in dung of nilgai most of year acacia nilotica and prosopis seeds were discovered in dry season and those of echinochloa during monsoon reproduction thumbnail left nilgai mating observations of females in southern texas revealed that ovaries are developed by two years of age and first birth takes place typically a year later though in a few cases females as young as one and a half years may mate successfully females can breed again around a year after parturition males in same location were found to have active testes by age of three years that matured considerably by next year males become sexually active at four or five years mating may occur throughout year with peaks of three to four months time of year when these peaks occur varies geographically in texas a peak is apparent from december to march in bharatpur national park rajasthan india breeding season is from october to february peaking in november and december sariska reserve witnesses a similar peak in december and january thumbnail right a mother with her calves in mating season rutting males move about in search of females in oestrus males become aggressive and fight among themselves for dominance these fights are characterised by displays of enlarged chest throat patch and beard while holding head upright and threatening opponent by running with horns pointed toward him and circling him victorious bull would protect vicinity of targeted female from other males courtship typically lasts for 45 minutes male stiff and composed approaches receptive female who keeps her head low to ground and may slowly walk forward male licks her genitalia upon which female holds her tail to a side and male gives out a flehmen response finally male pushes his chest against her rump and mounts her gestation lasts eight to nine months following which a single calf or twins even triplets at times are born in a 2004 study in sariska reserve twins accounted for as high as 80 percent of total calf population births peak from june to october in bharatpur national park and from april to august in southern texas calves are precocial they are able to stand within 40 minutes of birth and forage by fourth week pregnant females isolate themselves before giving birth as typical of several bovid species nilgai calves are kept in hiding for first few weeks of their lives this period of concealment can last as long as a month in texas calves mainly males bicker playfully by neck fighting young males would leave their mothers at ten months to join bachelor groups lifespan of nilgai is typically ten years in texas habitat and distribution thumb in grassland thumb left nilgai prefer areas with low bushes nilgai prefer areas with short bushes and scattered trees in scrub forests and grassy plains they are common in agricultural lands but hardly occur in dense woods in southern texas it roams in prairies scrub forests and oak forests it is a generalist animal it can adapt to a variety of habitats though sedentary and less dependent on water nilgai may desert their territories if all water sources in and around it dry up territories in texas are large this antelope is endemic to indian subcontinent major populations occur in india nepal and pakistan whereas it is extinct in bangladesh significant numbers occur in terai lowlands in foothills of himalayas antelope is abundant across northern india indian population was estimated at one million in 2001 nilgai were first introduced to texas in 1920s and 1930s in a large ranch near norias division of king ranch one of largest ranches in world feral population saw a spurt toward latter part of 1940s and gradually spread out to adjoining ranches thumb nilgai search for new areas if they run out of water population densities show great geographical variation across india density can be as low as 0 23 to 0 34 individuals per km2 in national park chhattisgarh and 0 4 individuals per km2 in pench tiger reserve madhya pradesh or as high as 6 60 to 11 36 individuals per km2 and ranthambhore national park and 7 individuals per km2 in keoladeo national park both in rajasthan seasonal variations were noted in bardiya national park nepal in a 1980 study density 3 2 individuals per km2 during dry season and 5 per km2 in april start of dry season in southern texas densities were found to be nearly 3 5 individuals per km2 in 1976 historic notes mention nilgai in southern india but these may have been feral threats and conservation thumb right nilgai in gir national park gujarat india nilgai is categorised as of least concern by international union for conservation of nature and natural resources iucn while it is common in india nilgai occurs sparsely in nepal and pakistan major reasons behind its decimation in these two countries and extinction in bangladesh are rampant hunting deforestation and habitat degradation in 20th century as of 2008 feral population in texas was nearly 37 000 wild populations also exist in us states of alabama florida and mississippi and mexican state of tamaulipas where they have escaped from private exotic ranches population around texas mexico border is estimated to be around 30 000 as of 2011 in india nilgai is protected under schedule iii of wildlife protection act of 1972 major protected areas for nilgai across india include gir national park gujarat national park bori wildlife sanctuary kanha national park biosphere reserve panna tiger reserve pench tiger reserve sanjay national park satpura national park madhya pradesh andhari reserve maharashtra wildlife sanctuary sultanpur national park in gurgaon ranthambore national park and sariska tiger reserve rajasthan interactions with humans remains of nilgai have been excavated at rajar west bengal india suggesting that they were domesticated or hunted in eastern india in neolithic period 6500 1400 bce and during indus valley civilisation 3300 1700 bce in indian subcontinent there is a reference to nilgai in aitareya brahmana a hindu religious text dated 500 1000 bce where one of prajapatis progenitor god is said to have assumed form of a nilgai thumbnail right nilgai illustrated by ustad mansur for jahangir 1605 27 c 1620 nilgai are extensively featured in paintings dagger and texts from mughal era 16th to 19th centuries their representation however is less frequent than that of horses and camels on being disturbed while hunting nilgai mughal emperor jahangir recorded his ire for centuries indian villagers have associated nilgai with cow a sacred animal revered by hindus and name gai means cow in hindi indicates similarity they saw with cow nilgai is rarely consumed by hindus due to its religious significance tribes such as traditionally take care of wild animals like nilgai nilgai was not widely hunted until 20th century when habitat degradation and poaching became rampant meat of nilgai is said to be lighter and milder flavoured than blackbuck meat culling and conservation populations of nilgai in india are so large that farmers in states of bihar chhattisgarh haryana madhya pradesh maharashtra rajasthan and uttar pradesh have pleaded to government to cull them nilgai herds raid and trample crop fields across these states often causing food shortages farmers use live electric wires to guard their farms which kills other animals as well farmers in madhya pradesh went on a hunger strike in 2015 demanding compensation for damage caused by nilgai although blackbuck cause a similar problem damage caused by them is significantly lower as they merely break off young shoots a 1990 study suggested culling building enclosures for antelopes and fencing off agricultural areas as remedies governments of bihar maharashtra and uttarakhand have urged government of india to declare nilgai as vermin proposal has been implemented in bihar where nilgai can now be hunted to minimise damages incurred by locals uttar pradesh government has given farmers and firearm licence holders right to cull animals however animal rights activists in various parts of india were unhappy with decision k srivastava a columnist and social activist wrote that culling of nilgais blue bulls in bihar in july 2016 was so deplorable that it doesn t need any justification excuse given for this slew by state government then environment minister prakash javadekar and judiciary is so illogical that it mocks all solutions available to stop nilgais from destroying farms we live in 21st century and culling is only very last option we have farmers can either opt for fencing around farmlands or if it s unaffordable then government can give ordinances to relocate them to forests state governments have attempted other initiatives to curb nilgai in november 2015 rajasthan government came up with a proposal to allow shooting nilgai with non lethal darts to inhibit fertilisation in their bodies so as to regulate their increasing populations as name nilgai appeals to religious sentiments of hindus government of madhya pradesh has sought to officially rename it as hindi for forest antelope and government of haryana to rename it as roze in a bid to make their culling acceptable in september 2019 a video surfaced of a nilgai being buried alive with an excavator in bihar as part of culling state forest department has claimed to have begun an investigation to find those responsible a 1994 study drew attention to ecological value provided by nilgai in ravines lining yamuna river in summer faeces of antelope contained nearly 1 6 percent nitrogen that could enhance quality of soil up to a depth of seeds in droppings could easily germinate and
