reputation for running in front and wearing out his exercise riders so stevens unsuccessfully attempted to rate oxbow and make him run off pace behind other horses oxbow described by observers as very rank and by stevens as pissed off and upset with me that he didn t get running style he wanted was tossing his head and fighting stevens into clubhouse turn after running last at one point in race oxbow improved his position and finished fifth less than a length behind second place frac daddy oxbow earned a speed figure of 90 same as in his maiden win stevens viewed his attempt to make oxbow

triple crown series kentucky derby oxbow ran in kentucky derby at churchill downs as a 25 1 long shot ridden by stevens who had been on oxbow in workouts since arkansas derby and as lukas said had gotten to know horse a little better throughout last two weeks following scratch of black onyx in post position one oxbow had inside number two post in field of 19 starters and was closest to rail his position was further complicated by being next to revolutionary with jockey calvin borel at number three between size of field and borel s well known preference for riding rail oxbow had to use his speed early to get out front and avoid being pushed into rail or being hemmed in behind traffic he broke fifth and was soon close to leader palace malice who ran second fastest initial quarter and

runner up finished third and derby champion orb was fourth oxbow earned a career high speed figure of 112 which was higher than orb s had been in derby in post race interviews stevens said his mind was right when i hit half mile pole race was over at that point and t hey gave me a free three quarters of a mile today stevens later tweeted that oxbow was most intelligent horse i have ever ridden he noted horse was not particularly tired after race and described him as a happy horse in winner s circle lukas said he never even broke a sweat victory was 77 year old lukas sixth career preakness win and his 14th triple crown win surpassing record of sunny jim fitzsimmons it was lukas first win in any triple crown race since commendable won belmont stakes in 2000 oxbow s success was stevens third career preakness win and his ninth triple crown win but first since winning preakness and belmont on point given in 2001 belmont stakes fourteen horses started at 2013 belmont stakes oxbow drew number seven post position with rival orb at post five there were concerns about stevens fitness as he had missed races after being thrown from a horse previous week but medical tests showed no sign of injury oxbow was third favorite at 5 1 on morning line but by race time his odds were at 10 1 in race oxbow broke third out of gate and settled behind frac daddy and freedom child completing a quarter mile in 23 seconds as usual oxbow wanted to run close to front stevens knew better than to fight with him and so as in derby horse and rider once again chased speed horses at fractions described as suicidal at half mile pole oxbow was a neck off leader who clocked at 0 46 66 and on backstretch oxbow went to front reaching three quarter mile mark at 1 10 95 running second fastest half and three quarter mile fractions at that point in race since secretariat s 1973 record setting performance oxbow was still in front by a half length at mile post at top of homestretch palace malice and oxbow were nose and nose but oxbow tired and finished second by three lengths to palace malice with kentucky derby winner orb third lengths behind oxbow his speed figure for belmont was 98 same as in risen star stakes second place finish in belmont earned oxbow 200 000 and pushed him over 1 million mark in career earnings making him third horse in 2013 to reach 1 million in purse wins behind orb and a fellow awesome again son six year old gelding game on dude although 1 million bonus for horse winning highest combined triple crown points has long been discontinued oxbow would have

race horses of all ages remainder of season oxbow came out of belmont feeling good or as lukas put it full of himself he returned to churchill downs and resumed scheduled workouts sooner than usual lukas then shipped oxbow to saratoga to prepare him to run in grade i 1 million haskell invitational on july 28 2013 with sportswriters hoping to see him meet up again with orb and palace malice in travers stakes later in summer in an attempt to get oxbow past what had been described as his one dimensional front running style lukas turned to a training regimen at saratoga where horse had no clocked workouts but instead was conditioned by jogging and galloping clockwise wrong way on training track for long one and a half to two mile trips each time out oxbow drew post position five for haskell carried highest weight at 122 pounds and was second favorite in race behind verrazano leading for early part of race oxbow was challenged for lead by verrazano at three quarter mile marker then weakened and finished fourth earning another 60 000 stevens felt something was wrong with oxbow at half mile pole later saying horse didn t feel like he did in any of triple crown races and lukas stated jockey kind of held oxbow from that point on oxbow was pulled up soon after crossing finish line then his rider jumped off and removed saddle when oxbow failed to jog sound on track horse walked back to barn without obvious sign of injury and radiographs of his right front ankle revealed no fracture but he did have a soft tissue injury to area described as a sprain of oxbow s overall health lukas commented he had a pretty set of x rays it s amazing for a horse with that many starts they were really clean nonetheless as a result of soft tissue injury oxbow was taken out of races for duration of summer and after three weeks of hand walking at saratoga was shipped home to calumet in mid august with an announcement that he was not anticipated to run again in 2013 lukas said he s
