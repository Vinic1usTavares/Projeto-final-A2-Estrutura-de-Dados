over cape canaveral during which aerial photographs of future launch sites were taken between april 4 1960 and october 25 1962 including during critical time of cuban missile crisis chaffee flew 82 missions over cuba sometimes up to three per day and achieved over 100 flight hours each month some of these trips included shuttling three men per plane back and forth to guantanamo bay including pilot co pilot and photographer some biographies credit him with flying u 2 plane to spy on cuba but this is erroneous since he was a navy pilot and u 2 was an air force plane after this chaffee undertook aircraft carrier flight training including time spent on performing both day and night flights he said of day flying setting that big bird down on flight deck was like landing on a postage stamp and of night flying getting catapulted off that flight deck at night is like getting shot into a bottle of ink while working in jacksonville he concurrently worked on a master s degree he was on

sill during water egress training for apollo 1 phase one of training for third group of astronauts began in 1964 in lecture halls lectures in several fields were supplemented with trips to locations with geological significance so astronauts gained hands on experience as well as piloting spacecraft astronauts were to perform scientific experiments and measurements on moon astronauts traveled to grand canyon to learn about geography and to alaska iceland and hawaii to learn about rock formations and lava flows second phase was contingency training which focused on astronauts learning skills required to survive if landing did not occur where planned group started their training by being dropped off in middle of jungle in panama they performed survival training in pairs carrying only their parachutes and survival kits chaffee with help from his boy scout training foraged for enough food to survive during three day training mission following jungle training astronauts traveled to an entirely different environment desert of reno nevada for clothing astronauts had only long underwear shoes and robes they manufactured from their parachutes lizards and snakes were main source of food and astronauts used their parachutes as makeshift tents for shelter for two days of desert training third and final phase was operational training for astronauts this focused on giving them hands on experience using instruments and equipment required during their spaceflight they received training in effects of microgravity and rapid acceleration astronauts spent time in simulators aboard cargo planes that simulated weightlessness underwater to practice extravehicular activities evas and on visits to manufacturing plants to check on progress of hardware project gemini thumb chaffee at consoles in mission control during gemini 3 mission alt refer to caption every astronaut was required to have a specialty and chaffee s specialty was communications he focused on deep space instrumentation facility which astronauts needed for navigation in space at manned spacecraft center in houston chaffee served as capsule communicator capcom in march 1965 for gemini 3 later that year he was capcom along with virgil gus grissom and eugene cernan for gemini 4 mission in which ed white performed first spacewalk by an american as capcom chaffee relayed information between crew members and director of flight operations chris kraft he never got a seat on a gemini mission but was assigned to work on flight control communications instrumentation and attitude and translation control systems in apollo program during this time along with grissom he also flew chase planes at an altitude of between to take motion pictures of launch of an uncrewed saturn 1b rocket apollo program thumb

he was youngest american astronaut to be selected for a mission joining command pilot grissom and senior pilot white he replaced injured donn f eisele in third ranked pilot position eisele required surgery for a dislocated shoulder which he sustained aboard kc 135 weightlessness training aircraft he was reassigned to a second apollo crew commanded by wally schirra crew announcement was made public on march 21 1966 two week flight of apollo1 was to test spacecraft systems and control and ground tracking facilities while chaffee had monitored manufacture of gemini spacecraft he had not witnessed building of apollo spacecraft three days after being selected for apollo1 crew he flew to north american aviation plant in downey california to see it later in april crew traveled to chapel hill north carolina to study stars that were programmed into their flight computer in october six crewmembers planned to test spacecraft in sea level and altitude conditions failure of an oxygen regulator prevented them from performing vacuum test but they managed to complete sea level test they also performed egress tests where capsule simulators were dropped in gulf of mexico under various conditions and crew had to exit spacecraft crew was able to spend time with their families at christmas chaffee entered a local christmas decoration contest and he received first prize four purdue astronauts were requested to attend rose bowl as guests of honor grissom gene cernan armstrong and chaffee attended game on january 2 progress on pre mission activities was nearing completion nasa

was to maintain communications with blockhouse a momentary power surge was detected at 23 30 55 gmt which was believed to accompany an electrical short in equipment located on lower left side of cabin presumed ignition source for fire at 23 31 04 gmt a voice was heard declaring we ve got a fire in cockpit most investigative listeners believe that voice was chaffee s assigned emergency roles called for grissom in left hand seat to open cabin pressure vent valve after which white in center seat was to open plug door hatch while chaffee in right hand seat was to maintain communications grissom was prevented from opening valve by intensity of fire which started in that region and spread from left to right despite this white removed his restraints and apparently tried in vain to open hatch which was held closed by cabin pressure increasing pressure finally burst inner cabin wall on right hand side at 23 31 19 gmt after approximately thirty seconds of being fed by a cabin atmosphere of pure oxygen at pressures of and now fed by nitrogen buffered ambient air primary fire decreased in intensity and started producing large amounts of smoke which killed astronauts chaffee lost consciousness because of a lack of oxygen which sent him into cardiac arrest he died from asphyxia due to toxic gases from fire with burns contributing to his death failed oxygen and ethylene glycol pipes near fire s origin point continued burning an intense secondary fire which melted through cabin floor by time firefighters were able to open hatch fire had extinguished itself back of chaffee s couch was found in horizontal position with lower portion angled towards floor his helmet was closed and locked his restraints were undone and hoses and electrical connections to suit remained connected as he was farthest from origin of fire he suffered least burn and suit damage aftermath thumb alt grissom and chaffee headstones with a wreath between them gus grissom s and roger chaffee s headstones during
