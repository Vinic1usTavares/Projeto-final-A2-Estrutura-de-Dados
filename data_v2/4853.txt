longtail butterfly ray gymnura poecilura is a species of butterfly ray family native to indo pacific from red sea to southern japan and western indonesia growing up to across this ray has a lozenge shaped pectoral fin disc about twice as wide as long colored brown to gray above with many small light spots spiracles behind its eyes have smooth rims this species can be identified by its tail which is about as long as snout to vent distance lacks fins and bears nine to twelve each of alternating black and white bands bottom dwelling in nature longtail butterfly ray frequents sandy or muddy habitats in coastal waters shallower than its diet consists of bony fishes molluscs and crustaceans this species gives birth to live young developing embryos are nourished first by yolk and later by histotroph uterine milk supplied by its mother there is no defined breeding season and females bear litters of up to seven pups used for its meat longtail butterfly ray is often caught by artisanal and commercial fisheries international union for conservation of nature iucn has listed this species as near threatened citing high levels of fishing pressure within its range and its low reproductive rate taxonomy and phylogeny longtail butterfly ray was originally described as raja poecilura by english zoologist george shaw in his 1804 general zoology or systematic natural history he did not designate a type specimen as his account was based on an illustration by scottish naturalist patrick russell published a year earlier in descriptions and figures of two hundred fishes collected at vizagapatam on coast of coromandel specific epithet poecilura is derived from greek of many colors and oura tail later authors moved this species to genus gymnura further research is needed to determine whether isolated longtail butterfly rays in french polynesia are in fact same species as those from rest of its range phylogenetic studies based on morphology and mitochondrial dna indicate that longtail butterfly ray is closely related to butterfly ray g which shares much of its range in indo pacific another name for longtail butterfly ray is variegated butterfly ray description pectoral fin disc of longtail butterfly ray has lozenge shape characteristic of its family measuring around twice as wide as long leading margin of disc is gently sinuous trailing margin is convex and outer corners are mildly angular snout is short and broad with a tiny protruding tip medium sized eyes have larger smooth rimmed spiracles behind nostrils are positioned close to mouth between them is a short and broad curtain of skin with a smooth margin large mouth forms a transverse curve and contains over 50 tooth rows in each jaw increasing in number with age teeth are small narrow and pointed there are five pairs of short gill slits on underside of disc pelvic fins are small and rounded thread like tail lacks dorsal or caudal fins though there are low ridges along its length above and below its length is about equal to distance between snout tip and vent distinguishing this species from other butterfly rays that have shorter tails sometimes there is a small stinging spine very rarely two on upper surface of tail near base skin is devoid of dermal denticles this species is brown to greenish brown to gray above with many small pale spots and sometimes also a smattering of dark dots tail has nine to twelve black bands alternating with white bands which often have a small dorsally positioned dark spot within underside is white darkening at edges of fins longtail butterfly ray attains a maximum width of distribution and habitat most widespread member of its family in indo pacific longtail butterfly ray is found from red sea and somalia westward across india and sri lanka to china and southern japan philippines and western islands of indonesia including borneo sumatra and java it has also been reported from french polynesia see taxonomic note above it is fairly common in some areas this bottom dwelling species inhabits coastal waters at depths of preferring sandy or muddy bottoms it does not appear to migrate seasonally biology and ecology thumb ponyfishes pictured leiognathus are preyed upon by longtail butterfly ray longtail butterfly ray feeds on bony fishes in particular ponyfishes of genus leiognathus as well as molluscs and crustaceans it is not known to shoal in large numbers known parasites of this ray include nematode and tapeworm acanthobothrium like other butterfly rays this species is viviparous with young sustained initially by yolk and later by histotroph uterine milk produced by mother adult females have two functional ovaries and uteruses reproductive activity proceeds throughout year with a peak from april to october gestation period is unknown though it is possible that females bear more than one litter per year litter size is at least seven pups and is not correlated with female size newborns measure across and look like stingless miniatures of adult siblings may differ from each other in color males and females mature sexually at roughly across respectively human interactions longtail butterfly ray is widely caught for meat and as bycatch in artisanal and commercial fisheries including in india thailand and indonesia it is taken using bottom trawls bottom set gillnets and to a lesser degree trammel nets and other fishing gear though specific population and catch data are lacking longtail butterfly ray is thought to be susceptible to overfishing due to its low reproductive rate and fact that pregnant females often abort their young when captured given high intensity of fishing pressure across most of its range international union for conservation of nature iucn has assessed this species
