developed script with uhls and sought screenwriting advice from cast and others in film industry he and cast compared film to rebel without a cause 1955 and graduate 1967 with a theme of conflict between generation x and value system of advertising fincher used homoerotic overtones of palahniuk s novel to make audiences uncomfortable and keep them from anticipating twist ending studio

project mayhem and stuart blumberg and matt winston play people harassed by group leonard van quattro markus redmond and michael appear as members of law enforcement also involved in fight club themes director david fincher said fight club is a coming of age film like 1967 film graduate but for people in their 30s fincher described narrator as an everyman character is identified in script as jack but left unnamed in film fincher outlined narrator s background he s tried to do everything he was taught to do tried to fit into world by becoming thing he isn t he cannot find happiness so he travels on a path to enlightenment in which he must kill his parents god and teacher by start of film he has killed off his parents with tyler durden he kills his god by doing things they are not supposed to do to complete process of maturing narrator has to kill his teacher tyler durden character is a 1990s inverse of graduate archetype a guy who does not have a world of possibilities in front of him he has no possibilities he literally cannot imagine a way to change his life he is confused and angry so he responds to his environment by creating tyler durden a nietzschean ubermensch in his mind while tyler is who narrator wants to be he is not empathetic and does not help narrator face decisions in his life that are complicated and have moral and ethical implications fincher explained tyler can deal with concepts of our lives in an idealistic fashion but it doesn t have anything to do with compromises of real life as modern man knows it which is you re not really necessary to a lot of what s going on it s built it just needs to run now while studio executives worried that fight club was going to be sinister and seditious fincher sought to make it funny and seditious by including humor to temper sinister element screenwriter jim uhls described film as a romantic comedy explaining it has to do with characters attitudes toward a healthy relationship which is a lot of behavior which seems unhealthy and harsh to each other but in fact does work for them because both characters are out on edge psychologically narrator seeks intimacy but avoids it with marla singer seeing too much of himself in her while marla is a seductive and prospect for narrator he embraces novelty and excitement that comes with befriending tyler narrator is comfortable being personally connected to tyler but becomes jealous when tyler becomes sexually involved with marla when narrator argues with tyler about their friendship tyler tells him that being friends is secondary to pursuing philosophy they have been exploring when tyler implies that marla is a risk they should remove narrator realizes he should have focused on her and begins to diverge from tyler s path narrator an unreliable narrator is not immediately aware that he is mentally projecting tyler he also mistakenly promotes fight clubs as a way to feel powerful though narrator s physical condition worsens while tyler durden s appearance improves while tyler desires real experiences of actual fights like narrator at first he manifests a nihilistic attitude of rejecting and destroying institutions and value systems his impulsive nature representing id is seductive and liberating to narrator and members of project mayhem tyler s initiatives and methods become dehumanizing he orders around members of project mayhem with a megaphone similar to camp directors at chinese re education camps narrator pulls back from tyler and arrives at a middle ground between his conflicting selves fight club examines generation x angst as middle children of history norton said it examines value conflicts of generation x as first generation raised on television this generation its value system largely dictated to it by advertising culture and was told one could achieve spiritual happiness through home furnishing his character walks through his apartment while visual effects identify his many ikea possessions fincher described narrator s immersion it was just idea of living in this fraudulent idea of happiness pitt said fight club is a metaphor for need to push through walls we put around ourselves and just go for it so for first time we can experience pain fight club also parallels 1955 film rebel without a cause both probe frustrations of people in system characters having undergone societal emasculation are reduced to a generation of spectators a culture of advertising defines society s external signifiers of happiness causing an unnecessary chase for material goods that replaces more essential pursuit of spiritual happiness film references consumer products such as gucci calvin klein and volkswagen new beetle norton said of beetle we smash it because it seemed like classic example of a baby boomer generation marketing plan that sold culture back to us pitt explained dissonance i think there s a self defense mechanism that keeps my generation from having any real honest connection or commitment with our true feelings we re rooting for ball teams but we re not getting in there to play we re so concerned with failure and success like these two things are all that s going to sum you up at end violence of fight clubs serves not to promote or glorify combat but for participants to experience feeling in a society where they are otherwise numb fights represent a resistance to impulse to be cocooned in society norton believed fighting strips away fear of pain and reliance on material signifiers of their self worth leaving them to experience something valuable when fights evolve into revolutionary violence film only half accepts revolutionary dialectic by tyler durden narrator pulls back and rejects durden s ideas fight club purposely shapes an ambiguous message whose interpretation is left to audience fincher said i love this idea that you can have fascism without offering any direction or solution isn t point of fascism to say this is way we should be going but this movie couldn t be further from offering any kind of solution production development novel fight club by chuck palahniuk was published in 1996 before its publication a fox searchlight pictures book scout sent a galley proof of novel to creative executive kevin mccormick executive assigned a studio reader to review proof as a candidate for a film adaptation but reader discouraged it mccormick then forwarded proof to producers lawrence bender and art linson who also rejected it producers josh donen and ross bell saw potential and expressed interest they arranged unpaid screen readings with actors to determine script s length and an initial reading lasted six hours producers cut out sections to reduce running time and they used shorter script to record its dialogue bell sent recording to laura ziskin head of division fox 2000 who listened to tape and purchased rights to fight club from palahniuk for 10 000 ziskin initially considered hiring buck henry to write adaptation finding fight club similar to 1967 film graduate which henry had adapted when a new screenwriter jim uhls lobbied donen and bell for job producers chose him over henry bell contacted four directors to direct film he considered peter jackson best choice but jackson was too busy filming 1996 film frighteners in new zealand bryan singer received book but did not read it danny boyle met with bell and read book but he pursued another film david fincher who had read fight club and had tried to buy rights himself talked with ziskin about directing film he hesitated to accept assignment with 20th century fox at first because he had an unpleasant experience directing 1992 film alien 3 for studio to repair his relationship with studio he met with ziskin and studio head bill mechanic in august 1997 20th century fox announced that fincher would direct film adaptation of fight club casting producer ross bell met with actor russell crowe to discuss his candidacy for role of tyler durden producer art linson who joined project late met with pitt regarding same role linson was senior producer of two so studio sought to cast pitt instead of crowe pitt was looking for a new film after domestic failure of his 1998 film meet joe black and studio believed fight club would be more commercially successful with a major star studio signed pitt for us 17 5 million for role of unnamed narrator studio desired a sexier marquee name such as matt damon to increase film s commercial prospects it also considered sean penn fincher instead considered norton based on his performance in 1996 film people vs larry flynt other studios were approaching norton for leading roles in developing films like talented mr ripley and man on moon he was cast in runaway jury but film did not reach production 20th century fox offered norton 2 5 million for fight club he could not accept offer immediately because he still owed paramount pictures a film he had signed a contractual obligation with paramount to appear in one of studio s future films for a smaller salary norton later satisfied obligation with his role in 2003 film italian job in january 1998 20th century fox announced that pitt and norton had been cast actors prepared by taking lessons in boxing taekwondo grappling and pitt voluntarily visited a dentist to have pieces of his front teeth chipped off so his character would not have perfect teeth pieces were restored after filming concluded fincher s first choice for role of marla singer was janeane garofalo who objected to film s sexual content filmmakers considered courtney love and winona ryder as early candidates studio wanted to cast reese witherspoon but fincher felt she was too young he chose to cast bonham carter based on her performance in 1997 film wings of dove writing uhls started working on a draft of adapted screenplay which excluded a voice over because industry perceived at time that technique was hackneyed and trite when fincher joined film he thought that film should have a voice over believing that film s humor came from narrator s voice he described film without a voice over as seemingly sad and pathetic fincher and uhls revised script for six to seven months and by 1997 had a third draft that reordered story and left out several major elements when pitt was cast he was concerned that his character tyler durden was too one dimensional fincher sought advice of writer director cameron crowe who suggested giving character more ambiguity fincher also hired screenwriter andrew kevin walker for assistance he invited pitt and norton to help revise script and group drafted five revisions in course of a year palahniuk praised faithful film adaptation of his novel and applauded how film s plot was more streamlined than book s palahniuk recalled how writers debated if film audiences would believe plot twist from novel fincher supported including twist arguing if they accept everything up to this point they ll accept plot twist if they re still in theater they ll stay with it palahniuk s novel also contained homoerotic overtones which fincher included in film to make audiences uncomfortable and accentuate surprise of twists bathroom scene where tyler durden bathes next to narrator is an example of overtones line i m wondering if another woman is really answer we need was meant to suggest personal responsibility rather than homosexuality another example is scene at beginning of film in which tyler durden puts a gun barrel down narrator s mouth narrator finds redemption at end of film by rejecting tyler durden s dialectic a path that diverged from novel s ending in which narrator is placed in a mental institution norton drew parallels between redemption in film and redemption in graduate indicating that protagonists of both films find a middle ground between two divisions of self fincher considered novel too infatuated with tyler durden and changed ending to move away from him i wanted people to love tyler but i also wanted them to be ok with his vanquishing filming studio executives mechanic and ziskin planned an initial budget of us 23 million to finance film but by start of production budget was increased to 50 million half was paid by new regency but during filming projected budget escalated to us 67 million new regency s head and fight club executive producer arnon milchan petitioned fincher to reduce costs by at least us 5 million fincher refused so milchan threatened mechanic that new regency would withdraw financing mechanic sought to restore milchan s support by sending him tapes of dailies from fight club after seeing three weeks of filming milchan reinstated new regency s financial backing final production budget was 63 million fight scenes were heavily choreographed but actors were required to go full out to capture realistic effects such as having wind knocked out of them makeup artist julie pearce who had worked for fincher on 1997 film game studied mixed martial arts and pay per view boxing to portray fighters accurately she designed an extra s ear to have cartilage missing inspired by boxing match in which mike tyson bit off part of evander holyfield s ear makeup artists devised two methods to create sweat on cue spraying mineral water over a coat of vaseline and using unadulterated water for wet sweat meat loaf who plays a fight club member who has bitch tits wore a 90 pound 40 kg fat harness that gave him large breasts he also wore eight inch 20 cm lifts in his scenes with norton to be taller than him fight club dvd commentary featuring david fincher brad pitt edward norton and helena bonham carter 2000 20th century fox filming lasted 138 days during which fincher shot more than 1 500 rolls of film three times average for a hollywood film locations were in and around los angeles including promenade towers melrose avenue st brendan s catholic church and michael heizer s public art sculpture north south east west sets were also built in century city production designer alex mcdowell constructed more than 70 sets exterior of tyler durden s house was built in wilmington california while interior was built on a sound stage at studio s location interior was given a decayed look to illustrate deconstructed world of characters marla singer s apartment was based on photographs of apartments in downtown la overall production included 300 scenes 200 locations and complex special effects fincher compared fight club to his subsequent less complex film panic room i felt like i was spending all my time watching trucks being loaded and unloaded so i could shoot three lines of dialogue there was far too much transportation going on cinematography fincher used super 35 format to film fight club since it gave him maximum flexibility to compose shots he hired jeff cronenweth as cinematographer cronenweth s father jordan cronenweth had been cinematographer for fincher s 1992 film alien 3 but left midway through production due to parkinson s disease fincher explored visual styles in his previous films seven and game and he and cronenweth drew elements from these styles for fight club fincher and cronenweth applied a lurid style choosing to make people sort of shiny appearance of narrator s scenes without tyler were bland and realistic scenes with tyler were described by fincher as more hyper real in a torn down deconstructed sense a visual metaphor of what narrator is heading into filmmakers used heavily desaturated colors in costuming makeup and art direction bonham carter wore opalescent makeup to portray her romantic nihilistic character with a smack fiend patina fincher and cronenweth drew influences from 1973 film american graffiti which applied a mundane look to nighttime exteriors while simultaneously including a variety of colors crew took advantage of both natural and practical light fincher sought various approaches to lighting setups for example he chose several urban locations for city lights effects on shots backgrounds crew also embraced fluorescent lighting at other practical locations to maintain an element of reality and to light prostheses depicting characters injuries on other hand fincher also ensured that scenes were not so strongly lit so characters eyes were less visible citing cinematographer gordon willis technique as influence fight club was filmed mostly at night and fincher filmed daytime shots in shadowed locations crew equipped bar s basement with inexpensive work lamps to create a background glow fincher avoided stylish camerawork when filming early fight scenes in basement and instead placed camera in a fixed position in later fight scenes fincher moved camera from viewpoint of a distant observer to that of fighter scenes with tyler were staged to conceal that character was a mental projection of unnamed narrator tyler was not filmed in two shots with a group of people nor was he shown in any over shoulder shots in scenes where tyler gives narrator specific ideas to manipulate him in scenes before narrator meets tyler filmmakers inserted tyler s presence in single frames for subliminal effect tyler appears in background and out of focus like a little devil on shoulder fincher explained subliminal frames our hero is creating tyler durden in his own mind so at this point he exists only on periphery of narrator s consciousness while cronenweth generally rated and exposed kodak film stock normally on fight club several other techniques were applied to change its appearance flashing was implemented on much of exterior night photography contrast was stretched to be purposely ugly print was adjusted to be underexposed technicolor s silver retention was used on a select number of prints to increase density of blacks and high contrast print stocks were chosen to create a stepped on look on print with a dirty patina visual effects fincher hired visual effects supervisor kevin tod haug who worked for him on game to create visual effects for fight club haug assigned visual effects artists and experts to different facilities that each addressed different types of visual effects cg modeling animation compositing and scanning haug explained we selected best people for each aspect of effects work then coordinated their efforts in this way we never had to play to a facility s weakness fincher visualized narrator s perspective through a mind s eye view and structured a myopic framework for film audiences fincher also used previsualized footage of challenging main unit and visual effects shots as a problem solving tool to avoid making mistakes during actual filming thumb 250px alt blue and rough looking tendrils stretch into a vanishing point in middle tendrils on right side are visible where rest are obscured in darkness blue specks of matter float in image in front of vanishing point are words fight club opening scene in fight club that represents a brain s neural network in which thought processes are initiated by narrator s fear impulse network was mapped using an l system and drawn out by a medical illustrator film s title sequence is a 90 second visual effects composition that depicts inside of narrator s brain at a microscopic level camera pulls back to outside starting at his fear center and following thought processes initiated by his fear impulse sequence designed in part by fincher was budgeted separately from rest of film at first but sequence was awarded by studio in january 1999 fincher hired digital domain and its visual effects supervisor kevin mack who won an academy award for visual effects for 1998 film what dreams may come for sequence company mapped computer generated brain using an l system and design was detailed using renderings by medical illustrator katherine jones pullback sequence from within brain to outside of skull included neurons action potentials and a hair follicle haug explained artistic license that fincher took with shot while he wanted to keep brain passage looking like electron microscope photography that look had to be coupled with feel of a night dive wet scary and with a low depth of field shallow depth of field was accomplished with ray tracing process other visual effects include an early scene in which camera flashes past city streets to survey project mayhem s destructive equipment lying in underground parking lots sequence was a three dimensional composition of nearly 100 photographs of los angeles and century city by photographer michael douglas middleton final scene of demolition of credit card office buildings was designed by richard baily of image savant baily worked on scene for over fourteen months midway through film tyler durden points out cue mark nicknamed cigarette burn in film to audience scene represents a turning point that foreshadows coming rupture and inversion of fairly subjective reality that existed earlier in film fincher explained suddenly it s as though projectionist missed changeover viewers have to start looking at movie in a whole new way score fincher was concerned that bands experienced in writing film scores would be unable to tie themes together so he sought a band which had never recorded for film he pursued radiohead but singer thom yorke declined as he was recovering from stress of promoting their album ok computer fincher instead commissioned breakbeat producing duo dust brothers who created a post modern score encompassing drum loops electronic scratches and computerized samples dust brothers performer michael simpson explained setup fincher wanted to break new ground with everything about movie and a nontraditional score helped achieve that climax and end credits feature song where is my mind by pixies kim deal i think that last scene in fight club got where is my mind popular i don t know how people know our music now for some reason over decade we got popular release marketing filming concluded in december 1998 and fincher edited footage in early 1999 to prepare fight club for a screening with senior executives they did not receive film positively and were concerned that there would not be an audience for film executive producer art linson who supported film recalled response so many incidences of fight club were alarming no group of executives could narrow them down nevertheless fight club was originally slated to be released in july 1999 but was later changed to august 6 1999 studio further delayed film s release this time to autumn citing a crowded summer schedule and a hurried post production process outsiders attributed delays to columbine high school massacre earlier in year marketing executives at fox searchlight pictures faced difficulties in marketing fight club and at one point considered marketing it as an art film they considered that film was primarily geared toward male audiences because of its violence and believed that not even pitt would attract female filmgoers research testing showed that film appealed to teenagers fincher refused to let posters and trailers focus on pitt and encouraged studio to hire advertising firm wieden kennedy to devise a marketing plan firm proposed a bar of pink soap with title fight club embossed on it as film s main marketing image proposal was considered a bad joke by fox executives fincher also released two early trailers in form of fake public service announcements presented by pitt and norton studio did not think trailers marketed film appropriately instead studio financed a 20 million large scale campaign to provide a press junket posters billboards and trailers for tv that highlighted film s fight scenes studio advertised fight club on cable during world wrestling entertainment broadcasts which fincher protested believing that placement created wrong context for film linson believed that ill conceived one dimensional marketing by marketing executive robert harper largely contributed to fight clubs lukewarm box office performance in united states theatrical run studio held fight clubs world premiere at 56th venice international film festival on september

performance of fight club soured relationship between 20th century fox s studio head bill mechanic and media executive rupert murdoch which contributed to mechanic s resignation in june 2000 british board of film classification reviewed fight club for its november 12 1999 release in united kingdom and removed two scenes involving an indulgence in excitement of beating a defenseless man s face into a pulp board assigned film an 18 certificate limiting release to adult only audiences in uk bbfc did not censor any further considering and dismissing claims that fight club contained dangerously instructive information and could encourage anti social behavior board decided film as a whole is quite clearly critical and sharply parodic of amateur fascism which in part it portrays its central theme of male machismo and anti social behaviour that flows from it is emphatically rejected by central character in concluding reels scenes were restored in a two disc dvd edition released in uk in

hated it in equal measures some critics expressed concern that film would incite copycat behavior such as that seen after a clockwork orange debuted in britain nearly three decades previously upon film s theatrical release times reported reaction it touched a nerve in male psyche that was debated in newspapers across world although film s makers called fight club an accurate portrayal of men in 1990s some critics called it irresponsible and appalling writing for australian newspaper christopher goodwin stated fight club is shaping up to be most contentious mainstream hollywood meditation on violence since stanley kubrick s a clockwork orange janet maslin reviewing for new york times praised fincher s direction and editing of film she wrote that fight club carried a message of contemporary manhood and that if not watched closely film could be misconstrued as an endorsement of violence and nihilism roger ebert reviewing for chicago sun times called fight club visceral and hard edged but also a thrill ride masquerading as philosophy whose promising first act is followed by a second that to macho sensibilities and a third he dismissed as trickery ebert later acknowledged that film was beloved by most not by me he was later requested to have a shot by shot analysis of fight club at conference on world affairs he stated that s it over course of a week i admired its skill even more and its thought even less jay carr of boston globe opined that film began with an nervy and imaginative buzz but that it eventually became explosively silly newsweeks david ansen described fight club as an outrageous mixture of brilliant technique puerile philosophizing trenchant satire and sensory overload and thought that ending was too pretentious richard schickel of time described mise en scene as dark and damp it enforces contrast between of his characters aboveground life and their underground one water even when it s polluted is source of life blood even when it s carelessly spilled is symbol of life being fully lived to put his point simply it s better to be wet than dry schickel applauded performances of pitt and norton but criticized conventionally gimmicky unfolding and failure to make bonham carter s character interesting gary reviewed critical reception in retrospect many critics praised fight club hailing it as one of most exciting original and thought provoking films of year he wrote of negative opinion while fight club had numerous critical champions film s critical attackers were far more vocal a negative chorus which became hysterical about what they felt to be excessively graphic scenes of fisticuffs they felt such scenes served only as a mindless glamorization of brutality a morally irresponsible portrayal which they feared might encourage impressionable young male viewers to set up their own real life fight clubs in order to beat each other senseless fight club was nominated for 2000 academy award for best sound editing but
