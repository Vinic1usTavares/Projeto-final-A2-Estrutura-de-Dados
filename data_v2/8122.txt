open source operating system for amd64 i686 personal computers intended to be binary compatible with computer programs and device drivers made for windows server 2003 and later versions reactos has been noted as a potential open source drop in replacement for windows and for its information on undocumented windows apis reactos has been in development since 1996 it is still considered alpha software feature incomplete but with many windows applications already working e g adobe reader 6 0 tests for 0 4 4 on reactos org february 2017 and is therefore recommended by developers only for evaluation and testing purposes reactos is primarily written in c with some elements such as reactos file explorer written in c project partially implements windows api functionality and has been ported to amd64 processor architecture reactos as part of foss ecosystem re uses and collaborates with many other foss projects most notably wine project which presents a windows compatibility layer for unix like operating systems history mission as formerly stated on official web site early development around 1996 a group of free and open source software developers started a project called freewin95 to implement a clone of windows 95 project stalled in discussions of design of system while freewin95 had started out with high expectations there still had not been any builds released to public by end of 1997 as a result project members led by coordinator jason joined together to revive project revived project sought to duplicate functionality of windows nt in creating new project a new name reactos was chosen project began development in february 1998 by creating basis for a new nt kernel and basic drivers name reactos was coined during an irc chat while term os stood for operating system term react referred to group s dissatisfaction with and reaction to microsoft s monopolistic position in 2002 reactos foundation was established in moscow with maxim osowski and aleksey bragin as executive officers and vladimir bragin and alexey ivanov in board of directors in 2015 foundation was liquidated ekush os fork in 2004 a copyright license violation of reactos gpl code and other foss code was found when someone distributed a reactos fork under name ekush os web page later disappeared internal audit in order to avoid copyright prosecution reactos had to be expressly completely distinct and non derivative from windows a goal that needed very careful work a claim was made on 17 january 2006 by now former developer hartmut birr on reactos developers mailing list ros dev that reactos contained code derived from disassembling microsoft windows code that birr disputed involved function badstack in s as well as other unspecified items comparing this function to disassembled binaries from windows xp birr argued that badstack function was simply copy pasted from windows xp given that they were identical alex ionescu author of code asserted that while windows xp binary in question was indeed disassembled and studied code was not merely copy pasted but reimplemented reason why functions were identical ionescu claimed was because there was only one possible way to implement function on 27 january 2006 developers responsible for maintaining reactos code repository disabled access after a meeting was held to discuss allegations when approached by microsoft declined to comment on incident since reactos is a free and open source software development project claim triggered a negative reaction by free software community in particular wine barred several inactive developers from providing contributions and formal high level cooperation between two projects remained difficult contributions from several active reactos developers have been accepted post audit and low level cooperation for bug fixes has been still occurring in a statement on its web site reactos cited differing legal definitions of what constitutes clean room reverse engineering as a cause for conflict reset reboot restart legal issues and long road to 0 3 on reactos org by steven edwards 27 january 2006 some countries including united states require that a based on disassembled code must be written by someone other than person having disassembled and examined original code whereas other countries allow both tasks to be performed by same individual consequently reactos clarified that its intellectual property policy statement requirements on clean room reverse engineering conform to united states law an internal source code audit was conducted to ensure that only clean room reverse engineering was used and all developers were made to sign an agreement committing them to comply with project s policies on reverse engineering contributors to its development were not affected by these events and all access to software development tools was restored shortly afterward in september 2007 with audit nearing completion audit status was removed from reactos homepage though audit was completed specific details were not made public as it was only an internal effort to ensure compliance with project s own policies much of assembly code that was allegedly copied has also been replaced as a natural progression in reactos development by developers having reimplemented functionality in c for portability reasons also 2004 leaked windows source code may be stolen on pc world by joris evers february 2004 was not seen as legal risk for reactos as trade secret was considered indefensible in court due to broad spread reset reboot restart legal issues and long road to 0 3 now as for issue of leaked source code i want to try to put all fears to rest we don t know what legal ramifications are for someone downloading and having leaked code as party that maintains copyright ownership of that code might still try to claim trade secrecy on information contained in sources in a court of law it is our point of view that source code leaks of windows have been spread to a broad enough audience that it would be impossible to claim product is still under trade secrecy on reactos org by steven edwards 27 january 2006 google summer of code

development reactos is primarily written in c with some elements such as reactos explorer and sound stack written in c project compiles using both mingw and microsoft visual studio and contributes to development of build systems used through submission of patches to its components developers aim to make kernel and application programming interface api more compatible with windows nt version 5 2 windows server 2003 and to add support for more applications and hardware with plans to target newer versions of windows as development matures directx support is undertaken through an in house implementation 2d hardware accelerated rendering is done natively while other drawing functionality is redirected to opengl as a stopgap solution development progress is influenced by size of development team and level of experience among them as an estimate of effort required to implement windows 7 microsoft employed 1 000 or so developers organized into 25 teams with each team averaging 40 developers in reactos entry in page followed through very large active development team link lists 33 developers who have contributed over a 12 month period and a cumulative total of 104 present and former users who have contributed code to project via apache subversion since its inception in his presentation at 2009 in milan reactos developer michele c noted that most of developers learn about windows architecture while working on reactos and have no prior knowledge while reactos targets currently mainly x86 amd64 pc platform an effort to port to arm architecture was at one point under way while it did not produce much functionality and was abandoned https www reactos org wiki reactos ports support for xbox a variant ia 32 architecture was added through use of an architecture specific hal although this along with a port to powerpc are no longer actively maintained it is worth noting that improved 64 bit support for reactos is being worked on however development seems to be going slowly collaboration and reuse while reactos has aim to build a windows compatible kernel as open source software much of surrounding required functionality to create a complete os is already available in greater open source ecosystem when available and possible reactos therefore builds on and collaborates with already existing open source projects conversely projects like wine and formerly captive ntfs read write filesystem for linux on osnews by eugenia loli they are using wine and reactos code to emulate parts of windows environment needed to make driver work 4 december 2003 and longene re use open source reactos code base as well linux unified kernel 0 2 4 1 luk project does not develop windows and linux userland libraries those libraries are offered by wine or microsoft windows reactos project and linux project hardware driver stack on hardware driver side for instance uniata project provides serial ata drivers for reactos project has also experimented with using library in its rewrite of its fat file system reactos makes use of usb stack from haiku both as a reference and as a foundation for its usb support reactos gets usb stack with haiku s help on osnews by thom holwerda mesa 3d provides opengl rendering networking reactos s network stack is built on tcp portion of s port of network stack in freebsd along with an internally developed implementation for packet oriented protocols like ip later lwip was integrated into reactos network stack windows network services like sam and print spooling are already available as open source alternative by samba samba tng project a fork of is used as an implementation of a client software for microsoft s proprietary remote desktop protocol wine cooperation thumb 300px a simplified architecture diagram of reactos with wine dependencies indicated by wine logo white boxes denote third party binary software green boxes are userland components red are kernel components reactos and wine projects share goal to run binary windows software natively and can therefore share many dependencies and development reactos uses portions of wine project so that it can benefit from wine s progress in implementing win32 api while wine s user32 gdi32 and components cannot be used directly by reactos due to architectural differences code snippets of them and other parts can be shared between both projects kernel is developed by reactos separately as wine relies here on existing unix like kernels separately experimental arwinss branch was created as an alternative means to improve user32 and gdi32 support through an alternative implementation of win32 api whereas reactos s original win32 subsystem was closely modeled after its equivalent in windows arwinss combines architecture of that subsystem with corresponding implementation in wine to this end arwinss uses wine s gdi32 and user32 libraries with few changes to take fuller advantage of wine s existing software compatibility arwinss also allows user to optionally use a remote x server instead of a local display other tango desktop project initiative provides open source design guidelines and resources as icons for applications on desktop environments is an open source software development library used to render text on to bitmaps and provides support for other font related operations kernelex project is a windows api extension and

various people have acknowledged reactos and implications of having a viable open source drop in replacement for windows a 2004 article and interview of german weekly magazine der spiegel describes reactos as directed at windows users who want to renounce use of proprietary commercial software without having to switch to linux distrowatch a linux distribution s monitoring web site also lists reactos and describes it as a free and open source operating system based on best design principles found in windows nt architecture reactos on distrowatch com reactos is a free and open source operating system based on best design principles found in windows nt architecture accessed january 2016 in his column for free software magazine david sugar noted in 2006 that reactos would allow use of applications depending on older versions of windows whose apis have been deprecated he also recognized its potential to expand total deployed base of free software and as a resource for developers wanting to know undocumented windows apis in course of writing portable applications pc magazine columnist john c dvorak remarked in 2008 that windows nt architecture had remained largely unchanged making it an ideal candidate for cloning and believed that reactos could be a bigger threat than linux to microsoft s dominance in response to dvorak s column zdnet technology journalist dana noted in 2008 that a lack of corporate sponsors and partners had rendered project harmless to microsoft echoing this thom holwerda of osnews in 2009 categorized reactos under a family of hobby operating systems maintained only by small groups of developers working in their spare time lacking financial support of more mainstream operating systems and legacy of formerly mainstream ones such as risc os in october 2015 a network world review of reactos v0 3 17 noted it s just like running windows 2000 and praised application package manager a feature original windows is missing jesse smith from distrowatch weekly reviewed reactos v0 4 9 and noted that reactos ultimately had a similar problem limited hardware support and is not yet a stable operating system awards reactos project won on
