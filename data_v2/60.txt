syndrome and lives in a residential home for people with disabilities in end glee club performs proud mary staging entire routine in wheelchairs in support of artie production kevin mchale deemed wheels most serious episode of glee so far he enjoyed artie s character development in episode explaining that when he was cast in role he did not know artie s background and thus made up his own backstory for him he believed that artie became paralysed later in life rather than being born that way which was proven correct in wheels of burgeoning romance between artie and tina mchale opined i think tina and artie will be together i think they will be a couple for a long time he explained that from beginning of show s production creator ryan murphy expressed belief that artie and tina should be together and so he and jenna ushkowitz deliberately sat close to one another during filming assuming that it would eventually happen mchale was shocked by artie s reaction to tina s faked stutter and was initially unsure why he was being so dramatic he concluded however i really think artie fell for tina because they were set apart by their disabilities they re already kind of outcasts being in glee but within that group they shared a connection so he based their whole relationship on that and when it went away artie didn t know what to do mchale and ushkowitz hope that their characters will ultimately become a couple as they are best friends in real life murphy called wheels turning point for show he elaborated certainly after this it remains a comedy and it s fun but writing this made me feel responsibility of showing truth of pain that outcasts go through it s not all razzle dazzle show business it s tough and it s painful and it was for me growing up and it is for most people murphy commented that episode caused him to realize that as well as highlighting fun and glamour of glee clubs it is also occasionally really great to show underbelly of what people who are different feel recurring characters who appear in episode are kurt s father burt hummel o malley glee club members brittany heather morris santana lopez naya rivera mike chang harry shum jr and matt rutherford dijon talton school reporter jacob ben israel josh sussman principal figgins theba and former glee club director sandy ryerson stephen tobolowsky wheels guest stars cheryl francis harrington and jeff lewis as a nurse and manager at a local residential facility and also introduces two characters with down syndrome robin trocki as sue s sister jean sylvester and lauren potter as becky jackson a sophomore at william mckinley high school potter is a member of down s syndrome association of los angeles and was contacted about auditioning through association s in house talent agency hearts and hands fourteen actresses auditioned for role which potter deemed a great experience to perform music and choreography thumb right defying gravity storyline was based on a high school experience of chris colfer episode features cover versions of nouvelle vague rendition of dancing with myself defying gravity from wicked and ike tina turner rendition of proud mary glee cast versions of songs including both michele and colfer s solo performances of defying gravity were all released as singles available for digital download while proud mary and dancing with myself did not chart defying gravity reached number 58 in australia 38 in canada and 31 in america a duet version of defying gravity appeared on soundtrack album glee music volume 1 murphy selected defying gravity for episode after colfer relayed a story from his own high school days whereby his drama teacher refused to let him sing song because of his sex murphy explained i found a way to write it into show because that s in a nutshell what this show is about someone being told that they can t do something because of what perception of them is as opposed to what their real ability is colfer stated that opportunity to finally sing song really meant world to him and that it s absolutely terrifying to watch yourself do something you ve dreamed about for such a long time i know i m definitely not best singer but i think message story behind song about defying limits and borders placed by others hopefully all that gets across with performance although i do some very things in song it s probably one of most honest and close to heart scenes i ve ever filmed or performed for that matter dancing with myself is mchale s first solo performance on show murphy commented that performance is artie s chance to break away from being misunderstood by everyone and express himself explaining that although artie is usually a very secure guy who does not care about others opinions of him wheels sees his friends take his disability for granted so this performance is all about him saying look this is who i am and this is who i want to be mchale has stated that performing as artie has made him more aware of challenges that people with disabilities face it s a completely different side of life more than ever i realize how grateful i am to be able to get up between each take and walk around i m glad that i can represent that kind of life on television so millions of people see it every week and whole point of it is to show that artie can still do everything everyone else can that matters glee choreographer zach woodlee described proud mary as scariest number produced to date citing concerns with choreographing an entire routine in wheelchairs and problems building correct staging woodlee explained stage ramps were initially built too steeply preventing actors from ascending them in wheelchairs and that actors experienced problems learning to distribute their weight correctly flipping wheelchairs over backwards it was like roller derby all of actors would fall backwards and hit their heads particularly lea michele you lose your balance really quick when you try to go up a ramp in a wheelchair amber riley caught an edge going down a ramp and fell off completely there were pile ups there were crashes basically everything that could go wrong did murphy specified to woodlee that cast members should not be able to leave their wheelchairs during number as artie doesn t get to get up ever so i didn t want anyone to get up woodlee agreed if it looked too fun and easy it wouldn t read right ryan really wanted people to understand what artie deals with reception thumb left casting of kevin mchale an able bodied actor as a character who uses a wheelchair drew criticism from a committee of performers with disabilities wheels was watched by 7 35 million us viewers and attained a 3 3 8 rating share in 18 49 demographic it was twenty second most watched show

episode was honored at 2010 television academy honors for exemplifying television with a conscience academy of television arts sciences called it a dynamic episode which paint s a portrait of how we treat others and how we can do it better critical reaction episode attracted criticism from a committee of performers with disabilities who felt that casting an able bodied actor to play a disabled student was inappropriate csi star robert david hall commented i think there s a fear of litigation that a person with disabilities might slow a production down fear that viewers might be uncomfortable glee executive producer brad falchuk responded that while he understood concern and frustration of disability advocates mchale had singing and acting ability and charisma required for role and it s hard to say no to someone that talented mchale has stated that he is pleased to represent a character in a wheelchair and that i think what s great about it is just because he s in a wheelchair he can still do what everyone else does kristin dos santos of e online refuted criticism of episode opining that wheels is all about empowering people with disabilities and sends out an uplifting message to disabled community gerrick kennedy of los angeles times expressed a similar sentiment stating here we have an episode bluntly addressing complexities of disability and doing so with so much respect and dignity and there are complaints about artie not being wheelchair bound in real life on guys tim stack for entertainment weekly called wheels a great great episode stating that it made him cry several times mtv s aly semigran also commented that episode brought her to tears suggesting that lynch s performance was emmy worthy and deeming wheels a truly standout hour of tv raymund flandez of wall street journal reviewed episode positively calling artie s rendition of dancing with myself catchy and upbeat and praising rachel s defying gravity audition which he wrote leaves us wanting for more kennedy described episode as sheer perfection and james poniewozik of time made pun glee always been a pleasure but if it raises its storytelling ambitions this way it can really defy gravity alan sepinwall of star ledger wrote that while he generally finds glee to be a show with a serious identity crisis he did not dislike wheels as much as previous episodes sepinwall wrote that while glee can be broad and in your face and self congratulatory this episode was much more human scaled and much more interesting maureen ryan of chicago tribune similarly commented that while other episodes of glee lack coherence and narrative drive wheels did not have this problem describing it as a case study of what glee does right and deeming artie and kurt s storylines provocative and thoughtfully handled mike hale of new york times felt that episode was problematic he thought that having kurt sabotage his own audition sent out a mixed message and believed that actress lauren potter was used as a prop in continuing humanization of sue sylvester hale wrote that storyline felt smarmy and artificial though praised lynch for making scene with sue s sister warm and real entertainment weekly dan snierson felt that revelation about sue s sister was a little manipulative though wrote that he didn t care in that glorious moment he hoped that glee writers would not humanize sue too often however fearing that she would lose her dictatorial swagger eric goldman for ign rated episode 7 5 10 commenting i really hope that episode was about getting a lot of issue storylines out of way all at once because that was a lot of overkill he felt that although episode contained usual strong humor warm character moments and catchy musical performances overall it felt
