stein p 177 critically all that glitters was negatively received and a ratings disappointment across syndicated television stations production all that glitters was series creator norman lear s attempt to duplicate his success with syndicated soap opera spoof mary hartman mary hartman lear described premise simply god created eve first took out her rib and gave her a companion so she wouldn t be lonely lear came up with idea on a trip to washington d c i had visited institute of policy studies and i just loved whole thing and i thought there was a series in it a five times a week series i went to bed thinking about that and i woke up next morning thinking what would happen if male female equation were changed what would happen if women had all power and all advantage and men had what women normally would have world of all that glitters had always been female dominated but lear also used series to comment on changing sex roles in united states in 1970s former major league baseball player wes parker almost literally walked into his role he was doing play by play reporting for a los angeles television station owned by lear s partner jerry perenchio lear casually asked if i d be interested in part i said yes but knew it was out of question because in real life things don t happen that way nobody walks in and gets on a norman lear show i read for part got it and didn t sleep at all that night linda gray was somewhat non upon being offered role of transgender linda murkland i remember meeting norman and him saying you ll be perfect for role i didn t know whether to take that as a compliment or what to prepare for her role linda gray asked lear to arrange for her to meet with a transgender woman gray met with her for several hours prior to beginning of filming and on a couple of occasions during production lois nettleton reportedly based her characterization of christina stockwood on clark gable production started in early march 1977 with director herbert in test screenings prior to its premiere reaction to show was sharply divided according to executive producer stephanie sills strongest negative reaction came from male executives they didn t mind being portrayed by women it was simply that they detest way we depicted them feminists were uncertain how to react to series with some being concerned that audiences would not perceive show as satire but as an attempt to represent how a female dominated society would actually operate lear marketed program through his company tat syndication television radio age p 38 series ran five nights a week cast

reviewer going so far as to call show s theme song blasphemous for suggesting that god was female and created eve first time magazine sharply criticized series calling it embarrassingly amateurish with flaccid and wearying jokes flat writing mediocre acting and aimless direction wall street journal concurred saying that while series role reversal premise may have been adequate for a play or film it was too limiting to serve as basis for a continuing series these limitations showed up most clearly journal says in lead performances although praising performers themselves as talented they are cited for being unable to infuse much life into their roles journal pegs fundamental problem with all that glitters as that its characters are not people at all merely composites of least attractive characteristics of each sex satire focuses not on way real recognizable people behave but on stereotypes and cliches about masculine and feminine attitudes even when stood on their heads they still remain stereotypes and cliches new times magazine was much more receptive to series although labeling it unquestionably weirdest show that lear has ever produced new times found that series was not a satire of mannerisms but of attitudes all that glitters required that viewers watch closely to pick up on subtleties and nuances not so much for what show says but for way that it s said all

of antagonizing sponsors or viewers hilliard p 43 in years since series it has garnered something of a positive reputation with one critic listing it and other lear efforts as imaginative shows that contained some of most striking satires of television and american society ever broadcast kellner p 59 while show itself was unsuccessful it did spawn a hit song you don t bring me flowers which had
