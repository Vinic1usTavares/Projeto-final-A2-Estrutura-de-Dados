alnus glutinosa common alder black alder european alder or just alder is a species of tree in family betulaceae native to most of europe southwest asia and northern africa it thrives in wet locations where its association with bacterium frankia alni enables it to grow in poor quality soils it is a medium size short lived tree growing to a height of up to 30 metres 100 ft it has short stalked rounded leaves and separate male and female flower in form of catkins small rounded fruits are cone like and seeds are dispersed by wind and water common alder provides food and shelter to wildlife with a number of insects lichens and fungi being completely dependent on tree it is a pioneer species colonising vacant land and forming mixed forests as other trees appear in its wake eventually common alder dies out of woodlands because seedlings need more light than is available on forest floor its more usual habitat is forest edges swamps and riverside corridors timber has been used in underwater foundations and for manufacture into paper and fibreboard for smoking foods for joinery turnery and carving products of tree have been used in ethnobotany providing folk remedies for various ailments and research has shown that extracts of seeds are active against pathogenic bacteria in midwest alnus glutinosa is an invasive terrestrial plant soon to be legally banned in indiana description thumb 240px foliage 240px thumb male inflorescence left and mature cone like flowers right alnus glutinosa is a tree that thrives in moist soils and grows under favourable circumstances to a height of and exceptionally up to young trees have an upright habit of growth with a main axial stem but older trees develop an arched crown with crooked branches base of trunk produces adventitious roots which grow down to soil and may appear to be propping trunk up bark of young trees is smooth glossy and greenish brown while in older trees it is dark grey and fissured branches are smooth and somewhat sticky being scattered with resinous warts buds are purplish brown and have short stalks both male and female catkins form in autumn and remain dormant during winter leaves of common alder are short stalked rounded up to long with a slightly wedge shaped base and a wavy serrated margin they have a glossy dark green upper surface and paler green underside with rusty brown hairs in angles of veins as with some other trees growing near water common alder keeps its leaves longer than do trees in drier situations and leaves remain green late into autumn as latin name glutinosa implies buds and young leaves are sticky with a resinous gum flora of nw europe alnus glutinosa species is monoecious and flowers are wind pollinated slender cylindrical male catkins are pendulous reddish in colour and long female flowers are upright broad and green with short stalks during autumn they become dark brown to black in colour hard somewhat woody and superficially similar to small conifer cones they last through winter and small winged seeds are mostly scattered following spring seeds are flattened reddish brown nuts edged with webbing filled with pockets of air this enables them to float for about a month which allows seed to disperse widely unlike some other species of tree common alders do not produce shade leaves respiration rate of shaded foliage is same as well lit leaves but rate of assimilation is lower this means that as a tree in woodland grows taller lower branches die and soon decay leaving a small crown and unbranched trunk taxonomy alnus glutinosa was first described by carl linnaeus in 1753 as one of two varieties of alder other being a incana which he regarded as a single species betula alnus in 1785 jean baptiste lamarck treated it as a full species under name betula glutinosa its present scientific name is due to joseph gaertner who in 1791 accepted separation of alders from birches and transferred species to alnus epithet glutinosa means sticky referring particularly to young shoots within genus alnus common alder is placed in subgenus alnus as part of a closely related group of species including grey alder alnus incana with which it hybridizes to form hybrid a x distribution and habitat common alder is native to almost whole of continental europe except for both extreme north and south as well as united kingdom and ireland in asia its range includes turkey iran and kazakhstan and in africa it is found in tunisia algeria and morocco it is naturalised in azores it has been introduced either by accident or by intent to canada united states chile south africa australia and new zealand its natural habitat is in moist ground near rivers ponds and lakes but it can also grow in drier locations and sometimes occurs in mixed woodland and on forest edges it tolerates a range of soil types and grows best at a ph of between 5 5 and 7 2 because of its association with nitrogen fixing bacterium frankia alni it can grow in nutrient poor soils where few other trees thrive ecological relationships thumb nodules on roots caused by bacterium frankia alni thumb galls on leaves caused by mite eriophyes inangulis common alder is most noted for its symbiotic relationship with bacterium frankia alni which forms nodules on tree s roots this bacterium absorbs nitrogen from air and fixes it in a form available to tree in return bacterium receives carbon products produced by tree through photosynthesis this relationship which improves fertility of soil has established common alder as an important pioneer species in ecological succession common alder is susceptible to phytophthora alni a recently evolved species of oomycete plant pathogen probably of hybrid origin this is causal agent of phytophthora disease of alder which is causing extensive mortality of trees in some parts of europe phytophthora disease of alder symptoms of this infection include death of roots and of patches of bark dark spots near base of trunk yellowing of leaves and in subsequent years death of branches and sometimes whole tree taphrina alni is a fungal plant pathogen that causes alder tongue gall a chemically induced distortion of female catkins gall develops on maturing fruits and produces spores which are carried by wind to other trees this gall is believed to be harmless to tree ellis hewett a 2001 vol 16 no 1 p 24 another also harmless gall is caused by a midge eriophyes inangulis which sucks sap from leaves forming pustules common alder is important to wildlife all year round and seeds are a useful winter food for birds deer sheep hares and rabbits feed on tree and it provides shelter for livestock in winter it shades water of rivers and streams moderating water temperature and this benefits fish which also find safety among its exposed roots in times of flood common alder is of larvae of a number of different butterflies and moths and is associated with over 140 species of plant eating insect tree is also a host to a variety of mosses and lichens which particularly flourish in humid moist environment of streamside trees some common lichens found growing on trunk and branches include tree lungwort lobaria pulmonaria and last of which is restricted to alders some 47 species of mycorrhizal fungi have been found growing in symbiosis with common alder both partners benefiting from an exchange of nutrients as well as several species of these symbionts include russula lactarius and lactarius and alder roll rim paxillus all of which grow nowhere else except in association with alders in spring catkin cup grows on fallen alder catkins as an introduced species common alder can affect ecology of its new locality it is a fast growing tree and can quickly form dense woods where little light reaches ground and this may inhibit growth of native plants presence of nitrogen fixing bacteria and annual accumulation of leaf litter from trees also alters nutrient status of soil it also increases availability of phosphorus in ground and tree s dense network of roots can cause increased sedimentation in pools and waterways it spreads easily by wind borne seed may be dispersed to a certain extent by birds and woody fruits can float away from parent tree when tree is felled regrowth occurs from stump and logs and fallen branches can take root a glutinosa is classed as an environmental weed in new zealand cultivation and uses thumb and common alder is used as a pioneer species and to stabilise river banks to assist in flood control to purify water in waterlogged soils and to moderate temperature and nutrient status of water bodies it can be grown by itself or in mixed species plantations and nitrogen rich leaves falling to ground enrich soil and increase production of such trees as walnut douglas fir and poplar on poor quality soils although tree can live for up to 160 years it is best felled for timber at 60 to 70 years before heart rot sets in on marshy ground it is important as coppice wood being cut near base to encourage production of straight poles it is capable of enduring clipping as well as marine climatic conditions and may be cultivated as a fast growing windbreak in woodland natural regeneration is not possible as seeds need sufficient nutrients water and light to germinate such conditions are rarely found at forest floor and as forest matures alder trees in it die out species is cultivated as a specimen tree in parks and gardens and cultivar imperialis has gained royal horticultural society s award of garden merit timber wood is soft white when first cut turning to pale red knots are attractively mottled timber is not used where strength is required in construction industry but is used for paper making manufacture of fibreboard and production of energy under water wood is very durable and is used for deep foundations of buildings piles beneath rialto in venice and foundations of several medieval cathedrals are made of alder roman architect vitruvius mentioned that timber was used in construction of causeways across ravenna marshes wood is used in joinery both as solid timber and as veneer where its grain and colour are appreciated and it takes dye well as wood is soft flexible and somewhat light it can be easily worked as well as split it is valued in turnery and carving in making furniture window frames clogs toys blocks pencils and bowls tanning and dyeing bark of common alder has long been used in tanning and dyeing bark and twigs contain 16 to 20 tannic acid but their usefulness in tanning is limited by strong accompanying colour they produce depending on mordant and methods used various shades of brown fawn and yellowish orange hues can be imparted to wool cotton and silk alder bark can also be used with iron sulphate to create a black dye which can substitute for use of or galls are said to chew bark and use their saliva to dye leather shoots of common alder produce a yellowish or cinnamon coloured dye if cut early in year other parts of tree are also used in dyeing catkins can yield a green colour and fresh cut wood a pinkish fawn colour other uses it is also traditional wood that is burnt to produce smoked fish and other smoked foods though in some areas other woods are now more often used it supplies high quality charcoal leaves of this tree are sticky and if they are spread on floor of a room their adhesive surface is said to trap fleas chemical constituents of alnus glutinosa include 3 4 hydroxyphenyl l b d and acid 2 3 acid health pollen from common alder along with that from birch and hazel is one of main sources of tree pollen allergy as pollen is often present in atmosphere at same time as that of birch hazel hornbeam and oak and they have similar physicochemical properties it is difficult to separate out their individual effects in central europe these tree are second most common cause of allergic conditions after grass pollen bark of common alder has traditionally been used as an astringent a cathartic a a a tonic and a restorative a substance able to restore normal health a decoction of bark has been used to treat swelling inflammation and rheumatism as an emetic and to treat pharyngitis and sore throat ground up bark has been used as an ingredient in toothpaste and inner bark can be boiled in vinegar to provide a skin wash for treating dermatitis lice and leaves have been used to reduce breast discomfort in nursing mothers and folk remedies advocate use of leaves against various forms of cancer alpine farmers are said to use leaves to alleviate rheumatism by placing a heated bag full of leaves on affected areas alder leaves are consumed by cows sheep goats and horses though pigs refuse to eat them according to some people consumption of alder leaves causes blackening of tongue and is harmful to horses in a research study extracts from seeds of common alder have been found to be active against all eight pathogenic bacteria against which they were tested which included escherichia coli and resistant staphylococcus aureus mrsa only extract to have significant antioxidant activity was that extracted in methanol all extracts were of low toxicity to brine shrimps these results suggest that seeds could be further investigated for use in development of possible anti mrsa drugs details of alder structure and
