tracks along tenth and eleventh avenues on manhattan s west side street level tracks were used by new york central railroad s freight trains which shipped commodities such as coal dairy products and beef for safety railroad hired west side cowboys men who rode horses and waved flags in front of trains however so many accidents occurred between freight trains and other traffic that nickname death avenue was given to tenth and eleventh avenues in 1910 one organization estimated that there had been 548 deaths and 1 574 injuries over years along eleventh avenue public debate about hazard began during early 1900s in 1929 city state and new york central agreed on west side improvement project conceived by robert moses project eliminated 105 street level railroad crossings and added to riverside park it also included construction of west side elevated highway it cost more than 150 million worth about billion in dollars last stretch of street level track was removed from eleventh avenue in 1941 first train on high line viaduct part of new york central s west side line ran along structure in 1933 elevated structure was dedicated on june 29 1934 and was first part of west side improvement project to be completed high line which originally ran from 35th street to newly constructed st john s park terminal at spring street was designed to go through center of blocks rather than over an avenue as a result viaduct s construction necessitated demolition of 640 buildings it connected directly to factories and warehouses allowing trains to load and unload inside buildings milk meat produce and raw and manufactured goods could be transported and unloaded without disturbing street traffic this reduced load on bell laboratories building which has housed westbeth artists

around 1960 southernmost section of line was demolished both due to low use and so west village apartments could be built on part of former segment s right of way this section began at bank street and ran down washington street to spring street just north of canal street by 1978 high line viaduct was used to deliver just two carloads of cargo per week viaduct was shut down in 1980 when owner conrail had to disconnect viaduct from rest of national rail system for a year closure was necessitated as a result of construction of javits center at 34th street which required that curve at 35th street be rebuilt last train on viaduct was a three car consist carrying frozen turkeys during time viaduct was disconnected two large customers along route moved to new jersey curve to viaduct from 35th street was demolished during construction of javits center and was replaced by current curve at 34th street tracks leading to high line were reconnected in 1981 but as there were no more customers along route curve at 34th street was never completed and viaduct did not see any further usage at this point conrail still owned right of way and tracks during mid 1980s a group of property owners with land under line lobbied for demolition of entire structure peter obletz a chelsea resident activist and railroad enthusiast challenged demolition efforts in court and tried to re establish rail service on line obletz offered to buy viaduct for 10 in order to run a small amount of freight trains on line and conrail accepted mainly because demolition would have cost 5 million however this offer was also disputed in court by 1988 metropolitan transportation authority was negotiating with conrail for possibility for using line s right of way to construct a light rail route these negotiations did not proceed further and by end of 1980s it was expected that high line would be demolished as part of construction of empire connection to penn station which opened in spring 1991 west side line tracks north of 35th street were routed to new empire connection tunnel to penn station a small section of high line in west village from bank to gansevoort streets was taken apart in 1991 despite objections by preservationists though remains of riveted steel elevated structure was unused and in disrepair during 1990s it remained structurally sound around this time it became known to urban explorers and local residents for tough drought tolerant wild grasses shrubs such as sumac and rugged trees which had sprung up in gravel along abandoned railway administration of mayor rudy giuliani planned to demolish structure repurposing proposal a nonprofit organization called friends of high line was formed in 1999 by joshua david and robert hammond who lived in surrounding area

2009 more than 30 projects were planned or under construction nearby and by 2016 more than 11 projects were under construction it has also helped raise value of properties directly adjacent to high line by an average of 10 percent over properties a few blocks away at least 20 properties abutting high line have sold for at least 10 million since park s opening in 2009 with an apartment in a building directly adjacent to park selling for an average of 6 million apartments located near phase 1 of high line are on average more than twice as costly as those between seventh and eighth avenues

written summonses for infractions of park rules such as walking dogs or riding bicycles on walkway at a lower rate than in central park park advocates attributed this to visibility of high line from
