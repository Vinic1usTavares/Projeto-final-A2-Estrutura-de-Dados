spacechem is an indie puzzle game developed by zachtronics industries based on principles of automation and chemical bonding in game player is tasked to produce one or more specific chemical molecules via an assembly line by programming two remote manipulators called waldos in game that interact with atoms and molecules through a visual programming language spacechem was developer s first foray into a commercial title after a number of free flash based browser games that feature similar puzzle based assembly problems game was initially released for microsoft windows at start of 2011 via zachtronics own website though it was initially rejected for sale on steam platform valve later offered to sell game after it received high praise from game journalists further attention came from game s release alongside one of humble indie bundles game has since been ported to other computing platforms and mobile devices reviewers found game s open ended problem solving nature as a highlight of title spacechem was incorporated into some academic institutions for teaching concepts related to both chemistry and programming gameplay thumb left a spacechem program requiring player to make titanium oxide and zinc oxide using titanium zinc and oxygen and deliver completed molecules to appropriate quadrant on right in spacechem player takes role of a spacechem reactor engineer whose task is to create circuits through which atoms and molecules flow with aid of waldos to produce particular batches of chemical shipments for each level primary game mode of spacechem depicts internal workings of a reactor mapped out to a 10 x 8 regular grid each reactor has up to two input and up to two output quadrants and supports two waldos red and blue manipulated through command icons placed on grid player adds commands from an array to direct each waldo independently through grid commands direct movement of waldo to pick up rotate and drop atoms and molecules and to trigger reactor events such as chemical bond formation two waldos can also be synchronized forcing one to wait for other to reach a synchronization command reactors may support specific nodes set by player that act where atomic bonds can be made or broken where atoms can undergo fission or fusion or where logic decisions based on atom type can be made as such player is challenged to create a visual program to accept given inputs disassemble and reassemble them as necessary and deliver them to target output areas to match required product product molecule does not need to match orientation or specific layout of molecules as long as molecule is topologically equivalent with respect to atoms bonds and bond types however in larger puzzles these factors will influence inputs to downstream reactors while two waldos can cross over each other without harm collision of atoms with one another or with walls of reactor is not allowed such collisions stop program and force player to re evaluate their solution similarly if a waldo delivers wrong product player will need to check their program player successfully completes each puzzle by constructing a program capable of repeatedly generating required output meeting a certain quota in larger puzzles player can also guide formation of chemicals through multiple reactors which they place out on a larger rectangular grid representing planet s surface from here output from one reactor will become input for another reactor player is often free to determine what intermediate products to produce to send to next reactor player must not only program individual reactors often limited in functionality such as one that can only break bonds but not form them but plan out location and order of reactors to make final product game s puzzles are divided into groups set on different planets players generally must complete each puzzle in order to progress to next one but game includes optional harder puzzles final boss levels called out as defense levels complete each planet here player must efficiently create chemicals and deliver them in a timely manner once reactor systems have been started to trigger defense systems to ward off attacking enemies before they destroy a control structure upon completion of each puzzle player s performance is compared on a leaderboard based on number of instructions placed in their reactors number of cycles it took to meet quota and number of reactors required to meet solution player also has an option to upload videos of their solution to youtube player once having cleared a puzzle can return to previous puzzles to try to improve their solution by reducing number of instructions cycles taken or reactors used spacechem supports downloadable content created by developers themselves and user submitted puzzles through its researchnet service a later addition included an open ended sandbox mode where players could simply explore game s capabilities development thumb right barth was inspired by derelict gasworks at seattle s gas works park in creation of spacechem prior to spacechem zach barth designer behind zachtronics industries had created several flash based browser games with automation puzzles including codex of alchemical engineering where player had to place and program manipulator arms to construct atoms and molecules following rules of alchemy barth had wanted to expand ideas in codex to include more realistic aspects of chemistry such as more complex molecules but did not pursue idea immediately afterwards about a year after completing codex barth was inspired by disused chemical plant at gas works park in seattle giving him idea to incorporate pipelines into basic mechanics of molecule building from codex spacechem took about a year with a team of seven people from around globe to create barth was responsible for design and production collin arnold and keith holman handled programming ryan sumo created visuals evan le ny music ken bowen sound and hillary field created game s narrative development costs were around 4 000 with team working on game during their spare time on weekends barth considered this a risk cutting measure if game did not succeed team still had their full time jobs they could continue team used c language built on mono framework for game which would allow for easy porting to other platforms beyond microsoft windows initially they had considered using microsoft xna for ease of porting to xbox 360 but later opted to consider other release platforms requiring them to switch to more portable mono framework in designing puzzles barth wanted to keep puzzles open ended allowing player to come to a solution without funneling them in a specific direction team designed puzzles based on general chemistry concepts without envisioning specific solution that player would take they brainstormed a number of puzzles and then eliminated those with similar solutions and arranged others into a reasonable learning curve for game despite this barth reflected that tutorials provided to explain game s mechanics had mixed responses from some players who took up concept easily to others that remained baffled as to puzzle s goal even when instructions were set out step by step in some cases barth discovered that players made assumptions on limitations of game from these tutorials such as idea that red and blue waldos must remain in separate halves of screen based on feedback that players had made on sites that hosted his previous flash based games barth designed global based to allow players to check their solution without feeling overwhelmed by top players as would be normally listed on a leaderboard he also devised means of sharing solutions through youtube videos due to similar comments and discussions on previous games barth had envisioned game as his first commercial project and based on feedback from codex and other games wanted to include a storyline along with puzzles story missions included defense puzzles that typically were considered very hard to solve barth recognized after release that players would stall out at these puzzles and not attempt to complete game with only 2 of players tracked having reached final puzzle barth would have likely placed harder puzzles at end or as part of researchnet add on he also tried too much to incorporate a theme based on scientific research popularized at time by success of portal he instead found potential players were scared off by chemistry aspect even though game had little connection to real chemistry a colleague had once suggested to barth that if game was named and modeled around alchemy game would have sold twice as many copies spacechem was released on january 1 2011 via digital download from zachtronics website for microsoft windows mac os x and linux computers they had initially sought to get approval from valve to sell game through steam but valve refused them and thus opted for sale from their own website shortly after its release game received several positive reviews including one from quintin smith of gaming website rock paper shotgun zachtronics was contacted two days later by valve with an interest to add it to steam game was subsequently made available on steam by march 4 2011 and later on on march 17 2011 inclusion of game on steam was considered by barth to be largest boost to sales of game outweighing any other distribution method they had post release support spacechem received a free update in late april 2011 which added several new features to game as well as new puzzles patch included support for researchnet puzzle creation and sharing system and for steam enabled version support for achievements and leaderboards specific for steam friends update for steam version also included a small set of puzzles tied in with team fortress 2 which upon completion would reward player with a decorative item they could use within team fortress 2 game was included in humble frozen synapse bundle charitable sale in early october 2011 spacechem was ported to ipad in october 2011 using touch controls instead of mouse and keyboard to manipulate visual program an android port was released in july 2012 both mobile platforms include most of full game excluding defense puzzles sandbox mode was added at request of a player who was trying to explore spacechem computational abilities alongside sandbox mode offered a contest for most interesting sandbox creation this same user was able to demonstrate a interpreter within spacechem claiming that visual programming language was turing complete barth has mentioned possibility of a sequel in an interview with zachtronics industries has encouraged game to be used as a learning tool for programming and chemistry concepts and offers discounts for schools though briefly offered game free of charge for educational institutions for a few months after release of sandbox mode addition according to independent games developers association schools in united kingdom have started using spacechem to teach students fundamental programming concepts success of spacechem led to several companies contacting zachtronics to develop educational titles company spent about two years working with amplify to develop three edutainment games for their platform before they returned to work on more direct entertainment titles but used opportunity to improve on their in game teaching mechanics on september 30 2012 spacechem was featured game on a site which features indie games with a pay what you want model with a portion of proceeds going to charity zachtronics industries chose against malaria foundation as charity to which 10 of proceeds were donated on october 25 2015 zachtronics announced they have dropped all support for spacechem on ios and os x platform reason they gave was due to complexity of mono package for future support reception spacechem was generally well received by critics with an aggregate metacritic score of 84 out of 100 from its microsoft windows release quintin smith of rock paper shotgun said i think we might have just received one of year s best indie games in first week of 2011 gamasutra s margaret robertson praised gameplay contrasting it with other open ended activities as it offers opportunity for player to be as creative as they want to be within minimal ruleset required of each puzzle robertson also found game to be thrilling having each puzzle initially appear so astonishingly dispiriting to what she had previously learned but through trial and error coming to a solution that works and giving her feeling of having made a creative statement in her solution eurogamer s john teti praised means through which game introduced new mechanics without excessive reliance on tutorials he commented that problems become more daunting through addition of new elements and commands game is always more accessible than it looks edge said triumph of spacechem is that overcoming these situations is more a case of inventing a solution than discovering one team fortress creator robin walker recommended spacechem on steam calling it pretty much greatest game ever made gamasutra named spacechem best indie game of 2011 though total sales of game are unknown at least 230 000 copies were purchases as part of game s inclusion in humble indie bundle barth stated that with sales of spacechem he was able to quit his job at microsoft and run his development company full time ryan sumo freelance artist for game gained recognition in industry and went on to help develop art for
