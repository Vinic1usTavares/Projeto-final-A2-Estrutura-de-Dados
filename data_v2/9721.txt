violin viola cello harp concert bass glockenspiel bass clarinet flute tympani marimba gongs and other miscellaneous percussion in opinion of all about jazz writer mark smith s use of echo laden atmospheric sounds in his previous work culminated on ten freedom summers whose somber mood reflects pieces titles compositions are organized in three principal sections defining moments in america what is democracy and freedom summers each section s pieces are meant to represent significant figures associated with civil rights movement during 1954 to 1964 and concepts relevant to formation of institutions that evolved from human interaction including government media and jeff dayton johnson from all about jazz said although its movements variously address malcolm x dr martin luther king jr brown vs board of education medgar evers and little rock nine thematic concerns nevertheless extend both backwards to 1857 dred scott case and forward to 9 11 and to a series of cross cutting concerns e g democracy freedom of press and black church according to josh langhoff from popmatters box set s pieces transform their subjects into musical invention and moods they re not literal or programmatic langhoff finds them similar to contemporary classical pieces in how they make their points through abstraction daniel spicer of bbc music characterized music as a mixture of austere contemporary classical composition performed by la based southwest chamber music ensemble and turbulent free jazz improvised by golden quartet in opinion of jazz critic john fordham presence of either smith s jazz quartet or classical ensemble led him to abandon typical themes and continuous pulses in favor of free jazz and contemporary classical idioms bob rusch believed performances are not inspired by contemporary civil rights movement music by artists such as paul robeson pete seeger mahalia jackson or aretha franklin because smith s golden quintet exhibit an astral chamber sound
