which turned out rather closer than predicted jack hallam opened scoring from a tommy hands cross with first league goal of season for match was started punctually and it would have been a sheer impossibility to score faster than small heath player did villa equalised some 20 minutes later took lead immediately afterwards and retained that lead to end birmingham daily post picked out hallam and caesar jenkyns for praise was disappointed by fred wheldon usually bright particular star of front rank and suggested that jack oliver would be a success when he has lost a little superfluous flesh on sunday jenkyns was involved in an incident after he and an acquaintance staked a quart of beer on a bicycle race solihull police court later heard how after jenkyns lost race he knocked his opponent off his bicycle hit another man and returned to public house where he struck a third man in face he was convicted on three counts of assault and fined 20s plus costs on each count in

frank mobley and wheldon visit to wolverhampton wanderers ended in defeat by same score oliver conceded a penalty kick for a foul on charlie reynolds wheldon equalised before half time and wolverhampton regained lead straight after interval surprise of saturday s football came when a late goal from hands was enough to beat preston north end though there was a suggestion in press that team would do well to moderate their tactics which were not of gentlest for preston s visit to coventry road following weekend club applied for a licence to sell alcohol within ground as it was only first division club without such a licence application was refused licensing magistrate remarking that if public wanted drink they could go outside to get it thumb right upright beneficiary fred

hands after a clash with mobley left preston goalkeeper james trainer on floor and for wheldon before edward deputising in goal for injured partridge let in a soft goal just before half time second half brought more finesse and less vigour from home side but preston grew stronger took lead and small heath appeared to be done with then trainer could only turn mobley s lob in off post same player gave his side lead but before small heath contingent had finished congratulating one another north end charging down field finely from centre kick scored again before whistle sounded to make final score 4 4 match receipts totalled nearly ps250 a ground record after wolverhampton wanderers took a three goal lead at coventry road daily post suggested that caesar jenkyns must have spent interval exhorting his men to make a famous effort for they responded nobly to his appeal adopting a strategy of all out attack running ball upfield at full speed before crossing to as many of forwards as could converge on goal they scored four times in 25 minutes to demoralise opposition and win match quality of hands movement and crosses was singled out for particular praise small heath then played west bromwich albion in a benefit match for fred wheldon who had first played for club on trial in 1890 and since signing before 1890 91 season had not missed a game in league or fa cup hands and goalkeeper charlie williams of swindon town were injured during game and unfortunately for beneficiary only 2 000 spectators turned up a creditable performance in a losing cause at burnley marred only by forwards lack of composure in front of goal was followed by visit of aston villa bob gordon scored early but thereafter was marked out of game by jenkyns villa had better of first half but wheldon tied scores from a penalty kick just before half time just after home side took lead with a determined and characteristic rush but dennis hodgetts equalised again from a penalty defences partridge and jenkyns for small heath and villa backs in particular had best of remaining time and match was drawn after only four games gate receipts including ps450 paid by that day s 14 600 spectators already amounted to half that of preceding season small heath finished october with a 2 2 draw on a waterlogged pitch at stoke which left them in ninth place in league november december three goals behind in first 20 minutes small heath had fought back to level terms when a powerful shot from everton s alex latta was given as a goal despite having gone well wide referee believing it had passed through a hole in net william mcgregor former president of league suggested that it was worst decision he had seen since establishment of goal nets and latta himself agreed that ball had gone wide crowd were unimpressed ironical shouts of goal were reception of any shots by everton of good or bad quality that followed until with ten minutes left jenkyns tied scores with a header from a free kick while confirming that result had to stand league appointed a committee to look into circumstances of phantom goal and issued an instruction to referees to inspect and observe condition of before each match in future in contrast small heath put on a very indifferent display in losing 4 1 at west bromwich albion they scored twice very much against run of play to come back from 2 0 down to beat stoke 4 2 and their good fortune continued at bolton wanderers home goalscorer alex paton left field injured before half time goalkeeper john willie sutcliffe was insistent that jack hallam s equaliser had been punched into goal hallam was equally insistent that it had not and after wheldon scored small heath s winner referee ended game a few minutes early bolton applied to league for match to be replayed because of short time referee admitted to having ended game 2 1 2 minutes early though not 5 alleged by bolton but result stood unusually small heath led at half time at home to sheffield united charlie letherbarrow in only his second appearance for club scored after ten minutes and again approaching interval to regain lead between two legitimate scores he hit a swerving shot which looped up off chest of goalkeeper william foulke and into net but referee judged that ball had been played in from behind goal line in second half wheldon converted a penalty kick when foulke pushed hallam out of way as he attempted to reach a cross from tommy hands and letherbarrow completed his hat trick as small heath won 4 1 jack oliver received a good reception when he returned to his former club small heath were introduced as oliver s team but sunderland took no pity winning 7 1 at liverpool an exciting game produced a 3 1 defeat three home forwards worked as one putting extra pressure on centre of visiting midfield and defence was unable to hold them out game was rough at times liverpool s joe mcque attracting particular attention because of an incident in corresponding match previous season when caesar jenkyns was sent off for his violent reaction to mcque kicking frank mobley in abdomen playing a close passing game that made them better able to cope with high winds and blizzards that had caused postponement of several league matches nottingham forest earned themselves a christmas bonus of 10s a man for inflicting small heath s first home defeat of season boxing day produced a 2 0 defeat to a sheffield wednesday team playing a better all round game and next day small heath beat a touring scottish borderers side 11 1 injury deprived small heath of four regular first team players for last game of year at home to liverpool and both tilson pritchard and ernie moore made their debuts at full back jenkyns moved back to play behind other half backs to protect understandably nervous reserves and once nerves wore off pritchard in particular could scarcely be improved upon mobley opened scoring in first half and with wind behind them in second half small heath won 3 0 to go into new year in 10th place in league january february on a hard pitch in very cold weather small heath had already conceded twice at blackburn rovers before billy ollis was injured midway through first half and played no further part visitors put up a fight but numerical disadvantage was too much for them and final score of 9 1 remains club s joint record losing margin with no competitive fixture scheduled for next two weeks club undertook a tour their opening match in plymouth was first visit of a professional club to south west of england home park club had ambitions to bring professional league football to region and in front of a crowd of 4 000 their team performed well before conceding three second half goals small heath s tour ended with a 2 1 defeat at manchester city and they returned to a celebratory dinner in honour of club s promotion to first division chairman presented medals to players congratulated them on their showing thus far and proposed a toast to their health in hope that a full strength team might be available by next league match in ten days time in a remarkable encounter burton swifts led 3 2 at half time in birmingham senior cup first round their second goal was something of a freak as an errant clearance by purves was met on volley and returned into net by davie swifts took a two goal lead for a third time before small heath drew level after which they pressed hotly but were kept out until twenty seconds from finish and when extra time seemed inevitable walton headed ball through amidst great cheering and referee blew final whistle a visit to brine baths at droitwich spa failed to help players adjust to nottingham forest s pitch which had been flooded when river trent burst its banks a few days before they conceded two early goals but kept up a strong pressure thereafter and birmingham daily post suggested that forwards played magnificently and had half backs supported them a little more efficiently they might have broken down even stalwart defence of home club nottinghamshire guardian had predicted that forest should have but little difficulty in disposing of small heath but later admitted that latter gave forest a far better game than had generally been anticipated february opened with fa cup tie at home to west bromwich albion albion scored first charging both ball and goalkeeper into net and doubled their lead after a misunderstanding between oliver and jenkyns half an hour into game wheldon made a characteristic dribble his shot was parried and walton scored from rebound pitch was very muddy but small heath forwards persisted with a close passing game when a kick and a rush would have served better and although birmingham enthusiasts nearly shouted themselves hoarse in encouraging heathens there were no more goals a collection was taken at match for families of 77 miners killed in flooding at colliery at audley staffordshire joe fountain made his debut against sunderland as a late replacement for wheldon whose sister had died on morning of match on a slippery pitch thickly strewn with chaff and small heath fell a goal behind in a first half dominated by defences of both teams special training undertaken by home side in preparation for match took effect as in closing stages they looked winners all over and sunderland had goalkeeper ned doig to thank for restricting scoring to just tommy hands equaliser attendance of 15 000 was nearly double highest recorded in previous seasons matthews 1995 complete record pp 140 42 both clubs having been eliminated from fa cup small heath arranged a friendly with notts county refereed by test cricketer and former england international footballer billy gunn which gave them an opportunity to try out reserve players jack jones and alec leake on a hard snow covered pitch billy walton scored all three goals in a 3 3 draw but attendance of under a thousand though understandable because of weather conditions was disappointing jones made his competitive debut standing in for injured hallam as small heath again struggled in muddy conditions and for fourth time this season lost to west bromwich albion reserve tom watson replaced partridge in goal and hallam returned to forward line for second round of birmingham cup at home to wolverhampton wanderers wheldon scored with two minutes left to take lead but wanderers still had time to tie scores at 3 3 after consulting both captains referee ordered half an hour s extra time but wanderers whose players had already returned to dressing rooms refused to play so jenkyns claimed game for small heath march april after seven defeats in last nine league matches small heath did little in draw with blackburn rovers to allay prospect of relegation test matches numerous chances were wasted according to birmingham daily post not one of forwards seemed capable of administering a sharp kick and have themselves to blame for not securing a victory with five matches remaining they were in 11th position in league but only two points clear of test match zone on a lighter note annual theatrical sports hosted in conjunction with prince of wales theatre featured a fancy dress procession from city centre to coventry road ground for athletic events including sprint and races for footballers won by caesar jenkyns and teddy jolly respectively a skipping race for ladies of theatre sack

to their 3 2 lead league match at home to sheffield wednesday was one of several victims of weather referee had initially passed ground fit for play but continued heavy rain turned pitch into a quagmire and forced a late postponement derby county took what local newspaper described as last chance county had of escaping test matches scoring three times in first 15 minutes as they beat small heath by five goals to three caesar jenkyns who has been playing so well with small heath this season that his selection as centre half was a foregone conclusion proved himself clever in tackling english forwards and often getting ball from them as wales drew with england at queen s club in semi final of birmingham cup a weakened small heath team lost to west bromwich albion in a rough game albion s tom hutchinson was accompanied off field by a policeman when sent off for injuring charles partridge and during extra time charlie perry was carried off with a leg injury players went to malvern for special training before home game with burnley joe fountain was an excellent stand in for injured tommy hands at outside left and jenkyns was a tower of strength as wheldon scored only goal of a scrappy game to bring small heath s points total to 22 with three matches left daily post predicted that 24 would be enough to avoid test matches on easter monday hands returned to team for

was turned into his own net and increased it to 4 0 in second half before frank mobley broke away to score a late consolation as players were leaving field they were verbally abused by a section of crowd who believed play had been unnecessarily rough jenkyns who appeared to be singled out for particular abuse grabbed one of spectators by throat other players separated pair and police became involved after an investigation club committee decided to suspend jenkyns for rest of season and release him thereafter dart suggested that supporters of this club praise executive for their maintenance of discipline and decorum jack oliver took over captaincy and teddy jolly played at centre half for birmingham charity cup semi final in which small heath finally beat west bromwich albion at sixth attempt in their last game of league season away to sheffield united small heath scored first when foulkes attempted clearance rebounded off his teammate walter hill into net and mobley extended lead after a break down left by hands although united came close to scoring from a second half scrimmage when ball appeared to cross line small heath held on to ensure their first division survival with an unexpected victory after overturning a two goal deficit to beat woolwich arsenal 4 3 in a friendly at plumstead small heath took on aston villa in their last match of season final of birmingham charity cup unfortunately for charities weather was poor and attendance low but those spectators present saw an exciting game wheldon scored first with a fierce shot that entered net off goalkeeper and underside of bar then bob chatt equalised from a free kick and charlie outpaced oliver and his parried shot was forced over line mobley tied scores with a long shot but in second half with wind behind them villa scored three times to jack hallam s one to take match 5 3 summary and aftermath small heath conceded more goals than any other team in division but finished 12th of 16 thus avoiding risk of relegation via test matches despite misgivings of daily post that it cannot be expected that eleven or twelve men will stand strain of a season s work amongst first division clubs no member of first choice team missed more than four league matches bill purves and billy ollis were ever present ollis for third season running and fred wheldon missed a match for first time in five years ten other men appeared at least once frank mobley was leading scorer with 13 goals followed by wheldon with 11 no other player reached double figures apart from caesar jenkyns who signed for woolwich arsenal where he was appointed captain all regular first team players remained with club goalkeeper joe fall signed from newton heath for a fee reported as ps20 and defender harry haynes joined from wolverhampton wanderers dart thought that jenkyns would be missed a great deal more than some of supporters imagine and that apart from fall who was expected to be a big improvement on
