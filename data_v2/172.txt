oust him coup was based upon owners disgruntlement with increasing cost of dallara dw12 chassis and fines given out for use of parts in races earlier in season bernard spoke to team owners on saturday

to deteriorating track going through turn six he struck a large piece of asphalt that had lifted from track after hitting his front wing it then went under car and propelled it into air with no traction hinchcliffe was unable to control his car and was sent into tire wall hinchcliffe was angry after race and claimed that track should have been fixed earlier fact that race control let it go as far as they did essentially waiting for someone to crash as a result of it before they did something is very unsafe he said that track had lifted much earlier in race but that drivers had been forced to keep avoiding debris which was on racing line on same lap takuma sato clipped curb going into turn 12 and lost control of his car before hitting wall forcing his retirement two crashes drew a full track caution and cars drove behind safety car for six laps before a red flag was given on lap 45 track had been patched up prior to weekend s racing using a synthetic rubber compound and it had remained secure throughout practice and qualifying sessions as well as grand am and indy lights races however dallara dw12 s aerodynamic ground force effects acted to pull compound out after assessing track conditions decision was made to attempt to repair track and restart race marshalls and track workers started to pull loose strips up from track and a quick drying concrete was used to fill troughs repairs were held up for a short time when a crew was despatched to collect more of concrete as on site resources had been used up but eventually race director was happy race could restart kanaan and power drove around to survey repairs acting as driver representatives and although kanaan particularly did not sound confident that they would hold up they agreed to try and continue racing there was some confusion about rules of restart no repairs were allowed and teams could change tires but had to remain on same compound this led to j r hildebrand suffering a one lap penalty as his car required repair work and a number of drivers being angered at having to stay on harder tires which were slower compound after a two hour delay race was restarted rahal suffered clutch problems on restart which placed him two laps down while other drivers ran behind safety car during which marshalls showed areas in which repair work had been conducted just prior to restart there was a short rain shower which made track slightly slippy power lost one position on restart dropping to third franchitti who was closest driver to front to have softer compound red tires fitted gained two positions on restart moving up to fourth restart only lasted for six corners before castroneves spun in wet conditions and was then struck by ed carpenter on next corner josef newgarden had slid into wall and stalled and a full track caution was again called race was restarted with nine laps remaining and franchitti once more gained a position passing pagenaud to gain second however race
