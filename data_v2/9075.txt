than teaching of magisterium of holy see as per founder josemaria escriva letter 14 february 1964 1 quoted in 2 october 2011 pastoral letter of bishop javier echevarria opus dei places special emphasis on certain aspects of catholic doctrine a central feature of opus dei s theology is its focus on lives of ordinary catholics who are neither priests nor monks mirrored on catholicity opus dei emphasizes universal call to holiness belief that everyone should aspire to be a saint as per jesus commandment to love god with all your heart and be perfect as your heavenly father is perfect opus

and family life members of opus dei lead ordinary lives with traditional families and secular careers and strive to sanctify ordinary life indeed pope john paul ii called escriva saint of ordinary life thumb right fernando ocariz present prelate of opus dei similarly opus dei stresses importance of work and professional competence while some religious institutes encourage their members to withdraw from material world opus dei exhorts its members and all lay catholics to find god in daily life and to perform their work excellently as a service to society and as a fitting offering to god opus dei teaches that work not only contributes to social progress but is a path to holiness and its founder advised people to sanctify your work sanctify yourself in your work sanctify others through your work biblical roots of this catholic doctrine according to founder are in phrase god created man to work gen 2 15 and jesus s long life as an ordinary carpenter in a small town escriva who stressed christian s duty to follow christ s example also points to gospel account that jesus has done everything well mk 7 37 foundation of christian life stressed escriva is divine filiation christians are children of god identified with christ s life and mission other main features of opus dei according to its official literature are freedom respecting choice and taking personal responsibility and charity love of god above all and love of others at bottom of escriva s understanding of universal call to holiness are two dimensions subjective and objective according to fernando ocariz a catholic theologian and prelate of opus dei since 2017 subjective is call given to each person to become a saint regardless of his place in society objective refers to what escriva calls christian materialism all of creation even most material situation is a meeting place with god and leads to union with him different qualifiers have been used to describe opus dei s doctrine radical reactionary faithful revolutionary ultraconservative most modern conservative and liberal prayers all members whether married or unmarried priests or laypeople are trained to follow a plan of life or norms of piety which are some traditional catholic devotions this is meant to follow teaching of catholic catechism pray at specific times to nourish continual prayer which in turn is based on jesus pray at all times echoed by st paul s pray without ceasing according to escriva vocation to opus dei is a calling to be a contemplative in middle of world who converts work and daily life into prayer additionally members should participate yearly in a spiritual retreat a three week seminar every year is obligatory for numeraries and a one week seminar for supernumeraries also members are expected to make a day trip pilgrimage where they recite 3 5 decade rosaries on month of may in honor of mary mortification much public attention has focused on opus dei s practice of mortification voluntary offering up of discomfort or pain to god this includes fasting or for some of its members self inflicted pain such as self flagellation mortification has a long history in many world religions including catholic church it has been endorsed by popes as a way of following christ who died in a bloody crucifixion and who speaking of anybody that sought to be his disciple let him deny himself take up his cross daily and follow me lk 9 23 supporters say that opposition to mortification is rooted in having lost 1 sense of enormity of sin or offense against god and consequent penance both interior and exterior 2 notions of wounded human nature and of or inclination to sin and thus need for spiritual battle and 3 a spirit of sacrifice for love and supernatural ends and not only for physical enhancement as a spirituality for ordinary people opus dei focuses on performing sacrifices pertaining to normal duties and to its emphasis on charity and cheerfulness additionally opus dei celibate members practice corporal mortifications such as sleeping without a pillow or sleeping on floor fasting and remaining silent for certain hours during day organization and activities governance in pope john paul ii s 1982 decree known as apostolic constitution ut sit opus dei was established as a personal prelature a new official structure of catholic church similar to a diocese in that it contains lay people and secular priests who are led by a bishop however whereas a bishop normally has a territory or diocese prelate of opus dei is pastor to members and priests of opus dei worldwide no matter what diocese they are in to date opus dei is only personal prelature in existence in addition to being governed by ut sit and by catholic church s general law opus dei is governed by church s particular law concerning opus dei otherwise known as opus dei s statutes this specifies objectives and workings of prelature prelature is under congregation for bishops head of opus dei prelature is known as prelate prelate is primary governing authority and is assisted by two councils general council made up of men and central advisory made up of women prelate holds his position for life current prelate of opus dei is msgr fernando ocariz brana who became third prelate of opus dei on 23 january 2017 first prelate of opus dei was alvaro del portillo who held position from 1982 until his death in 1994 opus dei s highest assembled bodies are general congresses which are usually convened once every eight years there are separate congresses for men and women s branch of opus dei general congresses are made up of members appointed by prelate and are responsible for advising him about prelature s future men s general congress also elects prelate from a list of candidates chosen by their female counterparts original latin version on opus dei official site after death of a prelate a special elective general congress is convened women nominate their preferred candidates for prelate and is voted upon by men to become next prelate an appointment that must be confirmed by pope membership based on language of catholic church law and theology prelature calls people under pastoral care of prelate as faithful of prelature since term member connotes an association rather than a hierarchical structure such as a prelature or a diocese as of 2016 faithful of opus dei prelature numbered 94 776 members of which 92 667 are lay persons men and women and 2 109 priests these figures do not include priest members of opus dei s priestly society of holy cross estimated to number 2 000 in year 2005 about 60 per cent of opus dei faithful reside in europe and 35 per cent reside in americas women comprise 57 of total membership according to study of john allen for most part opus dei faithful belong to middle to low levels in society in terms of education income and social status opus dei is made up of several different types of faithful according to statutes of opus dei editio typica of statutes is given in latin on opus dei webpage an unofficial english translation is published on website distinction derives from degree to which they make themselves available for official activities of prelature and for giving formation according to spirit of opus dei statutes of opus dei 2 7 supernumeraries largest type currently account for about 70 of total membership typically supernumeraries are married men and women with careers supernumeraries devote a portion of their day to prayer in addition to attending regular meetings and taking part in activities such as retreats due to their career and family obligations supernumeraries are not as available to organization as other types of faithful but they typically contribute financially to opus dei and they lend other types of assistance as their circumstances permit right 310px thumb dr ernesto cofino guatemalan pioneer of pediatrics numeraries second largest type of faithful of opus dei comprise about 20 of total membership numeraries are celibate members who give themselves in full availability for official undertakings of prelature statutes of opus dei 2 9 this includes full availability for giving doctrinal and ascetical formation to other members for staffing internal government of opus dei if asked by regional directors and for moving to other countries to start or help with apostolic activities if asked by prelate statutes of opus dei 2 8 see also christians in middle of world because they are making themselves fully available to do whatever needs to be done for undertakings of prelature numeraries are expected to live in special centers run by opus dei and question of which particular center a numerary will live in depends upon regional needs statutes of opus dei 2 8 numerary is a general term for persons who form part of permanent staff of an organization therefore in order to maintain a family atmosphere in centers rather than an institutional one it is considered very important for numeraries to participate in daily meals and get togethers in which they converse and share news j allen opus dei ch 3 both men and women may become numeraries in opus dei although centers are strictly gender segregated numeraries generally have jobs outside of opus dei although some are asked to work internally full time and many modify way that they go about their professional goals in order to be available for prelature they devote bulk of their income to organization numerary assistants are a type of numerary that exists in women s branch of opus dei their full availability for prelature is lived out as full availability for doing a specific type of work namely looking after domestic needs of conference centers and residential centers of opus dei statutes of opus dei 2 8 and 2 9 hence they live in special centers run by opus dei and do not have jobs outside centers associates are celibate faithful who make themselves fully available to god and to others in apostolic celibacy and stably take on at least one sometimes more apostolic assignment s from prelature in giving doctrinal and ascetical formation and or coordinating activities statutes of opus dei 2 10 they differ from numeraries in not making themselves fully available to staff official undertakings of prelature instead giving themselves in additional social realities such as through their profession or to their own families because of this difference in availability for official activities of opus dei unlike numeraries associates do not live in opus dei centers but maintain their own abodes some of their family life emotional and social support comes from centers of opus dei some from other associates of opus dei and some from their personal families and friends precise ratio of this distribution depends upon circumstances of individual associate clergy of opus dei prelature are priests who are under jurisdiction of prelate of opus dei they are a minority in opus dei only about 2 of opus dei members are part of clergy typically they are numeraries or associates who ultimately joined priesthood priestly society of holy cross consists of priests associated with opus dei part of society is made up of clergy of opus dei prelature priests who fall under jurisdiction of opus dei prelature are automatically members of priestly society other members in society are diocesan priests clergymen who remain under jurisdiction of a geographically defined diocese these priests are considered full members of opus dei who are given its spiritual training they do not however report to opus dei prelate but to their own diocesan bishop as of 2005 there were roughly two thousand of these priests cooperators of opus dei are non members who collaborate in some way with opus dei usually through praying charitable contributions or by providing some other assistance cooperators are not required to be celibate or to adhere to any other special requirements indeed cooperators are not even required to be christian there were 164 000 cooperators in year 2005 in accordance with catholic theology membership is granted when a vocation or divine calling is presumed to have occurred activities leaders of opus dei describe organization as a teaching entity whose main activity is to train catholics to assume personal responsibility in sanctifying secular world from within escriva said opus dei is a great catechesis this teaching is done by means of theory and practice its lay people and priests organize seminars workshops retreats and classes to help people put christian faith into practice in their daily lives spiritual direction one on one coaching with a more experienced lay person or priest is considered paramount means of training through these activities they provide religious instruction doctrinal formation coaching in spirituality for lay people spiritual formation character and moral education human formation lessons in sanctifying one s work professional formation and know how in evangelizing one s family and workplace apostolic formation thumb 250px right central building of university of navarra official catholic document which established prelature states that opus dei strives to put into practice teaching of universal call to sanctity and to promote at all levels of society sanctification of ordinary work and by means of ordinary work thus founder and his followers describe members of opus dei as resembling members of early christian church ordinary workers who seriously sought holiness with nothing exterior to distinguish them from other citizens opus dei runs residential centers throughout world these centers provide residential housing for celibate members and provide doctrinal and theological education opus dei is also responsible for a variety of non profit institutions called corporate works of opus dei a study of year 2005 showed that members have cooperated with other people in setting up a total of 608 social initiatives schools and university residences 68 technical or agricultural training centers 26 universities business schools and hospitals 6 university of navarra in pamplona spain or austral university in buenos aires argentina are both examples of corporate work of opus dei these universities usually perform very high in international rankings university of navarra s business school was adjudged one of best in world by financial times and economist intelligence unit total assets of non profits connected to opus dei are worth at least 2 8 billion relations with catholic leaders leopoldo y garay bishop of madrid where opus dei was born supported opus dei and defended it in 1940s by saying that this opus is truly dei this work is truly god s contrary to attacks of secrecy and heresy bishop described opus dei s founder as someone who is open as a child and most obedient to church hierarchy vazquez de prada andres founder of opus dei life of josemaria escriva volume 1 early years new york 2000 thumb st pope john paul ii opus dei was founded led by divine inspiration in 1950s pope pius xii told most senior australian bishop cardinal norman gilroy that escriva is a true saint a man sent by god for our times jose manuel cerda like a bridge over troubled waters in sydney warrane college and student protests of 1970 studia et documenta 4 2010 147 181 http warrane unsw edu au index php option com content view article id 58 itemid 81 pius xii gave opus dei canonical status of pontifical right an institution depending directly and exclusively on vatican in its internal governance in 1960 pope john xxiii commented that opus dei opens up unsuspected horizons of apostolate furthermore in 1964 pope paul vi praised organization in a handwritten letter to escriva saying opus dei is a vigorous expression of perennial youth of church fully open to demands of a modern apostolate we look with paternal satisfaction on all that opus dei has achieved and is achieving for kingdom of god desire of doing good that guides it burning love for church and its visible head that distinguishes it and ardent zeal for souls that impels it along arduous and difficult paths of apostolate of presence and witness in every sector of contemporary life relationship between paul vi and opus dei according to alberto moncada a doctor of sociology and ex member was stormy after second vatican council concluded in 1965 pope paul vi denied opus dei s petition to become a personal prelature moncada stated moncada alberto opus dei over time icsa e newsletter vol 5 no 2 2006 international cultic studies association pope john paul i a few years before his election wrote that escriva was more radical than other saints who taught about universal call to holiness while others emphasized monastic spirituality applied to lay people for escriva it is material work itself which must be turned into prayer and sanctity thus providing a lay spirituality criticisms against opus dei have prompted catholic scholars and writers like piers paul read and vittorio messori to call opus dei a sign of contradiction in reference to biblical quote of jesus as a sign that is spoken against said john carmel heenan cardinal archbishop of westminster one of proofs of god s favor is to be a sign of contradiction almost all founders of societies in church have suffered monsignor escriva de balaguer is no exception opus dei has been attacked and its motives misunderstood in this country and elsewhere an inquiry has always vindicated opus dei one of opus dei s most prominent supporters was pope john paul ii john paul ii cited opus dei s aim of sanctifying secular activities as a great ideal he emphasized that escriva s founding of opus dei was ductus divina led by divine inspiration and he granted organization its status as a personal prelature stating that escriva is counted among great witnesses of christianity john paul ii canonized him in 2002 and called him saint of ordinary life of organization john paul ii said opus dei has as its aim sanctification of one s life while remaining within world at one s place of work and profession to live gospel in world while living immersed in world but in order to transform it and to redeem it with one s personal love for christ this is truly a great ideal which right from beginning has anticipated theology of lay state of second vatican council and post conciliar period one third of world s bishops petitioned for canonization of escriva during canonization there were 42 cardinals and 470 bishops from around world generals superior of many religious institutes and representatives of various catholic groups during those days these church officials commented on universal reach and validity of message of founder for his canonization homily john paul ii said with teachings of st josemaria it is easier to understand what second vatican council affirmed there is no question then of christian message inhibiting men from building up world on contrary it is an incentive to do these very things vatican ii et spes n 34 concerning group s role in catholic church critics have argued that opus dei s unique status as a personal prelature gives it too much independence making it essentially a church within a church and that opus dei exerts a disproportionately large influence within catholic church itself as illustrated for example by unusually rapid canonization of escriva which some considered to be irregular in contrast catholic officials say that church authorities have even greater control of opus dei now that its head is a prelate appointed by pope and its status as a prelature precisely means dependence allen says that escriva s relatively quick canonization does not have anything to do with power but with improvements in procedures and john paul ii s decision to make escriva s sanctity and message known thumb left pope francis st josemaria is a precursor of vatican ii in proposing universal call to holiness pope benedict xvi has been a particularly strong supporter of opus dei and of escriva pointing to name work of god benedict xvi then cardinal joseph ratzinger wrote that lord simply made use of escriva who allowed god to work ratzinger cited escriva for correcting mistaken idea that holiness is reserved to some extraordinary people who are completely different from ordinary sinners even if he can be very weak with many mistakes in his life a saint is nothing other than to speak with god as a friend speaks with a friend allowing god to work only one who can really make world both good and happy ratzinger spoke of opus dei s surprising union of absolute fidelity to church s great tradition to its faith and unconditional openness to all challenges of this world whether in academic world in field of work or in matters of economy etc he further explained of escriva means this confidence in fact that god is working now and we ought only to put ourselves at his disposal this for me is a message of greatest importance it is a message that leads to overcoming what could be considered great temptation of our times pretense that after big bang god retired from history pope francis is first pope who has dealt with opus dei closely as a bishop and according to james v schall s j is a friend of opus dei francis referred to st josemaria as a precursor of vatican ii in proposing universal call to holiness in analysis of john allen pope francis strong dislike for clericalism which he calls one of worst evils in church is a key factor for what francis admires about opus dei since escriva s emphasis on dignity of laity was a challenge to ultra clerical ethos of spanish catholicism in late 1920s he has a devotion to st josemaria and he prayed before his relics for 45 minutes when he once visited church of prelature in rome francis beatified alvaro del portillo successor of escriva what bergoglio most liked about opus dei was work done for poor by one of its schools in buenos aires he thanks opus dei for its work to further holiness of priests in roman curia controversy throughout its history opus dei has been criticized from many quarters prompting journalists to describe opus dei as most controversial force in catholic church and founder saint josemaria escriva as a polarizing figure criticism of opus dei has centered on allegations of secretiveness controversial and aggressive recruiting methods strict rules governing members elitism and misogyny and support of or participation in authoritarian or right wing governments especially fascist franco government of spain until 1978 mortification of flesh practiced by some of its members is also criticized opus dei has also been criticized for allegedly seeking independence and more influence within catholic church on other hand according to several journalists who researched opus dei separately many criticisms against opus dei are based on fabrications by opponents several popes and other catholic leaders have endorsed what they see as its innovative teaching on sanctifying value of work and its fidelity to catholic beliefs in 2002 pope john paul ii canonized escriva and called him saint of ordinary life in recent years opus dei has received international attention due to novel da vinci code and its film version of 2006 both of which prominent christians and non believers criticized as misleading inaccurate and anti catholic critics such as jesuit wladimir ledochowski sometimes refer to opus dei as a catholic christian or white form of freemasonry supporting views according to several journalists who have worked independently on opus dei such as john allen jr vittorio messori patrice de plunkett maggy whitehouse noam friedlander many of criticisms against opus dei are myths and unproven tales allen messori and plunkett say that most of these myths were created by its opponents with allen adding that he perceives that opus dei members generally practice what they preach thumb right opus dei central headquarters in rome allen messori and plunkett also state that accusations that opus dei is secretive are unfounded these accusations stem from a clerical paradigm which expects opus dei members to behave as monks and clerics people who are traditionally known and externally identifiable as seekers of holiness in contrast these journalists continue opus dei s lay members like any normal catholic professional are ultimately responsible for their personal actions and do not externally represent organization which provides them religious education writer and broadcast analyst john l allen jr states that opus dei provides abundant information about itself these journalists have stated that historic roots of criticisms against opus dei can be found in influential clerical circles as to its alleged participation in right wing politics especially francoist regime distinguished british historians paul preston and brian crozier state that opus dei members who were franco s ministers were appointed for their talent and not for their opus dei membership crozier brian franco a biographical history little brown and company 1967 technocrats were appointed to high office not because of what they were i e opus dei members but because of what they wanted to do jose casanova opus dei ethic technocrats and modernization of spain february 1 1983 also there were notable members of opus dei who were vocal critics of franco regime such as rafael calvo serer and antonio fontan who was first president of senate in spain following adoption of a democratic constitution german historian and opus dei member peter berglar calls any connection made between opus dei and franco s regime a gross slander at end of franco s regime opus dei members were 50 50 for and against franco according to john allen similarly alvaro del portillo former prelate of opus dei said that any statements that escriva supported hitler were a patent falsehood that were part of a slanderous campaign he and others have stated that escriva condemned hitler as a rogue a racist and a tyrant see opus dei spokespersons also deny claims that opus dei members worked with general pinochet various authors and researchers state that escriva was staunchly non political and detested dictatorships julian herranz en las de jerico recuerdos de los anos con san josemaria y juan pablo ii 2008 allen wrote that compared with other catholic organizations opus dei s stress on freedom and personal responsibility is extraordinarily strong there are many opus dei members who are identified with left wing politics including ruth kelly jorge rossi chavarria mario fernandez baeza antonio fontan mario and jesus estanislao while opus dei spokespersons have admitted mistakes in dealing with some members and do not as a rule contest their grievances supporters have rejected generalizations merely based on negative experiences of some members matthew 10 37 sociologists like bryan r wilson write about some former members of any religious group who may have psychological motivations such as self justification to criticise their former groups wilson states that such individuals are prone to create fictitious atrocity stories which have no basis in reality many supporters of opus dei have expressed belief that criticisms of opus dei stem from a generalized disapproval of spirituality christianity or catholicism expressing this sentiment one opus dei member cardinal julian herranz stated opus dei has become a victim of julian herranz quoted in massimo introvigne president of highest profile lobbying and information group for controversial religions cesnur argues that critics employ term cult in order to intentionally stigmatize opus dei because they could not tolerate return to religion of secularized society opus dei is not elitist in sense in which people often invoke term meaning an exclusively white collar phenomenon concluded john allen he observed that among its members are barbers bricklayers mechanics and fruit sellers most supernumeraries are living ordinary middle class lives he said regarding alleged misogyny john allen states that half of leadership positions in opus dei are held by women and they supervise men catholic church defends its male priesthood by saying that greatest in kingdom of heaven are not ministers but saints criticism critics of opus dei include maria del carmen tapia an ex member who was a high ranking officer of opus dei for many years liberal catholic theologians such as fr james martin a jesuit writer and editor and supporters of liberation theology such as journalist penny and michael walsh a writer on religious matters and former jesuit critics state that opus dei is intensely secretive for example members generally do not disclose their affiliation with opus dei in public further under 1950 constitution members were expressly forbidden to reveal themselves without permission of their superiors this practice has led to much speculation about who may be a member due in part to its secrecy jesuit america magazine referred to it as most controversial group in catholic church today opus dei in united states america magazine james martin 25 february 1995 retrieved 22 december 2017 opus dei has been accused of deceptive and aggressive recruitment practices such as showering potential members with intense praise love bombing mirrored on com and instructing numeraries to form friendships and attend social gatherings explicitly for recruiting purposes critics allege that opus dei maintains an extremely high degree of control over its members for instance past rules required numeraries to submit their incoming and outgoing mail to their superiors for inspection and members are forbidden to read certain books without permission from their superiors critics charge that opus dei pressures numeraries to sever contact with non members including their own families exit counselor david clark has described opus dei as very cult like thumb 150px right antonio fontan spanish

says that escriva once remarked that hitler had been badly treated by world and he further declared that hitler couldn t have been such a bad person he couldn t have killed six million jews it couldn

been subjected to same criticisms targeted to catholicism in general for example opus dei s position has been to oppose sexual freedoms and promote conservative morals according to an investigative report produced by advocacy group catholics for choice report further cites a study from sociologist marco burgos alleging opus dei interference in sex education programs in honduras that contradict catholic faith after conducting a critical study of opus dei catholic journalist john l allen jr concluded that opus dei should 1 be more transparent 2 collaborate with members of religious institutes and 3 encourage its members to air out in public their criticisms of institution other views sociologists peter berger and samuel huntington suggest that opus dei is involved in a deliberate attempt
