striped honeyeater plectorhyncha lanceolata is a passerine bird of honeyeater family meliphagidae found in australia it is a medium sized honeyeater about in length both sexes are a light greyish brown with dark brown centres to feathers which give appearance of stripes stripes are particularly distinct on head and back of neck while it is found mainly in inland eastern australia where it inhabits drier open forests it is also found in coastal swamp forests from south east queensland to central coast of new south wales although a honeyeater striped honeyeater relies on insects as its major food source and its bill has been adapted to an insect diet when not breeding it has been recorded feeding and travelling in small groups but it nests singly laying around three eggs in a deep cup shaped nest suspended from end of drooping branches it is widely distributed and common within its range thus population is listed as being of least concern for conservation by iucn taxonomy striped honeyeater was first described by english ornithologist and bird artist john gould in a synopsis of birds of australia and adjacent islands published in 1838 it is a member of family meliphagidae honeyeaters and sole member of monotypic genus plectorhyncha molecular studies indicate that genus is closely allied to monotypic genus grantiella though dissimilar in appearance painted honeyeater grantiella picta and striped honeyeater are part of a subclade that includes also philemon and genus name plectorhyncha is derived from a combination of greek words for a spear point and bill and refers to fine pointed bill species name lanceolata comes from latin for lance shaped in reference to long pointed feathers on throat and breast bird is also referred to as honeyeater honeyeaters are related to pardalotidae pardalotes acanthizidae australian warblers scrubwrens thornbills etc and maluridae australian fairy wrens in a large meliphagoidea superfamily description thumb left gleaning in a eucalypt striped honeyeater is a medium sized honeyeater with a body length of a wingspan of and an average weight of upper parts are generally light greyish brown with dark brown centres to feathers giving appearance of stripes these stripes are marked on head and nape less distinct on rump and almost absent from upper tail coverts underparts are whitish with faint streaks on belly feathers of upper breast and throat are long and pointed giving head a spiky appearance wing and tail are both moderately long with rounded tips bill is short with a sharp pointed appearance dark blue grey grading to a grey black at tip and around nostrils legs and feet are blue grey with black claws bare skin around eye is dark brown and iris a dark black brown males and females are similar in appearance juvenile birds are slightly browner than adults with buff or brown edges to feathers of wings and back juveniles have a duller less streaked appearance than adults juveniles moult into adult plumage at around one year old there is no seasonal difference in plumage of breeding birds striped honeyeater s song is described as a chirp chirp cherry cherry its contact call as a sharp and its alarm call as a shrill whistling note distribution and habitat this species is found mainly in eastern australia predominantly inland it inhabits drier open forests such as mallee and mulga but also heathland and mangroves on coast an observer in 1923 was surprised to find a small number of striped honeyeaters nesting at forster on new south wales mid north coast saying it is a remarkable fact for this bird to leave its proper habitat so far inland to come to coast however range has expanded and contemporary accounts give its distribution as eastern australia from central and south east queensland extending inland to south east south australia and to coast south to lakes new south wales small associated with weather patterns and habitat changes have been recorded in areas outside its usual range including grampians and adelaide plains it occurs in a wide variety of habitats including riparian woodlands such as river red gum box and black box with an understory of lignum or saltbush mallee woodland especially where mixed with thickets of or emu bush woodlands of native pine growing on sand ridges and semi arid scrubland dominated by acacia including on coast striped honeyeater is found in swamp forests of paperbark and casuarina and in developed areas containing native and exotic trees and shrubs such as caravan parks reserves gardens and farms and orchards behaviour feeding thumb right alt striped honeyeater in a pepper tree eating berries feeding on berries although a honeyeater in origin striped honeyeater s food source is primarily insects and its diet includes seeds and fruits as well as nectar its bill has evolved to a short straight sharply pointed shape more suited to probing crevices for insects than to probing flower tubes it has honeyeater s brush tongue and takes nectar from shallow flowers such as eucalypt blossoms it is arboreal mostly feeding amongst foliage in canopy of trees most food is obtained from leaves and less often from bark or flowers and fruit major foraging methods are gleaning from leaves and dead branches probing under loose bark and in crevices probing woody fruits of black oak probing flowers of eucalyptus gracilis and sallying for insects striped honeyeater occasionally hangs upside down to extract insects social behaviour striped honeyeater has most often been observed singly or in twos and occasionally in small flocks when not breeding it has been recorded feeding in loose mobile groups drinking in mixed groups with miners and travelling in small groups it engages in a high level of social activity including perching closely and allopreening and when feeding in groups chasing calling and scolding non breeding striped honeyeater is vocal calling while feeding and perching though only occasionally calling in flight it has been recorded engaged in a display of wing raising and calling and performing duets and call and response song thumb right upright alt striped honeyeater in a cup shaped nest sitting on suspended nest while striped honeyeater aggressively defends its nest by dive bombing people and animals who come too close and has been observed singing from display perches it is not known to be territorial it often feeds near other species of honeyeater and no inter species aggression has been noted breeding striped honeyeater breeds throughout its distribution range usually as simple pairs with both sexes building nest incubating and feeding young however cooperative breeding has been observed with a third adult bird involved in feeding nestlings it nests solitarily and pairs use same or adjoining trees for nesting over two or more seasons breeding season is from august to january though dependent on local conditions nest site is usually in drooping foliage of a tall shrub or low tree such as casuarina melaleuca acacia and mallee eucalypts site is sometimes near to or overhanging water and nest is usually constructed at end of a drooping branch suspended from twigs or foliage striped honeyeater often nests in vicinity of a nesting butcherbird it builds a deep cup shaped or bag shaped nest with thick walls and lip of opening turned slightly inwards nest is made from thin dry grass and coated with plant down feathers or wool coating often completely obscuring grass framework it is lined with spider webs hair wool or rootlets and on occasion flowers and tissue paper striped honeyeater will commonly re use material from previous nests eggs are an elongated oval by somewhat pointed at one end they are a dull white smooth and lustreless or slightly lustrous and moderately blotched with reddish brown marks over whole shell though more profusely towards and over larger end striped honeyeater lays an average of three eggs at 24 hour intervals eggs are incubated by both parents who sit constantly in alternating periods of around 20 minutes for 16 or 17 days fledging period is also around 16 days nests of striped honeyeater are parasitized by pallid cuckoo cacomantis pallidus conservation status because of its wide distribution and stable numbers population status of striped honeyeater has been evaluated by iucn as being of least concern references striped honeyeater category birds of queensland category birds of new south wales category birds of south australia category birds of victoria
