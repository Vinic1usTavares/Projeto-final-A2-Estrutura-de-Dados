on a sequel to build on success of cat people but producer val lewton wished to make fantasy comedy story amorous ghost instead as lewton and studio wrangled lewton commenced production on seventh victim a horror murder mystery film and on may 12 1943 rko announced it was delaying production on sequel curse of cat people due to unavailability of key performers rko production chief charles koerner did not want lewton to be idle once filming on seventh victim ended nor did he favor idea of lewton working on comedy so koerner suggested that lewton direct a horror film set at sea utilizing studio s existing ship set built for pacific liner 1939 according to robert wise a longtime collaborator with lewton it was this set that gave lewton idea for film he would find what we call a standing set and then tailor his script to set whatever it was that s how he made ghost ship he walked onto a set and saw a tanker then cooked up idea for this ship with a murderous captain quoted in lovell glenn classic fright movies suggest rather than show evil san jose mercury news november 1 2000 one scholar has suggested that lewton accepted assignment in part because as an amateur sailor himself ship captain s behavior mirrored lewton s own views on how to manage a ship but also because lewton saw plot as a way of criticizing his micro managing superiors at rko budget as with all of

it a tepid potboiler of malfeasance and murder on high seas john brosnan described ghost ship as a more conventional mystery thriller involving a number of deaths on board a ship but was produced with lewton s customary attention to atmosphere script has come in for significant praise with captain stone being compared to captain queeg in caine mutiny captain ahab in moby dick and captain wolf larsen in sea wolf other critics have pointed out that stone and merriam seem to have a father son relationship but that of script is that father figure becomes so enraged at his son s failings that

praised for being suitably claustrophobic robson s direction has earned kudos for heightening suspense by leaving certain actions and motives vague in scene in which seaman parker lawrence tierney dies crushed by anchor chain robson left it unclear whether captain stone committed murder by trapping parker in anchor chain locker or whether he merely shut door vagueness leaves audience unsure whether to believe merriam s accusations against captain and builds an atmosphere of paranoia and doubt which is critical to picture s success contemporary critic gary giddins has pointed out that film incorporates classic lewton scare tactics but in new ways his trademark scare tactic a high point in practically all of his films is a long dark nightmarish walk where every sound is magnified and every object threatening in ghost ship that walk is transferred to cabin of victimized third officer giddins gary how val lewton made horror movies into fine art new york sun october 11 2005 others have pointed out another lewton device gradual stalking of a main character by a murderer as another deft touch in film modern critics have also pointed out that film unlike so many motion pictures of 1940s has an almost exclusively male cast and avoids trope of a man redeemed by love of a good woman picture is entirely concerned with male conflict one critic noted and at end of film a woman appears only in shadow and fog as possibility of salvation rather than bringing emotional closure other film critics have made sustained arguments that film is a lengthy if coded study of repressed homosexuality similar to that in herman melville s novel billy budd indeed focus on men and men s problems has led one modern critic to declare film one of most homoerotic films hollywood ever made feingold michael ghost ship village voice july 13 1993 contemporary film programmers seem to have a high opinion of film as well a 1993 film forum series val lewton horror most noir screened
