invasion of ile bonaparte was an amphibious operation in 1810 that formed an important part of british campaign to blockade and capture french indian ocean territories of ile bonaparte now reunion and isle de france now mauritius during napoleonic wars these islands formed a fortified base for a french frigate squadron under commodore jacques hamelin to raid british convoys of east indiamen travelling between britain and british india hamelin s ships had destroyed two convoys previous year despite attention of a squadron of royal navy ships under commodore josias rowley rowley had responded by raiding fortified anchorage of saint paul on ile bonaparte and capturing one of hamelin s frigates and two captured east indiamen raid had an unforeseen consequence when commander of ile bonaparte general nicolas des bruslys committed suicide rather than lead garrison against british landing parties this encouraged rowley to consider a larger operation to seize whole island using small british held island of rodriguez as a base rowley and his british army counterpart lieutenant colonel henry keating planned to land two forces either side of island s capital saint denis and force governor to capitulate before island s militia could be mobilised against them plan was launched on 7 july 1810 as two combined forces of british sailors soldiers sepoys and royal marines landed at separate beaches although a number of men were drowned in heavy surf majority of invasion force reached beaches safely and marched inland attacking french outposts as they approached capital recognising that his demoralised garrison would be unable to defend saint denis and that militia would take too long to mobilise french commander colonel chrysostome de sainte suzanne surrendered island its garrison and its stores to rowley background french indian ocean islands of ile bonaparte and isle de france had provided a secure base for french privateers and french navy frigates to operate against british shipping in region for entire french revolutionary and napoleonic wars in 1808 determined to capitalise on this poorly defended region of british trade french government ordered commodore jacques hamelin in venus to sail to isle de france where he would be joined by three other large and powerful frigates with specific orders to target british trade gardiner p 92 dispersing his frigates into bay of bengal hamelin had some success during 1809 caroline capturing two east indiamen at action of 31 may 1809 and hamelin himself seizing three at action of 18 november 1809 french squadron also captured a number of smaller british warships and large portuguese frigate minerve woodman p 283 to counteract hamelin s ships british commander in region admiral albemarle bertie had ordered commodore josias rowley to operate off islands with a squadron of royal navy frigates with instructions to disrupt french movements and prepare for future invasion attempts rowley s ships had some successes one of east indiamen captured by hamelin was retaken by a blockading frigate in december 1809 but he was largely powerless to prevent large french ships leaving their fortified anchorages at will rowley s first action to address this problem was to request a british army force from government in madras this force made up of british soldiers and honourable east india company heic sepoys was used to capture tiny island of rodriguez rodriguez provided a secure harbour at which rowley s ships could collect supplies and repair minor damage within a short sailing distance of french islands previously british ships had been forced to return to madras or cape of good hope decreasing time available for operations against islands rodriguez also provided rowley with a staging post from which he could prepare planned invasions and in september 1809 he led an amphibious operation against defences of harbour of saint paul on ile bonaparte gardiner p 93 raid on saint paul was an important demonstration of rowley s ability to strike at french anchorages directly landing men at beaches british soldiers sailors and royal marines of landing party were able to storm defences from landward side and rout defenders james p 197 this allowed rowley s squadron to enter harbour and capture caroline and a number of smaller ships that were docked there attack caused consternation on island and its commander nicolas des bruslys committed suicide rather than order his troops to attack british positions charles mullie biographie des celebrites militaires des armees de terre et de mer de 1789 a 1850 1852 unopposed rowley was able to destroy defences and public works in town before leaving with large quantities of captured supplies and ships colonel chrysostome sainte suzanne replaced des bruslys but was unable to effectively defend island with remaining garrison in event of a concerted invasion gardiner p 94 preparation in early 1810 as cyclone season came to an end hamelin ordered a squadron of frigates under captain guy victor duperre to attack british convoys in bay of bengal duperre was initially unsuccessful but after sailing to madagascar for a brief refit he encountered and defeated a convoy in action of 3 july 1810 british response to french depredations was already in progress in late june rowley sailed with two frigates to rodriguez leaving captain samuel pym off isle de france with remainder on rodriguez rowley and lieutenant colonel henry keating conferred on best method of invading and rapidly subduing island determining that best plan was to land soldiers either side of island s capital saint denis and defeat garrison outside town forcing new governor to surrender clowes p 457 government in madras had augmented garrison of rodriguez over previous year so that by june 1810 it stood at over 3 650 men 1 800 british army regulars and 1 850 heic army sepoys under keating s overall command clowes p 270 to transport these troops rowley called up his own frigate hms boadicea and hms under captain nesbit willoughby a veteran of raid on saint paul who was still recovering from an accidental explosion two months before that had inflicted severe facial injuries among passengers on boadicea was robert townsend farquhar a diplomat and trader with heic who had been sent from london to assume governorship of islands once they had been captured on 6 july rowley s force rendezvoused with squadron under pym consisting of his frigate hms sirius hms iphigenia under captain henry lambert and hms under captain lucius curtis invasion rowley s squadron and a number of supporting transport ships reached ile bonaparte on 7 july main body under rowley approached sainte marie at 14 00 to draw french forces away from grande chaloupe where sirius was secretly landing first brigade under lieutenant colonel frazier this force of 950 soldiers a small battery of howitzers and supplies needed for campaign was landed without loss under direction of navy lieutenant john wyatt watling who had landed first and secured beach with a party of seamen distributing soldiers and supplies as they came ashore advancing rapidly to seize heights over beach frazier drove off french outposts and snipers and cut main road between saint denis and saint paul hampering french communications and movement of reinforcements james p 271 to east on other side of saint denis rowley ordered his forces to land first ashore was intended to be nesbit willoughby in a schooner named estafette to secure beach and organise landing forces however as this boat approached beach wind strengthened and built up a powerful surf which smashed schooner ashore with enough force to break it apart four of 150 strong landing party were drowned estafette was a french naval 4 gun schooner that willoughby and boats had captured in a raid on 1 may at on isle de france realising that smaller transports would be similarly overwhelmed by waves keating ordered a small brig named driven on shore as a breakwater this allowed a number of additional boats safely to reach beach but did not provide enough cover for a full landing before nightfall james p 272 by morning of 8 july french had still failed to concentrate their forces which consisted of 576 regular french army soldiers and 2 717 militia dispersed across island seeing that a landing on beach at grande chaloupe was still practical captains rowley and lambert successfully landed their contingents providing keating with sufficient force to march on saint denis while keating was landing frazier had advanced on capital from west storming a french barricade on road from saint paul and routing its defenders with minimal casualties brushing aside french resistance in a series of minor skirmishes keating and frazier s forces closed on saint denis advancing british were met at 18 00 by representatives of sainte suzanne who later signed a capitulation that surrendered entire island to rowley keating and farquhar with its garrison and supplies brenton p 460 offshore sirius had blockaded saint paul after landing her soldiers and on 9 july observed a ship attempting to break out of harbour after hearing news of surrender sirius sent her barge under command of lieutenant george norman to pursue fugitive in an exhausting twelve hour chase norman was able to catch and board ship revealed to be a privateer named edward carrying four guns and 30 men norman was able to defeat crew in a brief struggle in which three men were wounded and discovered that she was carrying despatches from french government for authorities on isle de france all of which fell into british hands james p 273 aftermath invasion cost british a combined total of 22 dead and 79 wounded including those drowned in wreck of estafette clowes p 458 most of other casualties had been incurred in skirmishes on road to saint denis and french casualties although not known were probably of a similar number french failed to put up a meaningful resistance to british force which rapidly established beachheads and carried french outposts without facing significant opposition island reverted to its pre revolutionary name of bourbon following invasion and farquhar briefly assumed governorship before moving to mauritius upon that island s capture in december 1810 keating replaced him in command and remained in position until 1814 when island was restored to france at end of napoleonic wars success allowed british forces to concentrate against one remaining french territory in indian ocean isle de france bourbon provided a number of secure anchorages and plentiful supplies for british frigate squadron becoming rowley and keating s new headquarters gardiner p 94 with a safe harbour only a short journey away rowley was able to despatch his frigates against french ports on isle de france more frequently and more aggressively developing a plan to seize small offshore islands near main harbours on isle de france to disrupt passage of shipping and ability of french frigates to use these ports as raiding bases this plan ultimately led to disastrous attempt to seize shipping in grand port in which four frigates of rowley s squadron were lost gardiner p 96 monuments notes references bibliography category naval battles of napoleonic wars category naval battles involving france
