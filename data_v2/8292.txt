south west pacific area swpa was name given to allied supreme military command in south west pacific theatre of world war ii it was one of four major allied commands in pacific war swpa included philippines borneo dutch east indies excluding sumatra east timor australia territories of papua and new guinea and western part of solomon islands it primarily consisted of united states and australian forces although dutch filipino british and other allied forces also served in swpa general douglas macarthur was appointed as supreme commander southwest pacific area on its creation on 18 april 1942 he created five subordinate commands allied land forces allied air forces allied naval forces united states army forces in australia usafia and united states army forces in philippines last command disappeared when corregidor surrendered on 6 may 1942 while usafia became united states army services of supply southwest pacific area usasos swpa in 1943 united states army forces in far east was reformed and assumed responsibility for administration leaving usasos as a purely logistical agency both were swept away in a reorganisation in 1945 other three commands allied land forces allied air forces and allied naval forces remained until swpa was abolished on 2 september 1945 origins thumb 300px right map of south west pacific theater alt a map showing china japan and australia borders of swpa are indicated forerunner of south west pacific area was short lived american british dutch australian command abda in december 1941 and january 1942 abda was referred to as south west pacific area rapid japanese advance through dutch east indies effectively divided abda area in two and in late february 1942 abda was dissolved at recommendation of its commander general sir archibald wavell who as commander in chief in india retained responsibility for allied operations in burma and sumatra another command established under emergency conditions when a convoy intended for supply of philippines known as pensacola convoy was rerouted to brisbane due to attack on pearl harbor brigadier general julian f barnes was ordered to assume command of all troops in convoy on 12 december 1941 concurrent with their designation as task force south pacific and place himself under command of macarthur next day by radiogram chief of staff of united states army general george c marshall ordered barnes to assume command as commander us troops in australia and take charge of all troops and supplies on 22 december 1941 with convoy s arrival in brisbane command was designated as united states forces in australia usfia it was renamed u s army forces in australia usafia on 5 january 1942 its mission was to create a base in australia for support of forces still in philippines staff known as remember pearl harbor group selected by war department for usafia arrived melbourne 1 february 1942 aboard and in first large convoy bearing personnel supplies and munitions intended for transhipment to java and philippines as well as australia for a brief time due to increased isolation of philippines and before fall of java was withdrawn from macarthur s command and placed under abda with continued direction to support both java and philippines what would replace adba was subject of discussions between australian and new zealand chiefs of staff that were held in melbourne between 26 february and 1 march 1942 they proposed creating a new theatre of war encompassing australia and new zealand under command of wavell s former deputy lieutenant general george brett who had assumed command of us army forces in australia usafia on 25 february president of united states franklin roosevelt and prime minister of united kingdom winston churchill discussed matter of command arrangements in pacific in washington d c on 9 march roosevelt proposed that world would be divided into british and american areas of responsibility with united states having responsibility for pacific where there would be an american supreme commander responsible to joint chiefs of staff churchill responded favourably to proposal and governments of australia and new zealand were then consulted they endorsed idea of an american supreme commander but wanted to have some input into matters of strategy this resulted in creation of pacific war council which met for first time in london on 10 february 1942 churchill clement attlee deputy prime minister and anthony eden foreign secretary represented united kingdom and earle page represented australia along with representatives from netherlands new zealand india and china page was replaced as australian representative by stanley bruce in june 1942 a parallel pacific war council was created in washington d c that first met on 1 april 1942 it was chaired by roosevelt with richard casey and later owen dixon representing australia and prime minister mackenzie king representing canada pacific war council never became an effective body and had no influence on strategy but did allow dominions to put their concerns before president formation obvious choice for a supreme commander in pacific was general douglas macarthur he had been ordered to leave philippines for australia to take command of a reconstituted abda area on 22 february 1942 and had therefore been promised command even before there were discussions on what it should be macarthur had solid support from president army and american people but not navy commander in chief united states fleet admiral ernest king saw pacific lines of communication primarily as a naval responsibility and would not yield command to an army officer and proposed a division placing all of solomons within australian area but excluding new hebrides new caledonia and new zealand while army planners led by brigadier general dwight eisenhower were willing to compromise on a divided command they objected to placing australia and new zealand in separate theatres joint chiefs of staff discussed matter between 9 and 16 march result of which was a decision to adopt navy s plan with only minor amendments while this was still going on general marshall had contacted brett and asked him to get australian government to nominate macarthur whose arrival in australia was now imminent as its choice for supreme commander this was done on 17 march when macarthur arrived at batchelor northern territory on 24 march 1942 combined chiefs of staff issued a directive formally designating pacific theatre an area of american strategic responsibility on 30 march joint chiefs of staff divided pacific theatre into three areas pacific ocean areas poa under admiral chester nimitz southwest pacific area swpa under macarthur and southeast pacific area which never became an active theatre former anzac area was divided between swpa and poa an annex defined swpa s boundaries on 17 april 1942 prime minister of australia john curtin directed all australian defence forces personnel to treat orders from macarthur as emanating from commonwealth government army s workshops and fixed fortifications and royal australian air force raaf s logistical and training infrastructure were not placed under swpa having placed its troops at macarthur s disposal australian government was adamant that it should be consulted on any alteration to boundaries or command arrangements in swpa government was particularly concerned that supreme commander should not move troops outside australia or australian territory without its consent as there were legal restrictions on where australian militia could serve matter of changes in command first came up when brett was replaced as commander of allied air forces by joint chiefs of staff macarthur and curtin agreed that there would be no change to blamey s status and that government would be consulted about any other proposed changes when vice admiral herbert f leary was replaced a few months later curtin was consulted and concurred with change general headquarters macarthur became supreme commander southwest pacific area swpa on 18 april 1942 although he preferred to use more conventional title of commander in chief macarthur s first general order created five subordinate commands allied land forces allied air forces allied naval forces united states army forces in australia usafia and united states army forces in philippines last command had a short life lieutenant general jonathan wainwright s united states army forces in philippines disintegrated over following three weeks and

recommended that macarthur appoint as many australian and dutch officers to senior positions as possible most of his staff was made up of us army officers who had served under him in philippines rest including whitlock fitch and chamberlain had been on staff of usafia macarthur reported to marshall that there were no qualified dutch officers in australia and that australian army had a critical shortage of staff officers which he did not wish to exacerbate nevertheless several dutch and australian army officers as well as some american naval officers served in junior positions on staff in july macarthur moved his ghq north from melbourne to brisbane where it was located in amp building original intention had been to move to townsville but this was found to be impractical as townsville lacked communications facilities that ghq required allied air forces and allied naval forces headquarters were co located with ghq in amp building advanced headquarters of allied land forces opened at st lucia about away advanced ghq subsequently moved to hollandia in september 1944 leyte in october 1944 and manila in may 1945 thumb right command organization southwest pacific area july 1943 alt an

formation tenth united states army did not pass to afpac control until 31 july 1945 swpa together with allied air forces allied naval forces and allied land forces was abolished on 2 september 1945 but ghq remained as ghq afpac allied land forces australian army s commander in chief general sir thomas blamey was appointed commander allied land forces swpa his headquarters was existing general headquarters australia and became known as lhq an australian commander was chosen as most of land forces were australian in april 1942 there were 38 000 american ground troops in swpa and 369 000 australian lhq controlled five major commands lieutenant general sir john lavarack s first army based in queensland lieutenant general sir iven mackay s second army in victoria lieutenant general gordon bennett s iii corps in western australia northern territory force under major general edmund herring and new guinea force under major general basil morris between them they controlled ten australian and two american divisions in august 1944 australian army had a strength of 463 000 men and women and there were 173 000 us army ground personnel in swpa by late 1944 there were eighteen american divisions in swpa while australian army had just seven when ghq moved up to brisbane lhq remained behind in melbourne but blamey formed an advanced lhq under his deputy chief of general staff dcgs major general george alan vasey which moved to nearby st lucia major general frank berryman replaced vasey as dcgs in september 1942 and remained in post until january 1944 he resumed post in july 1944 and remained until december 1945 when main body of ghq moved to hollandia advanced lhq followed opening there on 15 december but when main ghq moved to leyte in february 1945 advanced lhq remained behind a forward echelon lhq was formed under berryman that remained co located with main body of ghq while main body of lhq remained at hollandia until it moved to morotai for operations in borneo in april 1945 in practice macarthur controlled land operations through task forces these reported directly to ghq and their commanders could control all allied land air naval and service forces in their area if a japanese land attack was imminent most important of these was new guinea force which was formed in 1942 and was commanded personally by blamey in september 1942 and again in september 1943 in february 1943 lieutenant general walter krueger s sixth army arrived in swpa and its headquarters became that of alamo force alamo force reported directly to macarthur and as a result blamey did not command of majority of american land forces in theatre after that time although his post was not abolished in march 1944 macarthur met with curtin and detailed his plans for western new guinea campaign explaining that he would assume direct command of land forces when he reached philippines and suggesting that blamey could either go with him as an army commander or remain in australia as commander in chief new organisation went into effect in september 1944 with lieutenant general walter krueger s sixth us army lieutenant general robert eichelberger s eighth united

brett created a completely integrated headquarters with a royal australian air force raaf officer air vice marshal william bostock as his chief of staff each united states army air forces usaaf staff

swpa lieutenant general george kenney right in mid 1945 in manila alt two men in informal military uniform without ties or hats in may 1942 australian government appointed air vice marshal george jones as chief of air staff he became responsible for matters other than operations such as administration and training it soon became clear that jones and bostock could not get along together but kenney preferred to have bostock in operational command and although he regarded antipathy between jones and bostock as a nuisance was happy to leave arrangements way they were one of macarthur s first orders to brett was for a bombing mission to philippines an order delivered personally by sutherland when brett protested sutherland informed him that macarthur wanted mission carried out mission was flown by brigadier general ralph royce but macarthur personally wrote a reprimand to brett henceforth communications with sutherland were handled by bostock further disagreements between macarthur and brett followed meanwhile in washington general george marshall and chief of army air forces lieutenant general henry arnold had become alarmed at brett s integration of usaaf and raaf and disturbed by his inability to work with macarthur on 6 july 1942 marshall radioed macarthur to offer him major general george kenney or brigadier general jimmy doolittle as a replacement for brett macarthur selected kenney kenney sent home major general royce brigadier generals edwin s perrin albert sneed and martin scanlon and about forty colonels in australia he found two talented recently arrived brigadier generals ennis whitehead and kenneth walker kenney reorganised his command in august appointing whitehead as commander of v fighter command and walker as commander of v bomber command allied air forces was composed of both usaaf and raaf personnel and kenney moved to separate them brigadier general donald wilson arrived in september and replaced air vice marshal bostock as kenney s chief of staff while bostock took over newly created raaf command walker was shot down over rabaul in january 1943 his successor brigadier general howard ramey disappeared in march 1943 kenney deviated from normal structure of an air force by creating advanced echelon advon under whitehead new headquarters had authority to alter assignments of aircraft in forward area where fast changing weather and enemy action could invalidate orders drawn up in australia he created 1st 2nd and 3rd air task forces to control air operations in a forward area for a specific mission another departure from doctrine while kenney was enthusiastic about this innovation washington did not like it and over kenney s objections converted three air task forces into 308th and 310th bombardment wings in june 1944 major general st clair streett s thirteenth air force was added to allied air forces kenney created far east air forces feaf from his fifth air force headquarters while advon became fifth air force under whitehead raaf formed australian first tactical air force under air commodore harry cobby in october 1944 and when macarthur became commander of all army forces in pacific seventh air force was added as well major general paul wurtsmith replaced streett in march 1945 and air commodore frederick scherger replaced cobby in may allied air forces was abolished on 2

vice admiral leary was appointed commander allied naval forces in april 1942 on 7 february 1942 he had become commander of anzac area to east of australia extending to include fiji with headquarters in melbourne that command included a naval element some air forces but without responsibility for land defense he was answerable directly to admiral king most important force under his command was rear admiral john gregory crace s anzac squadron when swpa and allied naval forces were formed in april 1942 leary also became commander southwest pacific force while crace s anzac squadron became task force 44 in june crace was succeeded by another royal navy officer rear admiral victor crutchley former anzac area was divided so that australian coastal waters were with swpa and sea and air lines of communication from hawaii and north america fell in pacific ocean areas poa with a special provision for south pacific area having a designated sub commander under admiral chester nimitz with agreement of australian government leary was succeeded as commander southwest pacific force and commander allied naval forces by vice admiral arthur s carpender on 11 september 1942 like his predecessor he reported to king in former role and macarthur in latter also like leary carpender was not most senior naval officer in theatre as royal australian navy chief of naval staff cns admiral sir guy royle and royal netherlands navy s vice admiral conrad helfrich were both senior to him however royle agreed to serve under carpenter as commander south west pacific sea frontier which was formed on 16 march 1943 southwest pacific force was renamed seventh fleet on 15 march 1943 and its task forces were renumbered to match so task force 44 became task force 74 another important component was task force 76 amphibious force southwest pacific which had been formed under rear admiral daniel barbey on 8 january 1943 it became vii amphibious force later in year a training centre was established at port stephens new south wales and another at toorbul point queensland vii amphibious forces initially consisted of australian landing ships infantry and and american attack transport but gradually grew in size as more landing craft and landing ships arrived macarthur was annoyed at way that royle a royal navy officer communicated directly with admiralty he was also aware that royle had been critical of swpa s command arrangements and of some of his decisions macarthur proposed that an australian officer captain john collins replace royle as cns an appointment that carpender also supported over admiralty s objections curtin appointed collins to replace crutchley as commander task force 44 in june 1944 at rank of commodore with intention that collins would replace royle when his term expired this did not occur because collins was seriously wounded in leyte gulf on 21 october 1944 macarthur did not get along with carpender and twice asked for him to be replaced only to be embarrassed in november 1943 when king replaced carpender with vice admiral thomas c kinkaid without informing macarthur or seeking approval of australian government however a face saving formula was agreed upon for invasion of leyte seventh fleet was massively reinforced by ships from pacific fleet cover was provided by admiral william f halsey s third fleet which remained under nimitz at battle of leyte gulf divided command brought allies to brink of disaster when misunderstandings arose between kinkaid and halsey allied naval forces was abolished along with swpa on 2 september 1945 u s army services of supply under u s army forces in australia usafia a series of bases had gradually been built in australia initially to support us forces in philippines seven base sections were established in australia to operate under usafia base section 1 at northern territory base section 2 in townsville base section 3 in brisbane base section 4 in melbourne base section 5 in adelaide base section 6 in perth and base section 7 in sydney on 20 july usafia became united states army services of supply southwest pacific area usasos swpa under command of brigadier general

in far east usaffe under macarthur s command this had same name as macarthur s old headquarters in philippines but its function was different this left usasos with logistical responsibilities only new arrangement was awkward and required considerable adjustment before it functioned properly in september 1943 marshall was replaced by brigadier general james l frink new guinea advanced base was formed in port moresby in august 1942 and sub bases were created at milne bay and oro bay these became advanced sub base a and advanced sub base b respectively in april 1943 advanced sub base c was created on goodenough island in april 1943 but was discontinued when island was handed over to sixth army control in july meanwhile advanced sub base d was formed at port moresby in may sub bases became bases in august 1943 advanced base e was formed at lae and advanced base f at finschhafen in november 1943 followed by bases g and h at hollandia and biak respectively with a worldwide shipping crisis and swpa being at end of a very long supply line as well as being a region without well developed transportation nets regional logistics were almost entirely dependent on water transport no one fleet composed assets available to commander in chief swpa as u s navy royal navy royal australian navy australian army netherlands east indies navy were under his operational command while being maintained under their respective organizations those assets were inadequate resulting in creation of a large army fleet unique to swpa permanent local fleet under first usfia later usasos and finally army forces western pacific afwespac starting with retention of usat meigs admiral halstead and coast farmer from convoy diverted to brisbane in december 1941 that core was augmented by vessels fleeing japanese advance particularly twenty one dutch vessels later known as kpm vessels after dutch shipping line s name koninklijke maatschappij as of 28 april 1942 army fleet had grown to twenty eight ships and by 24 january 1945 that fleet of large ships exceeded ninety with a peak of ninety eight by 1 august 1945 that number did not count a much larger fleet of small vessels ranging from landing craft barges and other floating equipment to seagoing vessels under 1 000 tons including small ships section of requisitioned and locally constructed 2 712 craft vessels manned largely by australian civilian employees 1 719 as of june 1945 of u s army and many such vessels and floating equipment delivered from united states permanent fleet of swpa almost had as many vessels as army s general fleet during some periods though those vessels were often small obsolete in poor condition and under unorthodox management in comparison as allied forces advanced new bases were formed and old ones in australia were closed base sections 5 and 6 were closed in january 1943 and base section 4 in june 1944 remaining four became bases and a base section was formed in brisbane to control them bases 1 and 3 were closed in december 1944 leaving only bases 2 and 7 these were deactivated in june 1945 and their functions absorbed by australia base section as base section had been renamed in february 1945 in new guinea base d was closed in july 1945 and bases a b and e in september leaving bases f g and h meanwhile a series of bases were opened in philippines base k on leyte base m on luzon base r at batangas base s on cebu and base x at manila these came under luzon base section which was redesignated philippine on 1 april 1945 on 7 june 1945 usasos became afwespac under command of lieutenant general wilhelm d styer and it absorbed usaffe intelligence in april 1942 brigadier general spencer akin and his australian counterpart at lhq major general colin simpson agreed to pool their resources and establish a combined intelligence organisation known as central bureau australian british and us armies as well as raaf and ran all supplied personnel for this formation which worked on codebreaking and decrypting japanese message traffic this magic and ultra intelligence was vitally important to operations in swpa to handle other forms of intelligence blamey and macarthur created allied intelligence bureau aib this included services reconnaissance department with its z special unit that carried out special operations like operation secret intelligence australia coastwatchers who watched for japanese aircraft and ships from observation posts behind japanese lines and propaganda specialists of far eastern liaison office felo two other important combined organisations not part of aib were allied translator and interpreter section atis which translated japanese documents and allied geographical section which prepared maps and charts and drafted appreciations of terrain since quality tended to be more important than quantity in intelligence this proved to be a fruitful field in which minor allies australia and netherlands could play a key part good intelligence enabled allied forces to minimise risk of failures and maximise chances of success moreover organisation built up in australia proved to be useful after war as well david horner later wrote that it may prove that present day intelligence cooperation has proved to be most lasting and important legacy of australia s experience of coalition warfare in second world war legacy allied command structure in south west pacific area faced challenges of coalition warfare in several ways with varying degrees of success benefits of wartime alliances proved to be substantial but required constant effort to maintain for australia and new zealand coalition warfare became norm and experience in swpa proved to be a formative and informative one with many political and military lessons over following decades australian new zealand and american forces would fight together again in korean war vietnam war and war on terror footnotes notes references further reading category
