whales are a widely distributed and diverse group of fully aquatic placental marine mammals they are an informal grouping within infraorder cetacea usually excluding dolphins and porpoises whales dolphins and porpoises belong to order cetartiodactyla which consists of even toed ungulates their closest living relatives are hippopotamuses having diverged about 40 million years ago two parvorders of whales baleen whales mysticeti and toothed whales odontoceti are thought to have split apart around 34 million years ago whales consist of eight extant families balaenopteridae rorquals balaenidae right whales pygmy right whale eschrichtiidae grey whale belugas and narwhals physeteridae sperm whale kogiidae dwarf and pygmy sperm whale and beaked whales whales are creatures of open ocean they feed mate give birth suckle and raise their young at sea so extreme is their adaptation to life underwater that they are unable to survive on land whales range in size from and dwarf sperm whale to and blue whale which is largest known creature that has ever lived sperm whale is largest toothed predator on earth several species exhibit sexual dimorphism in that females are larger than males baleen whales have no teeth instead they have plates of baleen a fringe like structure used to expel water while retaining krill and plankton which they feed on they use their throat pleats to expand mouth to take in huge gulps of water balaenids have heads that can make up 40 of their body mass to take in water toothed whales on other hand have conical teeth adapted to catching fish or squid baleen whales have a well developed sense of smell whereas toothed whales have well developed hearing their hearing that is adapted for both air and water is so well developed that some can survive even if they are blind some species such as sperm whales are well adapted for diving to great depths to catch squid and other favoured prey whales have evolved from land living mammals as such whales must breathe air regularly although they can remain submerged under water for long periods of time some species such as sperm whale are able to stay submerged for as much as 90 minutes they have blowholes modified nostrils located on top of their heads through which air is taken in and expelled they are warm blooded and have a layer of fat or blubber under skin with streamlined fusiform bodies and two limbs that are modified into flippers whales can travel at up to 20 knots though they are not as flexible or agile as seals whales produce a great variety of vocalizations notably extended songs of humpback whale although whales are widespread most species prefer colder waters of northern and southern hemispheres and migrate to equator to give birth species such as and blue whales are capable of travelling thousands of miles without feeding males typically mate with multiple females every year but females only mate every two to three years calves are typically born in spring and summer months and females bear all responsibility for raising them mothers of some species fast and nurse their young for one to two years once relentlessly hunted for their products whales are now protected by international law north atlantic right whales nearly became extinct in twentieth century with a population low of 450 and north pacific grey whale population is ranked critically endangered by iucn besides whaling they also face threats from bycatch and marine pollution meat blubber and baleen of whales have traditionally been used by indigenous peoples of arctic whales have been depicted in various cultures worldwide notably by inuit and coastal peoples of vietnam and ghana who sometimes hold whale funerals whales occasionally feature in literature and film as in great white whale of herman melville s moby dick small whales such as belugas are sometimes kept in captivity and trained to perform tricks but breeding success has been poor and animals often die within a few months of capture whale watching has become a form of tourism around world etymology and definitions word whale comes from old english from proto germanic hwalaz from proto indo european s o meaning large sea fish proto germanic hwalaz is also source of old saxon old norse swedish val middle dutch wal dutch walvis old high german wal and german wal obsolete has a similar derivation indicating a time when whales were thought to be fish other archaic english forms include wal wale whal wheal etc term whale is sometimes used interchangeably with dolphins and porpoises acting as a synonym for cetacea six species of dolphins have word whale in their name collectively known as blackfish killer whale melon headed whale pygmy killer whale false killer whale and two species of pilot whales all of which are classified under family delphinidae oceanic dolphins each species has a different reason for it for example killer whale was named ballena killer whale by spanish sailors term

whales do not form a clade or order infraorder cetacea includes dolphins and porpoises which are not considered whales phylogenetic tree shows relationships of whales and other mammals with whale groups marked in green cetaceans are divided into two parvorders largest parvorder mysticeti baleen whales is characterized by presence of baleen a sieve like structure in upper jaw made of keratin which it uses to filter plankton among others from water odontocetes toothed whales are characterized by bearing sharp teeth for hunting as opposed to their counterparts baleen cetaceans and artiodactyls now are classified under order cetartiodactyla often still referred to as artiodactyla which includes both whales and hippopotamuses hippopotamus and pygmy hippopotamus are whale s closest terrestrial living relatives mysticetes mysticetes are also known as baleen whales they have a pair of blowholes side by side and lack teeth instead they have baleen plates which form a sieve like structure in upper jaw made of keratin which they use to filter plankton from water some whales such as humpback reside in polar regions where they feed on a reliable source of schooling fish and krill these animals rely on their well developed flippers and tail fin to propel themselves through water they swim by moving their fore flippers and tail fin up and down whale ribs loosely articulate with their thoracic vertebrae at proximal end but do not form a rigid rib cage this adaptation allows chest to compress during deep dives as pressure increases mysticetes consist of four families rorquals balaenopterids cetotheriids right whales balaenids and grey whales eschrichtiids main difference between each family of mysticete is in their feeding adaptations and subsequent behaviour balaenopterids are rorquals these animals along with cetotheriids rely on their throat pleats to gulp large amounts of water while feeding throat pleats extend from mouth to navel and allow mouth to expand to a large volume for more efficient capture of small animals they feed on balaenopterids consist of two genera and eight species balaenids are right whales these animals have very large heads which can make up as much as 40 of their body mass and much of head is mouth this allows them to take in large amounts of water into their mouths letting them feed more effectively eschrichtiids have one living member grey whale they are bottom feeders mainly eating crustaceans and benthic invertebrates they feed by turning on their sides and taking in water mixed with sediment which is then expelled through baleen leaving their prey trapped inside this is an efficient method of hunting in which whale has no major competitors odontocetes odontocetes are known as toothed whales they have teeth and only one blowhole they rely on their well developed sonar to find their way in water toothed whales send out ultrasonic clicks using melon sound waves travel through water upon striking an object in water sound waves bounce back at whale these vibrations are received through fatty tissues in jaw which is then rerouted into ear bone and into brain where vibrations are interpreted all toothed whales are opportunistic meaning they will eat anything they can fit in their throat because they are unable to chew these animals rely on their well developed flippers and tail fin to propel themselves through water they swim by moving their fore flippers and tail fin up and down whale ribs loosely articulate with their thoracic vertebrae at proximal end but they do not form a rigid rib cage this adaptation allows chest to compress during deep dives as opposed to resisting force of water pressure excluding dolphins and porpoises odontocetes consist of four families belugas and narwhals monodontids sperm whales physeterids dwarf and pygmy sperm whales kogiids and beaked whales ziphiids there are six species sometimes referred to as blackfish that are dolphins commonly misconceived as whales killer whale melon headed whale pygmy killer whale false killer whale and two species of pilot whales all of which are classified under family delphinidae oceanic dolphins differences between families of odontocetes include size feeding adaptations and distribution monodontids consist of two species beluga and narwhal they both reside in frigid arctic and both have large amounts of blubber belugas being white hunt in large pods near surface and around pack ice their coloration acting as camouflage narwhals being black hunt in large pods in zone but their underbelly still remains white to remain camouflaged when something is looking directly up or down at them they have no dorsal fin to prevent collision with pack ice physeterids and kogiids consist of sperm whales sperm whales consist largest and smallest odontocetes and spend a large portion of their life hunting squid p macrocephalus spends most of its life in search of squid in depths these animals do not require any degree of light at all in fact blind sperm whales have been caught in perfect health behaviour of kogiids remains largely unknown but due to their small lungs they are thought to hunt in photic zone ziphiids consist of 22 species of beaked whale these vary from size to coloration to distribution but they all share a similar hunting style they use a suction technique aided by a pair of grooves on underside of their head not unlike throat pleats on rorquals to feed evolution right thumb basilosaurus skeleton whales are descendants of land dwelling mammals of artiodactyl order even toed ungulates they are related to indohyus an extinct like ungulate from which they split approximately 48 million years ago primitive cetaceans or archaeocetes first took to sea approximately 49 million years ago and became fully aquatic 5 10 million years later what defines an archaeocete is presence of anatomical features exclusive to cetaceans alongside other primitive features not found in modern cetaceans such as visible legs or asymmetrical teeth their features became adapted for living in marine environment major anatomical changes included their hearing set up that channeled vibrations from jaw to ambulocetus 49 mya a streamlined body and growth of flukes on tail 43 mya migration of nostrils toward top of cranium blowholes and modification of forelimbs into flippers basilosaurus 35 mya and shrinking and eventual disappearance of hind limbs first odontocetes and mysticetes 34 mya whale morphology shows a number of examples of convergent evolution most obvious being streamlined fish like body shape other examples include use of echolocation for hunting in low light conditions which is same hearing adaptation used by bats and in rorqual whales jaw adaptations similar to those found in pelicans that enable engulfment feeding today closest living relatives of cetaceans are hippopotamuses these share a semi aquatic ancestor that branched off from other artiodactyls some 60 mya around 40 mya a common ancestor between two branched off into cetacea and anthracotheres nearly all anthracotheres became extinct at end of pleistocene 2 5 mya eventually leaving only one surviving lineage hippopotamus whales split into two separate parvorders around 34 mya baleen whales mysticetes and toothed whales odontocetes biology anatomy thumb right features of a blue whale thumb features of a sperm whale skeleton whales have torpedo shaped bodies with non flexible necks limbs modified into flippers non existent external ear flaps a large tail fin and flat heads with exception of monodontids and ziphiids whale skulls have small eye orbits long snouts with exception of monodontids and ziphiids and eyes placed on sides of its head whales range in size from and dwarf sperm whale to and blue whale overall they tend to dwarf other blue whale is largest creature on earth several species have female biased sexual dimorphism with females being larger than males one exception is with sperm whale which has males larger than females odontocetes such as sperm whale possess teeth with cementum cells overlying dentine cells unlike human teeth which are composed mostly of enamel on portion of tooth outside of gum whale teeth have cementum outside gum only in larger whales where cementum is worn away on tip of tooth does enamel show mysticetes have large whalebone as opposed to teeth made of keratin mysticetes have two blowholes whereas odontocetes contain only one breathing involves expelling stale air from blowhole forming an upward steamy spout followed by inhaling fresh air into lungs a humpback whale s lungs can hold about 5 000 litres of air spout shapes differ among species which facilitates identification heart of a whale weighs about 180 200 kg it is 640 times bigger than a human heart heart of blue whale is largest of any animal and walls of arteries in heart have been described as being as thick as an iphone 6 plus is long all whales have a thick layer of blubber in species that live near poles blubber can be as thick as 11 inches this blubber can help with buoyancy which is helpful for a 100 ton whale protection to some extent as predators would have a hard time getting through a thick layer of fat and energy for fasting when migrating to equator primary usage for blubber is insulation from harsh climate it can constitute as much as 50 of a whale s body weight calves are born with only a thin layer of blubber but some species compensate for this with thick whales have a two to three chambered stomach that is similar in structure to terrestrial carnivores mysticetes contain a proventriculus as an extension of oesophagus this contains stones that grind up food they also have fundic and pyloric chambers locomotion thumb skeleton of a bowhead whale notice hind limb richard lydekker 1894 whales have two flippers on front and a tail fin these flippers contain four digits although whales do not possess fully developed hind limbs some such as sperm whale and bowhead whale possess discrete rudimentary appendages which may contain feet and digits whales are fast swimmers in comparison to seals which typically cruise at 5 15 kn or fin whale in comparison can travel at speeds up to and sperm whale can reach speeds of fusing of neck vertebrae while increasing stability when swimming at high speeds decreases flexibility whales are unable to turn their heads when swimming whales rely on their tail fin propel them through water flipper movement is continuous whales swim by moving their tail fin and lower body up and down propelling themselves through vertical movement while their flippers are mainly used for steering some species log out of water which may allow them to travel faster their skeletal anatomy allows them to be fast swimmers most species have a dorsal fin whales are adapted for diving to great depths in addition to their streamlined bodies they can slow their heart rate to conserve oxygen blood is rerouted from tissue tolerant of water pressure to heart and brain among other organs haemoglobin and myoglobin store oxygen in body tissue and they have twice concentration of myoglobin than haemoglobin before going on long dives many whales exhibit a behaviour known as sounding they stay close to surface for a series of short shallow dives while building their oxygen reserves and then make a sounding dive senses thumb right by cetaceans thumb right sperm whale skeleton richard lydekker 1894 whale ear has specific adaptations to marine environment in humans middle ear works as an impedance equalizer between outside air s low impedance and cochlear fluid s high impedance in whales and other marine mammals there is no great difference between outer and inner environments instead of sound passing through outer ear to middle ear whales receive sound through throat from which it passes through a low impedance fat filled cavity to inner ear whale ear is acoustically isolated from skull by air filled sinus pockets which allow for greater directional hearing underwater odontocetes send out high frequency clicks from an organ known as a melon this melon consists of fat and skull of any such creature containing a melon will have a large depression melon size varies between species bigger more dependent they are of it a beaked whale for example has a small bulge sitting on top of its skull whereas a sperm whale s head is filled up mainly with melon whale eye is relatively small for its size yet they do retain a good degree of eyesight as well as this eyes of a whale are placed on sides of its head so their vision consists of two fields rather than a binocular view like humans have when belugas surface their lens and cornea correct nearsightedness that results from refraction of light they contain both rod and cone cells meaning they can see in both dim and bright light but they have far more rod cells than they do cone cells whales do however lack short wavelength sensitive visual pigments in their cone cells indicating a more limited capacity for colour vision than most mammals most whales have slightly flattened eyeballs enlarged pupils which shrink as they surface to prevent damage slightly flattened corneas and a tapetum lucidum these adaptations allow for large amounts of light to pass through eye and therefore a very clear image of surrounding area they also have glands on eyelids and outer corneal layer that act as protection for cornea olfactory lobes are absent in toothed whales suggesting that they have no sense of smell some whales such as bowhead whale possess a vomeronasal organ which does mean that they can sniff out krill whales are not thought to have a good sense of taste as their taste buds are atrophied or missing altogether however some toothed whales have preferences between different kinds of fish indicating some sort of attachment to taste presence of jacobson s organ indicates that whales can smell food once inside their mouth which might be similar to sensation of taste communication whale vocalization is likely to serve several purposes some species such as humpback whale communicate using melodic sounds known as whale song these sounds may be extremely loud depending on species humpback whales only have been heard making clicks while toothed whales use sonar that may generate up to 20 000 watts of sound 73 dbm or 43 and be heard for many miles captive whales have occasionally been known to mimic human speech scientists have suggested this indicates a strong desire on behalf of whales to communicate with humans as whales have a very different vocal mechanism so imitating human speech likely takes considerable effort whales emit two distinct kinds of acoustic signals which are called whistles and clicks clicks are quick broadband burst pulses used for sonar although some lower frequency broadband vocalizations may serve a non purpose such as communication for example pulsed calls of belugas pulses in a click train are emitted at intervals of 35 50 milliseconds and in general these inter click intervals are slightly greater than round trip time of sound to target whistles are narrow band frequency modulated fm signals used for communicative purposes such as contact calls intelligence whales are known to teach learn cooperate scheme and grieve neocortex of many species of whale is home to elongated spindle neurons that prior to 2007 were known only in hominids in humans these cells are involved in social conduct emotions judgement and theory of mind whale spindle neurons are found in areas of brain that are homologous to where they are found in humans suggesting that they perform a similar function thumb bubble net feeding brain size was previously considered a major indicator of intelligence of an animal since most of brain is used for maintaining bodily functions greater ratios of brain to body mass may increase amount of brain mass available for more complex cognitive tasks allometric analysis indicates that mammalian brain size scales at approximately 2 3 or 3 4 exponent of body mass comparison of a particular animal s brain size with expected brain size based on such allometric analysis provides an encephalisation quotient that can be used as another indication of animal intelligence sperm whales have largest brain mass of any animal on earth averaging and in mature males in comparison to average human brain which averages in mature males brain to body mass ratio in some odontocetes such as belugas and narwhals is second only to humans small whales are known to engage in complex play behaviour which includes such things as producing stable underwater toroidal air core vortex rings or bubble rings there are two main methods of bubble ring production rapid puffing of a burst of air into water and allowing it to rise to surface forming a ring or swimming repeatedly in a circle and then stopping to inject air into helical vortex currents thus formed they also appear to enjoy biting vortex rings so that they burst into many separate bubbles and then rise quickly to surface some believe this is a means of communication whales are also known to produce bubble nets for purpose of foraging thumb upright a southern right whale sailing larger whales are also thought to some degree to engage in play southern right whale for example elevates their tail fluke above water remaining in same position for a considerable amount of time this is known as sailing it appears to be a form of play and is most commonly seen off coast of argentina and south africa humpback whales among others are also known to display this behaviour life cycle whales are fully aquatic creatures which means that birth and courtship behaviours are very different from terrestrial and semi aquatic creatures since they are unable to go onto land to calve they deliver baby with fetus positioned for tail first delivery this prevents baby from drowning either upon or during delivery to feed new born whales being aquatic must squirt milk into mouth of calf being mammals they have mammary glands used for nursing calves they are weaned off at about 11 months of age this milk contains high amounts of fat which is meant to hasten development of blubber it contains so much fat that it has consistency of toothpaste females deliver a single calf with gestation lasting about a year dependency until one to two years and maturity around seven to ten years all varying between species this mode of reproduction produces few offspring but increases survival probability of each one females referred to as cows carry responsibility of childcare as males referred to as bulls play no part in raising calves most mysticetes reside at poles so to prevent unborn calf from dying of frostbite they migrate to calving mating grounds they will then stay there for a matter of months until calf has developed enough blubber to survive bitter temperatures of poles until then calves will feed on mother s fatty milk with exception of humpback whale it is largely unknown when whales migrate most will travel from arctic or antarctic into tropics to mate calve and raise during winter and spring they will migrate back to poles in warmer summer months so calf can continue growing while mother can continue eating as they fast in breeding grounds one exception to this is southern right whale which migrates to patagonia and western new zealand to calve both are well out of tropic zone sleep unlike most animals whales are conscious breathers all mammals sleep but whales cannot afford to become unconscious for long because they may drown while knowledge of sleep in wild cetaceans is limited toothed cetaceans in captivity have been recorded to sleep with one side of their brain at a time so that they may swim breathe consciously and avoid both predators and social contact during their period of rest a 2008 study found that sperm whales sleep in vertical postures just under surface in passive shallow drift dives generally during day during which whales do not respond to passing vessels unless they are in contact leading to suggestion that whales possibly sleep during such dives ecology foraging and predation thumb upright polar bear with remains of a beluga all whales are carnivorous and predatory odontocetes as a whole mostly feed on fish and cephalopods and then followed by crustaceans and bivalves all species are generalist and opportunistic feeders mysticetes as a whole mostly feed on krill and plankton followed by crustaceans and other invertebrates a few are specialists examples include blue whale which eats almost exclusively krill minke whale which eats mainly schooling fish sperm whale which specialize on squid and grey whale which feed on bottom dwelling invertebrates elaborate baleen teeth of filter feeding species mysticetes allow them to remove water before they swallow their planktonic food by using teeth as a sieve usually whales hunt solitarily but they do sometimes hunt cooperatively in small groups former behaviour is typical when hunting non schooling fish slow moving or immobile invertebrates or endothermic prey when large amounts of prey are available whales such as certain mysticetes hunt cooperatively in small groups some cetaceans may forage with other kinds of animals such as other species of whales or certain species of pinnipeds large whales such as mysticetes are not usually subject to predation but smaller whales such as monodontids or ziphiids are these species are preyed on by killer whale or orca to subdue and kill whales orcas continuously ram them with their heads this can sometimes kill bowhead whales or severely injure them other times they corral narwhals or belugas before striking they are typically hunted by groups of 10 or fewer orcas but they are seldom attacked by an individual calves are more commonly taken by orcas but adults can be targeted as well these small whales are also targeted by terrestrial and predators polar bear is well adapted for hunting arctic whales and calves bears are known to use sit and wait tactics as well as active stalking and pursuit of prey on ice or water whales lessen chance of predation by gathering in groups this however means less room around breathing hole as ice slowly closes gap when out at sea whales dive out of reach of surface hunting orcas polar bear attacks on belugas and narwhals are usually successful in winter but rarely inflict any damage in summer whale pump thumb whale pump role played by whales in recycling ocean nutrients a 2010 study considered whales to be a positive influence to productivity of ocean fisheries in what has been termed a whale pump whales carry nutrients such as nitrogen from depths back to surface this functions as an upward biological pump reversing an earlier presumption that whales accelerate loss of nutrients to bottom this nitrogen input in gulf of maine is more than input of all rivers combined emptying into gulf some each year whales defecate at ocean s surface their excrement is important for fisheries because it is rich in iron and nitrogen whale faeces are liquid and instead of sinking they stay at surface where phytoplankton feed off it whale fall upon death whale carcasses fall to deep ocean and provide a substantial habitat for marine life evidence of whale falls in present day and fossil records shows that deep sea whale falls support a rich assemblage of creatures with a global diversity of 407 species comparable to other neritic biodiversity hotspots such as cold seeps and hydrothermal vents deterioration of whale carcasses happens though a series of three stages initially moving organisms such as sharks and hagfish scavenge soft tissues at a rapid rate over a period of months and as long as two years this is followed by colonization of bones and surrounding sediments which contain organic matter by enrichment opportunists such as crustaceans and polychaetes throughout a period of years finally bacteria reduce bones releasing hydrogen sulfide enabling growth of chemoautotrophic organisms which in turn support other organisms such as mussels clams limpets and sea snails this stage may last for decades and supports a rich assemblage of species averaging 185 species per site relationship with humans whaling thumb whale fishing woodcut by paris 1574 thumb dutch whalers near spitsbergen their most successful port

harpoons to spear bigger animals from boats out at sea people from norway and japan started hunting whales around 2000 b c whales are typically hunted for their meat and blubber by aboriginal groups they used baleen for baskets or roofing and made tools and masks out of bones inuit hunted whales in arctic ocean started whaling as early as 11th century sailing as far as newfoundland in 16th century in search of right whales 18th and 19th century whalers hunted whales mainly for their oil which was used as lamp fuel and a lubricant baleen or whalebone which was used for items such as corsets and skirt hoops and ambergris which was used as a fixative for perfumes most successful whaling nations at this time were netherlands japan and united states commercial whaling was historically important as an industry well throughout 17th 18th and 19th centuries whaling was at that time a sizeable european industry with ships from britain france spain denmark netherlands and germany sometimes collaborating to hunt whales in arctic sometimes in competition leading even to war by early 1790s whalers namely americans and australians focused efforts in south pacific where they mainly hunted sperm whales and right whales with catches of up to 39 000 right whales by americans alone by 1853 us profits reached us 11 000 000 5m equivalent to us 348 000 000 today most profitable year for american whaling industry commonly exploited species included north atlantic right whales sperm whales which were mainly hunted by americans bowhead whales which were mainly hunted by dutch common minke whales blue whales and grey whales scale of whale harvesting decreased substantially after 1982 when international whaling commission iwc placed a moratorium which set a catch limit for each country excluding aboriginal groups until 2004 current whaling nations are norway iceland and japan despite their joining to iwc as well as aboriginal communities of siberia alaska and northern canada subsistence hunters typically use whale products for themselves and depend on them for survival national and international authorities have given special treatment to aboriginal hunters since their methods of hunting are seen as less destructive and wasteful this distinction is being questioned as these aboriginal groups are using more modern weaponry and mechanized transport to hunt with and are selling whale products in marketplace some anthropologists argue that term subsistence should also apply to these cash based exchanges as long as they take place within local production and consumption in 1946 iwc placed a moratorium limiting annual whale catch since then yearly profits for these subsistence hunters have been close to us 31 million per year other threats whales can also be threatened by humans more indirectly they are unintentionally caught in fishing nets by commercial fisheries as bycatch and accidentally swallow fishing hooks gillnetting and seine netting is a significant cause of mortality in whales and other marine mammals species commonly entangled include beaked whales whales are also affected by marine pollution high levels of organic chemicals accumulate in these animals since they are high in food chain they have large reserves of blubber more so for toothed whales as they are higher up food chain than baleen whales lactating mothers can pass toxins on to their young these pollutants can cause gastrointestinal cancers and greater vulnerability to infectious diseases they can also be poisoned by swallowing litter such as plastic bags advanced military sonar harms whales sonar interferes with basic biological functions of whales such as feeding and mating by impacting their ability to echolocate whales swim in response to sonar and sometimes experience decompression sickness due to rapid changes in depth mass strandings have been triggered by sonar activity resulting in injury or death references prior to 2010

eastern coast of greenland and 178 on their western coast 10 fin whales from west coast of greenland nine humpback whales from west coast of greenland and 20 off st vincent and grenadines each year several species that were commercially exploited have rebounded in numbers for example grey whales may be as numerous as they were prior to harvesting but north atlantic population is functionally extinct conversely north atlantic right whale was extirpated from much of its former range which stretched across north atlantic and only remains in small fragments along coast of canada greenland and is considered functionally extinct along european coastline iwc has designated two whale sanctuaries southern ocean whale sanctuary and indian ocean whale sanctuary southern ocean whale sanctuary

major part in shaping art forms of many coastal civilizations such as norse with some dating to stone age petroglyphs off a cliff face in south korea show 300 depictions of various animals a third of which are whales some show particular detail in which there are throat pleats typical of rorquals these petroglyphs show these people of around 7 000 to 3 500 b c e in south korea had a very high dependency on whales pacific islanders and australian aborigines viewed whales as bringers of good and joy one exception is french polynesia where in many parts cetaceans are met with great brutality in vietnam and ghana among other places whales hold a sense of divinity they are so respected in their cultures that they occasionally hold funerals for beached whales a throwback to vietnam s ancient sea based austro asiatic culture god of seas according to chinese folklore was a large whale with human limbs whales have also played a role in sacred texts such as bible it mentions whales in genesis 1 21 job 7 12 and ezekiel 32 2 leviathan described at length in job 41 1 34 is generally understood to refer to a whale sea monsters in lamentations 4 3 have been taken by some to refer to marine mammals in particular whales although most modern versions use word jackals instead story of jonah being swallowed by a great fish is told both in qur an and in bible a medieval column capital
