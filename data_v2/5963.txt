deep vein thrombosis dvt is formation of a blood clot in a deep vein most commonly legs symptoms may include pain swelling redness or warmth of affected area about half of cases have no symptoms complications may include pulmonary embolism as a result of detachment of a clot which travels to lungs and post thrombotic syndrome together dvt and pulmonary embolism are known as venous thromboembolism vte risk factors include recent surgery cancer trauma lack of movement obesity smoking hormonal birth control pregnancy and period following birth antiphospholipid syndrome and certain genetic conditions genetic factors include deficiencies of antithrombin protein c and protein s and factor v leiden mutation underlying mechanism typically involves some combination of decreased blood flow rate increased tendency to clot and injury to blood vessel wall individuals suspected of having dvt may be assessed using a clinical prediction rule such as wells score a d dimer test may also be used to assist with excluding diagnosis or to signal a need for further testing diagnosis is most commonly confirmed by ultrasound of suspected veins anticoagulation blood thinners is standard treatment typical medications include low molecular weight heparin warfarin or a direct oral anticoagulant wearing graduated compression stockings may reduce risk of post thrombotic syndrome preventive efforts following surgery may include frequent walking calf exercises aspirin anticoagulants graduated compression stockings or intermittent pneumatic compression rate of dvts increases from childhood to old age in adulthood about one in 1000 adults are affected per year about 5 of people are affected by a vte at some point in time signs and symptoms thumb illustration depicting a deep vein thrombosis common signs and symptoms of dvt include pain or tenderness swelling warmth redness or discoloration and of surface veins although about half of those with condition have no symptoms signs and symptoms alone are not sufficiently sensitive or specific to make a diagnosis but when considered in conjunction with known risk factors can help determine likelihood of dvt in most suspected cases dvt is ruled out after evaluation and symptoms are more often due to other causes such as baker s cyst musculoskeletal injury or lymphedema other differential diagnoses include hematoma tumors venous or arterial aneurysms and connective tissue disorders phlegmasia alba dolens and phlegmasia cerulea dolens occur when a dvt is very large and causes significant obstruction of veins complete or near complete occlusion in former affected leg is white and painful as congestion is so severe that arterial blood supply is reduced in latter arterial supply is reduced to point that there is a blue tinge and venous gangrene may develop generally with severe pain surgery may be required in this setting causes thumb incision for a completed knee replacement surgery a procedure that can predispose people to a dvt three factors of virchow s triad venous stasis and changes in endothelial blood vessel lining such as physical damage or endothelial activation contribute to dvt and are used to explain its formation other related causes include activation of immune system components state of microparticles in blood concentration of oxygen and possible platelet activation various risk factors contribute to dvt though many at high risk never develop it acquired risk factors include strong risk factor of older age which alters blood composition to favor clotting other important acquired risk factors include major surgery and trauma both of which may increase risk because of tissue factor from outside vascular system entering blood in orthopedic surgery venous stasis may be temporarily provoked by a cessation of blood flow as part of procedure cancer can grow in and around veins causing venous stasis and can also stimulate increased levels of tissue factor pregnancy causes blood to favor clotting and in postpartum placental tearing releases substances that favor clotting oral contraceptives and hormonal replacement therapy increase risk through a variety of mechanisms including altered blood coagulation protein levels and reduced fibrinolysis disease term venous thromboembolism vte includes development of either dvt or pulmonary embolism pe genetic factors that increase risk of vte include deficiencies of three proteins that normally prevent blood from clotting protein c protein s and antithrombin in addition to non o blood type and mutations in factor v and prothrombin genes deficiencies in antithrombin protein c and protein s are rare but strong or moderately strong risk factors these three thrombophilia increase risk of vte by about 10 times factor v leiden which makes factor v resistant to inactivation by activated protein c and genetic variant prothrombin g20210a which causes increased prothrombin levels are predominantly expressed in caucasians they moderately increase risk for vte by three to eight times for factor v leiden and two to three times for prothrombin g20210a having a non o blood type roughly doubles vte risk non o blood type is common in all races making it an important risk factor individuals without o blood type have higher blood levels of von willebrand factor and factor viii than those with o blood type increasing likelihood of clotting some risk factors influence location of dvt within body in isolated distal dvt profile of risk factors appears distinct from proximal dvt transient factors such as surgery and immobilization appear to dominate whereas and age do not seem to increase risk in upper extremity dvt most important risk factor is having a central venous catheter and thoracic outlet syndrome also increases risk risk factors thumb femoral vein in thigh iliac veins in pelvis and inferior vena cava in abdomen are places of potential dvt extension acquired older age obesity major surgery and orthopedic surgery cancers especially of bone ovary brain pancreas and lymphomas inactivity and immobilization as with orthopedic casts sitting travel bed rest and hospitalization pregnancy and postpartum period trauma minor leg injury and lower limb amputation previous vte combined oral contraceptives hormonal replacement therapy central venous catheters inflammatory diseases some autoimmune diseases antiphospholipid syndrome nephrotic syndrome infection hiv polycythemia vera chemotherapy intravenous drug use inherited antithrombin deficiency protein c deficiency protein s deficiency type i factor v leiden prothrombin g20210a non o blood type mixed low free protein s activated protein c resistance high factor viii levels high levels high factor ix levels high factor xi levels pathophysiology right upright 1 5 thumb coagulation system often described as a cascade consists of a group of proteins that interact to form a blood clot dvt risk is increased by abnormalities in cascade regulators antithrombin and activated protein c apc are shown in green above blood s clotting factors they affect dvt often develops in calf veins and grows in direction of venous flow towards heart when dvt does not grow it can be cleared naturally and dissolved into blood fibrinolysis veins in calf or thigh are most commonly affected including femoral vein popliteal vein and iliofemoral vein as with may syndrome extensive lower extremity dvt can reach into iliac vein of pelvis or inferior vena cava occasionally veins of arm are affected as after central venous catheter placement and with rare paget schrotter disease mechanism behind arterial thrombosis such as with heart attacks is more established than steps that cause venous thrombosis with arterial thrombosis blood vessel wall damage is required as it initiates coagulation but clotting in veins mostly occurs without any such damage beginning of venous thrombosis is thought to be caused by tissue factor which leads to conversion of prothrombin to thrombin followed by fibrin deposition red blood cells and fibrin are main components of venous and fibrin appears to attach to blood vessel wall lining endothelium a surface that normally acts to prevent clotting platelets and white blood cells are also components platelets are not as prominent in venous clots as they are in arterial ones but they may play a role inflammation is associated with vte and white blood cells play a role in formation and resolution of venous clots often dvt begins in valves of veins blood flow pattern in valves can cause low oxygen concentrations in blood hypoxemia of a valve sinus hypoxemia which is worsened by venous stasis activates pathways ones that include hypoxia inducible factor 1 and early growth response protein 1 hypoxemia also results in production of reactive oxygen species which can activate these pathways as well as nuclear factor kb which regulates hypoxia inducible factor 1 transcription hypoxia inducible factor 1 and early growth response protein 1 contribute to association with endothelial proteins such as p selectin prompting monocytes to release tissue factor filled which presumably begin clotting after binding to endothelial surface deep vein thrombosis occurs in upper extremities in about 4 10 of cases generally in people with severe underlying diseases especially cancer diagnosis dvt diagnosis requires use of imaging devices such as ultrasound clinical assessments which predict dvt likelihood can help determine if a d dimer test is useful in those not highly likely to have dvt a normal d dimer result can rule out a diagnosis a ruptured baker s cyst can mimic presentation of a deep vein thrombosis classification provoked dvts occur in association with acquired risk factors such as surgery oral contraceptives trauma immobility obesity or cancer cases without acquired states are called unprovoked or idiopathic acute dvt is characterized by pain and swelling and is usually occlusive which means that it obstructs blood flow whereas non occlusive dvt is less symptomatic label chronic has been applied to symptomatic dvt that persists longer than 10 to 14 days dvt that has no symptoms but is found only by screening is labeled asymptomatic or incidental dvt in legs is proximal or iliofemoral when above knee and distal or calf when below knee dvt below popliteal vein a proximal vein behind knee is classified as distal and has limited clinical significance compared to proximal dvt an initial episode of dvt is called incident and any subsequent dvt is termed recurrent bilateral dvt refers to clots in both legs while unilateral means that only a single leg is affected probability thumb swelling in leg from fluid edema can result in pitting after pressure is applied this person did not have dvt in those with suspected dvt a clinical assessment of probability can be useful to determine which tests to perform guyatt et al 2012 p 16s 3 1 most studied clinical prediction rule is wells score wells score or criteria possible score 2 to 9 active cancer treatment within last 6 months or palliative 1 point calf swelling 3 cm compared to asymptomatic calf measured 10 cm below tibial 1 point swollen unilateral superficial veins non varicose in symptomatic leg 1 point unilateral pitting edema in symptomatic leg 1 point previous documented dvt 1 point swelling of entire leg 1 point localized tenderness along deep venous system 1 point paralysis paresis or recent cast immobilization of lower extremities 1 point recently bedridden 3 days or major surgery requiring regional or general anesthetic in past 12 weeks 1 point alternative diagnosis at least as likely 2 points those with wells scores of two or more have a 28 chance of having dvt those with a lower score have 6 probability alternatively wells scores can be categorized as high if greater than two moderate if one or two and low if less than one with of 53 17 and 5 respectively d dimer d dimers are a fibrin degradation product and an elevated level can result from plasmin dissolving a clot or other conditions hospitalized patients often have elevated levels for multiple reasons when individuals are at a high probability of having dvt diagnostic imaging is preferred to a d dimer test guyatt et al 2012 p 17s 3 4 for those with a low or moderate probability of dvt a d dimer level might be obtained which excludes a diagnosis if results are normal an elevated level requires further investigation with diagnostic imaging to confirm or exclude diagnosis for a suspected first leg dvt in a low probability situation american college of chest physicians recommends testing either d dimer levels with moderate or high sensitivity or compression ultrasound of proximal veins these options are suggested over whole leg ultrasound and d dimer testing is suggested preference overall uk national institute for health and care excellence nice recommends d dimer testing prior to proximal vein ultrasound for a suspected first leg dvt in a moderate probability scenario a high sensitivity d dimer is suggested as a recommended option over ultrasound imaging with both whole leg and compression ultrasound possible guyatt et al 2012 p 16s 3 3 nice guideline uses a two point wells score and does not refer to a moderate probability group imaging imaging tests of veins are used in diagnosis of dvt most commonly either proximal compression ultrasound or whole leg ultrasound each technique has drawbacks a single proximal scan may miss a distal dvt while whole leg scanning can lead to distal dvt doppler ultrasound guyatt et al 2012 p 19s 5 3 6 1 ct scan venography mri venography or mri of thrombus are also possibilities guyatt et al 2012 p 16s 3 2 ultrasonography for suspected deep vein thrombosis has a sensitivity of 97 in detecting dvts of proximal legs gold standard for judging imaging methods is contrast venography which involves injecting a peripheral vein of affected limb with a contrast agent and taking x rays to reveal whether venous supply has been obstructed because of its cost invasiveness availability and other limitations this test is rarely performed in one study it found a dvt in an additional 20 of patients with pulmonary embolism where an ultrasonography was negative prevention thumb american college of chest physicians suggested graduated compression stockings for at risk travelers and some hospital patients depending upon risk for dvt different preventive measures are recommended walking and calf exercises reduce venous stasis because leg muscle contractions compress veins and pump blood up towards heart in immobile individuals physical compression methods improve blood flow anticoagulation which increases risk of bleeding might be used in high risk scenarios risk of major bleeding with long term anticoagulation is about 3 per year and point where annual vte risk is thought to warrant long term anticoagulation is estimated to be between 3 and 9 usually only when individuals exceed a 9 annual vte risk is long term anticoagulation a common consideration antithrombin deficiency a strong or moderately strong risk factor carries an annual risk of vte of only 0 8 1 5 as such asymptomatic individuals with thrombophilia do not warrant long term anticoagulation guyatt et al 2012 p 11s 7 1 aside from anticoagulation antiplatelet drug aspirin might be used in some people following orthopedic surgery and in those with a previous vte statins might decrease risk for people who are otherwise healthy but evidence is not clear following completion of warfarin long term aspirin is useful to prevent re occurrence hospital in 2011 american college of physicians acp issued a clinical practice guideline making three strong recommendations based on moderate quality evidence that hospitalized patients be assessed for their risk of thromboembolism and bleeding before prophylaxis is started that heparin or a related drug be used if potential benefits are thought to outweigh potential harms and that graduated compression stockings not be used acp also drew attention to a lack of support for any performance measures encouraging physicians to apply universal prophylaxis without regard to risks a 2014 cochrane review found that using heparin in medical patients did not change risk of death or pulmonary embolism while its use decreased people s risks of dvts it also increased people s risks of major bleeding review thus recommended need to balance risks and benefits 2012 accp guidelines for patients recommend anticoagulation for acutely ill in cases of elevated risk when neither bleeding nor a high risk of bleeding exists guyatt et al 2012 p 10s 2 3 2 4 2 7 1 mechanical prophylaxis is suggested when risks for bleeding and thrombosis are elevated guyatt et al 2012 p 10s 2 7 2 for critically ill either pharmacological or mechanical prophylaxis is suggested depending upon risk guyatt et al 2012 pp 10s 11s 3 4 3 3 4 4 heparin is suggested in outpatients with cancer who have solid tumors and additional risk factors for vte listed as previous venous thrombosis immobilization hormonal therapy angiogenesis inhibitors thalidomide and and a low risk of bleeding guyatt et al 2012 p 11s 4 2 2 after surgery major orthopedic surgery total hip replacement total knee replacement or hip fracture surgery has a high risk of causing vte if prophylaxis is not used after these surgeries symptomatic vte has about a 4 chance of developing within 35 days options for vte prevention in people following surgery include early walking mechanical prophylaxis intermittent pneumatic compression or graduated compression stockings and drugs low molecular weight heparin and low dose unfractionated heparin depending upon risk of vte risk of major bleeding and person s preferences following major orthopedic surgery accp recommends treatment with drugs that reduce risk of clots such as fondaparinux and aspirin with low molecular weight heparin lmwh suggested as a preference intermittent pneumatic compression is also an option graduated compression stockings are effective after both general and orthopedic surgery pregnancy thumb warfarin a common vka is suggested only after childbirth in some at risk women risk of vte is increased in pregnancy by about five times because of a more hypercoagulable state a likely adaptation against fatal postpartum hemorrhage additionally pregnant women with genetic risk factors are subject to a roughly three to 30 times increased risk for vte preventative treatments for pregnancy related vte in hypercoagulable women were suggested by accp homozygous carriers of factor v leiden or prothrombin g20210a with a family history of vte were suggested for lmwh and either lmwh or a vitamin k antagonist vka for six weeks following childbirth those with another thrombophilia and a family history but no previous vte were suggested for watchful waiting during pregnancy and lmwh or for those without protein c or s deficiency a vka homozygous carriers of factor v leiden or prothrombin g20210a with no personal or family history of vte were suggested for watchful waiting during pregnancy and lmwh or a vka for six weeks after childbirth those with another thrombophilia but no family or personal history of vte were suggested for watchful waiting only guyatt et al 2012 pp 39s 40s 3 0 warfarin a common vka can cause harm to fetus and is not used for vte prevention during pregnancy guyatt et al 2012 p 38s 3 0 1 travelers 2012 accp guidelines offered weak recommendations for at risk long haul travelers those with previous vte recent surgery or trauma active malignancy pregnancy estrogen use advanced age limited mobility severe obesity or known disorder suggestions included calf exercises frequent walking and aisle seating in airplanes to ease walking guyatt et al 2012 p 11s 6 1 1 6 1 2 use of graduated compression stockings that fit below knee and give 15 30 mm hg of pressure to ankle was suggested while aspirin or anticoagulants were not guyatt et al 2012 p 11s 6 1 2 6 1 3 compression stockings have sharply reduced levels of asymptomatic dvt in airline passengers but effect on symptomatic vte is unknown as none of individuals studied developed symptomatic vte treatment anticoagulation anticoagulation which prevents further coagulation but does not act directly on existing clots is standard treatment for dvt balancing risk vs benefit is important in determining duration of anticoagulation and three months is generally standard length of treatment in those with an annual risk of vte in excess of 9 as after an unprovoked episode extended anticoagulation is a possibility those who finish vka treatment after idiopathic vte with an elevated d dimer level show an increased risk of recurrent vte about 9 vs about 4 for normal results and this result might be used in clinical decision making thrombophilia test results rarely play a role in length of treatment two forms of direct oral anticoagulants have been developed oral direct thrombin inhibitors dti and oral factor xa inhibitors which may be an effective and safe alternative to warfarin for acute dvt for acute cases in leg accp recommended a parenteral anticoagulant such as lmwh fondaparinux or unfractionated heparin for at least five days and a vka oral anticoagulant same day lmwh and fondaparinux are suggested over unfractionated heparin but both are retained in those with compromised kidney function unlike unfractionated heparin guyatt et al 2012 p 20s 2 5 1 vka is generally taken for a minimum of three et al 2012 pp 20s 21s 3 1 to maintain an international normalized ratio of 2 0 3 0 with 2 5 as target guyatt et al 2012 p 22s 3 2 benefit of taking a vka declines as duration of treatment extends and risk of bleeding increases with age accp recommended treatment for three months in those with proximal dvt provoked by surgery guyatt et al 2012 p 21s 3 1 1 a three month course is also recommended for those with proximal dvt provoked by a transient risk factor and three months is suggested over lengthened treatment when bleeding risk is low to moderate guyatt et al 2012 p 21s 3 1 2 unprovoked dvt patients should have at least three months of anticoagulation and be considered for extended treatment guyatt et al 2012 p 22s 3 1 4 those whose first vte is an unprovoked proximal dvt are suggested for anticoagulation longer than three months unless there is a high risk of bleeding guyatt et al 2012 p 22s 3 1 4 1 in that case three months is sufficient guyatt et al 2012 p 22s 3 1 4 2 those with a second unprovoked vte are recommended for extended treatment when bleeding risk is low suggested for extended treatment when bleeding risk is moderate guyatt et al 2012 p 22s 3 1 4 4 and suggested for three months of anticoagulation in high risk scenarios guyatt et al 2012 p 22s 3 1 4 5 stockings walking and repeat imaging accp recommended initial home treatment instead of hospital treatment for those with acute leg dvt this applies as long as individuals feel ready for it and those with severe leg symptoms or would not qualify an appropriate home environment is expected one that can provide a quick return to hospital if necessary support from family or friends and phone access guyatt et al 2012 p 21s 2 7 in addition to anticoagulation accp suggested graduated compression stockings which apply higher pressure 30 40 mm hg at ankles and a lower pressure around knees for those with symptomatic dvt guyatt et al 2012 p 23s 4 1 use should begin as soon as possible after anticoagulation evidence however does not support that these stockings reduce risk of post thrombotic syndrome nor do they indicate a reduction in recurrent vte use is suggested for two years though inconvenience and discomfort can reduce compliance walking is also suggested for those without severe pain or edema guyatt et al 2012 p 21s 2 14 unless a person has medical problems preventing movement after a person starts anti coagulation therapy bed rest should not be used to treat acute deep vein thrombosis which cites there are clinical benefits associated with walking and no evidence that walking is harmful but people with dvt are harmed by bed rest except when it is medically necessary instead of anticoagulation a follow up imaging test typically ultrasound about one week post diagnosis is an option for those with an acute isolated distal dvt without a high risk for extension if clot does not grow accp does not recommend anticoagulation this technique can benefit those at a high risk for bleeding patients may choose anticoagulation over serial imaging however to avoid inconvenience of another scan if concerns about risk of bleeding are insignificant guyatt et al 2012 p 20s 2 3 when applied to symptomatic patients with a negative initial ultrasound result serial testing is inefficient and not cost effective ivc filters thrombolysis and thrombectomy thumb an ivc filter inferior vena cava filters ivc filters are used on presumption that they reduce pe although their effectiveness and safety profile are not well established in general they are only recommended in some high risk scenarios accp recommended them for those with a contraindication to anticoagulant treatment but not in addition to anticoagulation unless an individual with an ivc filter but without a risk for bleeding develops acute proximal dvt in this case both anticoagulation and an ivc filter are suggested guyatt et al 2012 p 21s 2 13 1 3 nice recommends filters in settings where someone with an acute proximal dvt or pe cannot receive anticoagulation and that filter is removed when anticoagulation can be safely started while ivc filters themselves are associated with a long term risk of dvt they are not reason enough to maintain extended anticoagulation guyatt et al 2012 p 21s 2 13 thrombolysis is administration of an enzyme intravenous or directly into affected vein through a catheter which acts to enzymatically break up clots this may reduce risk of post thrombotic syndrome by a third and possibly reduce risk of leg ulcers but is associated with a small increased risk of bleeding accp currently suggests anticoagulation rather than thrombolysis but patients may choose thrombolysis if prevention of post thrombotic syndrome outweighs concerns over complexity bleeding risk and cost of procedure guyatt et al 2012 p 21s 2 9 2 10 nice recommends that thrombolysis is considered in those who have had symptoms for less than two weeks are normally well have a good life expectancy and a low risk of bleeding a mechanical thrombectomy device can remove venous clots although accp considers it an option only when following conditions apply iliofemoral dvt symptoms for 7 days criterion used in single randomized trial good functional status life expectancy of 1 year and both resources and expertise are available anticoagulation alone is suggested over thrombectomy guyatt et al 2012 p 21s 2 11 prognosis most frequent complication of proximal dvt is post thrombotic syndrome which is caused by a reduction in return of venous blood to heart some symptoms of post thrombotic syndrome are pain edema paresthesia and in severe cases leg ulcers an estimated 20 50 of those with dvt will develop it and 5 10 will develop severe form pe is most serious complication of proximal dvt and risk of pe is higher when clots are present in thigh and pelvis distal dvt itself is hardly if ever associated with post thrombotic syndrome or pe untreated lower extremity dvt has a 3 pe related mortality rate while deaths associated with upper extremity dvt are extremely rare presence of a remaining thrombus after a dvt occurs in a minority of people and it increases risk of recurrence though to a lesser extent than an elevated d dimer in 10 years following a dvt approximately a third of individuals will have a recurrent episode a seemingly unprovoked vte might suggest presence of an undiagnosed cancer epidemiology about 1 in 1000 adults per year has dvt but as of 2011 available data are dominated by north american and european populations vte is rare in children with an incidence of about 1 in 100 000 a year from childhood to old age incidence increases by a factor of about 1000 with almost 1 of elderly experiencing vte yearly during pregnancy and after childbirth acute vte occurs about once per 1000 deliveries after surgery with preventative treatment vte develops in about 10 of 1000 people after total or partial knee replacement and in about 5 of 1000 after total or partial hip replacement about 300 000 600 000 americans develop vte each year with about 60 000 100 000 deaths attributable to pe in england an estimated 25 000 a year die from hospital related vte for unclear reasons people of asian descent have a lower vte risk than whites in north american and european populations around 4 8 of people have a thrombophilia most commonly factor v leiden and prothrombin g20210a for populations in china japan and thailand in protein s protein c and antithrombin predominate non o blood type is present in around 50 of general population and varies with ethnicity and it is present in about 70 of those with vte altogether global data is incomplete history thumb rudolf virchow earliest case of dvt was described by sushruta in his book sushruta samhita around 600 900 bc another documented case is thought to have occurred in 13th century in leg of a 20 year old male at some point increased incidence of dvt in women after childbirth was noticed and in late 1700s a public health recommendation was issued to encourage women to breastfeed as a means to prevent this phenomenon dvt was called milk leg as it was thought to result from milk building up in leg in 1856 german physician and pathologist rudolf virchow published what is referred to as virchow s triad three major causes of thrombosis triad provides theoretical framework for current explanation of venous thrombosis although it was focused on effect of a foreign body in venous system and conditions required for clot propagation multiple pharmacological therapies for dvt were introduced in 20th century oral anticoagulants in 1940s subcutaneous in 1962 and subcutaneous lmwh in 1982 diagnoses were commonly performed by impedance in 1970s and 1980s but use of doppler ultrasound techniques with their increased sensitivity and specificity largely superseded this method economics initial dvt costs for an average hospitalized patient in u s are around 7 700 10 800 vte follow up costs at three months six months and a year are about 5 000 10 000 and 33 000 respectively in europe three and six month figures are about eur1 800 and eur3 200 post thrombotic syndrome is a significant contributor to dvt follow up costs annual dvt costs in u s are an estimated 5 billion or in excess of 8 billion and average annual cost per treated individual is thought to be about 20 000 as an example if 300 000 symptomatic dvt patients were treated at costs averaging 20 000 annually that would cost 6 billion a year research directions as of 2011 three large randomized controlled trials norwegian trial north american attract trial and dutch cava trial are studying effectiveness and safety of catheter directed thrombolysis in 2012 two studies found a clinical benefit in taking aspirin to prevent recurrent
