flushing main street signed as main street on entrances and pillars and main st flushing on overhead signs is northern terminal station on irt flushing line of new york city subway located at main street and roosevelt avenue in downtown section of flushing queens it is served by at all times and 7 train rush hours in peak direction flushing main street station was originally built as part of dual contracts between interborough rapid transit company irt and brooklyn manhattan transit corporation bmt it opened on january 21 1928 completing segment of flushing line in queens although plans existed for line to be extended east of station such an extension was never built station was renovated in 1990s in 2018 it was busiest single subway station in queens busiest station outside of manhattan and 11th busiest subway station in system history planning and construction thumb left upright 1 1 one of escalators in eastern entrance 1910 dual contracts called for extending irt and bmt lines to brooklyn queens and bronx owing to queens lack of development at time it did not receive many new irt and bmt lines compared to brooklyn and bronx since new york public service commission psc wanted to alleviate subway crowding in other two boroughs first before building in queens irt flushing line was to be one of two dual contracts lines in borough and it would connect flushing and long island city two of queens oldest settlements to manhattan via steinway tunnel when majority of line was built in early 1910s most of route went through undeveloped land and roosevelt avenue had not been constructed community leaders advocated for more dual contracts lines to be built in queens to allow development there at time of line s planning downtown flushing was a quiet dutch colonial style village what is now roosevelt avenue in area was known as amity street a major commercial thoroughfare in neighborhood in late 1912 flushing community groups were petitioning public service commission psc to depress proposed line in flushing into a subway tunnel rather than an elevated line unlike a subway an el would cause disturbances to quality of life and a loss in nearby property values as well as a widening of amity street that would cause more changes to already existing town one amity street property owner compared planned effect of an elevated flushing line on amity street to degradation of myrtle avenue in brooklyn after myrtle avenue elevated was built there on other hand a subway would only require that street be widened even though it was more expensive than an elevated of same length on january 20 1913 because of these concerns flushing association voted to demand that any irt station in flushing be built underground due to advocacy for elevated extensions to line past flushing see psc vacillated on whether to build a subway or elevated for next few months psc finally voted to bring flushing portion of line underground in april 1913 however as costs of a subway had increased by then they decided to postpone discussion of matter in june 1913 new york city board of estimate voted to allow line to be extended from 103rd street corona plaza east to flushing as a three track line with a possible two track second phase to bayside flushing line west of 103rd street opened in 1917 irt agreed to operate line under condition that any loss of profits would be repaid by city as part of agreement psc would build line eastward to at least flushing station as well as two other stations at willets point boulevard and 111th street was approved in 1921 as part of an extension of flushing line past 103rd street construction of station and double deck bridge over flushing creek began on april 21 1923 with station built via cut and cover methods bridge was completed in 1927 and station opened on january 21 1928 over a decade after line initially began operation following station s opening downtown flushing evolved into a major commercial and transit center as development sprung around section of main street near station on april 24 1939 express trains began operating to and from station in conjunction with reconstruction of willets point station for 1939 world s fair due to high level of passenger use beginning in 1940 local residents requested an additional exit at east end of station and widening of existing staircases a new eastern entrance was added after world war ii ground broke on new entrance on november 5 1947 and it opened on october 28 1948 with two new street stairs and an additional token booth upon its initial opening new entrance did little to relieve crowding at main fare control area later years platforms at main street and all other stations on flushing line with exception of queensboro plaza were extended in 1955 1956 to accommodate 11 car trains platforms at queensboro plaza could already fit bmt trains so no extensions were built there a station renovation had been planned since 1970s in 1981 mta listed station among 69 most deteriorated stations in subway system mta finally found funding for station s renovation in 1994 at expense of renovations of 15 other stations including three franklin avenue line stations and atlantic avenue pacific street roosevelt avenue 74th street and 161st street yankee stadium station complexes because station was a vital station for commuters from eastern queens between 1999 and 2000 station underwent a major renovation project renovation added an elevator near eastern lippmann plaza exit that made station compliant with americans with disabilities act of 1990 project also added new street entrances and a large entrance hall near lippmann plaza at far east end of station beyond bumper blocks at end of tracks flushing main street station has been listed on national register of historic places since october 2004 national park service listed station because it was considered a good historic example of squire j vickers architecture during time of construction proposed extension of line thumb right upright 1 1 flushing line tunnel portal at college point boulevard station was not intended to be flushing line s terminus while controversy over an elevated line in flushing was ongoing in january 1913 whitestone improvement association pushed for an elevated to whitestone college point and bayside however some members of that group wanted to oppose flushing line s construction if there was not going to be an extension to whitestone after january 20 vote to demand that subway line through flushing be built underground groups representing communities in south flushing collaborated to push for an elevated along what was then lirr s central branch in current right of way of kissena corridor park eleven days later psc announced its intent to extend line as an el from corona to flushing with a possible further extension to little neck bay in bayside there was consensus that line should not abruptly end in corona but even with extension to bayside borough would still have fewer dual contracts route mileage than either brooklyn or bronx new york times wrote that compared to bronx queens would have far less subway mileage per capita even with flushing extension bayside extension was tentatively approved in june 1913 but only after construction of initial extension to flushing under revised subway expansion plan put forth in december 1913 flushing line would be extended past main street along and or parallel to right of way of nearby port washington branch of lirr towards bell boulevard in bayside a spur line would branch off north along 149th street towards college point in 1914 psc chairman and commissioner committed to building line toward bayside however at time lirr and irt were administered separately and irt plan would require rebuilding a section of port washington branch between broadway and stations lirr moved to block irt extension past flushing since it would compete with port washington branch service in bayside one member of united civic association submitted a proposal to lirr to let irt use port washington branch to serve flushing and bayside using a connection between two lines in corona psc supported connection as an interim measure and on march 11 1915 it voted to let bayside connection be built subsequently engineers surveying planned intersection of lirr and irt lines found that irt land would not actually overlap with any lirr land lirr president at time ralph peters offered to lease port washington and whitestone branches to irt for rapid transit use for 250 000 annually excluding other maintenance costs lease would last for ten years with an option to extend lease by ten more years psc favored idea of irt being a lessee along these lines but did not know where to put corona connection even majority of groups in eastern queens supported lease plan only group who opposed lease agreement was flushing association who preferred original flushing subway plan afterward psc largely ignored lease plan since it was still focused on building first phase of dual contracts flushing business men s association kept advocating for amity street subway causing a schism between them and rest of groups that supported lirr lease through summer of 1915 psc and lirr negotiated planned lease to 125 000 a first year with an eight percent increase each year negotiations then stalled in 1916 whitestone improvement association impatient with pace of negotiations approved of subway under amity street even though it would not serve them directly psc s chief engineer wrote in a report that a combined 20 600 riders would use whitestone and bayside lines each day in either direction and that by 1927 there would be 34 000 riders per day per direction third ward rapid transit association wrote a report showing how much they had petitioned for flushing subway extensions to that point compared to how little progress they had made in doing so negotiations continued to be stalled in 1917 despite line not having been extended past corona yet idea of a subway extension to little neck encouraged development there whitestone branch would have had to be rebuilt if it were leased to subway with railroad crossings removed and single track doubled psc located 14 places where crossings needed to be eliminated however by early 1917 there was barely enough money to build subway to flushing let alone a link to whitestone and bayside a lease agreement was announced on october 16 1917 but irt withdrew from agreement a month later citing that it was inappropriate to enter such an agreement at that time thereafter psc instead turned its attention back to main street subway extension even after station opened in 1928 efforts to extend line past flushing persisted in 1928 new york city board of transportation bot proposed allowing irt trains to build a connection to use port washington branch but irt did not accept offer since this would entail upgrading railroad crossings and single tracked line subsequently lirr abandoned branch in 1932 as part of 1929 ind second system plan flushing line would have had branches to college point and bayside east of main street board of transportation of city of new york engineering department proposed additional rapid transit lines and proposed vehicular tunnel dated august 23 1929 that plan was revived in 1939 project for expanded rapid transit facilities new york city transit system dated july 5 1939 bot kept proposing an extension of flushing line past main street until 1945 when world war ii ended and new budgets did not allow for a flushing extension in 1956 queens chamber of commerce and queens transit committee again proposed extensions east of station to bayside and college point along with a new spur along kissena boulevard running south to sutphin boulevard in jamaica and eventually leading to john f kennedy international airport since then several new york city transit authority proposals for an eastward extension have all failed station layout thumb left upright 1 1 eastern entrance s waiting area station has three tracks and two relatively narrow island platforms
