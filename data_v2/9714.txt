green iguana iguana iguana also known as american iguana is a large arboreal mostly herbivorous species of lizard of genus iguana usually this animal is simply called iguana green iguana ranges over a large geographic area it is native from southern brazil and paraguay as far north as mexico and caribbean islands and have been introduced from south america to puerto rico and are very common throughout island where they are colloquially known as gallina de palo bamboo chicken or chicken of trees and considered an invasive species in united states feral populations also exist in south florida including florida keys hawaii u s virgin islands and rio grande valley of texas a herbivore it has adapted significantly with regard to locomotion and osmoregulation as a result of its diet it grows to in length from head to tail although a few specimens have grown more than with upward of commonly found in captivity as a pet due to its calm disposition and bright colors it can be very demanding to care for properly space requirements and need for special lighting and heat can prove challenging to hobbyist taxonomy and etymology species was first officially described by swedish botanist carl linnaeus in 1758 in two centuries since then numerous subspecies have been identified but later classified as merely regional variants of same species using nuclear and mitochondrial dna sequence data to explore phylogenic history of green iguana scientists from el salvador mexico and united states studied animals collected from 17 different countries topology of phylogeny indicated that species originated in south america and eventually radiated through central america and caribbean study revealed no unique mitochondrial dna haplotypes for subspecific status but did indicate deep lineage divergence between central and south american populations word iguana is derived from a spanish form of name for species in some spanish speaking countries males of species are referred to as or and juveniles are called or distribution and habitat thumb left green iguana in maracaibo native range of green iguana extends from southern mexico to central brazil dominican republic paraguay and bolivia and caribbean specifically grenada aruba curacao trinidad and tobago st lucia st vincent and utila they have been introduced to grand cayman puerto rico texas florida hawaii and u s virgin islands scholar search furthermore green iguanas colonised island of anguilla in 1995 after being washed ashore following a hurricane though species is not native to martinique a small wild colony of released or escaped green iguanas endures at historic fort saint louis green iguanas are diurnal arboreal and are often found near water agile climbers iguana iguana can fall up to and land unhurt iguanas use their hind leg claws to clasp leaves and branches to break a fall during cold wet weather green iguanas prefer to stay on ground for greater warmth when swimming an iguana remains submerged letting its four legs hang limply against its side they propel through water with powerful tail strokes in south and central america where green iguana is native it is an endangered species in some countries because people have been hunting and eating this gallino de palo bamboo chicken or chicken of trees for a long time anatomy and morphologies left thumb green iguana skeleton despite their name green iguanas can come in different colours and types in southern countries of their range such as peru green iguanas appear bluish in colour with bold blue markings on islands such as bonaire curacao aruba and grenada a green iguana s colour may range from green to lavender black and even reddish brown green iguanas from western region of costa rica are red and animals of northern ranges such as mexico appear orange juvenile green iguanas from el salvador are often bright blue as babies but they lose this color as they get older adult iguanas found on most of st lucia mainly on northeastern coast and grand anse have many differences from other green iguana populations they are light green with predominant black stripes instead of typical orange dewlap iguanas of st lucia have a black dewlap when compared to common green iguana females lay about half amount of eggs 25 instead of 50 scales to back of their head near jawbone are smaller their iris is white or cream whereas other green iguanas have yellow irises green iguanas possess a row of spines along their backs and along their tails which helps to protect them from predators their whip like tails can be used to deliver painful strikes and like many other lizards when grabbed by tail iguana can allow it to break so it can escape and eventually regenerate a new one in addition iguanas have a well developed dewlap which helps regulate their body temperature this dewlap is used in courtships and territorial displays upright thumb right male with spines and dewlap upright thumb right close up of head green iguanas have excellent vision enabling them to detect shapes and motions at long distances as green iguanas have only a few rod cells they have poor vision in low light conditions at same time they have cells called double cone cells that give them sharp color vision and enable them to see ultraviolet wavelengths this ability is highly useful when basking so animal can ensure that it absorbs enough sunlight in forms of uva and uvb to produce vitamin d green iguanas have a white organ on top of their heads called parietal eye also called third eye pineal eye or pineal gland in contrast to most other lizards that have lost this primitive feature this eye has only a rudimentary retina and lens and cannot form images but is sensitive to changes in light and dark and can detect movement this helps iguana detect predators stalking it from above green iguanas have very sharp teeth that are capable of shredding leaves and even human skin these teeth are shaped like a leaf broad and flat with serrations on edge similarity of these teeth to those of one of first dinosaurs discovered led to dinosaur being named iguanodon meaning iguana tooth and incorrect assumption that it had resembled a gigantic iguana teeth are situated on inner sides of jawbones which is why they are hard to see in smaller specimens left thumb in palo verde national park costa rica primarily herbivorous green iguanas are presented with a special problem for osmoregulation plant matter contains more potassium and as it has less nutritional content per gram more must be eaten to meet metabolic needs as green iguanas are not capable of creating liquid urine more concentrated than their bodily fluids like birds they excrete nitrogenous wastes as salts through a salt gland as a result green iguanas have developed a lateral nasal gland to supplement renal salt secretion by expelling excess potassium and sodium chloride green iguanas from guatemala and southern mexico predominantly have small horns on their snouts between their eyes and their nostrils whereas others do not naturalists once classified these iguanas as a separate subspecies iguana iguana however this classification has been found to be invalid based on mitochondrial dna and iguanas with similar nose projections appearing randomly in other populations and interbreeding freely with those that do not share this trait green iguana is a large lizard and is probably largest species in iguana family though a few in genus may match or exceed it in weight green iguana iguana iguana giant green iguana facts and care animal world com retrieved on 2012 08 22 adults typically grow to in length from head to tail as in all iguanas tail comprises much of this length and snout to vent length of most green iguanas is an average

association of zoos and aquariums waza retrieved on 2012 08 22 some specimens have even reportedly been measured at a body weight of greater than reproductive biology thumb right juvenile green iguana grand cayman male green iguanas have highly developed femoral pores on underside of their thighs which secrete a scent females have femoral pores but they are smaller in comparison to those of males in addition dorsal spines that run along a green iguana s back are noticeably longer and thicker in males than they are in females making animals somewhat sexually dimorphic male green iguanas tend to display more dominant behaviors such as head bobbing and tail whipping they also tend to develop a taller dorsal crest than females as well as taller dorsal spines or spikes large round very pronounced jowls are generally a male characteristic jowls are located under jaw and are protected by plate which is a large green circular shaped scale green iguanas are oviparous with females laying clutches of 20 to 71 eggs once per year during a synchronized nesting period female green iguana gives no parental protection after egg laying apart from defending nesting burrow during excavation in panama green iguana has been observed sharing nest sites with american crocodiles and in honduras with spectacled caimans hatchlings emerge from nest after 10 15 weeks of incubation once hatched young iguanas look similar to adults in color and shape resembling adult females more so than males and lacking dorsal spines juveniles stay in familial groups for first year of their lives male green iguanas in these groups often use their own bodies to shield and protect females from predators and it appears to be only species of reptile which does this behavior thumb left reddish colored green iguana when frightened by a predator green iguanas will attempt to flee and if near a body of water dive into it and swim away if cornered by a threat green iguana will extend and display dewlap under its neck stiffen and puff up its body hiss and bob its head at aggressor if threat persists iguana can lash with its tail bite and use its claws in defense wounded are more inclined to fight than uninjured prey green iguanas use head bobs and dewlaps in a variety of ways in social interactions such as greeting another iguana or to court a possible mate frequency and number of head bobs have particular meanings to other iguanas green iguanas are hunted by predatory birds and their fear of these is exploited as a ploy to catch them in wild sound of a hawk s whistle or scream makes iguana boogie dance and it becomes easier to capture diet thumb right green iguana eating bougainvillea leaves green iguanas are primarily herbivores with captives feeding on leaves such as turnip greens mustard greens dandelion greens flowers fruit and growing shoots of upwards of 100 different species of plant in panama one of green iguana s favorite foods is wild plum although they will consume a wide variety of foods if offered green iguanas are naturally herbivorous and require a precise ratio of minerals 2 to 1 calcium to phosphorus in their diet it is important for captive iguanas to have a variety of leafy greens along with fruits and vegetables such as turnip greens collards butternut squash acorn squash mango and parsnip juvenile iguanas often eat feces from adults in order to acquire essential microflora to digest their low quality and hard to process vegetarian only diet there is some debate as to whether captive green iguanas should be fed animal protein there is evidence of wild iguanas eating grasshoppers and tree snails usually as a byproduct of eating plant material wild adult green iguanas have been observed eating birds eggs zoologists such as adam britton believe that such a diet containing protein is unhealthy for animal s digestive system resulting in severe long term health damage including kidney failure and leading to premature death on other side of argument is that green iguanas at miami seaquarium in key biscayne florida have been observed eating dead fish and individuals kept in captivity have been known to eat mice without any ill effects de writes that captive animals have been known to survive and thrive on eating nothing but whole rodent block or monkey chow and one instance of romaine lettuce with vitamin and calcium supplements however it is only recommended that captive iguanas not be fed lettuce or meat and instead receive vitamins and minerals they need via a purely herbivorous diet captivity thumb left a green iguana in a terrarium american pet trade has put a great demand on green iguana 800 000 iguanas were imported into u s in 1995 alone primarily originating from captive farming operations based in their native countries honduras el salvador colombia and panama however these animals are demanding to care for properly over their lifetime and many die within a few years of acquisition although green iguanas in captivity will eat meat if presented with it excessive consumption of animal protein results in severe kidney problems and possible premature death misinformed pet owners tend to feed iguanas iceberg lettuce which provides iguanas with water but has little nutritional value compared to other vegetables a captive green iguana s diet should consist of fresh leafy vegetables such as mustard greens collard greens dandelion arugula or kale and access to fresh water green iguanas will thrive only in temperatures of to and must have appropriate sources of uvb and uva lighting or else their bodies cannot produce vitamin d that promotes calcium absorption which can result in a metabolic bone disease that can be fatal in some locales such as new york city and hawaii iguanas are considered exotic pets and ownership is prohibited due to potential impact of an introduced species on hawaii s ecosystem state has strict regulations regarding import and possession of green iguanas violators can spend three years in jail and be fined up to 200 000 as an invasive species thumb upright young juvenile green iguana found indoors in curacao thumb right at botanical garden at ecuador thumb right at saint thomas u s virgin islands caribbean in aftermath of hurricane luis and hurricane marilyn in 1995 a raft of uprooted trees carrying 15 or more green iguanas landed on eastern side of anguilla an island where green iguanas had never been recorded before these iguanas were apparently accidentally caught on trees and rafted 200 miles across ocean from guadeloupe where green iguanas are indigenous examination of weather patterns and ocean currents indicated that iguanas had probably spent three weeks at sea before arriving on anguilla this new colony began breeding on island within two years of its arrival in february 2012 government of puerto rico proposed that islands iguanas which were said to have a population of 4 million and considered to be a non native nuisance be eradicated and sold for meat fiji green iguana is present as an invasive species on some of islands of fiji where it is known as american iguana they pose a threat to native iguanas through potential spread of disease and to humans by spreading salmonella they were initially brought to in 2000 by an american who wanted them to eat numerous insects on island although they are primarily vegetarian they are now on islands of and taveuni united states green iguana is established on oahu and maui hawaii as a feral species despite strict legislation banning importation of any reptiles and in rio grande valley of texas as most reptiles carry salmonella this is a concern and a reason legislation has been sought to regulate trade in green iguanas due to a combination of events green iguana is considered an invasive species in south florida and is found along east coast as well as gulf coast of florida from key west to pinellas county original small populations in florida keys were stowaways on ships carrying fruit from south america over years other iguanas were introduced into wild mostly originating through pet trade some escaped and some were intentionally released by their owners these iguanas survived and then thrived in their new habitat they commonly hide in attics of houses and on beaches they often destroy gardens and landscaping they seem to be fond of eating a native endangered plant cordia globosa and feeding on a primary food plant of endangered miami blue butterfly additionally on marco island green iguanas have been observed using burrows of florida burrowing owl athene floridana a species of special concern all of which can make them more of a serious threat to florida s ecosystem than originally believed in january 2008 large numbers of iguanas established in florida dropped from trees in which they lived due to uncommonly cold nights that put them in a state of torpor and caused them to lose their grip on tree branches though no specific numbers were provided by local wildlife officials local media described phenomenon as a frozen iguana shower in which dozens littered local bike paths upon return of daytime warmth many but not all of iguanas woke up and resumed their normal activities this occurred again in january 2010 and january 2018 after a prolonged cold front once again hit southern florida conservation green iguana is listed within appendix ii by cites indicating that it is beneficial to regulate trade of this species to ensure that species does not become threatened in addition green iguana is
