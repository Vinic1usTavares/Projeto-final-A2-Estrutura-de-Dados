jerry alan fodor april 22 1935 november 29 2017 was an american philosopher and cognitive scientist he held position of state of new jersey professor of philosophy emeritus at rutgers university and was author of many works in fields of philosophy of mind and cognitive science in which he laid groundwork for modularity of mind and language of thought hypotheses among other ideas he was known for his provocative and sometimes polemical style of argumentation and as one of principal philosophers of mind of late twentieth and early twenty first century in addition to having exerted an enormous influence on virtually every portion of philosophy of mind literature since 1960 fodor s work has had a significant impact on development of cognitive sciences fodor argued that mental states such as beliefs and desires are relations between individuals and mental representations he maintained that these representations can only be correctly explained in terms of a language of thought lot in mind furthermore this language of thought itself is an actually existing thing that is codified in brain and not just a useful explanatory tool fodor adhered to a species of functionalism maintaining that thinking and other mental processes consist primarily of computations operating on syntax of representations that make up language of thought for fodor significant parts of mind such as perceptual and linguistic processes are structured in terms of modules or organs which he defines by their causal and functional roles these modules are relatively independent of each other and of central processing part of mind which has a more global and less domain specific character fodor suggests that character of these modules permits possibility of causal relations with external objects this in turn makes it possible for mental states to have contents that are about things in world central processing part on other hand takes care of logical relations between various contents and inputs and outputs although fodor originally rejected idea that mental states must have a causal externally determined aspect in his later years he devoted much of his writing and study to philosophy of language because of this problem of meaning and reference of mental contents his contributions in this area include so called asymmetric causal theory of reference and his many arguments against semantic holism fodor strongly opposed reductive accounts of mind he argued that mental states are multiple realizable and that there is a hierarchy of explanatory levels in science such that generalizations and laws of a higher level theory of psychology or linguistics for example cannot be captured by low level explanations of behavior of neurons and synapses he also emerged as a prominent critic of what he characterized as ill grounded darwinian and neo darwinian theories of natural selection biography jerry fodor was born in new york city on april 22 1935 and was of jewish descent he received his a b degree summa cum laude from columbia university in 1956 where he wrote a senior thesis on soren kierkegaard remembering jerry fodor and his work and studied with sydney and a phd in philosophy from princeton university in 1960 under direction of hilary putnam from 1959 to 1986 fodor was on faculty of massachusetts institute of technology in cambridge massachusetts from 1986 to 1988 he was a full professor at city university of new york cuny from 1988 until his retirement in 2016 he was state of new jersey professor of philosophy and cognitive science at rutgers university in new jersey where

manhattan fodor and nature of mental states in his article propositional attitudes 1978 fodor introduced idea that mental states are relations between individuals and mental representations despite changes in many of his positions over years idea that intentional attitudes are relational has remained unchanged from its original formulation up to in that article he attempted to show how mental representations specifically sentences in language of thought are necessary to explain this relational nature of mental states fodor considers two alternative hypotheses first completely denies relational character of mental states and second considers mental states as two place relations latter position can be further subdivided into view that such relations are between individuals and sentences of natural languages and view that they are between individuals and propositions expressed by such sentences trans it senso e in a bonomi la logica del bompiani milan 1973 pp 9 32 fodor s own position instead is that to properly account for nature of intentional attitudes it is necessary to employ a three place relation between individuals representations and propositional contents considering mental states as three place relations in this way representative realism makes it possible to hold together all of elements necessary to solution of this problem further mental representations are not only objects of beliefs and desires but are also domain over which mental processes operate they can be considered ideal link between syntactic notion of mental content and computational notion of functional architecture these notions are according to fodor our best explanation of mental processes functional architecture of mind thumb ideas of modularity of mind have predecessors in 19th century movement of phrenology founded by franz joseph gall following in path paved by linguist noam chomsky fodor developed a strong commitment to idea of psychological nativism nativism postulates innateness of many cognitive functions and concepts for fodor this position emerges naturally out of his criticism of and these criticisms also led him to formulation of his hypothesis of modularity of mind historically questions about mental architecture have been divided into two contrasting theories about nature of faculties first can be described as a horizontal view because it sees mental processes as interactions between faculties which are not domain specific for example a judgment remains a judgment whether it is judgment about a perceptual experience or a judgment about understanding of language second can be described as a vertical view because it claims that our mental faculties are domain specific genetically determined associated with distinct neurological structures and so on vertical vision can be traced back to 19th century movement called phrenology and its founder franz joseph gall gall claimed that mental faculties could be associated with specific physical areas of brain hence someone s level of intelligence for example could be literally read off from size of a particular bump on his posterior parietal lobe this simplistic view of modularity has been disproved over course of last century fodor revived idea of modularity without notion of precise physical in 1980s and became one of most vocal proponents of it with 1983 publication of his monograph modularity of mind two properties of modularity in particular informational encapsulation and domain specificity make it possible to tie together questions of functional architecture with those of mental content ability to elaborate information independently from background beliefs of individuals that these two properties allow fodor to give an atomistic and causal account of notion of mental content main idea in other words is that properties of contents of mental states can depend rather than exclusively on internal relations of system of which they are a part also on their causal relations with external world fodor s notions of mental modularity informational encapsulation and domain specificity were taken up and expanded much to fodor s chagrin by cognitive scientists such as zenon pylyshyn and evolutionary psychologists such as steven pinker and henry plotkin among many others but fodor complained that pinker plotkin and other members of what he sarcastically called new synthesis have taken modularity and similar ideas way too far he insisted that mind is not massively modular and that contrary to what these researchers would have us believe mind is still a very long way from having been explained by computational or any other model intentional realism in a theory of content and other essays 1990 fodor takes up another of his central notions question of reality of mental representations fodor needs to justify representational realism to justify idea that contents of mental states are expressed in symbolic structures such as those of lot fodor s criticism of dennett fodor starts with some criticisms of so called standard realism this view is characterized according to fodor by two distinct assertions one of these regards internal structure of mental states and asserts that such states are non relational other concerns semantic theory of mental content and asserts that there is an isomorphism between causal roles of such contents and inferential web of beliefs among modern philosophers of mind majority view seems to be that first of these two assertions is false but that second is true fodor departs from this view in accepting truth of first thesis but rejecting strongly truth of second in particular fodor criticizes instrumentalism of daniel dennett dennett maintains that it is possible to be realist with regard to intentional states without having to commit oneself to reality of mental representations now according to fodor if one remains at this level of analysis then there is no possibility of explaining why intentional strategy works there is a standard objection to instrumentalism it is difficult to explain why psychology of beliefs desires works so well if psychology of beliefs desires is in fact false as putnam boyd and others have emphasized from predictive successes of a theory to truth of that theory there is surely a presumed inference and this is even more likely when we are dealing with only theory in play which is crowned with success it is not obvious why such a presumption should not in favour of a realist conception of interpretations of beliefs desires productivity systematicity and thought fodor also has positive arguments in favour of reality of mental representations in terms of lot he maintains that if language is expression of thoughts and language is systematic then thoughts must also be systematic fodor draws on work of noam chomsky to both model his theory of mind and to refute alternative architectures such as connectionism systematicity in natural languages was explained by chomsky in terms of two more basic concepts productivity and compositionality productivity refers to a representational system s unbounded ability to generate new representations from a given set of symbols john loves and mary allow for construction of sentences john loves mary and mary loves john fodor s language of thought theorizes that representations are into constituent parts and these decomposed representations are built into new strings more important than productivity is systematicity since it does not rely on questionable about human cognition argument states that a is able to understand some sentence in virtue of understanding another for example no one who understands john loves mary is unable to understand mary loves john and no one who understands p and q is unable to understand p systematicity itself is rarely challenged as a property of natural languages and logics but some challenge that thought is systematic in same way languages are still others from connectionist tradition have tried to build non classical networks that can account for apparent systematicity of language fact that systematicity and productivity depend on compositional structure of language means that language has a combinatorial semantics if thought also has such a combinatorial semantics then there must be a language of thought second argument that fodor provides in favour of representational realism involves processes of thought this argument touches on relation between representational theory of mind and models of its architecture if sentences of mentalese require unique processes of elaboration then they require a computational mechanism of a certain type syntactic notion of mental representations goes hand in hand with idea that mental processes are calculations which act only on form of symbols which they elaborate and this is computational theory of mind consequently defence of a model of architecture based on classic artificial intelligence passes inevitably through a defence of reality of mental representations for fodor this formal notion of thought processes also has advantage of highlighting parallels between causal role of symbols and contents which they express in his view syntax plays role of mediation between causal role of symbols and their contents semantic relations between symbols can be imitated by their syntactic relations inferential relations which connect contents of two symbols can be imitated by formal syntax rules which regulate derivation of one symbol from another nature of content from beginning of 1980s fodor adhered to a causal notion of mental content and of meaning this idea of content contrasts sharply with inferential role semantics to which he subscribed earlier in his career fodor criticizes inferential role semantics irs because its commitment to an extreme form of holism excludes possibility of a true naturalization of mental but naturalization must include an explanation of content in atomistic and causal terms fodor j holism a shopper s guide with e lepore blackwell 1992 anti holism fodor has made many and varied criticisms of holism he identifies central problem with all different notions of holism as idea that determining factor in semantic evaluation is notion of an epistemic bond briefly p is an epistemic bond of q if meaning of p is considered by someone to be relevant for determination of meaning of q meaning holism strongly depends on this notion identity of content of a mental state under holism can only be determined by totality of its epistemic bonds and this makes realism of mental states an impossibility if people differ in an absolutely general way in their estimations of epistemic relevance and if we follow holism of meaning and intentional states by way of totality of their epistemic bonds consequence will be that two people or for that matter two temporal sections of same person will never be in same intentional state therefore two people can never be subsumed under same intentional generalizations and therefore intentional generalization can never be successful and therefore again there is no hope for an intentional psychology asymmetric causal theory having criticized idea that semantic evaluation concerns only internal relations between units of a symbolic system fodor can adopt an position with respect to mental content and meaning for fodor in recent years problem of naturalization of mental is tied to possibility of giving sufficient conditions for which a piece of world is relative to expresses represents is true of another piece in non intentional and non semantic terms if this goal is to be achieved within a representational theory of mind then challenge is to devise a causal theory which can establish interpretation of primitive non logical symbols of lot fodor s initial proposal is that what determines that symbol for water in mentalese expresses property h2o is that occurrences of that symbol are in certain causal relations with water intuitive version of this causal theory is what fodor calls crude causal theory according to this theory occurrences of symbols express properties which are causes of their occurrence term horse for example says of a horse that it is a horse in order to do this it is necessary and sufficient that certain properties of an occurrence of symbol horse be in a law like relation with certain properties which determine that something is an occurrence of horse main problem with this theory is that of erroneous representations there are two unavoidable problems with idea that a symbol expresses a property if it is necessary that all and only presences of such a property cause occurrences first is that not all horses cause occurrences of horse second is that not only horses cause occurrences of horse sometimes a horses are caused by a horses but at other times when for example because of distance or conditions of low visibility one has confused a cow for a horse a horses are caused by b cows in this case symbol a doesn t express just property a but disjunction of properties a or b crude causal theory is therefore incapable of distinguishing case in which content of a symbol is disjunctive from case in which it isn t this gives rise to what fodor calls problem of disjunction fodor responds to this problem with what he defines as a slightly less crude causal theory according to this approach it is necessary to break symmetry at base of crude causal theory fodor must find some criterion for distinguishing occurrences of a caused by as true from those caused by bs false point of departure according to fodor is that while false cases are ontologically dependent on true cases reverse is not true there is an asymmetry of dependence in other words between true contents a a and false ones a a or b first can subsist independently of second but second can occur only because of existence of first from point of view of semantics errors must be accidents if in extension of horse there are no cows then it cannot be required for meaning of horse that cows be called horses on other hand if horse did not mean that which it means and if it were an error for horses it would never be possible for a cow to be called horse putting two things together it can be seen that possibility of falsely saying this is a horse presupposes existence of a semantic basis for saying it truly but not vice versa if we put this in terms of crude causal theory fact that cows cause one to say horse depends on fact that horses cause one to say horse but fact that horses cause one to say horse does not depend on fact that cows cause one to say horse functionalism during 1960s various philosophers such as donald davidson hilary putnam and fodor tried to resolve puzzle of developing a way to preserve explanatory efficacy of mental causation and so called folk psychology while adhering to a materialist vision of world which did not violate generality of physics their proposal was first of all to reject then dominant theories in philosophy of mind behaviorism and type identity theory problem with logical behaviorism was that it failed to account for causation between mental states and such causation seems to be essential to psychological explanation especially if one considers that behavior is not an effect of a single mental event cause but is rather effect of a chain of mental events causes type identity theory on other hand failed to explain fact that radically different physical systems can find themselves in identical mental state besides being deeply anthropocentric why should humans be only thinking organisms in universe identity type theory also failed to deal with accumulating evidence in neurosciences that every single human brain is different from all others hence impossibility of referring to common mental states in different physical systems manifests itself not only between different species but also between organisms of same species thumb an illustration of multiple realizability m stands for mental and p stand for physical diagram shows that more than one p can instantiate one m but not vice versa causal relations between states are represented by arrows m1 goes to m2 etc one can solve these problems according to fodor with functionalism a hypothesis which was designed to overcome failings of both dualism and reductionism what is important is function of a mental state regardless of physical substrate which implements it foundation for this view lies in principle of multiple realizability of mental under this view for example i and a computer can both instantiate realize same functional state though we are made of completely different material stuff see graphic at right on this basis functionalism can be classified as a form of token materialism evolution fodor co authored book what darwin got wrong 2010 with massimo piattelli palmarini in which they describe neo darwinists as being distressingly uncritical and say of darwin s theory of evolution that it overestimates contribution environment makes in shaping phenotype of a species and correspondingly underestimates effects of endogenous variables survival of fittest theory darwinism s limits what darwin got wrong evolutionary biologist jerry coyne describes this book as a profoundly misguided critique of natural selection worst science journalism of year darwin completely wrong again why evolution is true and as biologically uninformed as it is strident improbability pump a review of what darwin got wrong and richard dawkins s greatest show on earth nation moral philosopher and anti scientism author mary midgley praises what darwin got wrong as an overdue and valuable onslaught on neo darwinist what darwin got wrong by jerry fodor and massimo piattelli palmarini mary midgley guardian 6 february 2010 book also received positive review by mathematician and intelligent design theorist william criticism a wide variety of philosophers of diverse orientations have challenged many of fodor s ideas for example language of thought hypothesis has been accused of either falling prey to an infinite regress or of being superfluous specifically simon blackburn suggested in an article in 1984 that since fodor explains learning of natural languages as a process of formation and confirmation of hypotheses in lot this leaves him open to question of why lot itself should not be considered as just such a language which requires yet another and more fundamental representational substrate in which to form and confirm hypotheses so that lot itself can be learned if natural language learning requires some representational substrate lot in order for it to be learned why shouldn t same be said for lot itself and then for representational substrate of this representational substrate and so on ad infinitum on other hand if such a representational substrate is not required for lot then why should it be required for learning of natural languages in this case lot would be superfluous fodor in response argues that lot is unique in that it does not have to be learned via an antecedent language because it is innate in 1981 daniel dennett had formulated another argument against lot dennett suggested that it would seem on basis of evidence of our behavior toward computers but also with regard to some of our own unconscious behavior that explicit representation is not necessary for explanation of propositional attitudes during a game of chess with a computer program we often attribute such attitudes to computer saying such things as it thinks that queen should be moved to left we attribute propositional attitudes to computer and this helps us to explain and predict its behavior in various contexts yet no one would suggest that computer is actually thinking or believing somewhere inside its circuits equivalent of propositional attitude i believe i can kick this guy s butt in mentalese same is obviously true suggests dennett of many of our everyday automatic behaviors such as desiring to breathe clear air in a stuffy environment some linguists and philosophers of language have criticized fodor s self proclaimed extreme concept nativism kent bach for example takes fodor to task for his criticisms of lexical semantics and fodor claims that there is no lexical structure to such verbs as keep get make and put he suggests that alternatively keep simply expresses concept keep fodor capitalizes concepts to distinguish them from properties names or other such entities if there is a straightforward one to one mapping between individual words and concepts keep your clothes on keep your receipt and keep washing your hands will all share same concept of keep under fodor s theory this concept presumably locks on to unique external property of keeping but if this is true then retain must pick out a different property in retain your receipt since one can t retain one s clothes on or retain washing one s hands fodor s theory also has a problem explaining how concept fast contributes differently to contents of fast car fast driver fast track and fast time whether or not differing interpretations of fast in these sentences are specified in semantics of english or are result of pragmatic inference is a matter of debate fodor s own response to this kind of criticism is expressed bluntly in concepts people sometimes used to say that exist must be ambiguous because look at difference between chairs exist and numbers exist a familiar reply goes difference between existence of chairs and existence of numbers seems on reflection strikingly like difference between numbers and chairs since you have latter to explain former you don t also need exist to be some critics find it difficult to accept fodor s insistence that a large perhaps implausible number of concepts are primitive and undefinable for example fodor considers such concepts as effect island trapezoid and week to be all primitive innate and because they all fall into category of what he calls lexical concepts those for which our language has a single word against this view bach argues that concept vixen is almost certainly composed out of concepts female and fox bachelor out of single and male and so on one of his critics fiona cowie says that fodor s innatism is indicative of a certain degree of pessimism as to our prospects for understanding how a mind comes to be furnished it just has furniture it has books what darwin got wrong
