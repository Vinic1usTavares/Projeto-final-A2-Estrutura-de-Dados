thumb alt colour photograph of horse head terminal from staffordshire helmet horse head terminal from staffordshire helmet boar is of anglo saxon origin and dates from first half of seventh century ad although its original purpose cannot be conclusively determined style and size of boar suggests that it formed terminal of a helmet crest figural terminals adorn crests of many contemporaneous helmets such as sutton hoo helmet which has a dragon terminal at either end and one from staffordshire which features a horse head terminal boar iconography is also found on helmets from period typically on crests as with benty grange and guilden morden examples or at ends of eyebrows as on those from sutton hoo and perhaps york horncastle fragment with its lentoid eyes tusks and defined mane is stylistically similar to boar atop benty grange helmet taken in context boar would probably have adorned an early model of crested helmets known in northern europe in sixth through eleventh centuries ad such helmets are characterised by a rounded cap and usually a prominent nose to nape crest from which name of helmet type derives and at one end of which horncastle boar was probably once attached iconography thumb alt colour photograph of a central european boar a central european boar boar was an important symbol in prehistoric europe where according to archaeologist jennifer foster it was venerated eulogised hunted and eaten for millennia until its virtual extinction in recent historical time anglo saxon boar symbols follow a thousand years of similar iconography coming after la tene examples in fourth century bc gaulish examples three centuries later and roman boars in fourth century ad they probably represent a fused tradition of european and mediterranean cultures boar is said to have been sacred to a mother goddess figure among linguistically celtic communities in iron age europe while roman historian tacitus writing around first century ad suggested that baltic aesti wore boar symbols in battle to invoke her protection boar crested helmets are depicted on turn of millennium gundestrup cauldron discovered in denmark and on a torslunda plate from sweden made some five hundred years later though romans also included boar in their stable of symbols four legions including england based twentieth adopted it as their emblem it was only one among many boar persisted in continental germanic tradition during nearly 400 years of roman rule in britain such as in association with scandinavian gods freyja and freyr its return to prominence in anglo saxon period as represented by boars from benty grange wollaston guilden morden and horncastle may therefore suggest post roman introduction of a germanic tradition from europe rather than continuation of a tradition in britain through 400 years of roman rule whatever its precise symbolism anglo saxon boar appears to have been associated with protection beowulf poet makes this clear writing that boar symbols on
