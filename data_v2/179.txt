lydford castle is a medieval castle in town of lydford devon england first castle in lydford sometimes termed norman fort was a small ringwork built in a corner of anglo saxon fortified burh in years after norman conquest of england it was intended to help control devon following widespread revolt against norman rule in 1068 norman fort had been abandoned by middle of 12th century second castle in lydford was constructed in 1195 following a wave of law and order problems across england it included a stone tower with a surrounding bailey and rapidly became used as a prison and court to administer laws in forest of dartmoor and devon stannaries tower was rebuilt in middle of 13th century probably in 1260s by richard earl of cornwall it was redesigned to resemble a motte and bailey castle an antiquated design for period but one that was heavily symbolic of authority and power in 1342 castle still being used as a prison and courtroom passed to duchy of cornwall who owned it until 20th century castle was repeatedly renovated and then left to deteriorate so its condition varied considerably over time nonetheless other than a period during english civil war and restoration in 17th century lydford castle played an important part in stannary and forest administration until 19th century castle acquired a bad reputation for injustice in 14th century and complaints about lydford law persisted for centuries in early 19th century however dartmoor prison was constructed and lydford ceased to be centre for legal administration castle had fallen into ruin by middle of century in 1932 lydford castle passed into hands of state and in 21st century is run by english heritage as a tourist attraction historian andrew saunders has described castle as architecturally significant being earliest example of a purpose built gaol in england earthworks of norman fort are owned by national trust and are open to public history 1066 1150 thumb earthwork remains of 11th century castle first castle at lydford was built in aftermath of norman conquest of england in 1066 in 1068 william conqueror intervened in south west england to put down widespread anglo saxon revolts against norman rule and set about pacifying region william had been responsible for building urban castles across england in former centres of anglo saxon power and in devon he constructed new urban castles at exeter totnes possibly barnstaple and in town of lydford lydford then called was a type of fortified anglo saxon town called a burh castle in 21st century called norman fort was built on isolated south west corner of burh soon after 1068 it had a ringwork design and was only by in size protected in part by existing defences of burh a similar pattern of castle building within existing anglo saxon burhs can be seen at wallingford and bedford castles most of interior of castle was used to store grain in large timber and earth buildings it is uncertain whether these storage facilities were intended for supplying norman troops or storing grain for wider economic purposes this first castle was used only briefly and seems to have been abandoned by middle of 12th century grain stores were destroyed by fire but reason for this is uncertain by this period town of lydford as a whole was also in serious economic decline 1150 1239 construction thumb 350px plan of castle in

trade in town then in 1195 there were widespread problems with law and order across england including south west and on basis of this richard s government decided to build a fortification for holding royal prisoners in lydford further along west side of town from old castle in a prestigious location next to town s church this fortification is referred to in contemporary documents variously as a firme domus and castelli de a strong house and lydford castle respectively it is unclear why decision was taken to build new castle in a different location within town lydford s case is not unique as a similar shift occurred at canterbury and gloucester generally such changes in castle location are associated with destruction of older defence or changes in political leadership archaeologist andrew saunders suggests that new site was chosen because earlier castle at lydford was not owned by crown in 1195 and was in any case in disrepair ps74 was spent on construction of castle paid for by crown revenues from both devon and cornwall castle took form of a stone tower with a surrounding bailey bailey was rectangular and in 21st century measures by bailey was protected by ramparts and deep ditches on south west and north east sides with north west side protected by ramparts and valley of original burh fortifications south east side of bailey probably formed a small courtyard in front of tower in a space now occupied by part of 13th century earthworks and was probably entrance to original castle tower was a square free standing building by and at least two storeys tall in 12th century tower sat on flat ground with no mound around it walls were roughly built from slate and granite up to thick and pierced by arrow slits tower had a spine wall along middle of building dividing each floor into two rooms entrance was probably on first floor of building an internal water supply was installed of which a decorated spout still survives role in stannary and forest law thumb boundary marker on forest of dartmoor lydford castle does not seem to be primarily designed to have a military function although in 1199 when king john succeeded to throne he had castle garrisoned and expensively equipped to prevent any potential unrest breaking out in region castle lacked usual military features of time such as external gatehouses and its design seems to have been intended to evoke authority of a traditional defensive fortification rather than to resist an actual attack instead as well as helping to deal with wider problems in 1195 castle appears to have been built with intention of enforcing stannary and forest law in devon it is possible that crown originally intended that castle took over stannary law across whole of cornwall and devon although in practice its role extended only to governing devon stannaries stannary law was a medieval english legal system for governing tin industry south west england and in particular devon was a major producer of tin in 12th century produced by independent miners who worked alluvial deposits across region industry was regulated by crown who taxed mining output and raised revenue from any fines imposed on those who broke stannary laws laws also helped to manage relationship between miners and other local people whose economic interests were often at odds output of tin increased from end of 12th century onwards encouraging crown to extend its regulation and generate more revenue in 1198 william of wrotham who controlled lydford castle at start of john s reign was appointed as warden of stannaries a new office intended to provide additional rigour to administration of mining industry stannary courts were established in devon backed by a team of officials and with creation of duchy of cornwall in 14th century administration of stannary law was delegated to duchy from 1198 onwards lydford castle was designated as prison for supporting court and its processes forests were special areas of land in medieval england owned by crown and subject to forest law they were often selected because of their natural resources and were expected to provide crown with a flow of money or raw materials in 1195 forest of dartmoor extended across all of devon but in 1204 john curtailed extent of royal forest removing much of devon from forest law and leaving area known in modern period as dartmoor this reduced forest was still subject to forest laws involving a specialised group of legal officials who met at lydford castle to impose fines and other punishments probably both lydford castle and forest was given to sheriff of devon william brewer in 1216 arrangement changed under henry iii when estates were given to richard earl of cornwall in 1239 legally this meant that forest of dartmoor was converted to a chase although earls of cornwall continued to hold law courts at lydford castle enforcing chase laws that closely resembled former forest laws 1239 1278 thumb tower seen from south east richard edward ii s second son took possession of lydford castle in 1239 as earl of cornwall richard took a close interest in developing town of lydford creating an additional market and introducing a new fair in 1260s around this time main tower at lydford castle was demolished and rebuilt probably by richard possibly following a serious fire in building richard was a wealthy politician and rebuilding castle in this way would have provided him with an important status symbol in region previous tower was stripped back existing walls levelled off around from ground and ground floor arrow slits filled in two more storeys were then built on top of older walls better executed with a higher proportion of granite stone and thinner typically around thick although structure remained essentially same new tower was slightly smaller measuring around by first floor was only basically designed with a sequence of rooms of different levels of comfort and intended to function as prison and second floor was better finished with a hall and a chamber and probably operated as courtroom and provided accommodation for keeper of castle as part of work an earth mound or motte high was piled up around base of tower original ground floor of castle was now an underground cellar probably used as a puteus or pit for detaining low status prisoners and reached by ladder from first floor some infilling of ground floor occurred in order to equalise pressure on walls from mound it is uncertain how many other towers or keeps have similar mounds as excavation is usually required before foundations can be examined but totnes and farnham castles are known to have mottes build against walls of keep reason for building mound is uncertain but it was almost certainly not designed as a serious defensive feature it was instead probably intended as to superficially imitate older motte and bailey designs with completed castle echoing these former symbols of power and reinforcing current political status of its owner 1278 1642 thumb a blowing house part of remains of medieval tin industry in devon governed by stannaries richard s son edmund took over earldom in 1278 but had little interest in lydford preferring restormel and lostwithiel by his death in 1299 castle had been left to decay and was in ruins it reverted to crown and when edward ii made his royal favourite piers gaveston earl of cornwall in 1307 lydford castle was passed to him castle was repaired at start of century and was in use once again as a prison edward ii and gaveston fell from power in 1327 and thomas le was temporarily entrusted with castle and dartmoor by new regime in 1329 castle was valued at a little over ps11 piers gaveston s widow margaret de clare leased property to tavistock abbey and it continued to operate as a prison edward black prince became duke of cornwall in 1337 and he acquired lydford castle on margaret s death in 1342 extensive repairs took place over next three years and castle was considered to be well roofed and decorated inside over next two centuries condition of castle fluctuated around 1390 castle roof was stripped for its lead to be used on castles in cornwall castle well was possibly dug during 15th century after 1425 crown let it to a range of individuals including sir walter hungerford and sir philip courteney lydford remained centre of forest administration through 14th and 15th centuries despite complaints from non miners at start of 14th century that prison regime at lydford castle was overly lax by end of century prison had a reputation for poor grim conditions first known rhymes complaining about lydford law date from 1399 and continued to be popular for several centuries in 1510 richard strode a member of parliament campaigning for reform of stannary laws was infamously arrested by stannary officials and imprisoned in lydford castle he later described how he was kept in an underground room in keep fed only bread and water and encumbered with until he paid keeper to release him from irons after 1485 duchy took castle back into direct control and by 1546 it was in poor repair renovation work was carried out under elizabeth i but a report of 1618 suggested that castle was unable to function as a prison because of its poor condition and fresh repair work was carried out in 1620s and 1630s under charles i

richard grenville as his main military prison in region it had a terrible reputation amongst parliamentarians who complained that it was used to summarily execute military prisoners and to extort money from innocent civilians on fear of imprisonment at end of civil war lydford estate appears to have been sold off by parliament castle was assessed by their surveyors to be almost totally ruined in 1650 roof of tower was still mostly intact but floors and their beams were collapsing and whole site including bailey was only worth around ps80 with restoration of charles ii to throne in 1660 castle and forest were taken back to ownership of duchy sir john granville was made rider and master forester of dartmoor and lydford castle courts continued to be held to regulate forest repairs to dilapidated building do not appear to have been carried out however and in 1704 a report was drawn up for government noting that stannary laws could not be enforced without a working prison work was carried out between 1616 and 1733 bringing castle back into good order as part of this spine wall was rebuilt properly and second floor windows enlarged courtroom featured a chair for stannary court judge additional seating for court officials and a railed public section around outside of room courtroom also doubled as a hall for village dances and feasts at start of 19th century however sir thomas tyrwhitt lord warden of stannaries began construction of dartmoor prison at princetown dartmoor prison and princetown grew increasingly important and courts began to be held there instead of lydford castle castle declined once again courtroom became unsafe to use and by 1833 remaining judicial fittings had been stripped out in middle of 19th century duchy of cornwall rejected proposals to repair castle in order to bring it back into service as being too expensive but castle site was enclosed to prevent injuries to children who might be tempted to play on stonework by 1870s town of lydford was vastly reduced in importance from medieval period and castle s roofs and floors had either collapsed or been removed 20th 21st centuries duchy of cornwall continued to own lydford castle into 20th century albert richardson architect to duchy estate proposed converting property into a private house in 1912 but duchy turned down project in 1932 duchy gave castle to office of works repairs were carried out in 1930s and 1950s and archaeological investigations were undertaken in 1960s in 21st century castle is controlled by english heritage and operated as a tourist attraction
