thumb right heavy water production plant at sylacauga alabama p 9 project was codename given during world war ii to manhattan project s heavy water production program cominco plant at trail british columbia was upgraded to produce heavy water dupont built three plants in united states at morgantown ordnance works near morgantown west virginia at wabash river ordnance works near dana and newport indiana and at alabama ordnance works near childersburg and sylacauga alabama american plants operated from 1943 until 1945 canadian plant at trail continued in operation until 1956 three nuclear reactors were built using heavy water produced by p 9 project chicago pile 3 at argonne and zeep and nrx at chalk river laboratories in canada origins heavy water is a form of water that contains a larger than normal amount of hydrogen isotope deuterium also known as heavy hydrogen rather than common hydrogen 1 isotope that makes up most of hydrogen in ordinary water deuterium was discovered by harold urey in 1931 and he was later able to concentrate it in water his mentor gilbert newton lewis isolated first sample of pure heavy water by electrolysis in 1933 although a scientific curiosity from start considerable interest in heavy water was aroused in 1939 when hans von halban and lew kowarski suggested that heavy water could be used as a neutron moderator in a nuclear reactor using natural uranium they carried out experiments on uranium using ordinary water but had found that hydrogen atoms absorbed neutrons thus preventing desired chain reaction heavy water though was an ideal moderator office of scientific research and development osrd put hugh s taylor a british physicist at princeton university in charge of heavy water research taylor and urey began looking at means for producing heavy water on an industrial scale for his plutonium project arthur h compton requested of it heavy water project was codenamed p 9 project in october 1942 problem with using heavy water was that it was scarce and scientists could not readily acquire quantities required by a reactor at columbia university in united states enrico fermi and leo szilard attempted to use graphite as a moderator instead this turned out to be possible but graphite had to be very pure as impurities particularly boron tended to absorb neutrons on 2 december 1942 fermi s team initiated first artificial self sustaining nuclear chain reaction in an experimental reactor known as chicago pile 1 for manhattan project this was a crucial step towards manufacture of plutonium in a reactor for use in an atomic bomb but much larger reactors were required for mass production trail cominco had been involved in heavy water research since 1934 and produced it at its smelting plant in trail british columbia on 26 february 1941 canadian national research council inquired about its ability to produce heavy water this was followed on 23 july 1941 by letter from taylor that offered a national defense research committee ndrc contract to produce for which ndrc was prepared to pay 5 per pound for low grade and 10 for high grade heavy water at time it was selling for up to 1 130 a pound cominco s president selwyn g blaylock was cautious there might be no post war demand for heavy water and patent on process was held by albert edgar knowles so a profit sharing agreement would be required in response taylor offered up 20 000 for plant modifications there matter rested until 6 december 1941 when blaylock had a meeting with british physicist g i higson who informed him that taylor had become discouraged with cominco and had decided to find an alternative source of heavy water blaylock invited taylor to visit trail which he did from 5 to 8 january 1942 two soon found common ground blaylock agreed to produce heavy water at trail and quickly secured approval from chairman of board sir edward beatty a contract was signed on 1 august 1942 to existing 10 million plant consisting of 3 215 cells consuming 75 mw of hydroelectric power secondary electrolysis cells were added to increase deuterium concentration in water from 2 3 to 99 8 for this process taylor developed a platinum on carbon catalyst for first three stages while urey developed a nickel one for fourth stage tower seven new parcels of land were acquired totalling were leased by u s government construction was undertaken by stone webster final cost was 2 8 million canadian government did not officially learn of project until august 1942 shortly before construction began following month it was completed on 30 june 1943 at a cost of 2 604 622 production rose steadily from in june 1943 to in january 1944 in january 1945 and in january 1946 running cost of plant averaged 32 979 per month over period from june 1943 to december 1946 when manhattan project was replaced by atomic energy commission this worked out to 39 per pound trail s heavy water production continued until 1956 american sites thumb right heavy water production plant at sylacauga alabama director of manhattan project brigadier general leslie r groves jr had in november 1942 recruited dupont as prime contractor for construction of a plutonium production complex although dupont s preferred designs for nuclear reactors were helium cooled and used graphite as a moderator dupont still expressed an interest in using heavy water as a backup in case graphite reactor design proved infeasible for some reason for this purpose it was estimated that of heavy water would be required per month as plant at trail which was then under construction could produce per month more capacity was required groves therefore authorized dupont to establish additional heavy water facilities at morgantown ordnance works near morgantown west virginia at wabash river ordnance works near dana and newport indiana and at alabama ordnance works near childersburg and sylacauga alabama although known as ordnance works and paid for under ordnance department contracts they were built and operated by united states army corps of engineers locating them at ordnance plants saved cost of acquiring land since it was already owned by government and they already had personnel and utilities including steam generating equipment three american plants used a process different from trail s heavy water was extracted by distillation taking advantage of slightly higher boiling point of heavy water this was not considered to be an efficient process but it was known to work and scale to an industrial process and therefore represented less risk than other proposals wabash and alabama were expected to produce and respectively of heavy water per month with a concentration of 99 75 morgantown works at morgantown were undertaken by dupont under a cost plus fixed fee contract as was works at wabash and alabama construction commenced on 7 january 1943 and was substantially completed ahead of 1 september scheduled date facilities were progressively brought into operation between 29 may and 28 august 1943 cost was 3 490 069 dupont s fixed fee was originally 154 882 but this was voluntarily reduced to 88 588 because cost of construction was considerably less than 6 034 000 originally estimated electrolytic finishing plant was established at morgantown because that plant was under control of dupont s ammonia division at this plant output from distillation plants which was about 90 heavy water was broken down by electrolysis into hydrogen and oxygen light hydrogen tends to be drawn off first leaving heavy water behind this process was repeated through several stages to yield a finished product that was 99 75 heavy water wabash construction commenced on 23 january 1943 and was substantially completed on 22 october stages of p 9 distillation plant became operational between 17 june and 18 september 1943 total cost was 7 493 157 including dupont s fee of 152 472 which was voluntarily reduced from 272 776 because plant was constructed for substantially less than allocated 13 665 000 alabama construction commenced on 11 february 1943 and was completed on 15 november stages of p 9 distillation plant became operational between 29 may and 4 september 1943 total cost was 3 466 171 including dupont s fee of 70 368 which was voluntarily reduced from 184 680 because plant was constructed for substantially less than allocated 8 285 000 production thumb right chicago pile 3 three american plants never achieved intended production of per month a series of suggestions for improving production was considered and most promising were carried out most successful of these was reconstruction of first stage towers at morgantown to reduce leakage which resulted in a considerable improvement in performance however by this time early 1945 it was decided that production was sufficient and expense of doing this at other plants could not be justified p 9 distillation plant at alabama was closed in june 1945 that at wabash in july and one at morgantown in august electrolytic finishing plant at morgantown was closed in september intermediate product remaining when plants were closed was sent to trail this resulted in approximately of extra production at trail between february 1944 and august 1945 electrolytic finishing plant at morgantown which finished product for all three plants produced an average of per month for a total of electrolytic finishing plant also processed from heavy water recovered from germany by manhattan project s alsos mission average monthly production cost was 72 000 for morgantown 154 000 at alabama and 197 400 at wabash for a total of 423 400 thus heavy water cost 186 per pound excluding 11 967 000 cost of plants if this is included it cost 550 per pound compared to 111 per pound at trail intermediate product was shipped from wabash and alabama by rail in sealed metal containers finished product was shipped by rail from morgantown via monongahela railway and trail via canadian pacific railway to manhattan project s metallurgical laboratory at university of chicago heavy water from trail was used for chicago pile 3 at argonne first reactor using heavy water and natural uranium designed by eugene wigner and built under direction of walter zinn it went critical on 15 may 1944 an allocation of heavy water was used by chalk river laboratories to build zeep under kowarski s direction which went critical in september 1945 this was followed by its nrx reactor in 1947 which was also moderated by heavy water like cp 3 and zeep it was used for scientific research and not for plutonium production demand for heavy water increased in early 1950s heavy water facility at wabash now renamed dana plant by atomic energy commission was reopened and dupont resumed production of heavy water in may 1952 site was used a pilot plant for a new production process using hydrogen sulphide heavy water facility was closed again in early 1957 facility and a larger complex at savannah river site had fulfilled its purpose supplying heavy water for plutonium production reactors at savannah river notes
