ripken second from right meeting with president ronald reagan second from left at 6 ft 4 in 225 lb 1 93 m 102 kg ripken was a departure from prototypical shortstop of time small fleet of foot players who played a defensively difficult position but often did not post home run and batting average totals that an outfielder might power hitting shortstops such as alex rodriguez nomar garciaparra and miguel tejada are often seen by fans to be part of ripken s legacy nonetheless ripken demonstrated ability to play excellent defense at shortstop and as a result remained a fixture there for well over a decade leading league in assists several times winning gold glove twice and in 1990 setting mlb record for best fielding percentage in a season at his position though not a flashy fielder ripken displayed excellent fundamentals and studied batters and even his own pitching staff so he could position himself to compensate for his lack of physical speed rosenfeld p 175 176 ripken s legacy as a
