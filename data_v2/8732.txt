thumb upright 1 25 an air mass thunderstorm over wagga wagga an air mass thunderstorm also called an ordinary single cell or garden variety thunderstorm is a thunderstorm that is generally weak and usually not severe these storms form in environments where at least some amount of convective available potential energy cape is present but very low levels of wind shear and helicity lifting source which is a crucial factor in thunderstorm development is usually result of uneven heating of surface though they can be induced by weather fronts and other low level boundaries associated with wind convergence energy needed for these storms to form comes in form of insolation or solar radiation air mass thunderstorms do not move quickly last no longer than an hour and have threats of lightning as well as showery light moderate or heavy rainfall heavy rainfall can interfere with microwave transmissions within atmosphere lightning characteristics are related to characteristics of parent thunderstorm and could induce wildfires near thunderstorms with minimal rainfall on unusual occasions there could be a weak downburst and small hail they are common in temperate zones during a summer afternoon like all thunderstorms mean layered wind field storms form within determine motion when deep layered wind flow is light outflow boundary progression will determine storm movement since thunderstorms can be a hazard to aviation pilots are advised to fly above any haze layers within regions of better visibility and to avoid flying under anvil of these thunderstorms which can be regions where hail falls from parent thunderstorm vertical wind shear is also a hazard near base of thunderstorms which have generated outflow boundaries life cycle thumb 400px stages of a thunderstorm s life trigger for lift of initial cumulus cloud can be insolation heating ground producing thermals areas where two winds converge forcing air upwards or where winds blow over terrain of increasing elevation moisture rapidly cools into liquid drops of water due to cooler temperatures at high altitude which appears as cumulus clouds as water vapor condenses into liquid latent heat is released which warms air causing it to become less dense than surrounding dry air air tends to rise in an updraft through process of convection hence term convective precipitation this creates a low pressure zone beneath forming thunderstorm otherwise known as a cumulonimbus cloud in a typical thunderstorm approximately 5x108 kg of water vapor is lifted into earth s atmosphere as they form in areas of minimal vertical wind shear thunderstorm s rainfall creates a moist and relatively cool outflow boundary with undercuts storm s low level inflow and quickly causes dissipation waterspouts small hail and strong wind gusts can occur in association with these thunderstorms common locations of appearance also known as single cell thunderstorms these are typical summer thunderstorms in many temperate locales they also occur in cool unstable air which often follows passage of a cold front from sea during winter within a cluster of thunderstorms term cell refers to each separate principal updraft thunderstorm cells occasionally form in isolation as occurrence of one thunderstorm can develop an outflow boundary which sets up new thunderstorm development such storms are rarely severe and are a result of local atmospheric instability hence term air mass thunderstorm when such storms have a brief period of severe weather associated with them it is known as a pulse severe storm pulse severe storms are poorly organized due to minimal vertical wind shear in storm s environment and occur randomly in time and space making them difficult to forecast between formation and dissipation single cell thunderstorms normally last 20 30 minutes motion 250px thumb right anvil shaped thundercloud in mature stage over swifts creek victoria two major ways thunderstorms move are via advection of wind and propagation along outflow boundaries towards sources of greater heat and moisture many thunderstorms move with mean wind speed through earth s troposphere or lowest of earth s atmosphere younger thunderstorms are steered by winds closer to earth s surface than more mature thunderstorms as they tend not to be as tall if gust front or leading edge of outflow boundary moves ahead of thunderstorm thunderstorm s motion will move in tandem with gust front this is more of a factor with thunderstorms with heavy precipitation hp such as air mass thunderstorms when thunderstorms merge which is most likely when numerous thunderstorms exist in proximity to each other motion of stronger thunderstorm normally dictates future motion of merged cell stronger mean wind less likely other processes will be involved in storm motion on weather radar storms are tracked by using a prominent feature and tracking it from scan to scan convective precipitation right 250px thumb calvus type cumulonimbus cloud convective rain or showery precipitation occurs from cumulonimbus clouds it falls as showers with rapidly changing intensity convective precipitation falls over a certain area for a relatively short time as convective clouds such as thunderstorms have limited horizontal extent most precipitation in tropics appears to be convective graupel and hail are good indicators of convective precipitation and thunderstorms in mid latitudes convective precipitation is intermittent and often associated with baroclinic boundaries such as cold fronts squall lines and warm fronts high rainfall rates are associated with thunderstorms with larger raindrops heavy rainfall leads to fading of microwave transmissions starting above frequency of 10 gigahertz ghz but is more severe above frequencies of 15 ghz lightning thumb right 250px downward motion of cooler air from thunderstorms spreads outward in all directions when environmental wind flow is light relationships between lightning frequency and height of precipitation within thunderstorms have been found thunderstorms which show radar returns above in height are associated with storms which have more than ten lightning flashes per minute there is also a correlation between total lightning rate and size of thunderstorm its updraft velocity and amount of graupel over land same relationships fail over tropical oceans however lightning from low precipitation lp thunderstorms is one of leading causes of wildfires aviation concerns in areas where these thunderstorms form in isolation and horizontal visibility is good pilots can evade these storms rather easily in more moist atmospheres which become hazy pilots navigate above haze layer in order to get a better vantage point of these storms flying under anvil of thunderstorms is not advised as hail is more likely to fall in such areas outside thunderstorm s main rain shaft when an outflow boundary forms due to a shallow layer of rain cooled air spreading out near ground level from parent thunderstorm both speed and directional wind shear can result at leading edge of three dimensional boundary stronger outflow boundary is stronger
