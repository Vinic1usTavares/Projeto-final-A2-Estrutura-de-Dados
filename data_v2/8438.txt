biography 2008 accessed 23 aug 2011 in terms of public policy she favoured pragmatism in dealing with religious matters question of her legitimacy was a key concern although she was technically illegitimate under both protestant and catholic law her retroactively declared illegitimacy under english church was not a serious bar compared to having never been legitimate as catholics claimed she was for this reason alone it was never in serious doubt that elizabeth would embrace protestantism elizabeth and her advisers perceived threat of a catholic crusade against heretical england elizabeth therefore sought a protestant solution that would not offend catholics too greatly while addressing desires of english protestants she would not tolerate more radical puritans though who were pushing

conveniently carried off mary s archbishop of canterbury reginald pole less than twenty four hours after her own death somerset 98 there were no less than ten sees unrepresented through death or illness and carelessness of accursed cardinal pole black 10 this enabled supporters amongst peers to outvote bishops and conservative peers nevertheless elizabeth was forced to accept title of supreme governor of church of england rather than more contentious title of supreme head which many thought unacceptable for a woman to bear new act of supremacy became law on 8 may 1559 all public officials were to swear an oath of loyalty to monarch as supreme governor or risk disqualification from office heresy laws were repealed to avoid a repeat of persecution of dissenters practised by mary at same time a new act of uniformity was passed which made attendance at church and use of an adapted version of 1552 book of common prayer compulsory though penalties for recusancy or failure to attend and conform were not extreme somerset 101 103 marriage question from start of elizabeth s reign it was expected that she would marry and question arose to whom although she received many offers for her

conveniently if god take not him away with whom i mind to marry or myself or else some other great let happen doran monarchy 87 by 1570 senior figures in government privately accepted that elizabeth would never marry or name a successor william cecil was already seeking solutions to succession problem for her failure to marry elizabeth was often accused of irresponsibility haigh 20 21 her silence however strengthened her own political security she knew that if she named an heir her throne would be vulnerable to a coup she remembered that way a second person as i have been had been used as focus of plots against her predecessor haigh 22 23 elizabeth s unmarried status inspired a cult of virginity in poetry and portraiture she was depicted as a virgin or a goddess or both not as a normal woman at first only elizabeth made a virtue of her virginity in 1559 she told commons and in end this shall be for me sufficient that a marble stone shall declare that a queen having reigned such a time lived and died a virgin haigh 23 later on poets and writers took up theme and turned it into an iconography that exalted elizabeth public tributes to virgin by 1578 acted as a coded assertion of opposition to queen s marriage negotiations with duke of alencon ultimately elizabeth would insist she was married to her kingdom and subjects under divine protection in 1599 she spoke of all my husbands my good people haigh 24 mary queen of scots thumb upright left mary s french relatives considered her rightful queen of england and had english arms emblazoned with those of scotland and
