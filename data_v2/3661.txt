every corner of uk matcham was born in newton abbot devon where he became apprenticed at age of 14 to architect george soudon bridgman matcham moved to london aged 21 where he joined architectural practice of j t robinson who was to become his father in law under robinson matcham completed his first solo design elephant and castle theatre which opened in june 1879 he took over robinson s business on latter s death and continued designs of various provincial theatres matcham formed his own practice matcham co in 1880s and enlisted skilled craftsman his first major association came in 1880s when he was employed to design and refurbish theatres belonging to revill family who owned many of theatres throughout uk at that time matcham s most successful period was between 1892 and 1912 when he worked extensively for moss empires a theatrical company headed by edward moss and run by oswald stoll under them he completed 21 theatres most of which were in provinces during this period although not with moss empires he completed designs for tower ballroom at blackpool tower grand theatre blackpool both in 1894 and county arcade in leeds in 1900 author iain mackintosh writing for dictionary of national biography in 1993 describes matcham s theatre interiors to be superior when compared to building s external designs matcham s use of cantilevers for galleries allowed him to discontinue use of columns which would otherwise obstruct audience s view of stage auditorium decorations were often mixed with tudor strap work louis xiv detail anglo indian motifs naval and military insignia rococo panels classical statuary and baroque columns matcham retired to southend on sea essex shortly before first world war where he died of a heart attack brought about by a blood infection in 1920 his biographer brian walker notes from architect s personal archives that he was a man of remarkable vigour and enthusiasm for life he possessed a tranquility of mind and had a great sense of

from newton abbot to union street torquay where he secured a job as a manager of a brewery and a malthouse frank was educated at babbacombe school in babbacombe torquay matcham showed an early interest in architecture and became apprenticed at age of 14 to george soudon bridgeman a local architect walker pp 1 2 apprenticeship lasted 18 months until matcham was offered a job at a quantity surveyor s office in london in around 1868 growing up on english riviera by gorel garlick wilmore p 40 working in capital allowed matcham to study with different architectural professionals his training under a quantity surveyor taught him how to draw up estimates of cost interact with building contractors and introduced him to complex calculations something which he was unlikely to have been taught at school growing up on english riviera by gorel garlick wilmore p 42 he also learnt importance of working to tight schedules imposed by demanding customers frank matcham in perspective by andrew saint wilmore p 21 thumb left gaiety theatre in strand a building from which matcham took inspiration as a student alt black and white photograph of a large building with a domed shape roof set on a corner plot on a busy london street in his spare time matcham visited many of london s buildings but took a particular liking to theatres and music halls a building of special interest to him was newly completed gaiety theatre in strand designed by charles j phipps matcham was impressed at phipps s ability to build a normal sized theatre on a small awkward plot and it is probable that matcham gained inspiration from gaiety in some of his later buildings which were also built on restricted plots of land it is not known how long matcham spent in london although it was not uncommon for an architect to take up to six years to become qualified theatre historian gorel garlick estimates that matcham spent three years in capital during this time which would seem probable as by 1871 matcham was back in torquay and again under guidance of bridgeman this time as his chief assistant bridgeman was eager to take advantage of matcham s experience in london and asked him to help on redesign of lyceum theatre in torquay torquay directory 12 april 1871 p 4 isaac singer american businessman moved from france to devon in late 1871 his intention was to buy a large property in english countryside

1873 p 176 singer commissioned bridgeman s office to undertake design and instructed that a theatre be built within house long since demolished oldway mansion historic england accessed 7 july 2019 in an edition of builder dated 1873 matcham was named in request for tender section as being accepted party to work alongside bridgeman on oldway mansion project garlick considers it entirely possible that matcham was given responsibility for design of theatre because of his educational experiences in london singer spared no cost in terms of oldway mansion s construction he sourced finest materials from around world and instructed bridgeman to design interior in exuberant french style garlick notes that it was highly likely that singer s exuberance would have influenced someone as architecturally impressionable as matcham whose later theatres also used extravagant decoration growing up on english riviera by gorel garlick wilmore pp 44 49 entry into robinson family business in around 1875 soon after completion of singer s house matcham secured a job with j t robinson s office in london growing up on english riviera by gorel garlick wilmore p 49 employment allowed matcham to become more familiar with what matcham s biographer brian mercer walker calls theatre design of a high order matcham s time under robinson was brief robinson died unexpectedly at family home in bloomsbury square london in 1877 shortly after matcham s marriage to robinson s daughter maria on 9 july matcham was entrusted by family to continue with robinson s designs which included refurbishment of elephant and castle theatre as well as modifications to cambridge music hall in shoreditch walker p 3 by mid 1870s around 137 theatre fires had been reported in united kingdom which prompted parliament to create metropolis management and building act 1878 which established safety rules for developers to adhere to matcham found rules to be problematic because of them elephant and castle theatre project had to be extended by six months walker pp 5 6 in 1882 matcham took on redesign of grand theatre in islington it was an important project for matcham it was first to be designed using unobstructed sight lines to stage and was notable for its holding capacity and prompt construction something for which he latterly became known in architectural circles grand was revolutionary in its design it was used as an educational showpiece to amateur architects and it was often visited and commented on by architectural critics and journalists walker p 6 in one of three volumes entitled modern opera houses and theatres which were published between 1896 and 1898 author edwin sachs made reference to grand s good sighting and acoustics of auditorium economy of space and cost and rapidity of execution walker pp 6 7 matcham s improvement of sight lines were a result of his use of cantilevered steel this new design allowed for balconies to protrude into auditorium without use of supporting pillars which increased seating capacity and gave audience better views to stage it was a design that matcham patented and incorporated into all his future theatrical designs walker p 10 paragon in mile end east london in 1882 was matcham s next major project design was one of importance according to walker as it showed a great emphasis on ventilation system first of its kind which used a sun burner in roof and warm air ducts above ground level which emitted draughts walker p 7 builders of theatre crowder and payne advertised venue as being best ventilated theatre in london walker p 68 it opened in may following year to much praise for its achievements in audience comfort walker p 85 success of paragon allowed matcham to open up his own office in belfast in 1884

designed by james thomson and one that had been built on first floor of a four storey building layout was problematic and matcham had to make a series of adjustments to compensate he designed a ventilation system which involved installation of an exhaust duct over auditorium gas light which caused heat from burners to rise up and create a movement of air through theatre it was a design that he also used on gaiety matcham s second glaswegian theatre royalty took just four weeks to complete and was relatively inexpensive two factors that helped enhance his reputation matcham met actor and theatrical manager james elliston in 1886 elliston a native of edinburgh had heard of architect through his work in glasgow and commissioned him to reconstruct side boxes and gallery and to improve acoustics and ventilation system at his theatre theatre royal blackburn through elliston matcham was introduced to william j revill proprietor of people s temperance hall in stockport matcham s

contracting auditorium s art work out to a london based sculptor matcham s revills by michael sell wilmore pp 65 67 following year matcham was contracted by frederick purcell a member of extended revill family matcham s revills by michael sell wilmore p 64 to undertake renovations of his theatre that had caught fire year before matcham was afforded benefit of being able to use existing building which increased possibility of his being able to finish project on time matcham s revills by michael sell wilmore p 69 same year grand cirque and amphitheatre opened in bolton matcham s design allowed for it to be used as a circus and a theatre and for venue to be changed between two in a few hours it was decorated in italian style and had capacity to seat 3 200 people circus ring
