uss south dakota bb 57 uss south dakota bb 57 was lead vessel of four fast battleships built for united states navy in 1930s first american battleships designed after washington treaty system began to break down in mid 1930s they took advantage of an escalator clause that allowed increasing main battery to guns but congressional refusal to authorize larger battleships kept their displacement close to washington limit of a requirement to be armored against same caliber of guns as they carried combined with displacement restriction resulted in cramped ships overcrowding was exacerbated by wartime modifications that considerably strengthened their anti aircraft batteries and significantly increased their crews south dakota saw extensive action during world war ii immediately upon entering service in mid 1942 she was sent to south pacific to reinforce allied forces waging guadalcanal campaign ship was damaged in an accidental grounding on an uncharted reef but after completing repairs she returned to front taking part in battle of santa cruz in october and second naval battle of guadalcanal in november during latter action electrical failures hampered ability of ship to engage japanese warships and she became target of numerous japanese vessels sustaining over two dozen hits that significantly damaged her superstructure but did not seriously threaten her buoyancy south dakota returned to united states for repairs that lasted into 1943 after which she was briefly deployed to strengthen british home fleet tasked with protecting convoys to soviet union in mid 1943 ship was transferred back to pacific where she primarily operated with fast carrier task force contributing her heavy anti aircraft armament to its defense in this capacity she took part in gilbert and marshall islands campaign in late 1943 and early 1944 mariana and palau islands campaign in mid 1944 and philippines campaign later that year in 1945 she participated in battles of iwo jima and okinawa and bombarded japan three times following end of war in august 1945 she took part in initial occupation of country before returning to united states in september she later moved to philadelphia naval shipyard where she was laid up in atlantic reserve fleet until 1962 when she was sold for scrap design thumb left recognition drawing of south dakota class south dakota class battleship 1939 south dakota was ordered in context of global naval rearmament during breakdown of washington treaty system that had controlled battleship construction during 1920s and early 1930s under washington and london treaties so called treaty battleships were limited to a standard displacement of and a main battery of guns in 1936 following japan s decision to abandon treaty system united states navy decided to invoke escalator clause in treaty that allowed displacements to rise to and armament to increase to guns congressional objections to increasing size of new ships forced design staff to keep displacement as close to 35 000 lt as possible while incorporating larger guns and armor sufficient to defeat guns of same caliber south dakota was long overall and had a beam of and a draft of she displaced as designed and up to at full combat load ship was powered by four shaft general electric steam turbines and eight oil fired babcock wilcox boilers rated at generating a top speed of ship had a cruising range of at a speed of she carried three vought os2u kingfisher floatplanes for aerial reconnaissance which were launched by a pair of aircraft catapults on her fantail her peace time crew numbered 1 793 officers and enlisted men but during war crew swelled to 2 500 thumb south dakotas forward turrets note various radar sets on tower mast ship was armed with a main battery of nine 16 inch 45 caliber mark 6 guns in three triple gun turrets on centerline two of which were placed in a superfiring pair forward with third aft secondary battery consisted of sixteen 38 caliber dual purpose guns mounted in twin turrets clustered amidships four turrets on either side this was two fewer turrets than her sisters a reduction in weight and magazine space to accommodate extra personnel and equipment for her use as a flagship to compensate for reduction in medium anti aircraft firepower she received light anti aircraft guns as designed ship was equipped with an anti aircraft battery of twenty 75 caliber guns and twelve 50 caliber m2 browning machine guns in single mounts but she was completed with a battery of seven quadruple bofors guns seven quadruple 1 1 in guns thirty four oerlikon autocannon in single mounts and eight of 50 cal guns main armored belt was thick while main armored deck was up to thick main battery gun turrets had thick faces and they were mounted atop barbettes that were thick conning tower had 16 in thick sides dakota received a series of modifications through her wartime career consisting primarily of additions to her anti aircraft battery and various types of radar sets first addition was installation of sc air search radar ordered in 1941 that was fitted in fore mast it was later replaced with an sk type set at same time an sg surface search radar was installed on forward superstructure a second sg set was added to main mast after experiences during guadalcanal campaign in 1942 during fitting out in 1942 she received a mark 3 fire control radar mounted on her conning tower to assist in direction of her main battery guns and mark 4 radars for secondary battery guns mark 3 was quickly replaced with more modern mark 8 fire control radar and mark 4 radars for secondary battery guns she later received mark 12 22 sets in place of mark 4s south dakota also received a tdy jammer in 1945 her traditional spotting scopes were replaced with mark 27 microwave radar sets and she received an sr air search radar and an sk 2 air search dish ship s light anti aircraft battery was gradually expanded in november 1942 eight more 50 cal machine guns were installed and during repairs in late 1942 and early 1943 two of her 1 1 in quadruple mounts were replaced with 40 mm quadruple mounts by february 1943 all of her 1 1 in guns were removed and thirteen more 40 mm quadruple mounts were added by this time her 20 mm battery had been increased to 80 barrels all in individual mounts by end of war eight of these had been removed service history thumb south dakota during her shakedown cruise keel for south dakota was laid down on 5 july 1939 at new york shipbuilding corporation in camden new jersey she was launched on 7 june 1941 and was commissioned into fleet on 20 march 1942 she was then towed across river to philadelphia navy yard and began fitting out captain thomas leigh gatch was her first commanding officer this work was completed by 14 may and over next two days she did machinery tests in delaware river followed by more fitting out work that lasted until 3 june two days later she began her shakedown cruise escorted by four destroyers owing to threat of german u boats operating off east coast of united states over following two days she tested her engines at various speeds and test fired her guns to check for structural problems training in area continued until 17 july and next day departed for hampton roads virginia with four destroyers as escort from there she cruised back north to meet battleship off coast of maine before anchoring at casco bay on 21 july there she engaged in further firing practice before steaming to philadelphia finally being declared ready for active duty on 26 july first pacific deployment as fighting between american and japanese forces in guadalcanal campaign intensified particularly after allied defeat at battle of savo island admiral ernest king chief of naval operations ordered south dakota washington light cruiser and six destroyers to deploy to south pacific to reinforce american fleet there rear admiral radm willis lee took command of ships designated battleship division batdiv 6 on 14 august hoisting his flag aboard south dakota next day she got underway escorted by three destroyers but her progress was delayed by an engine breakdown that necessitated repairs that were completed following morning after steaming south through caribbean lee detached escorting destroyers passed through panama canal and picked up three other destroyers on pacific side of canal later in august while still en route to guadalcanal area south dakota rendezvoused with juneau ships proceeding together to nuku alofa tongatapu which they reached on 4 september after refueling there they left port on 6 september but south dakota was badly damaged when she struck an uncharted reef in passage divers from repair ship inspected hull and discovered a length of plating had been damaged workers from vestal patched hull allowing her to depart for pearl harbor on 12 september where permanent repairs were effected she joined aircraft carrier which had been torpedoed by a japanese submarine south of guadalcanal and her escorts for voyage repairs lasted from 23 to 28 september and work also included removing 1 1 inch guns adding four 40 mm quad mounts and twenty two 20 mm guns after loading ammunition and supplies south dakota was pronounced ready for sea on 12 october she conducted anti aircraft training through following day before returning to pearl harbor on 14 october she departed for south pacific later that day in company with task force 16 tf which included aircraft carrier with nine escorting destroyers vice admiral william f halsey south pacific area commander ordered tf 16 to sweep for japanese naval forces north of santa cruz islands before turning south west toward solomon islands to block japanese path to guadalcanal for operation tf 16 was reinforced by tf 17 centered on carrier which were combined to form tf 61 under command of radm thomas c kinkaid force was supported by lee with tf 64 which comprised washington two heavy cruisers two light cruisers and six destroyers battle of santa cruz islands thumb south dakota at battle of santa cruz japanese and american reconnaissance aircraft discovered each others fleets on 25 october and south dakotas crew prepared for a night surface action that night though anticipated japanese attack did not materialize japanese reconnaissance aircraft that had spotted lee s force east of rennell island had drawn japanese fleet in his direction away from tf 61 next morning aircraft from enterprise located japanese aircraft carriers minutes before a japanese seaplane located tf 61 both sides immediately launched air strikes leading to battle of santa cruz islands first japanese wave struck hornets group inflicting serious damage on carrier and forcing her to withdraw though south dakota and enterprise were left unmolested hornets withdrawal allowed japanese carriers to concentrate their attacks on enterprises group a second strike later that morning shortly after 10 00 targeted enterprise group and south dakota provided heavy anti aircraft fire to drive off attackers ships shot down seven japanese aircraft and fighters claimed another three a third wave hit task force an hour later and at 11 48 a group of nakajima b5n torpedo bombers attacked south dakota she evaded torpedoes and shot down one of attackers a fourth strike arrived over fleet half an hour later and several aichi d3a dive bombers attacked south dakota most of bombs fell harmlessly in sea but one scored a hit on her forward main battery turret roof though it exploded without penetrating gatch who was out on bridge wing to spot bombers so he could try to maneuver vessel away was wounded by a bomb splinter and concussion from blast threw him into wall and knocked him unconscious two men were killed and over fifty were wounded by fragments from bomb splinters from bomb damaged center and left gun of number two turret gun crew was eventually informed by bureau of ordnance that gouges were deep enough that barrels should not be fired left thumb south dakota fires at a japanese torpedo bomber right during battle of santa cruz smoke around battleship is from ship s anti aircraft guns a miscommunication while transferring steering control to executive officer s xo station caused south dakota to haul out of formation briefly headed toward enterprise before xo corrected mistake two fleets then disengaged as night approached south dakotas gunners claimed to have shot down 26 japanese aircraft but only 13 had actually been shot down by all of ships of tf 16 combined ship suffered two fatalities and around sixty wounded between bomb hit and strafing runs from mitsubishi a6m zero fighters effectiveness of south dakotas anti aircraft fire was exaggerated in press after battle 5 inch 1 1 inch and 40 mm guns had difficulty tracking targets through low clouds 20 mm guns with their shorter effective range were not hampered by reduced visibility and accounted for two thirds of aircraft south dakota shot down according to ship s after action report though japanese carriers survived battle and hornet eventually had to be scuttled japanese had lost 99 aircraft nearly half of carriers complement devastating japanese naval aviation which relied on a small number of highly trained veterans that could not be easily replaced while attempting to avoid a submarine contact on return trip to noumea south dakota collided with destroyer on 30 october both south dakota and mahan suffered significant damage with bow deflected to port and crumpled back to frame 14 both warships continued to noumea where vestal repaired south dakotas collision and battle damage repair team flooded some of south dakotas internal compartments to induce a list to expose damaged hull plating work lasted from 1 to 6 november and gatch had returned to duty previous day by this time enterprise was only active carrier in pacific and so halsey ordered washington to join south dakota as part of escort force to protect valuable carrier tf 16 now consisted of south dakota enterprise washington heavy cruiser and nine destroyers ships sortied on 11 november to return to fighting off guadalcanal cruiser and two more destroyers joined them following day on 13 november after learning that a major japanese attack was approaching halsey detached south dakota washington and four of destroyers as task group 16 3 again under lee s command enterprise her forward elevator damaged from action at santa cruz was kept to south as a reserve ships of tg 16 3 were to block an anticipated japanese bombardment group in waters off guadalcanal second naval battle of guadalcanal as lee s task group approached guadalcanal his japanese counterpart admiral nobutake kondo steamed to meet him with his main bombardment force consisting of fast battleship heavy cruisers and and a destroyer screen while en route tg 16 3 was re designated as tf 64 on 14 november ships passed to south of guadalcanal and then rounded western end of island to block kondo s expected route japanese aircraft reported sighting lee s formation but identification of ships ranged from a group of cruisers and destroyers to aircraft carriers causing confusion among japanese commanders that evening american reconnaissance aircraft spotted japanese warships off savo island prompting lee to order his ships to general quarters four destroyers were arrayed ahead of two battleships american task force having been thrown together a day before had not operated together as a unit and both of battleships had very limited experience shooting their main battery particularly at night at around 23 00 on 14 november leading japanese destroyers in a screening force commanded by radm shintaro hashimoto sent ahead of kondo s main force spotted lee s ships and turned about to warn kondo at about same time washingtons search radar picked up one of hashimoto s cruisers and a destroyer ships fire control radars then began tracking japanese vessels and lee ordered both of his battleships to open fire when ready washington fired first at 23 17 at a range of followed quickly by south dakota though she was limited to four of her six forward guns owing to damage to two of barrels sustained at santa cruz ships used their radars to determine range but their optical directors to aim guns south dakota initially targeted destroyer south dakota missed but immediately turned to open range south dakota then shifted fire to destroyers and her spotters claimed south dakota had hit both and set them on fire but she scored no hits during this period former approached washington too closely however and was quickly reduced to a flaming wreck which was scuttled later shortly thereafter at about 23 30 an error in electrical switchboard room knocked out power aboard south dakota disabling her radar systems and leaving ship all but blind to japanese vessels approaching force by this time hashimoto s ships had inflicted serious damage on american destroyer screen two of destroyers were torpedoed one of which survived until following morning and a third was destroyed by gunfire this compounded south dakotas problems as she had to keep clear of burning wrecks by being forced to turn in front of burning destroyers fires backlit south dakota and highlighted her presence to japanese ships at 23 40 she engaged hashimoto s ships with her rear turret which accidentally set her kingfishers on fire but a second salvo knocked two of three burning aircraft overboard and blew out fire on third power was restored and she fired five salvos from her main battery at a range of but shock of firing guns caused further electrical failures disabling her gunnery and search radars for five minutes shortly before midnight upon reactivating her search radar south dakota picked up numerous japanese vessels directly ahead these were kondo s ships and they immediately launched a volley of torpedoes at south dakota though they all missed having inadvertently closed to within of kondo s force south dakota bore brunt of japanese attacks during this phase of battle japanese destroyers illuminated ship and rest of kondo s vessels concentrated their fire on south dakota she received 27 hits during this phase including a 14 inch shell from kirishima that hit rear turret and failed to penetrate armor though it damaged training gear most of hits came from medium caliber guns of cruisers and destroyers though they were largely confined to superstructure where they did not threaten ship s survival they nevertheless inflicted significant damage destroying radar sets disabling radio systems and knocking out other systems leaving ship in lee s words deaf dumb blind and impotent focused on south dakota japanese left washington unengaged allowing her to attack kirishima without any disruption south dakota fired two or three salvos at next japanese ship in line before shifting fire to target kirishima as well firing five salvos in total before checking her fire as her gun directing equipment had been disabled her secondary battery nevertheless kept up a heavy fire washington quickly inflicted fatal damage on kirishima destroying two of her four main battery turrets holing her below waterline and starting numerous fires shortly after midnight kondo turned his ships to bring them back into torpedo range leaving stricken kirishima to steam out of control at 00 05 japanese ceased firing at south dakota and she increased speed to and checked her fire at 00 08 since her radios had been disabled by gunfire gatch could not communicate with lee so he turned south and disengaged a hit below waterline caused minor flooding and a list of 0 75 degrees though that was quickly corrected fires that shell hits had started were suppressed by 01 55 at around 02 00 south dakota restored radio contact with washington and gatch informed lee of his ship s condition lee ordered gatch to withdraw at high speed south dakotas crew had suffered heavy casualties with 40 killed and 180 wounded among injured was 12 year old calvin graham who had lied about his age to enlist he was youngest american to fight in war south dakota received navy unit commendation for her role in battle by 09 00 south dakota had formed back up with washington benham and destroyer to withdraw from area repairs and atlantic deployment thumb south dakota tied alongside repair ship after battle off joined south dakota and two battleships withdrew to noumea which they reached on 17 november there repair ship repaired some of south dakotas damage work lasting until 25 november during that period she received replacements for her destroyed kingfishers on 25 november she got underway headed to nuku alofa escorted by a pair of destroyers after refueling there on 27 november she proceeded with destroyers until 29th when she detached them to return to fleet south dakota steamed northeast to panama canal which she reached on 11 december she refueled on pacific side of canal passed through locks and steamed north to new york once she was in atlantic she picked up an escort of two destroyers after arriving in new york on 18 december south dakota went into dry dock at brooklyn navy yard for permanent repairs and a refit ship was heralded in press and credited with victory off guadalcanal instead of washington despite her poor performance in action for security purposes she was referred to as battleship x captain lynde d mccormick relieved gatch on 1 february 1943 and ship went to sea on 25 february to begin sea trials in march she began operations in north atlantic with carrier british home fleet deployed battleships to mediterranean to support allied invasion of sicily and south dakota was in turn sent to reinforce home fleet her primary responsibility during this period was protecting arctic supply convoys being sent to soviet union through arctic ocean a powerful german squadron consisting of battleships and and several heavy cruisers threatened these convoys american contribution to convoy escort was designated tf 61 commanded by radm olaf m and consisted of south dakota her sister and five destroyers ships arrived in scapa flow on 19 may and joined battleships and with which they frequently operated over next three months ships protected convoys going back and forth between britain and soviet union and in july they conducted a demonstration to distract german attention during sicily invasion though germans took no notice of ships at end of month south dakota was recalled to norfolk with five destroyers as escort they arrived there on 1 august after her arrival radm edward hanson commander of batdiv 9 came aboard south dakota making her his flagship second tour in pacific thumb south dakotas crew preparing to recover a kingfisher seaplane gilbert and marshall islands south dakota departed norfolk on 21 august and reached efate in south pacific on 14 september from there she steamed to fiji on 7 november where she joined rest of batdiv 9 which had been assigned to support force for tg 50 1 designated carrier interceptor group american fleet embarked on a campaign to conquer gilbert and marshall islands beginning with operation galvanic seizure of tarawa later in november on 19 november carriers launched raids on tarawa and nearby islands in advance of amphibious assault south dakota once again came under command of lee in december who commanded tg 50 4 which also included battleships alabama washington and two carriers ships were sent to attack nauru early in month and on 6 december they were reinforced by battleships and now being re designated tg 50 8 ships arrived off nauru two days later and bombarded it with gunfire from battleships and strikes from carriers aircraft americans achieved little of significance as japanese forces on island were light and had few aircraft to be targeted ships returned to efate and began preparations for next major offensive including loading ammunition and other supplies she loaded ammunition from transport on 5 january 1944 and went to sea in company with indiana and three destroyers for gunnery training on 16 january next operation in which south dakota participated was invasion of marshalls code named operation flintlock south dakota was now part of tg 37 2 third fleet which included indiana massachusetts north carolina and washington escorted by six destroyers they departed efate on 18 january bound for funafuti heavy seas injured several men aboard south dakota and swept one man overboard who was not recovered ships met carriers and on way and on arriving in funafuti two days later group was re numbered as tf 58 8 as fifth fleet had taken command of fast carrier task force ships refueled and departed on 23 january and on morning of 25 january south dakota north carolina and alabama were detached to form tg 58 2 2 fleet continued on to its objective over next several days voyage marked by false submarine sightings and radar contacts ships reached roi namur on 29 january and carriers launched major air strikes on islands in preparation for coming assault south dakota remained with carriers to protect them from japanese aircraft that did not materialize on 30 january south dakota and rest of tg 58 2 2 were sent to shell islands part of preparatory bombardment before ground forces went ashore following day central pacific raids thumb left part of south dakotas light anti aircraft armament including a 40 mm quad mount and numerous 20 mm single dakota steamed to majuro to replenish fuel and ammunition on 4 february before departing on 12 february to support operation hailstone a raid on major japanese naval base in central pacific at truk american strikes sank a number of japanese warships and logistics vessels in harbor before continuing on to raid japanese air bases in mariana islands on 20 february south dakotas 5 inch gunners engaged japanese aircraft at long range late on 21 february and into early hours of 22 february heavy anti aircraft fire from fleet kept japanese aircraft from closing to attack effectively and south dakota claimed several aircraft shot down american carriers attacked airfields on saipan guam and tinian over next two days and on 23 february fleet came under heavy japanese air strikes a wave of mitsubishi g4m land based bombers struck fleet and south dakota shot down at least two of them one of which had attempted to bomb ship south dakota alabama and a screen of destroyers were detached from carrier raiding force to return to tg 58 2 they arrived back in majuro on 26 february where they refueled and conducted shooting practice over next month fifth fleet got underway on 22 march for operation desecrate one a series of carrier raids on islands in western carolines including palau yap woleai and ulithi raids were intended to secure seaward flank for landing at hollandia in new guinea for operation south dakota was assigned to tg 58 9 which included four other fast battleships two carriers three heavy cruisers and thirteen destroyers ships were tasked with screening main carrier task force to guard against a possible attack by heavy surface elements of japanese combined fleet though they encountered no naval opposition on 27 march three carriers and other warships from tg 36 1 joined tg 58 2 which was re designated 58 3 late that evening south dakotas air search radar picked up japanese aircraft approaching in ensuing battle south dakotas gunners could not identify any targets in darkness and so she did not engage japanese aircraft for their part japanese inflicted no damage on fleet main carrier force began their raids on 30 march which continued into 1 april another japanese air strike hit fleet late on 30th and this time south dakota engaged two waves of attackers but did not shoot any down carriers inflicted significant losses to japanese forces in region at little cost before further operations were interrupted by bad weather that prevented aircraft from being launched by 6 april fleet had returned to majuro to prepare for next operation operation desecrate two followed next week this series of raids targeted japanese positions along coast of new guinea to support landing at aitape while underway on 19 april south dakota picked up a japanese aircraft that was shadowing fleet and a fighter from combat air patrol cap was sent to shoot it down carriers began their strikes two days later and inflicted serious losses sinking a number of japanese vessels in area and destroying around 130 aircraft in air or on ground another series of raids followed next day to support ground forces fighting ashore while fleet withdrew back to majuro carriers hit truk again on 29 and 30 april further battering island on 1 may lee took fast battleships including south dakota and created tg 58 7 tasked with bombarding island of pohnpei ships arrived off island that afternoon and opened fire quickly suppressing japanese anti aircraft guns that attempted to engage them south dakota indiana and north carolina briefly disengaged to avoid a reported submarine in area but after it failed to attack they returned to their firing positions there were few targets for battleships but operation provided crews with experience operating in bombardment role together ships returned to majuro on 4 may south dakota conducted more shooting practice at sea on 15 16 may mariana and palau islands thumb a japanese plane shot down over carrier tf 58 sortied on 6 june to begin operation forager invasion of mariana islands south dakota operated as part of tg 58 7 again under lee s command unit now included six other battleships four heavy cruisers and thirteen destroyers they were again tasked primarily with escorting fast carrier strike force providing protection against surface forces and their ample anti aircraft batteries to defend against hostile aircraft carriers began their raids on 11 june and continued for several days japanese aircraft launched first of several counter attacks later that night and south dakota used her air search radar to help vector fighters from cap to intercept them as japanese made their approach south dakotas 5 inch guns opened fire on 13 june south dakota and other battleships were sent to shell saipan and tinian in advance of arrival of old battleships of bombardment group following day japanese artillery attempted to engage them but south dakota and other battleships easily outranged them south dakota bombarded area around harbor for some six hours hitting two transports in port and starting several fires in town shelling was generally ineffective however as battleships were not sufficiently experienced with shore bombardment and japanese defenses were largely undamaged on 14 june south dakota refueled some of escorting destroyers and employed her kingfishers to rescue downed pilots from carriers next day marines went ashore on saipan a breach of japan s inner defensive perimeter that triggered japanese fleet to launch a major counter thrust with 1st mobile fleet main carrier strike force while japanese were approaching local counter attacks from land based aircraft struck fleet first of these hit on evening of 15 june with south dakota shooting down one of attackers ship refueled next day and on 17 june carriers and escorting battleships left saipan area to meet 1st mobile fleet after patrolling submarines had reported its approach through philippine sea on 18 june lee and admiral marc mitscher commander of fast carrier task force discussed strategies for coming battle and lee decided to deploy his battleships with carriers to screen them during anticipated japanese attack rather than pursue japanese fleet in a night action as mitscher suggested battle of philippine sea thumb right 1 july 1944 chaplain lindner reads benediction held in honor of shipmates killed in air action off guam lee kept his ships steaming in a circle that was in diameter to cover a wide area as japanese scouts approached fleet early on 19 june south dakota and other battleships tracked these aircraft on their air search radars by 10 04 south dakota picked up first wave of strike aircraft inbound and ordered her crew to general quarters in ensuing battle of philippine sea cap fighters engaged incoming aircraft at 10 43 but japanese planes broke through and continued on to fleet one of these a yokosuka d4y dive bomber hit south dakota with a bomb at 10 49 blasting an hole in deck disabling a 40 mm mount and killing twenty four and wounding another twenty seven men gun crews claimed to have shot bomber down but observers aboard alabama stated that plane evaded fire and escaped at 11 50 a second wave of about twenty aircraft punched their way through cap two nakajima b6n torpedo bombers attempted to launch their torpedoes at south dakota but heavy fire from her and alabama forced them to break off their runs other aircraft targeted south dakota at around 11 55 but she again emerged unscathed third and fourth waves hit fleet later in day but south dakota was not attacked during these actions that evening men killed in bomb hit were buried at sea one of wounded men succumbed to his injuries next morning and he was buried as well battle continued throughout 20 june but south dakota did not see further action american strike aircraft had had to fly at extreme range to attack retreating japanese fleet and so many were forced to ditch their aircraft after running out of fuel south dakota spent next morning searching for downed aircrews during this period another man who had been wounded by bomb hit died south dakota turned to east on 22 june with 1st mobile fleet having been badly mauled by mitscher s carrier strike invasion fleet off marianas was no longer under significant threat and battleships of tg 58 7 could withdraw from area south dakota was transferred to tg 58 2 and sent to eniwetok on 23 june arriving there four days later from there she got underway for puget sound by way of pearl harbor while in pearl harbor on 2 july she embarked a group of 248 wounded 279 sailors and 90 marines to carry them to mainland she reached puget sound on 10 july and disembarked her passengers and her own wounded crewmen next day she was then dry docked for repairs that evening work was completed by 6 august and after being re floated she loaded ammunition on 19 august sea trials began two days later she was then assigned to task unit tu 12 5 1 in company with a pair of destroyers on 25 august departing for pearl harbor which she reached on last day of month ship took part in a series of gunnery exercises off hawaii from 6 to 8 september including anti aircraft shooting and defending against simulated torpedo boat attacks she replenished fuel and ammunition in pearl harbor on 9 september and departed two days later for further maneuvers during these exercises she experienced difficulties with her engines divers inspected screws and discovered that several of blades on three of her four propellers were bent or chipped instead of participating in scheduled exercises she had to return to dry dock in pearl harbor for repairs that lasted until 16 september she resumed training operations that day before getting underway to re join fleet on 18 september tu 12 5 1 initially headed to seeadler harbor in manus island off new guinea but while en route they were redirected to ulithi which had recently been seized to serve as fleet s advance base they reached their destination on 30 september by which time third fleet had taken operational control of fast carrier task force okinawa and formosa raids thumb an unidentified south dakota class battleship during formosa raid with a b6n flying through flak on 3 october fleet at ulithi was forced to go to sea to avoid being caught in harbor by a typhoon that struck that night after returning to anchorage next morning stores ship accidentally collided with south dakota striking her port side and inflicting only superficial damage on 5 october hanson came back aboard ship and she resumed her role as flagship of batdiv 9 next day tf 38 to which batdiv 9 had been assigned sortied to embark on next major operation a series of carrier raids on japanese positions in western pacific fast carrier task force still under mitscher s command steamed north to launch strikes on okinawa islands they arrived early on morning of 10 october and began raid which sank twenty nine japanese vessels in area early next morning battleship picked up a radar contact at long range and south dakota confirmed contact it turned out to be a g4m bomber shadowing task force that was shot down by one of cap fighters after leaving okinawa area mitscher turned to make a feint toward philippines late in day before turning west toward formosa which he attacked in a major raid beginning on 12 october aircraft inflicted significant damage to japanese installations around island bombing airfields factories and other military facilities and sinking eighteen ships and damaging six more a g4m dropped chaff to interfere with fleet s search radars but measure was only partially effective and bomber was shot down cap intercepted three waves of bombers but they were able to approach fleet much closer before being detected possibly as a result of chaff south dakota opened fire with her 5 inch guns at 19 03 as first wave arrived before target turned away second wave reached fleet about twenty minutes later and south dakotas gunners engaged it as well japanese air strikes convinced mitscher to disengage to east before returning next morning for another attack while americans were withdrawing japanese aircraft repeatedly attacked ships though south dakota initially held her fire since no aircraft approached close enough for her to engage them at 22 31 she reported shooting down one aircraft and she kept another group of aircraft at bay with long range 5 inch fire closer to midnight carriers returned to their strike positions on 13 october but japanese aircraft counter attacked almost immediately though this first wave was broken up by cap fighters several waves of g4m bombers struck fleet torpedoing cruiser south dakota maneuvered at high speed to avoid their torpedoes while engaging bombers american carriers launched another round of strikes next day to cover withdrawal of canberra and her escorts later that afternoon lookouts on south dakota spotted a wave of seven b6n torpedo bombers approaching fleet she opened fire on two closest aircraft shooting one of them down five more were destroyed by fire from other ships in area fast carrier task force then withdrew to support invasion of philippines philippines campaign battle of leyte gulf thumb south dakota underway in august 1944 landing on leyte on 17 october triggered japanese high command to initiate operation sho go 1 a complicated counter thrust that involved four separate fleets converging on allied invasion fleet to destroy it 1st mobile fleet now labeled northern force had been significantly reduced in strength by three years of combat and was intended to serve only as a distraction to lure american fast carrier task force away from invasion fleet meanwhile vice admiral takeo kurita s center force would pass through san bernardino strait and attack invasion fleet americans detected kurita s approach however and carriers launched a major attack on his fleet while it passed through sibuyan sea after losing powerful battleship in battle of sibuyan sea on 24 october kurita temporarily reversed course this convinced halsey now commander of third fleet to send fast carrier task force to destroy 1st mobile fleet which had by then been detected later that evening commodore arleigh burke mitscher s chief of staff suggested that mitscher detach south dakota and massachusetts along with a pair of light cruisers and a destroyer screen to send them ahead of carriers to fight a night action with northern force mitscher agreed and at 17 12 ordered radm forrest sherman to put plan into action halsey intervened before sherman could send ships north and overruled mitscher ordering them to keep battleships with main fleet as halsey sent mitscher north to pursue japanese carriers he established tf 34 consisting of south dakota and five other fast battleships seven cruisers and eighteen destroyers commanded by now vice admiral lee tf 34 was arrayed ahead of carriers serving as their screen on morning of 25 october mitscher began his first attack on northern force initiating battle off cape engano over course of six strikes on japanese fleet americans sank all four carriers and damaged two old battleships that had been converted into hybrid carriers unknown to halsey and mitscher kurita had resumed his approach through san bernardino strait late on 24 october and passed into leyte gulf next morning while mitscher was occupied with decoy northern force kurita moved in to attack invasion fleet in battle off samar he was held off by a group of escort carriers destroyers and destroyer escorts tu 77 4 3 known as taffy 3 frantic calls for help later that morning led halsey to detach lee s battleships to head south and intervene however halsey waited more than an hour after receiving orders from admiral chester w nimitz commander u s pacific fleet to detach tf 34 still steaming north during this interval delay added two hours to battleships voyage south a need to refuel destroyers further slowed tf 34 s progress south heavy resistance from taffy 3 threw kurita s battleships and cruisers into disarray and led him to break off attack before south dakota and rest of tf 34 could arrive halsey detached battleships iowa and as tg 34 5 to pursue kurita through san bernardino strait while lee took rest of his ships further southwest to try to cut off his escape but both groups arrived too late historian h p wilmott speculated that had halsey detached tf 34 promptly and not delayed battleships by refueling destroyers ships could have easily arrived in strait ahead of center force and owing to marked superiority of their radar directed main guns destroyed kurita s ships south dakota refueled at sea on 26 october before in turn refueling a pair of destroyers two days later she refueled another two destroyers on 30 october though process was temporarily interrupted by appearance of a g4m on 1 november south dakota was transferred to batdiv 6 though hanson remained aboard ship until her replacement new battleship arrived later that month south dakota

luzon next day group came under air attack on afternoon of 5 november errant rounds from other ships accidentally killed a man and wounded seven more aboard south dakota during action another wave of aircraft approached following morning prompting fleet to assume a defensive formation japanese planes did not attack however and fleet returned to its cruising formation south dakota spent next several days refueling destroyers and replenishing her own fuel bunkers carriers launched another series of raids on 13 and 14 november before withdrawing to ulithi arriving on 17 november next day hanson transferred to wisconsin and lee who was by now commander battleships pacific fleet came aboard ship making her his flagship south dakota and rest of tg 38 3 sortied on 22 november unit by this

operation was to seize a large airfield that could be used to support invasion of luzon carriers began a series of strikes on airfields on luzon on 14 december to destroy or otherwise prevent japanese aircraft there from interfering with landing on mindoro american raids continued over next several days and significantly degraded remaining strength of japanese air forces in philippines late in day on 17 december typhoon cobra swept through area battering fleet sinking three destroyers and inflicting serious damage to several other vessels though south dakota emerged relatively unscathed damage inflicted on fleet delayed further support of ground troops for two days and continuing bad weather led halsey to break off operations ships arrived back in ulithi on 24 december tf 38 refueled over next several days and embarked on another raid on formosa on 3 4 january 1945 but bad weather hampered flight operations and halsey broke off operation having achieved little ships returned to philippines and made repeated strikes on lingayen over course of 6 and 7 january in preparation for next landing particularly targeting airfields being used by kamikaze suicide aircraft ships then entered south china sea on 10 january and refueled before conducting a further series of strikes against various targets in region including formosa on 21 january and ryuku islands following day battles of iwo jima and okinawa thumb south dakota aboard auxiliary floating drydock by early february fifth fleet had resumed control of fast carrier task force and south dakota was transferred to tg 58 3 along with new jersey large cruiser and several other warships fleet carriers conducted a series of air strikes on japan targeting tokyo area on 17 february but bad weather made it difficult for aircraft to operate ships of tg 58 3 were then sent to reinforce invasion fleet during battle of iwo jima from 19 to 22 february carriers made repeated strikes as marines went ashore on first day of landing ships of tf 58 were then recalled for another series of raids on japan targeting tokyo on 25 february planned attacks on kobe and nagoya were cancelled due to poor weather fleet then returned to ulithi to replenish ammunition and fuel before embarking on another raid of japan in mid march carriers struck kyushu on 18 march while battleships continue their air defense role four days later having inflicted serious damage on airfields and several warships in kure task force withdrew to refuel following day air strikes to prepare okinawa for assault began interrupted by need to disengage and refuel on 28 29 march initiation of major attacks on island a clear indicator of an impending amphibious assault led japanese to begin a serious concentrated kamikaze campaign against fleet damaging numerous vessels but not seriously impeding allies progress over coming weeks task groups of tf 58 rotated through waters off okinawa two groups at a time to allow other groups to replenish fuel and ammunition and repair battle damage throughout maelstrom off okinawa south dakota emerged without having been hit by any of kamikazes on 19 april south dakota was detached from carriers to join a shore bombardment group sent to support a major offensive by xxiv army corps against japanese defensive positions in southern okinawa though they made little progress ships of tf 58 then departed for a raid on sakishima islands before withdrawing to leyte after replenishing there task groups resumed their rotations off okinawa for next week on 6 may south dakota was replenishing ammunition from ammunition ship when a tank of propellant for guns exploded blast detonated four more tanks and caused a serious fire forcing crew to flood magazine for turret number 2 to avoid a catastrophic explosion three men were killed by explosion and eight more were seriously wounded and later died another twenty four were less seriously injured in accident south dakota was detached from tg 58 4 for repairs at ulithi on 13 may in company with a pair of escorting destroyers arriving there next day she entered auxiliary floating drydock to be inspected ship s propellers shafts and

series of strikes on targets in japan to deplete japanese forces in home islands while en route south dakota kept several destroyers fueled before fleet arrived off coast of japan on 10 july carriers began their raids that day though japanese had anticipated attacks and had dispersed and camouflaged their aircraft holding them back for eventual landing instead of losing them prematurely as a result carrier aircraft found few japanese planes to destroy over next several days on 14 july south dakota was assigned to tu 38 8 1 with indiana massachusetts two heavy cruisers and nine destroyers battleships were then sent to bombard town of kamaishi to destroy kamaishi steel works but mountainous terrain made targeting facility difficult this was first time that japan came under bombardment by capital ships during war despite their difficulty in observing effects of their shooting in course of six passes battleships inflicted what was later estimated to have been a two and a half month interruption in coke production and a one month disruption of pig iron manufacture battleships then returned to their positions with tf 38 and covered them during air strikes on honshu and hokkaido on 15 july further reinforced by british pacific fleet allied fleet struck targets around tokyo on 17 july sinking or damaging several warships in area over course of 20 through 22 july south dakota

1 and supported carriers during further strikes on airfields later that day and on 10th shafroth transferred to alabama on 12 august and south dakota was reassigned to tg 38 3 next morning end of war tf 38 carriers had already launched aircraft on morning of 15 august when halsey received word that japanese had agreed to surrender unconditionally aircraft were recalled and south dakota received order to cease offensive operations at 06 58 problems communicating their surrender to all subordinate units led to some japanese aircraft launching attacks on fleet later that day but they were all shot down by cap aircraft south dakota spent next several days refueling and replenishing ammunition before steaming to sagami wan on 27 august as part of initial occupation of japan two days later she moved to tokyo bay that afternoon halsey and nimitz came aboard ship halsey left later in day but nimitz remained until he left for battleship where formal surrender ceremony took place on 2

underwent an overhaul in preparation for deactivation a month later on 21 february radm thomas r cooley hoisted his flag aboard ship making her flagship of fourth fleet a reserve unit cooley s tenure aboard ship was brief and he was replaced by vice admiral charles h mcmorris just five days later on 3 july mcmorris transferred his flag to heavy cruiser and navy dissolved fourth fleet on 1 january 1947 south dakota was decommissioned on 31 january and laid up in atlantic reserve fleet plans were drawn up during period she was in reserve to modernize south dakota and other ships of her class should they be needed for future active service in march 1954 a program to equip four ships with secondary batteries consisting of ten twin guns were proposed but plan came to nothing another plan to convert ship into a guided missile battleship arose in 1956 1957 but cost of conversion proved to be prohibitive she would have had all three main battery turrets removed and replaced with a twin rim 8 talos missile launcher forward two rim 24 tartar launchers aft anti submarine weapons and equipment to handle helicopters cost of project amounted to 120 million ship remained in navy s inventory for another fifteen years before being stricken from naval vessel register on 1 june 1962 south dakota was sold to lipsett division of luria brothers and co to be broken up for scrap on 25 october
