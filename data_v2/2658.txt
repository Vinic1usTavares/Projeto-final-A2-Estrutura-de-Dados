his home in connecticut arnold s angry response to loss of command led some members of congress to dislike him in spite of his military contributions brandt 1994 p 38 congressional opinion of arnold was also negatively affected by reports circulated by two men that arnold came to consider enemies john brown and james easton were two of allen s lieutenants who had traveled to massachusetts and

men were marked by conflict brandt 1994 p 29 in an encounter between arnold and easton in june easton slighted arnold s authority to which arnold responded by challenging other man to a duel easton

boats on river s southern banks although two warships frigate lizard 26 guns and sloop of war hunter 16 guns kept up a constant patrol to prevent a river crossing arnold was able to procure sufficient watercraft for his men and crossed to quebec city side on november 11 smith 1903 pp 254 257 he then realized his force was not strong enough to capture city so he retreated several miles and waited

brigadier general in january for his success in reaching quebec city smith 1907 vol 2 p 189 he also had a run in with john brown who was now a major and had come north with montgomery montgomery had apparently promised brown a promotion which he then applied to arnold to receive arnold apparently still smarting over perceived slights at ticonderoga denied promotion which brown promptly appealed directly to congress arnold s response to this threat to his authority was to accuse brown and also easton who had been present when montgomery took montreal but had returned south of improperly plundering bags of british officers when brown insisted on a court martial to clear his name arnold again refused attempting to further smear two men through use of intermediaries brown never received a formal hearing on arnold s charges brandt 1994 pp 80 81 arnold maintained siege until spring of 1776 when reinforcements under brigadier general david wooster arrived arnold traveled to montreal to

general horatio gates then in command at ticonderoga dissolved arrest warrant citing desperate need for arnold s services against expected british attack arnold s silence in response to hazen s accusation probably confirmed and deepened opinions people already held of him those favorably disposed to him perceived it as a dignified non response to a ridiculous accusation while those who disliked him saw it as reaction of a man whose hand had been caught in till historians continue to debate whether arnold was actually engaged in anything illegal brandt 1994 p 97 in aftermath of these incidents congressman samuel chase warned arnold that your best friends are not your countrymen brandt 1994 p 98 thumb right upright general horatio gates portrait by gilbert stuart much of army at
