2 2nd machine gun battalion was an infantry support unit of all volunteer second australian imperial force that was raised for service overseas during second world war formed in mid 1940 in sydney from personnel drawn from states of queensland and new south wales battalion was allocated to australian 9th division after completing training in australia battalion operated in middle east between early 1941 and early 1943 seeing action against german and italian forces at first and second battles of el alamein and undertaking garrison duties in syria as part of allied garrison that was established there after syria lebanon campaign in early 1943 2 2nd was brought back to australia to fight several campaigns against japanese first of these came in september 1943 when battalion landed east of lae in new guinea and then took part in advance to secure town which fell within a fortnight this was followed by fighting on huon peninsula which saw battalion undertake an amphibious landing at scarlet beach and then take part in actions around finschhafen sattelberg and sio until it was withdrawn back to australia in early 1944 in mid 1945 machine gunners from 2 2nd supported landings on tarakan labuan and brunei bay as part of allied efforts to recapture borneo after war battalion was disbanded in february 1946 history formation and training 2 2nd machine gun battalion was one of four machine gun battalions that were raised as part of all volunteer second australian imperial force 2nd aif for service overseas during second world war motorised infantry units equipped with wheeled motor vehicles motor cycles and sometimes tracked carriers machine gun battalions were formed to provide a greater level of support by fire than that which was organically available within ordinary infantry battalions developed by british army concept within australian army had its genesis during gallipoli campaign in 1915 when machine guns assigned to infantry battalions initially two and then later four had been grouped together and co ordinated at brigade level to help compensate for lack of artillery support over course of war on western front concept had evolved through establishment of machine gun companies in 1916 and machine gun battalions in 1918 similar formations had also been established amongst australian light horse units serving in sinai and palestine campaign during inter war years machine gun battalions had been deemed unnecessary when army was reorganised in 1921 they were not re raised but in 1937 as army looked to expand as fears of war in europe loomed four such units were raised within part time militia by converting light horse units and motorising them when second world war broke out decision was made to raise several machine gun battalions within 2nd aif allocated at a rate of one per division 2 2nd machine gun battalion was formed on 2 may 1940 in sydney new south wales upon formation battalion was assigned to 7th division 2nd aif s second division there were also five infantry divisions as part of militia at this time and its personnel were recruited from two australian states queensland and new south wales with many having served previously in militia with various light horse regiments and infantry battalions battalion s first commanding officer was lieutenant colonel david whitehead who had previously commanded 1st light horse machine gun regiment royal new south wales lancers nucleus of its trained personnel were also drawn from this regiment as well as several queensland based militia units colours chosen for battalion s unit colour patch ucp were gold and black in a triangular shape with a border of grey this was later changed though following unit s involvement in fighting at tobruk when it adopted a t shaped ucp because of geographic dislocation of its recruits basic training was undertaken separately with queenslanders completing their induction at in greater brisbane area and new south welshmen undertaking theirs at ingleburn and then cowra in new south wales central tablelands before battalion finally concentrated at pyrmont in new south wales in late 1940 at this point unit s establishment was completed as battalion structure was finalised it was structured along same lines as other 2nd aif machine gun battalions which consisted of between 800 and 900 personnel organised into a headquarters element consisting of three platoons signals anti aircraft and administration and four machine gun companies each equipped with 12 vickers machine guns to make a total of 48 across entire battalion within machine gun companies there were three platoons normally these were numbered sequentially starting from 1 to 3 in headquarters company through to 13 to 15 in d company however 2 2nd differed from other australian machine gun battalions designating its platoons a1 a2 a3 through to d1 d2 and d3 a light aid detachment of electrical and mechanical engineers was also attached after a period of further training battalion was ready to deploy overseas and in february 1941 unit embarked for middle east departing from sydney aboard transport aquitania service in middle east thumb left machine gunners from 2 2nd at tel el eisa august 1942 alt soldiers man a machine gun in desert after arriving in middle east 2 2nd machine gun battalion conducted more training in palestine until april 1941 when it was transported to mersa matruh where battalion began a year long period serving in garrison role towards end of this period january 1942 battalion was reassigned to 9th division and moved to syria where it undertook further garrison duty as part of allied occupation force that had been established after syria lebanon campaign to defend against a possible german attack across caucasus mountains this came to an end in late june 1942 when 9th was rushed to el alamein to help establish a hasty defence line throughout july battalion s companies were detached to support individual australian brigades during first battle of el alamein as allied forces which had since beginning of year been steadily pushed back by german and italian forces fought desperately to stop german advance east towards cairo supporting infantry battalions fighting around tel el eisa in early july several of battalion s crews played significant roles in turning back attacks on australian positions and in concert with divisional artillery were reported to have inflicted heavy casualties upon german and italian soldiers later in middle of month they supported an attack by 2 32nd infantry battalion now commanded by 2 2nd s old commander whitehead around makh khad ridge to right of qattara track by end of month offensive had come to a halt and during lull that followed battalion provided defensive fire from depth positions in october it joined second allied counter attack that was launched during second battle of el alamein during these battles battalion was heavily engaged with a company supporting a composite force under whitehead and another operating in support of 24th brigade its casualties amounted to 21 killed 128 wounded and 26 captured at conclusion of el alamein fighting 2 2nd machine gun battalion was withdrawn to gaza in early december remaining there with rest of 9th division until embarking on queen mary for australia in late january 1943 as part of final withdrawal of australian ground units from middle east to pacific to fight japanese fighting in new guinea and borneo upon their return a period of leave followed after which battalion was re constituted on atherton tablelands in queensland in april 1943 battalion was subsequently retrained re equipped and reorganised to prepare it for rigours of jungle warfare and throughout this time several drafts of reinforcements were received these were mainly drawn from states of south australia and western australia which changed demographics of battalion s personnel some personnel were also drawn from europeans who had been living in new guinea finally battalion received orders to deploy to territory of papua and in august 1943 2 2nd arrived at milne bay which had been developed into a large allied base after fighting there previous year after a month of garrison duties and work parties battalion was committed to final actions of salamaua lae campaign in early september 1943 it took part in landing at lae as 9th and 7th divisions rushed to secure town during 9th s landing east of town battalion suffered 29 casualties in a single japanese air attack but overall battalion s involvement in advance resulted in only limited casualties as its personnel were mainly used to unload stores and equipment as well providing local defence thumb left a machine team from 2 2nd around scarlet beach october 1943 alt troops manning a vickers machine gun on a ridge overlooking a creek amidst a jungle setting lae fell sooner than anticipated and allies moved quickly to consolidate dispatching 9th division to secure huon peninsula in late september during initial landing at scarlet beach only one company from 2 2nd was deployed c company in support of 20th brigade initially company was responsible for defending beachhead around scarlet beach but as australians fanned out and advanced south where japanese resistance intensified machine gunners began patrolling operations further afield to north and west once finschhafen had been secured in early october australians increased size of their force ashore landing 24th brigade and along with it rest of 2 2nd machine gun battalion after this battalion formed main part of divisional reserve carrying out labouring tasks and maintaining a mobile reserve to counter attack if necessary in november as 26th brigade attacked sattelberg machine guns of b company were used in an offensive role for first time during campaign following fall of sattelberg elements of battalion supported advance to wareo before supporting subsequent advance to sio as australians followed up retreating japanese during december a company was detached in support of militia 4th brigade before 20th brigade resumed lead marching on to sio in mid january 1944 battalion remained in new guinea until late february unloading ships before embarking upon transport on 25 february as 9th division were relieved by 5th and withdrawn to australia for rest and reorganisation after a short voyage 2 2nd disembarked in brisbane in early march 1944 total casualties sustained by battalion in new guinea were 12 dead and 53 wounded a long period of relative inactivity subsequently followed as a result of inter allied service politics which saw us army assume primacy of operations in pacific and indecision about future role of australian forces in pacific campaign during this time battalion was based around ravenshoe in queensland and was virtually rebuilt having fallen to a strength of just over 250 personnel due to effects of tropical diseases and losses suffered during previous campaign battalion was transferred to tropical war establishment during this period as part of an army wide reorganisation intended to optimise units for jungle warfare as a result of this change battalion was no longer considered a motorised unit with its guns largely being carried across battlefield by soldiers moving on foot it was mostly a notional change as battalion had lost majority of its vehicles when machine gunners had embarked from middle east earlier previous year when 9th division had returned most of its equipment to british a small number of vehicles had been allocated to battalion for its previous campaign in new guinea amounting to just six jeeps and two five tonne 6 x 6 gmc tractors this had proven insufficient to maintain supplies though and so with re organisation this was increased so that each company headquarters had two jeeps with another four equipped with trailers being provided to each machine gun company for resupply this represented a total of 19 jeeps and trailers across whole battalion thumb upright members of b company of 2 2nd machine gun battalion moving along a road between brooketon and brunei during borneo campaign alt soldiers advance down a road after over a year battalion was committed to its final campaign of war transiting through morotai island as it joined fighting on borneo d company supported 26th brigade during its assault on tarakan island in may while rest of battalion supported landings on labuan island and around brunei bay during battle of north borneo it was a short but sharp campaign during this time in addition to their normal close support role machine gunners were often used as infantry conducting extensive patrolling in search of japanese stragglers which resulted in a number of clashes as well as conducting defensive tasks against infiltrators and raiding parties in north borneo a number of members of battalion were also used to assist with operation of a narrow gauge railway which had been brought back into service to maintain australian supply line in early august dropping of atomic bombs on hiroshima and brought war to an end battalion s casualties during campaign in borneo totaled five dead and six wounded while casualties on tarakan amounted to five soldiers killed or wounded disbandment in late august 2 2nd was concentrated on island of labuan where it was tasked with setting up and running a reception camp for released allied prisoners of war and internees prior to their repatriation doing so until late december when camp was finally closed meanwhile following conclusion of hostilities battalion s personnel were slowly transferred to other units or repatriated back to australia for demobilisation in january 1946 2 2nd s remaining personnel returned to australia and following month on 26 february unit was disbanded throughout course of war a total of 1 824 personnel served within unit one member

while a further 193 were wounded and 28 were captured members of battalion received following decorations two distinguished service orders one military cross one distinguished conduct medal five military medals and 20 mentions in despatches after war australian army moved away from machine gun battalion construct and consequently no similar units have been raised since with role being subsumed into support companies of individual infantry battalions concept was arguably misunderstood by australian commanders throughout war and this may have influenced decision to move away from concept when units had been established intent had been that machine gun battalions would provide highly mobile fire support however this was largely only applicable in theatres where principles of open warfare could be applied once focus of australian army combat operations shifted to pacific machine gun battalions were largely misused being employed in a static defensive capacity against short and medium range targets or for menial tasks rather than as offensive fire support weapons that could have been employed to provide long range fire support medium machine guns were also largely utilised in same manner as light machine guns such as bren other reasons identified for concept s limited use include distrust of overhead fire by some commanders a preference for organic fire support over attached sub units over estimating difficulty of transporting vickers guns in jungle and a tendency to ignore targets that could not be seen difficulties of target acquisition in dense jungle
