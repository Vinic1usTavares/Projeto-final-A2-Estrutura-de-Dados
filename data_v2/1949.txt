second collaborative work between 5pb and nitroplus after chaos head game was created with concept of 99 science reality and 1 fantasy in mind planning for steins gate was headed by chiyomaru shikura of 5pb characters were designed by ryohei also known as huke known as one of illustrators of metal gear series and creator of black rock shooter franchise whereas gadgets were designed by sh rp

adventure yu no a girl who chants love at bound of this world 1996 matsuhara who came up with concept of phone trigger system stated that he initially wanted to incorporate player s own mobile phone into system however idea was abandoned due to concerns that it might clash with japan s privacy laws when asked if phone trigger system would be used in a possible sequel to game hayashi stated that he hoped this would not be case and recalled saying who thought of this system while writing contents of text messages while shikura did not directly contribute to script itself hayashi stated that shikura helped with overall plot and provided assistance with second half of story in particular shikura helped a lot with time traveling aspects of story hayashi stated that while he did not want script to repeat same text over and over again it was ultimately unavoidable due to player having to travel back in time so he tried to emphasize overall tempo of plot s development and how plot unfolded with regards to theme of time traveling hayashi had felt that it seemed like an overdone topic and expressed concern over it when he first heard idea from shikura prior to game s announcement a teaser site was featured on 5pb s website that simply referred to game as project s g and stating that it was going to be a collaboration between 5pb and nitroplus nitroplus s website had also
