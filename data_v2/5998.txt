years ago meisler pp 290 291 claimed that early in show he had met with a man who was one of people responsible for leading project of mapping human genome which interested him enough to tie it into show s alien mythology hurwitz and knowles p 169 scientific basis for extraterrestrials was an attempt by writers to have mulder and scully s divergent beliefs come together which was furthered in later seasons of show frank spotnitz claimed that ideas used in this episode had been discussed between him and carter for a few years and had become easier to bring up after wrapping up much of

previously assisted with episode blessing way oversaw use and implementation of navajo symbols in this episode a large portion of episode was based on ancient astronaut theory which proposes that intelligent extraterrestrial beings have visited earth in antiquity or prehistory and made contact with humans frank spotnitz later remarked that he was astounded at how little negative fan mail show received despite fact that biogenesis sixth extinction amor fati story arc heavily hinted that aliens were originators of notion of god and religion he credited manner in which show handled this delicate subject saying often in past we ve done stuff where i was sure we would get angry letters but we rarely do and reason is because of way we handle things in amor fati we treated religious side

episode was later included on x files mythology volume 3 colonization a dvd collection that contains episodes involved with alien colonist s plans to take over earth tom kessenich in his book examination an unauthorized look at seasons 6 9 of x files gave episode a positive review writing biogenesis gave us a mulder gone mad duplicitous allies and enemies a rising body count and scully on brink of an amazing discovery it was pure x files and a terrific conclusion to a standout sixth season kessenich p 70 den of geek writer nina sordi ranked biogenesis along with sixth extinction and sixth extinction ii amor fati as fifth best episode of series writing it is evident that as x files progressed episodes surrounding those storylines and breaking points mulder and scully endured push them further and further towards total irreversible defeat this is especially poignant when viewing this anxiety inducing trio of episodes monica s from exclaim magazine called biogenesis along with sixth extinction and amor fati one of best episodes during show s colonization phase michigan daily reviewer melissa said biogenesis along with one son and two fathers were highlights of sixth season zack handlen awarded episode a b and called it crazy enough at end that if nothing else i really want to know what happens next he enjoyed basic premise involving idea that aliens were active in development of humanity comparing it to stanley kubrick s film 2001 a space odyssey and ridley scott s movie prometheus however handlen since he was reviewing series retrospectively was slightly disappointed that plot was dropped in subsequent season in end he noted that entry was ambitious but it doesn t exactly make sense which is pretty much where x files mythology is at now other reviews were more critical robert shearman and lars pearson in their book wanting to believe a critical guide to x files millennium lone gunmen rated episode two stars out of five two heavily criticized episode for recycling story lines writing with syndicate destroyed this episode was widely touted as beginning of a fresh new mythology for show so why does watching it give such a strong sense of deja vu shearman and pearson p 187 paula vitaris from cinefantastique gave episode a largely negative review and awarded it one and a half stars out of four vitaris summarized episode as if someone took script to anasazi one of best x files episodes ever changed plot a bit and then stripped it of virtually all human interest footnotes bibliography external links biogenesis at tv com category
