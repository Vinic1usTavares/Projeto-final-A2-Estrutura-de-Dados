hurricane ernesto was costliest tropical cyclone of 2006 atlantic hurricane season sixth tropical storm and first hurricane of season ernesto developed from a tropical wave on august 24 in eastern caribbean sea ernesto first affected northern caribbean reaching minimal hurricane status near haiti before weakening and moving across eastern cuba as a tropical storm despite initial predictions for it to track through eastern gulf of mexico as a major hurricane ernesto moved across eastern florida as a weak tropical storm after turning to northeast it re intensified and made landfall on august 31 on north carolina coast just below hurricane status late next day ernesto became extratropical after entering southern virginia remnants spread moisture across northeastern united states before dissipating over eastern canada on september 4 deaths of at least eleven people were attributed to ernesto which dumped heavy rains throughout its path especially in mid atlantic region of united states while moving across caribbean it affected several countries and initially ernesto posed a threat to gulf coast of united states around one year anniversary of hurricane katrina damage in virginia was estimated at over 118 million 2006 usd prompting declaration of a federal disaster area total damage in united states was estimated at 500 million 2006 usd meteorological history on august 18 a tropical wave moved off coast of africa it tracked westward and its convection began organizing and concentrating on august 22 next day convection increased along wave axis and dvorak classifications from tropical analysis and forecast branch of national hurricane center began at 1200 utc on august 23 as it approached lesser antilles a surface low developed and with confirmation of a closed low level circulation from hurricane hunters it is estimated system developed into tropical depression five on august 24 about north northwest of grenada located to south of a ridge across southwestern atlantic ocean depression tracked west northwestward through an area of dry air and westerly wind shear despite shear convection intensified near center as banding features improved and on august 24 depression intensified into tropical storm ernesto convection deepened and expanded though wind shear displaced low level center to west of convection by august 26 structure had become much better defined and within five days ernesto was forecast to be located about 275 mi 445 km south of gulf coast of united states as a powerful hurricane center reformed under deepest convection after wind shear decreased and at same time outflow increased in all quadrants turning northwestward a small eye formed and early on august 27 ernesto attained hurricane status about south southwest of border between haiti and dominican republic thumb right infra red animation of tropical storm ernesto making landfall in south florida on august 29 upon becoming a hurricane ernesto was believed to be undergoing rapid intensification however small inner core deteriorated as circulation interacted with mountainous terrain of southwest haiti and it quickly weakened back to tropical storm status center became broad and ill defined though it was forecast to re intensify to hurricane status before striking cuba it continued to weaken due to land interaction and early on august 28 ernesto passed just offshore of southwestern tip of haiti with winds of hindered by increased wind shear from an upper level low over bahamas storm weakened further before striking just west of guantanamo bay in cuba as a minimal tropical storm with very warm water temperatures and a favorable upper level environment one forecast remarked possibility of ernesto strengthening greatly over straits of florida and eastern gulf of mexico to hit western florida as a major hurricane ernesto remained over land as a minimal tropical storm for about 18 hours before reaching straits of florida convection gradually increased over warm waters though ernesto failed to strengthen significantly due to its disrupted inner core an eastward moving high pressure system over southeastern united states allowed a continued northwest movement and at 0300 utc on august 30 storm struck plantation key in upper florida keys with winds of two hours later ernesto made landfall on florida mainland in southwestern miami dade county thumb left tropical storm ernesto intensifying along atlantic coast on august 31 moving through a weakness in subtropical ridge storm turned to north through state operationally national hurricane center downgraded ernesto to tropical depression status while over state though post analysis indicated system maintained tropical storm status ernesto retained a well organized cloud pattern over land and after emerging over atlantic ocean near cape canaveral convection again increased and began wrapping into circulation upon reaching atlantic ocean ernesto accelerated north northeastward ahead of an approaching deep layer trough convection increased as storm strengthened over warm waters and late on august 31 ernesto attained an intensity of while located about south southwest of wilmington north carolina shortly prior to moving ashore an eye began to develop and early on september 1 storm made landfall on oak island north carolina very near threshold between tropical storm and hurricane status national hurricane center remarked possibility that ernesto could have been a hurricane at landfall due to possibility that strongest maximum wind was not sampled after landfall storm rapidly weakened and about eight hours after moving ashore ernesto deteriorated to tropical depression status interacting with a pre existing frontal zone that extended eastward through virginia ernesto quickly lost its tropical characteristics and late on september 1 it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone it re intensified to a gale over mid atlantic states only to weaken to an extratropical depression near pennsylvania with a large high pressure area to its east remnants turned to north northwest reaching southern ontario on september 3 after turning northeastward extratropical remnants of ernesto were absorbed into a larger storm over quebec on september 4 preparations caribbean about nine hours after ernesto became a tropical storm government of haiti issued a tropical storm watch from its border with dominican republic to southwestern tip of country as storm strengthened watch was replaced with a tropical storm warning and about 15 hours

bahamas cruise ship companies indicated they were diverting several liners to avoid storm hurricane warnings were put in effect for six provinces in southeastern cuba where significant precipitation ranging up to 20 inches 500 mm across mountainous south was expected as center of ernesto tracked slowly across cuba cuban officials evacuated 300 000 people and brought its fishing fleet into harbors cuban state television broadcast extensive warnings about storm urging precautions cattle were moved to higher ground tourists were evacuated from hotels in southeastern province of granma and baseball games scheduled for evening of august 27 in havana were played earlier in day threat of storm caused domestic flights to be canceled united states thumb right atlantis heads back to launch

four days prior to ernesto striking state government of florida activated its emergency operations center while national guard was placed on standby following a warning order to its commanders on august 27 governor of florida jeb bush issued a state of emergency because of high risk of impact from ernesto on state officials issued a mandatory evacuation order for all visitors and non residents in florida keys about three days before storm passed through area mandatory evacuations were later issued for mobile homes and low lying areas of monroe broward st lucie and martin counties voluntary evacuations were also issued for barrier islands in miami dade and palm beach counties on august 28 forecasters issued a hurricane watch for southern florida through florida keys when ernesto was downgraded to tropical storm status governor jeb bush urged florida residents to continue preparations and not wait until it regained hurricane status as it was forecast to do by national hurricane center at least 30 shelters were opened and tolls on four turnpike were lifted several schools were closed across southern florida threat of storm caused nasa to postpone launch of space shuttle

previous year which caused hundreds of billion in damage and left thousands of houses damaged or destroyed there were initial fears that ernesto would make landfall days after hurricane katrina s one year anniversary and that levees in new orleans might not be able to withstand a strong storm surge officials in new orleans prepared buses and trains in event that people needed to evacuate but could not a possible path over gulf of mexico oil fields as well as tension with iran caused price of oil to increase although prices receded when threat of storm receded on august 29 a hurricane watch was
