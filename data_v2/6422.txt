laguna del maule is a volcanic field in andes mountain range of chile close to and partly overlapping chile argentina frontier bulk of volcanic field is in talca province of chile s maule region it is a segment of southern volcanic zone part of andean volcanic belt many of volcanic centres in laguna del maule volcanic field formed during postglacial times after glaciers had retreated from area this activity has generated cones lava domes lava coulees and lava flows which surround laguna del maule lake field gets its name from lake which is also source of maule river some of volcanic centres were active during and before last glaciation at least three caldera formation events are associated with system about 130 volcanic vents belong to field whose activity began 1 5 million years ago and continued into holocene postglacial volcanic activity has included eruptions with simultaneous explosive and effusive components and volcanic rocks in field vary from basalt over andesite and dacite to rhyolite field was a source of obsidian with regional importance between 2004 and 2007 ground inflation began in volcanic field indicating intrusion of a sill beneath it rate of inflation is faster than those measured on other inflating volcanoes such as uturunku in bolivia and yellowstone in united states and has been accompanied by anomalies in soil gas emission and seismic activity this pattern has created concern about potential for impending large scale eruptive activity geography and structure thumb 300px right cerro azul on right is at northern edge of southern volcanic zone thumb 300px right chaiten here erupting is located in southern part of southern volcanic zone laguna del maule volcanic field is centred around straddling chilean argentine frontier with most of complex on chilean side locality belongs to maule region of talca province in andes mountain range close to confluence of maule and campanario rivers in maule s valley city of talca lies about west argentine section of field is in mendoza and neuquen provinces and city of malargue is located about east from volcanic field highway 115 passes through northern part of volcanic field and paso pehuenche mountain pass is a few kilometres northeast of lake other than this region is sparsely inhabited and economic activity in region is limited to oil prospecting pastures and tourism subduction of nazca plate beneath south america plate has formed a volcanic arc about long which is subdivided into several segments distinguished by varying angles of subduction of nazca plate part of volcanic belt named southern volcanic zone alone contains at least 60 volcanoes with historical activity and three major caldera systems major volcanoes of southern volcanic zone include from north to south cerro azul calabozos tatara san pedro laguna del maule antuco villarrica puyehue cordon caulle osorno and chaiten laguna del maule is located within a segment known as transitional southern volcanic zone west of peru chile trench volcanoes in this segment are typically located on basement blocks that have been uplifted between extensional basins laguna del maule lake lies on crest of andes within a depression with a diameter of lake has a depth of a surface area of and surface is at an altitude of name of volcanic field comes from lake maule river originates there and barrancas river has its headwaters in volcanic field as well terraces around lake indicate that water levels have fluctuated in past today it is regulated by a dam at outlet that was built in 1950 an eruption dated 19 000 700 23 300 400 years ago dammed lake higher than its present level and when dam broke 9 400 years ago a lake outburst flood occurred leaving traces in down valley gorge such as scour benches and beach bars developed on shores of this lake which has left a shoreline around laguna del maule additionally tephra fallout has impacted lake through holocene and affected life in lake waters lake is surrounded by a number of quaternary volcanic systems of various ages including about fourteen shield volcanoes and stratovolcanoes that have been degraded by glaciation laguna del maule volcanic field covers a surface area of and contains 130 volcanic vents including cones lava domes lava flows and shield volcanoes 36 silicic coulees and lava domes surround lake over of field is covered by these volcanic rocks and volcanic ash and pumice produced by eruptions has been found in argentina volcanic field lies at an average height of some summits around laguna del maule reach altitudes of among various structures in volcanic field domo del maule lava dome is of rhyolitic composition and generated a northward flowing lava flow that dammed laguna del maule this lava flow is joined by other lava flows from a small cone in southwestern sector of volcanic field lavas of this cone however are andesitic and basaltic is a large long lava flow of acidic rocks in northern sector of volcanic field close to outlet of laguna del maule it consists of two lobes with a total volume of about this flow contains obsidian and and crystals within flow reflect sunlight well preserved lava flow is in extreme southwestern sector of volcanic field this lava flow is thick long and about wide with a tuff cone at its source barrancas centre has a total volume of and reaches an elevation of this area of andes was subject to glaciation in past which has left traces especially in adjacent valleys these valleys are u shaped or have form of a trench shapes associated with glacial action and older volcanics of laguna del maule have been disproportionately eroded by glacial action slopes around laguna del maule are covered by colluvium including talus slopes laguna del maule lake is not only lake in field other lakes are laguna cari launa on chilean side in northeastern sector of field and laguna fea in south at elevation and laguna negra lake both on argentine side laguna sin salida so named because it lacks a river running out of it is in northeastern sector of volcanic field and it formed within a glacial cirque geology thumb right 300px nazca plate reaches a depth of about beneath laguna del maule subduction of eastern part of nazca plate beneath western margin of south america plate occurs at a rate of about a process which is responsible for events such as 1960 valdivia earthquake and 2010 chile earthquake this subduction process is responsible for growth of chilean andes and volcanic and geothermal manifestations therein including laguna del maule which formed behind volcanic arc probably due to increased convergence rates of nazca and south america plates for past 28 million years a phase of strong volcanic activity commenced in andes 25 million years ago it is likely that this phase persisted without interruption until today in area of laguna del maule subducting nazca plate reaches a depth of and is 37 million years old there during late miocene convergence rate was higher than today and malargue fold belt formed east of main chain in response is found at depths of beneath volcanic field local 15 3 to 7 mya old campanario formation forms much of basement in laguna del maule area this geological formation contains andesitic dacitic ignimbrites and tuffs with later dacitic dykes that were emplaced 3 6 2 0 mya an older unit of jurassic cretaceous age crops out northwest of volcanic field other units include an oligocene miocene group of lacustrine and fluvial formations named cura mallin and another intermediary formation named trapa trapa which is of volcanic origin and between 19 and 10 million years old remnants of quaternary ignimbrites and pliocene early quaternary volcanic centres are also found around field they form cola del zoro formation which is in part covered by eruption products of laguna del maule faults are also found within volcanic field such as strike slip fault in its southwestern sector and various north south cutting faults are found within campanario formation northeast of laguna del maule is high cerro campanario a mafic stratovolcano which was active 150 000 160 000 years ago nevado de longavi volcano is located west of laguna del maule local volcanoes are in a segment of crust where wadati benioff zone is deep also west of laguna del maule lies tatara san pedro and rio colorado caldera they may be part of a volcano alignment with laguna del maule more distant are calabozos caldera and a late pleistocene system with domes and flows south of cerro san francisquito which are both silicic volcanic systems activity of tatara san pedro and laguna del maule with presence of rhyolite may be influenced by subduction of mocha fracture zone which projects in direction of these volcanic centres nearby are bayo and huemul plutons which are about 6 2 million years old and may have formed through volcanism similar to that of laguna del maule composition of erupted lavas and pyroclasts laguna del maule has erupted andesite basaltic andesite basalt dacite rhyodacite and rhyolite andesites and basaltic andesites having medium contents and in loma de los espejos rocks a content of 75 6 76 7 per weight has been noted several silicic rocks are known from quaternary after deglaciation composition of laguna del maule volcanic rocks has grown more silicic with andesite eruptions being limited to edges of volcanic field since 19 000 years ago generally postglacial phase of activity has generated about of rhyolite and of rhyodacite total volume of volcanic rocks that are part of laguna del maule volcanic field is over of which about were emplaced several stratigraphic units have been distinguished at volcanic field including valley unit exposed in maule valley and lake unit found around lake valley unit s rocks are basaltic andesite plagioclase and in lesser measure clinopyroxene and olivine form its phenocrysts mostly postglacial lake unit includes glassy rhyolite which is poor in crystals phenocrysts in postglacial rocks are biotite plagioclase and quartz in lake unit rocks include biotite plagioclase and spinel variable vesicular texture has been noted on rocks erupted during different eruptions temperatures of postglacial magmas have been estimated at holocene rhyolites are glassy and contain few crystals postglacial rocks have very similar element compositions high and low are present in basaltic andesite and basalt a typical pattern for basic rocks in zones where plates converge rocks overall belong to calc alkaline series although some rich rocks have been attributed to tholeiitic series isotope ratios have been compared to ones of volcano additional compositional similarity is found to other volcanoes close to laguna del maule such as cerro azul and calabozos laguna del maule stands out for frequency of rhyolitic rocks compared to volcanoes farther south in chain there are compositional trends in region of volcanic arc between 33deg with more northerly volcanoes being more andesitic in composition while to south basalts are more frequent magma genesis all postglacial activity appears to originate from a shallow silicic magma chamber beneath caldera research published in 2017 indicates that this system is somewhat heterogeneous with distinct compositions of magmas erupted in northwesterly and southeasterly parts of volcanic field early post glacial contain mafic inclusions implying that mafic lavas exist but do not reach surface from isotope ratios it has been inferred that magma is of deep origin and rare earth element composition shows no evidence of crustal contamination and isotope ratios indicate all rocks are derived from same parent source with rhyolites forming by fractional crystallization of basic magma similar to postulated origins of rocks from central volcanic zone partial melting may also be source of rhyolites overall environment where rocks formed appears to be an oxidized hot system that formed over 100 000 200 000 years and was influenced by injection of basaltic magma rhyolitic melts may originate in a crystal rich mush beneath volcanic field and probably in at least two magma chambers a minimum long term magma supply rate of has been estimated use of obsidian it has been suggested that laguna del maule is an important source of obsidian for region on both sides of andes finds have been made from pacific to mendoza away from coast as well as at archaeological sites of neuquen province obsidian forms sharp edges and was used by ancient societies for production of projectiles as well as cutting instruments in south america obsidian was traded over large distances obsidian has been found in arroyo el pehuenche laguna negra and laguna del maule localities these sites yield with varying properties from large blocks at laguna del maule to smaller pebbles probably carried by water at arroyo el pehuenche climate and vegetation thumb right 300px snowy peaks and barren landscapes surrounding laguna del maula crater lake of volcano with same name laguna del maule lies at interface between a semi arid temperate climate and a colder montane climate average yearly temperatures from 2007 to 2013 ranged cold front related precipitation falls during autumn and winter although occasional summer storms also contribute to rainfall laguna del maule is subject to rain shadow effect of mountains farther west which is reason why numerous summits exceeding in altitude around lake presently are not glaciated most of lake water comes from snowmelt for much of year landscape around lake is covered with snow area of laguna del maule was glaciated during last ice age with a maximum occurring between 25 600 1 200 and 23 300 600 years ago during this time a wide ice cap covered volcano and surrounding valleys probably due to changes in position of westerlies after 23 000 years ago glaciers retreated above laguna del maule glaciation has left moraines and terraces in area with undulating hills lying close to outlet of lake poorly developed moraines with appearance of tiny hills lie downstream of laguna del maule and such moraines form small hills around lake rising about above lake level other climate changes in holocene such as little ice age are also recorded from sediments in laguna del maule such as a humid period in 15th 19th century landscape around laguna del maule is mostly desertic without trees vegetation around laguna del maule is principally formed by cushion plants and sub shrubs with higher altitudes displaying more scattered vegetation rocks around laguna del maule host a plant named which has not been found elsewhere eruptive history laguna del maule has been active since 1 5 mya ago at least three caldera forming events occurred during system s lifespan at 1 5 mya dacitic laguna sin puerto ignimbrite ignimbrite is exposed northwest of laguna del maule lake 990 000 950 000 rhyodacitic bobadilla caldera ignimbrite from this caldera forming event borders laguna del maule lake in north and 336 000 years ago welded cordon ignimbrite bobadilla caldera is centred beneath northern shore of laguna del maule and has dimensions of in total volcanic output at laguna del maule has been estimated to be comparable to other volcanic arc systems with eruptions occurring about every 1000 years it has been inferred that each eruption lasted between 100 and more than 3000 days aside from caldera activity pre postglacial eruptions include rhyolitic 712 000 years ago north of lake rhyodacitic 468 000 447 000 years ago in northeastern parts of field rhyodacitic 203 000 years ago northwest of lake and unit known as valley unit with basic rocks of a volume of this unit was erupted 240 000 50 000 to 200 000 70 000 years ago and in maule valley outcrops it appears as lava flows thinning to top a unit of basalt pyroclastic cones and lava flows in northwest of field has been dated 100 000 20 000 to 170 000 20 000 years ago from two samples other volcanic activity took place 154 000 years ago forming basaltic vent and lava north of lake and 152 000 years ago forming andesitic vent and lava straddling chile argentina border in eastern sector later eruptive activity formed rhyodacite 114 000 years ago northwest of laguna del maule a neighbouring rhyodacite west of laguna del maule dam basaltic 63 000 62 000 years ago near outlet of laguna del maule a rhyolite east of outlet 38 000 29 000 years ago and andesites also west of dam 27 000 26 000 years ago named 36 rhyodacitic lava domes and flows which surround lake were erupted from about 24 individual vents from 25 000 years ago forwards after onset of deglaciation until last such eruption approximately 2 000 years ago after deglaciation 23 000 19 000 years ago two pulses of volcanism occurred at laguna del maule first 22 500 19 000 years ago and second in middle late holocene a first large plinian eruption formed rhyolite of laguna del maule from a vent presumably located below northern part of lake beyond this silicic volcanic units erupted after 25 000 include young andesites on western coast of laguna del maule 24 000 years ago rhyodacitic 21 000 years ago southeast of laguna del maule and rhyolitic unit rle 19 000 years ago in northern part of field latter of which dammed maule river and thus increased size of lake these units have a volume of centre started being active around 14 500 1 500 years before present and was main site of volcanic activity between 14 500 and about 8 000 years ago after that point activity shifted and volume output increased with subsequent units having a volume of these two phases of volcanic activity occurred within 9 000 years of each other and magmas involved may have been sourced from different magma reservoirs this phase includes rhyolitic unit rcb 7 000 years ago in southeastern part of field whose tephra and pyroclastic emissions are among largest of volcanic field including an associated long pyroclastic flow that filled a pre existing valley forming pampa del rayo rhyolitic which is in part flooded by cari launa lake unit rcl 3 300 3 500 years ago in northeastern part of field as well as rhyolitic unit rcd and unit 2 000 years ago in eastern and southwestern parts of field respectively first three of these volcanic units straddle border between argentina and chile other proposed dates are 23 000 years ago for espejos rhyolite 14 500 years ago for cari launa rhyolite 6 400 and 3 900 years ago for barrancas complex and 2 200 years ago for colada divisoria in addition unit rcb might be a compound unit of various ages undated postglacial units are andesitic scoria cone and lava flow just west of laguna del maule andesitic on southeastern shore of laguna del maule rhyolitic at laguna del maule and rhyodacitic unit rcd in western part of field this rhyolitic flare up has no precedents in history of volcanic field and it is largest such structure in southern andes three mafic volcanic vents named crater and are also considered postglacial former two are andesitic while latter is a pyroclastic cone mafic volcanism appears to have decreased after glacial times at laguna del maule probably because such magmas were hindered from ascending by a more silicic magma system and post glacial volcanism has a mainly silicic composition magma chamber acts as a trap for mafic magma preventing it from rising to surface and thus explaining absence of postglacial mafic volcanism explosive eruptions and far field effects explosive activity including ash and pumice has accompanied a number of postglacial eruptions largest is associated with los espejos and has been dated 23 000 years ago deposit of this plinian eruption reaches of thickness at a distance of white ash and pumice form layered deposits east of loma de los espejos another explosive eruption is linked to barrancas centre other such explosive events have been dated at 7 000 4 000 and 3 200 years ago by radiocarbon dating in total about three plinian eruptions and three smaller explosive eruptions have been identified at laguna del maule most of them took place between 7 000 and 3 000 years ago it has been estimated that ash and pumice deposits have a volume comparable with that of lava flows a tephra layer in argentine caverna de las brujas cave dated 7 780 600 years ago has been tentatively linked to laguna del maule and another with a thickness of away from laguna del maule is dated 765 200 years ago and appears to coincide with a time with no archaeological findings in high cordillera other tephras which possibly were erupted at laguna del maule have been found in argentinian archaeological sites one 7 195 200 years ago at el manzano and another 2 580 250 to 3 060 300 years old at canada de el manzano tephra reaches a thickness of about away from laguna del maule and would have had a severe impact on holocene human communities south of mendoza most recent activity and geothermal system most recent dates for eruptions are ages of 2 500 700 1 400 600 and 800 600 for rhyolitic lava flows with last eruption forming flow no eruptions have occurred during historical time but petroglyphs in valle may depict volcanic activity at laguna del maule laguna del maule is geothermally active featuring bubbling pools fumaroles and hot springs temperatures in these systems range between but fumarolic activity in general is small banos campanario hydrothermal springs lie northwest from laguna del maule and their waters together with these from del medano springs appear to form through a mixing of magmatic and precipitation water field has been evaluated as a potential source of geothermal energy it and neighbouring tatara san pedro volcano form so called mariposa geothermal system discovered in 2009 whose temperature has been estimated on basis of gas chemistry to be one estimate puts potential productivity of laguna del maule as an energy source at present day threat laguna del maule is a volcanic system that is undergoing strong deformation between 2004 and 2007 ground in volcanic field has been uplifting this deformation attracted attention of global scientific community after it was detected by radar interferometry between january 2006 and january 2007 uplift of was measured with uplift during 2012 amounting to about between 2007 and 2011 uplift reached close to a change in deformation pattern occurred in 2013 related to an earthquake swarm in january 2013 with deformation slowing through to mid 2014 measurements in 2016 indicated that uplift rate was uplift has continued into 2018 and total deformation has reached this uplift is one of largest in all volcanoes which are not in eruption strongest uplift worldwide was recorded during 1982 84 at campi in italy with an end change of other actively deforming dormant volcanoes in world are also in chile santorini in greece during 2011 12 and yellowstone in united states at a rate of 1 7th that of laguna del maule another south american volcano uturunku in bolivia has been inflating at a pace 1 10th that of laguna del maule s there is evidence that earlier deformations occurred at laguna del maule with lake shores having risen by about during holocene possibly as a consequence of about entering magmatic system current uplift has its centre beneath western segment of ring of post glacial lava domes more specifically beneath southwestern sector of lake source of deformation has been traced to an inflation of a sill with dimensions of deep beneath volcanic field this sill has been inflating at an average pace of between 2007 and 2010 rate of volume change has changed between 2011 and 2012 with an increase in volume change rate of magma are estimated to enter magma chamber average recharge rate required to explain inflation is about this volume change is approximately 10 to 100 times as large as field s long term magma supply rate gravimetric analysis has indicated that between april 2013 and january 2014 approximately of magma intruded beneath field presence of a sill is also supported by magnetotelluric measurements indicating conductivity anomalies at depths of beneath western side of volcanic field and at depth beneath its northern part indicating presence of rhyolitic melt but they do not show a magmatic system associated with southeastern vents leaving their magma supply route uncertain existence of a gravity anomaly also indicates existence of a low density body beneath volcano a volume of of crystal rich mush with about magma embedded within mush have been estimated this reservoir may have moved away from old vents towards its present day position and is being resupplied by more crystal poor deeper magmas strong seismic activity has accompanied deformation at laguna del maule with seismic swarms recorded above depth of deforming sill south of ring of lava domes with a particular focus around a further magnitude 5 5 earthquake occurred south of volcanic field on june 2012 a major volcano tectonic earthquake swarm occurred in january 2013 possibly due to faults and underground liquids being pressurized by intrusion of magma swarms of earthquakes occur every two or three months and can last from half an hour to three hours most earthquake activity appears to be of volcano tectonic origin with fluid flow inducing a subordinate amount of earthquakes two intersecting lineaments on southwest corner of lake appear to be involved 2010 maule earthquake west of laguna del maule did not affect volcanic field with rate of uplift remaining unchanged while other measurements indicate a change in uplift rates at that point some shallow earthquakes have been interpreted as reflecting and faulting on magma chamber pressure within chamber however appears to be insufficient to trigger a rupture all way between surface and chamber and thus no eruption has occurred yet several mechanism have been proposed for inflation including movement of magma underground injection of new magma or action of volcanic gases and volatiles which are released by magma another proposal is that inflation may be situated in a hydrothermal system although there is little evidence for existence of such a system at laguna del maule unless away are part of one anomalies have also been found around laguna del maule possibly triggered by stress of inflation activating old faults these anomalies are concentrated on northern lakeshore such may indicate that inflation is of mafic composition as rhyolite only poorly dissolves gravity change measurements also show an interaction between magma source faults and hydrothermal system this uplift has been a cause of concern in light of history of explosive activity of volcanic field with 50 eruptions in last 20 000 years current uplift may be prelude of a large rhyolitic eruption in particular scarce fumarolic activity implies that a large amount of gas is trapped within magma reservoir increasing hazard of an explosive eruption it is not clear if such an eruption would fit pattern set by holocene eruptions or would be a larger event prospect of renewed volcanic activity at laguna del maule has caused concerns among authorities and inhabitants of region as a major eruption would have a serious impact on argentina and chile including formation of lava domes lava flows pyroclastic flows near lake ash fall at larger distances and lahars international road across paso pehuenche and air traffic in region could be endangered by renewed eruptions laguna del maule is considered to be one of most dangerous volcanoes of southern andean volcanic belt in march 2013 southern andean volcano observatory declared a yellow alert for volcano in light of deformation and earthquake activity and was later supplemented with an early warning later withdrawn in january 2017 chilean national geology and mining service monitors volcano and a preliminary hazard map has been published references bibliography external links laguna del maule by chile s servicio nacional de geologia in spanish article about laguna del
