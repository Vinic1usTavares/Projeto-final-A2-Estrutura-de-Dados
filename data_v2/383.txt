polls rated band as britain s most popular group outranking even beatles mick jagger entry contemporary musicians volume 53 thomson gale 2005 band s name was changed shortly after their first gig to rolling stones group s then acting manager giorgio gomelsky secured a sunday afternoon residency at crawdaddy club in richmond london in february 1963 he claimed this triggered an international renaissance for blues in may 1963 rolling stones signed andrew loog oldham as their manager his previous clients beatles directed former publicist to band because oldham was only nineteen and had not reached age of majority he was also younger than anyone in band he could not obtain an agent s licence or sign any contracts without his mother co signing by necessity he joined with booking agent eric easton to secure record financing and assistance booking venues gomelsky who had no written agreement with band was not consulted initially oldham tried applying strategy used by brian epstein beatles manager and have band members wear suits he later changed his mind and imagined a band which contrasted with beatles featuring unmatched clothing long hair and an unclean appearance he wanted to make stones a raunchy gamy unpredictable bunch of undesirables and to establish that stones were threatening uncouth and animalistic stewart left official line up but remained road manager and touring keyboardist of stewart s decision oldham later said well he just doesn t look part and six is too many for fans to remember faces in picture later oldham reduced band members ages in publicity material to make them appear as teenagers decca records which had declined to sign a deal with beatles gave rolling stones a recording contract with favourable terms band got three times a new act s typical royalty rate full artistic control of recordings and ownership of recording master tapes deal also let band use non decca recording studios regent sound studios a mono facility equipped with egg boxes on ceiling for sound treatment became their preferred location oldham who had no recording experience but made himself band s producer said regent had a sound that leaked instrument to instrument right way creating a wall of noise that worked well for band because of regent s low booking rates band could record for extended periods rather than usual three hour blocks common at other studios all tracks on first rolling stones album rolling stones were recorded there oldham contrasted rolling stones independence with beatles obligation to record in emi s studios saying it made them appear as mere mortals sweating in studio for man he promoted rolling stones as nasty counterpoint to beatles by having band pose unsmiling on cover of their first album he also encouraged press to use provocative headlines such as would you let your daughter marry a rolling stone by contrast wyman says our reputation and image as bad boys came later completely there accidentally oldham never did engineer it he simply exploited it exhaustively in a 1972 interview wyman stated we were first pop group to break away from whole cliff richard thing where bands did little dance steps wore identical uniforms and had snappy patter a cover version of chuck berry s come on was rolling stones first single released on 7 june 1963 band refused to play it at live gigs and decca bought only one ad to promote record with oldham s direction fan club members bought copies at record shops polled by charts helping come on rise to no 21 on uk singles chart having a charting single gave band entree to play outside london starting with a booking at outlook club in middlesbrough on 13 july sharing billing with hollies later in 1963 oldham and easton arranged band s first big uk concert tour as a supporting act for american stars including bo diddley little richard and everly brothers tour gave band opportunity to hone their stagecraft during tour band recorded their second single a lennon mccartney penned number entitled i wanna be your man song was written and given to stones when john lennon and paul mccartney visited them in studio as two beatles liked giving copyrights to songs away to their friends it reached no 12 on uk charts beatles 1963 album with beatles includes their version of song on 1 january 1964 stones i wanna be your man was first song ever performed on bbc s top of pops third single by stones buddy holly s not fade away reflecting bo diddley s style was released in february 1964 and reached no 3 oldham saw little future for an act that lost significant songwriting royalties by playing songs of what he described as middle aged blacks limiting appeal to teenage audiences jagger and richards decided to write songs together oldham described first batch as soppy and imitative because band s songwriting developed slowly songs on their first album rolling stones 1964 issued in us as england s newest hit makers were primarily covers with only one jagger richards original tell me you re coming back and two numbers credited to nanker phelge pen name used for songs written by entire group rolling stones first us tour in june 1964 was a disaster

hair and their performance during tour they recorded for two days at chess studios in chicago meeting many of their most important influences including muddy waters these sessions included what would

stones allegedly took several benzedrine tablets displayed a piece of hashish and invited his companions back to his flat for a smoke article claimed this was mick jagger but it turned out to be a case of mistaken identity reporter had in fact been eavesdropping on brian jones two days after article was published jagger filed a writ for libel against news of world a week later on 12 february sussex police tipped off by paper which had been tipped off by his chauffeur raided a party at keith richards home redlands no arrests were made at time but jagger richards and their friend art dealer robert fraser were subsequently charged with drug offences andrew oldham was afraid of being arrested and fled to america richards said in 2003 when we got busted at redlands it suddenly made us realize that this was a whole different ball game and that was when fun stopped up until then it had been as though london existed in a beautiful space where you could do anything you wanted on treatment of man responsible for raid he later added as i heard it he never walked same again in march 1967 while awaiting consequences of police raid jagger richards and jones took a short trip to morocco accompanied by marianne faithfull jones girlfriend anita pallenberg and other friends during this trip stormy relations between jones and pallenberg deteriorated to point that she left morocco

smoked on his property and sentenced to a year in prison both jagger and richards were imprisoned at that point but were released on bail next day pending appeal times ran famous editorial entitled who breaks a butterfly upon a wheel in which conservative editor william rees mogg surprised his readers by his unusually critical discourse on sentencing pointing out that jagger had been treated far more harshly for a minor first offence than any purely anonymous young man while awaiting appeal hearings band recorded a new single we love you as a thank you for their fans loyalty it began with sound of prison doors closing and accompanying music video included allusions to trial of oscar wilde on 31 july appeals court overturned richards conviction and reduced jagger s sentence to a conditional discharge jones trial took place in november 1967 in december after appealing original prison sentence jones received a ps1 000 fine and was put on three years probation with an order to seek professional help band released their satanic majesties request which reached no 3 in uk and no 2 in us in december 1967 it drew unfavourable reviews and was widely regarded as a poor imitation of beatles sgt pepper s lonely hearts club band satanic majesties was recorded while jagger richards and jones were awaiting their court cases band parted ways with oldham during sessions split was publicly amicable but in 2003 jagger said reason andrew left was because he thought that we weren t concentrating and that we were being childish it was not a great moment really and i would have thought it wasn t a great moment for andrew either there were a lot of distractions and you always need someone to focus you at that point that was andrew s job satanic majesties became first album

it was well received at time of release and reached no 3 in uk and no 5 in us richards said of album there is a change between material on satanic majesties and beggars banquet i d grown sick to death of whole maharishi guru shit and beads and bells who knows where these things come from but i guess music was a reaction to what we d done in our time off and also that severe dose of reality a spell in prison will certainly give you room for thought i was fucking pissed with being busted so it was right we ll go and strip this thing down there s a lot of anger in music from that period rolling

situation made normal functioning complicated with members living in different countries and legal barriers restricting where they could tour in addition drug use was starting to affect richards productivity and taylor felt some of his own creative contributions were going unrecognised at end of 1974 with a recording session already booked in munich to record another album taylor quit rolling stones taylor said in 1980 i was getting a bit fed up i wanted to broaden my scope as a guitarist and do something else i wasn t really composing songs or writing at that time i was just beginning to write and that influenced my decision there are some people who can just ride along from crest to crest they can ride along somebody else s success and there are some people for whom that s not enough it really wasn t enough for me thumb upright ronnie wood left and jagger right in chicago 1975 stones needed a new guitarist and recording sessions for next album black and blue 1976 no 2 in uk no 1

live with richards and had contributed to recording and writing of track it s only rock n roll he had declined jagger s earlier offer to join stones because of his commitment to faces saying that s what s really important to me faces lead singer rod stewart went so far as to say he would take bets that wood would not join stones wood officially joined rolling stones in 1975 for their upcoming tour of americas which was a contributing factor in disbandment of faces unlike other band members however wood was a salaried employee which remained case until early 1990s when he finally joined

keith richards signature telecaster model in fender guitar factory museum rolling stones have assimilated various musical genres into their own collective sound throughout band s career their musical contributions have been marked by a continual reference and reliance on musical styles including blues psychedelia r b country folk reggae dance and world music exemplified by jones collaboration with master musicians of jajouka as well as traditional english styles that use stringed instruments like harps brian jones experimented with use of non traditional instruments such as sitar and slide guitar in their early days group started out covering early rock n roll and blues songs and have never stopped playing live or recording cover songs jagger and richards had a shared admiration of jimmy reed muddy waters and howlin wolf little walter influenced brian jones richards recalls he was more into t bone walker and jazz blues stuff we d turn him onto chuck berry and say look it s all same shit man and you can do it charlie watts a traditional jazz drummer was also introduced to blues through his association with pair keith and brian turned me on to jimmy reed and people like that i learned that earl phillips was playing on those records like a jazz drummer playing swing with a straight four jagger recalling when he first heard likes of chuck berry bo diddley muddy waters fats domino and other major american r b artists said it seemed most real thing he had heard up to that point similarly keith richards describing first time he listened to muddy waters said it was most powerful music he had ever heard most expressive he also recalled when you think of some dopey spotty seventeen year old from dartford who wants to be muddy waters and there were a lot of us in a way very pathetic but in another way it was very heartwarming despite rolling stones predilection for blues and r b numbers on their early live set lists first original compositions by band reflected a more wide ranging interest critic richie unterberger described first jagger richards single tell me you re coming back as a pop rock ballad when jagger and richards began to write songs they were usually not derived from blues but were often surprisingly fey slow mersey type pop numbers as tears go by ballad originally written for marianne faithfull was one of first songs written by jagger and richards and one of many written by duo for other artists jagger said of song it s a relatively mature song considering rest of output at time and we didn t think of recording it because rolling stones were a butch blues group rolling stones did later record a version which became a top five hit in us of their early writing experience richards said amazing thing is that although mick and i thought these songs were really puerile and kindergarten time every one that got put out made a decent showing in charts that gave us extraordinary confidence to carry on because at beginning songwriting was something we were going to do in order to say to andrew loog oldham well at least we gave it a try jagger said we were very pop orientated we didn t sit around listening to muddy waters we listened to everything in some ways it s easy to write to order keith and i got into groove of writing those kind of tunes they were done in ten minutes i think we thought it was a bit of a laugh and it turned out to be something of an apprenticeship for us thumb left a vox teardrop guitar as used by brian jones on display at hard rock cafe in sacramento california alt a white teardrop shaped guitar as used by brian jones on display at hard rock cafe in sacramento california writing of last time rolling stones first major single proved a turning point richards called it a bridge into thinking about writing for stones it gave us a level of confidence a pathway of how to do it song was based on a traditional gospel song popularised by staple singers but rolling stones number features a distinctive guitar riff played by brian jones prior to emergence of jagger richards as stones songwriters band members occasionally were given collective credit under pseudonym nanker phelge some songs attributed to nanker phelge have been re attributed to jagger richards beginning with jones and continuing with wood rolling stones have developed what richards refers to as ancient art of weaving responsible for part of their sound interplay between two guitarists on stage unlike most bands stones follow richards lead rather than drummer s watts likewise watts is primarily a jazz player who was able to bring that genre s influences to style of band s drumming following of richards lead has led to conflicts between jagger and richards and they have been known to annoy one another but they have both agreed it makes a better record watts in particular has praised jagger s production skills in studio band have tended to use a fluid personnel for recordings and not use same players for each song guest pianists were commonplace on recordings several songs on beggars banquet are driven by nicky hopkins piano playing on exile on main st richards plays bass on three tracks while taylor plays on four richards started using open tunings for rhythm parts often in conjunction with a capo most prominently an open e or open d tuning in 1968 beginning in 1969 he often used 5 string open g tuning with lower 6th string removed as heard on 1969 single honky tonk women brown sugar sticky fingers 1971 tumbling dice capo iv happy capo iv exile on main st 1972 and start me up tattoo you 1981 feuds between jagger and richards originated in 1970s when richards was a heroin addict resulting in jagger managing band s affairs for many years when richards got himself off heroin and became more present in decision making jagger was not used to it and did not like his authority diminished this led to period richards has referred to as world war iii musical collaboration between members of band and supporting musicians was key due to fluid lineups typically experienced by band in studio as tracks tended to be recorded by whatever members of group happened to be around at time of sessions over time jagger has developed into template for rock frontmen and with help of stones has in words of telegraph changed music through his contributions to it as a pioneer of modern music industry legacy thumb upright 1 15 right overhead shot of stones concert at washington grizzly stadium in montana october 2006 stones have had highest grossing concert tour three times

creating their own and slang such as losing streak for menstrual period which they have used throughout their catalogue of songs band has been viewed as musical vanguard of a major transfusion of various cultural attitudes making them accessible to youth in both america and britain muddy waters was quoted as saying that rolling stones and other english bands piqued interest of american youth in blues musicians after they came to united states sales of waters albums and those of other blues musicians increased public interest thus helping to reconnect country with its own music rolling

forum in inglewood california they were also using more equipment including lighting rigs and better sound equipment than they had used in clubs 1969 tour is considered a great watershed tour by mick jagger because they started hanging sound and therefore hanging lights attributing birth of arena rock to stones 1969 us tour guardian ranked it 19 on their list of 50 key events in rock music history before this tour loudest sound at large capacity shows was often crowd so stones used lighting and sound systems that ensured they could be seen and heard in biggest arenas guardian commented that their combination of front of house excellence and behind scenes savvy took business of touring to an entirely new level during 1972 tour stones developed a complex light show which included giant mirrors that bounced light off them during 1975 tour of americas arena shows became an industry for band and stones hired a new lighting director jules fisher props band used on stage increased in both size and sophistication similar to those on broadway they started to use multiple stages from which they would select for a particular show on this tour they had two versions of what jagger
