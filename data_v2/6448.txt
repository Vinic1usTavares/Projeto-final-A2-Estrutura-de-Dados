very disappointing to british government because trials had partly been intended to meet expectations of italian public war office notified lieutenant general sir john harding who had succeeded alexander as commander of british forces in mediterranean in 1946 that there should be no more death sentences and those already imposed should be commuted accordingly harding commuted death sentences
