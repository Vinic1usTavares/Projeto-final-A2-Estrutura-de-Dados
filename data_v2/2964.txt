sukhoi su 33 33 nato reporting name flanker d is an all weather carrier based twin engine air superiority fighter designed by sukhoi and manufactured by komsomolsk on amur aircraft production association derived from su 27 and initially known as su 27k compared with su 27 su 33 has a strengthened undercarriage and structure folding wings and stabilators all for carrier operations su 33 has canards and its wings are larger than su 27 for increased lift su 33 has upgraded engines and a twin nose wheel and is air first used in operations in 1995 aboard aircraft carrier fighter officially entered service in august 1998 by which time designation su 33 was used following break up of soviet union and subsequent downsizing of russian navy only 24 aircraft were produced attempted sales to china and india fell through with plans to retire su 33 once they reach end of their service life russian navy ordered mig 29k as a replacement in 2009 development background and origins during 1970s yakovlev yak 38 then soviet navy s only operational carrier based fixed wing combat aircraft was found to be unable to undertake its role due to limited range and payload which severely hampered capability of soviet navy s project 1143 carriers it was decided to develop a bigger and more potent carrier capable of operating stol aircraft during assessment period a number of aircraft carriers were studied project 1160 carrier would have been able to operate mig 23s and su 24s but was abandoned due to budget constraints design efforts were then concentrated on project 1153 carrier which would have accommodated su 25s and proposed mig and su 27ks sufficient funding was not secured and navy looked at possibility of a fifth and larger project 1143 carrier modified to allow for yak 141 mig 29k and su 27k operations williams 2002 p 126 to prepare for operations of su 27k and rival mig 29k on board new carrier work proceeded on development of steam catapult arresting gear optical and radio landing systems pilots were trained at a new establishment in crimea named nitka for aviation research and training complex in 1981 soviet government ordered abandonment of catapult system as part of an overall downsize of project 1143 5 carriers which also included cancelling fifth project 1143 carrier and varyag a takeoff ramp was installed at complex where takeoffs would be executed to ensure that su 27ks and mig 29ks would be able to operate from carriers eden 2004 p 462 both sukhoi and mikoyan modified their prototypes to validate takeoff ramp three sukhoi 3 24 and 25 along with an su were used for takeoffs from simulated ramp first of these tests were undertaken by nikolai sadovnikov on 28 august 1982 flight tests indicated need for a change in ramp design and it was modified to a ski jump profile conceptual designs of su 27k commenced in 1978 on 18 april 1984 soviet government instructed sukhoi to develop an air defence fighter mikoyan was ordered to build a lighter multirole fighter williams 2002 p 127 full scale design of su 27k soon started as t 10k under guidance of konstantin nikolai sadovnikov was appointed design bureau s chief test pilot for programme by november 1984 conceptual design had passed its critical design review with detailed design finalised in 1986 two prototypes were constructed in conjunction with knaapo in 1986 1987

admiral kuznetsov aircraft carrier first su 27k prototype piloted by viktor pugachyov made its maiden flight on 17 august 1987 at nitka facility second followed on 22 december flight tests continued at nitka where su 27ks and mig 29ks demonstrated and validated feasibility of ski jump operations pilots also practised no flare landings before making an actual landing on a carrier deck it was another two years before tbilisi subsequently renamed admiral kuznetsov left shipyard williams 2002 p 129 viktor pugachyov piloting second su 27k became first russian to conventionally land aboard an aircraft carrier on 1 november 1989 gordon 1999 p 80 it was found that carrier s jet blast deflectors were too close to engine nozzles when raised at an angle of 60deg thus an improvised solution held deflectors at 45deg however when aircraft was in front of it for longer than maximum six seconds shield s water pipes exploded pilot pugachyov reduced engine throttle accidentally causing detents blocks used to restrain aircraft from accelerating to retract and fighter to move forwards aircraft was quickly stopped pugachyov later took off without use of blast deflectors or detents since then a kamov ka search and rescue helicopter was flown close to carrier in case of an accident gordon 1999 p 66 during following three week period 227 sorties were amassed along with 35 deck landings flight testing continued afterwards and on 26 september 1991 naval pilots began testing su 27k by 1994 it had successfully passed state acceptance trials during 1990 1991 seven production aircraft were rolled out further developments first of two known versions of su 33 twin seat su 33ub made its first flight in april 1999 aircraft piloted by viktor pugachyov and sergey melnikov flew for 40 minutes near ramenskoye airport su 33ub initially named as su 27kub or carrier combat trainer was planned to be a trainer but with potential to fill other roles notable improvements over su 33 included a revised forward fuselage and leading edge slats bigger wings and stabilators williams 2002 p 131 modernization in 2010 sukhoi developed an upgraded version of su 33 flight trials began in october 2010 this modernized su 33 was to compete with a potential chinese indigenous version of original su 33 shenyang j 15 and to encourage orders from russian navy fisher 2008 pp 190 191 major upgrades to aircraft included more powerful 132 kn 29 800 lbf al 31 f m1 engines and a larger weapons carriage upgrades to radar and weapons were not possible at time due to funding constraints fisher 2008 p 191 according to military author richard fisher it has been speculated that further modifications to a new production batch would include a phased array radar thrust vectoring nozzles and long range anti ship missiles in september 2016 it was announced su 33 will be outfitted with new sighting and computing system svp 24 from russian company t that will allow aircraft to use unguided bombs with a similar precision as guided ones giving it an ability of a strike fighter svp 24 takes into account data such as current plane s location together with flight parameters target data and environmental parameters and determines optimal trajectory for unguided ammunition it is believed installation of modern targeting systems will increase capability of su 33 fighters close to su 30sm level second stage of modernization is to include installation of more powerful engines and detection systems according to naval aviation chief major general igor kozhin design thumb rear starboard view of su 33 with its arrestor hook visible under shortened tail stinger alt angled rear view of fighter aircraft with engines showing prominently above engines are two vertical stabilizers wings and horizontal stabilizers are folded to adapt original su 27 for naval operations sukhoi first incorporated a reinforced structure and undercarriage to withstand great stress experienced upon landing particularly quick descents and non flare landings landings where aircraft does not float and slow its descent rate just prior to touchdown leading edge slats and other control surfaces are enlarged to provide increased lift and manoeuvrability at low speeds although wingspan remains unchanged wings feature double slotted flaps and outboard drooping ailerons in total refinements enlarge wing area by 10 12 williams 2002 p 128 wings and stabilators are modified for folding to maximise number of aircraft carrier can accommodate and to allow ease of movement on deck aircraft is outfitted with more powerful turbofan engines to increase thrust to weight ratio as well as an in flight refuelling probe su 33 sports canards that shorten take off distance and improve manoeuvrability but have required reshaping of leading edge root extensions rear radome is shortened and reshaped to prevent its striking deck during high alpha angle of attack landings eden 2004 p 463 compared with rival mig 29k su 33 s maximum takeoff weight mtow is 50 higher fuel capacity is more than double allowing it to fly 80 further at altitude or 33 at sea level mig 29k can spend as much time as su 33 on station by using external fuel tanks but this limits its ordnance capacity williams 2002 pp 126 128 su 33 can fly at speeds as low as in comparison mig 29k needs to maintain a minimum of for effective control however mig 29k carries more air to ground munitions than su 33 su 33 is more expensive and physically larger than mig 29k limiting numbers able to be deployed on an aircraft carrier su 33 carries guided missiles such as r 73 four and r six on twelve hardpoints supplemented by 150 round 30 mm gsh 30 1 it can carry an assortment of unguided rockets bombs and cluster bombs for secondary air to ground missions aircraft can be used in both night and day operations at sea radar used slot back has been speculated to have poor multi target tracking making su 33 reliant on other radar platforms and airborne warning and control system awacs aircraft like kamov ka 31 early warning helicopter r missiles have capability to intercept anti ship missiles infra red search and track irst system is placed to provide better downward visibility operational history soviet union and russia thumb a su 33 onboard admiral kuznetsov in 1996 u s navy sailors from are visiting carrier alt aqua and blue jet

mediterranean sea carrying two su nine ka 27s and 13 su 27ks williams 2002 p 130 however aircraft officially entered service 31 august 1998 with 279th naval fighter regiment of northern fleet based at severomorsk 3 by which time it was officially designated su 33 with break up of soviet union russian navy was dramatically downsized with many shipbuilding programmes stopped if varyag oryol and had been commissioned a total of 72 production airframes would have been built early airborne warning and mig 29k would also have proceed instead of being abandoned only 24 examples were built at time varyag was sold to china in 2009 russian navy announced it will buy 24 mig 29ks to replace its fleet of about 19 su 33s in service with deliveries of new aircraft to be completed by 2015 however in 2015 major general igor kozhin commander of navy s air and air defense forces announced that a second fighter regiment would be formed to augment current force with intention that mig 29ks be used by this new unit with existing su 33s refurbished for further use in september 2016 first su 33s upgraded with installation of svp 24 targeting system were delivered to ranks under a contract signed in spring 2016 in 2017 united engine corporation has resumed production of upgraded al 31f series 3 engines for su 33 fighters and first batch was delivered to customer by same year failed bids internationally people s republic of china was identified as a possible export customer russia s state weapons exporter rosoboronexport was previously negotiating an order of 50 aircraft totalling us 2 5 billion china would have initially acquired two aircraft worth 100 million for testing and then have further options to acquire an additional 12 48 aircraft fighters were intended to be used with fledgling chinese aircraft carrier programme with former soviet carrier varyag as centrepiece at sixth zhuhai airshow in late 2006 lieutenant general aleksander publicly confirmed at a news conference that china had approached russia for possible purchase of su 33s and negotiations were to start in 2007 on 1 november 2006 xinhua news agency published information on its military website that china planned to introduce su 33 china had previously obtained a manufacturing license for su 27 production sukhoi is working on a more advanced version su a development to integrate advanced technologies of su 35 fighters into older su 33 airframe however worries over other chinese intentions emerged when it was reported that china had acquired one of t a su 33 prototype from ukraine potentially to study and reverse engineer a domestic version fisher 2008 p 190 various aircraft are alleged to have originated partially from su 33 such as shenyang j 15 photos of shenyang aircraft designers posing in front of a t 10k carrier based fighter prototype strongly suggest that j 15 is directly related to t 10k negotiations stagnated as shenyang aircraft company sought to reduce russian content in aircraft while sukhoi wanted to ensure a level of income from future upgrades and modifications made to j 11 india was also viewed as another potential operator of su 33 indian navy planned to acquire su 33 for its aircraft carrier refurbished soviet which was sold to india in 2004 in end rival mig 29k was opted for because of su 33 s outdated avionics size of su 33 reportedly led to concerns over potential difficulties in operating it off indian carriers a constraint not shared by smaller mig 29k conley 2001 p 69 combat history thumb pilots of russian naval aviation returning to severomorsk 3
