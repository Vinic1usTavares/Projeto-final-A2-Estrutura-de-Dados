subtropical storm alpha also called alfa was a rare off season subtropical cyclone that hit georgia in may 1972 it developed from a previously non tropical cyclone in western atlantic ocean and initially it moved northeastward off carolinas storm turned southwestward due to a building ridge and concurrently it intensified to become subtropical storm alpha it later moved ashore near savannah and it finally dissipated in northeast gulf of mexico on may 29 it produced wave action and moderate rainfall along coast damage totaled over 100 000 1972 usd and there were two associated deaths meteorological history throughout may 1972 a series of weak troughs moved across eastern united states in third week of month an upper level cutoff low developed along one of these troughs located southeast of united states and removed from westerlies origins of alpha were from a surface low northeast of florida associated with larger scale cold core upper low it organized and late on may 23 it could be classified as a subtropical depression east of georgia south carolina border while southeast of hatteras north carolina a developing ridge blocked its northeast motion and so it slowed to turn to southeast on may 25 a small intense low level center organized rapidly and by next day it attained gale force winds by which time storm turned southwestward at 1600 utc on may 26 national hurricane center initiated advisories on subtropical cyclone alpha when storm was about 225 miles south of cape hatteras around that time it reached its peak winds of 70 mph 110 km h on its first advisory there was disagreement among forecast models regarding its eventual track with projected tracks deviating from a georgia landfall to a track northeastward out to sea alpha was also a climatological outlier at time nhc hurran model which was based on previous storms with similar characteristics found no analogs for storm subtropical storm alpha was initially well defined as it moved southwestward very small center was located along eastern edge of convection while low level cloud bands formed east of center at time temperature structure was more typical of a winter storm although it was expected to become more like a subtropical storm typical during summer months winds decreased steadily as it turned more westward on may 27 and heavy rainfall persisted mostly to north and west of center national hurricane center initially thought center might not have been at surface and agency indicated low forecasting confidence as they could not determine a circulation center difficulty arose from large sprawling nature of storm and by later on may 27 a new center formed as confirmed by radar imagery and hurricane hunters that night extremely small center made landfall just south of savannah georgia affecting a very small area with winds of 65 mph 100 km h and a minimum pressure of 991 mbar hpa 29 26 inhg around time of landfall alpha developed a warm core indicating some tropical characteristics storm weakened quickly over land although it did not dissipate until two days later over northeast gulf of mexico preparations and impact thumb right rainfall from subtropical storm in southeastern united states at time of first advisory on alpha there were small craft warnings from jacksonville florida to cape may new jersey gale warnings were posted from cape fear north carolina to chincoteague virginia interaction between alpha and high pressure system to its northeast caused cooler temperatures and gusty winds from delaware southward wave heights reached up to along virginia capes storm dropped rainfall along coast of north carolina and virginia with a maximum of reported in ocracoke north carolina while moving slowly off north carolina coast alpha caused heavy beach erosion destroyed one house and threatened foundation of several other homes in outer banks damage totaled over 50 000 1972 usd while storm was traveling over western atlantic ocean storm produced a large area of rough seas which was considered greatest threat from storm in northeastern florida police officers were stationed to ensure people did not swim in dangerous seas high waves also halted work to deepen a harbor at mayport naval station two people drowned after storm dissipated when surf was still turbulent tides along georgia coast reached above normal which caused some flooding and beach erosion wind gusts reached on saint simons island winds knocked down trees and power lines leaving some people without power in eastern georgia damage was minor but widespread in state estimated at over 50 000 1972 usd moderate rains spread in coastal areas from south carolina through southern florida 1972 hurricane season was first year in which quasi tropical cyclones were named by using nato phonetic alphabet at time names were applied to large subtropical cyclones and small both of which were later combined into one category name alpha was later used in 2005 but it was used for a tropical storm after standard list of names became exhausted see also list of florida hurricanes 1950 1974 tropical storm beryl 2012 subtropical storm andrea 2007 references
