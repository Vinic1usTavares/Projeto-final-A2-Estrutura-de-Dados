french submarine mariotte was a submarine built for french navy prior to world war i intended to accompany fleet she was designed for high speed on surface although navy was unsatisfied with her performance on surface boat had a higher underwater speed than any french submarine before or during following 35 years mariotte was plagued with engine problems during her construction and navy spent years fixing various issues before finally commissioning her five years after beginning construction during war she participated in dardanelles campaign but had to be scuttled after she became entangled in cables of a minefield on her first attempt to penetrate dardanelles design and description mariotte was winning design in a competition conducted by ministere de la marine navy ministry in 1906 for a submarine displacing that could accompany a squadron of battleships on surface and had a submerged range of winning design by constructor first class ingenieur de 1ere classe charles was optimized for good sea keeping qualities and high speed with moderate buoyancy a long thin hull and high freeboard most unusual feature of his design was prominent forecastle that was built atop forward part of pressure hull while rear was virtually awash this odd configuration gave boat her nickname of toothbrush a dents caresse p 81 submarine actually displaced slightly more than planned surfaced and submerged she measured between perpendiculars and had a beam of mariotte had a maximum draft of and had a depth of from bottom of her keel to top of conning tower this latter was faired into rear of forecastle two lead weights were located in keel and could be dropped in an emergency her hull was divided into nine compartments and she was fitted with five internal trim tanks an internal central ballast tank and three external ballast tanks she had a test depth of mariotte had two rudders one above waterline for submerged use and other below waterline for regular use she had two sets of diving planes fore and aft to control her depth below water boat was evaluated in 1914 and commission felt that she was generally successful except for her surface speed and range it noted that she had problems with a following sea as superstructure rapidly filled with water but drained slowly so that she was much heavier by bow and would tend to wallow it also felt that she was insufficiently buoyant and had mediocre stability on surface garier pp 179 80 188 89 for surface running boat was powered by two sautter harle six cylinder diesel engines each driving a propeller when submerged each propeller was driven by a breguet electric motor using electricity from two 124 cell batteries garier pp 181 82 mariotte could reach on surface and underwater this latter speed was a record that would not be exceeded by a french submarine for 35 years on surface boat had a range of at submerged she had a range of at caresse pp 81 83 she was armed with four internal torpedo tubes in bow and two drop collars in forecastle two reloads were stowed internally which gave her a total of eight torpedoes garier p 180 during world war i boat probably used modele torpedoes these had a warhead and a range of at a speed of friedman pp 345 46 construction and service thumb mariotte at anchor calais 1912 14 mariotte named after physicist edme mariotte was ordered from arsenal de cherbourg on 31 december 1906 boat was laid down on 30 march 1908 and launched on 2 february 1911 with only starboard electric motor in place port electric motor was under repair at time and was installed from 3 may to 21 june and a brief series of trials were conducted boat was refitted and further repairs were made to port side motor although continuing problems with her propulsion system often immobilized mariotte into 1912 she was able however to conduct diving torpedo and underwater speed trials in august and september 1911 boat was lightly damaged when air heater of a modele torpedo exploded in its tube on 27 december her diesel engines three years delayed by problems during factory testing were installed from 1 march to 28 july 1912 they were judged satisfactory after oil sump and compressors were changed after repeated breakdowns mariotte conducted her testing of diesels from 23 october to 11 december and she was finally commissioned armament on 5 february 1913 after a complete overhaul of her propulsion system caresse pp 81 83 84 boat was assigned to 2nd division escadrille of light squadron of submarines on 16 january and she joined them at calais on 11 february mariotte visited brest on 20 february and was inspected by rear admiral charles eugene during inspection oil fired galley stove in forecastle exploded lightly burning two sailors boat was in calais for visit of king christian x of denmark later in year caresse p 85 thumb crew lined up at mudros july 1915 when world war i began in august 1914 mariotte was transferred to mediterranean squadron at toulon where she patrolled off coast of provence in july 1915 she was transferred to mudros to attempt to penetrate dardanelles after making a reconnaissance flight over straits and having studied reports of british submarines that had successfully entered dardanelles lieutenant de vaisseau auguste farbre ordered his crew to cast off on evening of 25 july escorted by to mouth of dardanelles she rounded cape helles on surface but dived to avoid being spotted by a searchlight about an hour later and attempted to pass underneath a minefield near canakkale boat became entangled in cables and when she surfaced in an unsuccessful attempt to free herself she was immediately engaged by a turkish gun battery at close range mariotte could not submerge because her conning tower had been penetrated by shells so farbre decided to scuttle boat and surrender turks ceased fire when he signaled his surrender and so his crew was able to destroy documents and equipment before opening seacocks to sink submarine wreck lies off cape nara near a turkish naval base at a depth of caresse pp 86 89 see also list of submarines of france references bibliography external links french
