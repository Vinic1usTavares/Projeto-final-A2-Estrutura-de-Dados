asad ibn abdallah ibn asad al qasri died 738 was a prominent official of umayyad caliphate serving twice as governor of khurasan under caliph hisham ibn abd al malik descendant of a prominent arab family he was brother of khalid al qasri powerful governor of iraq for most of hisham s reign asad s first tenure as governor in 724 727 came in wake of day of thirst a severe defeat at hands of turgesh turks in transoxiana asad tried to reconcile local soghdians to muslim rule initiated tax reforms to address grievances of native converts to islam mawali and enjoyed good relations with many local nobles who began to convert to islam under his influence his military expeditions during his first tenure were targeted mainly against restive local princes avoiding a direct confrontation with turgesh after his dismissal his successors reversed his policy of reconciliation resulting in a large scale anti arab rebellion among soghdians another major defeat against turgesh in battle of defile was followed by almost complete collapse of arab position in and outbreak of a major rebellion in khurasan itself led by al harith ibn surayj appointed for a second time to govern khurasan in late 734 asad brought fresh troops into province and managed to suppress harith s uprising in 735 736 although rebel leader himself escaped capture an expedition in khuttal in 737 brought about intervention of turgesh khagan at head of an army despite initial arab setbacks and turgesh invasion of khurasan asad succeeded in inflicting a defeat upon khagan in person at battle of kharistan turning back turgesh army despite asad s death a few months later this success was instrumental in preserving muslim rule in central asia as blow to khagans prestige led to his murder soon after and collapse of turgesh power at same time asad s conciliatory policy towards native population laid foundations for its eventual acceptance of muslim rule and islamization of central asia origin asad was a member of qasr clan a subtribe of bajila his great grandfather asad ibn kurz al qasri is said by some traditions to have been chief of bajila in times of islamic prophet muhammad and is counted as one of muhammad s companions other traditions hostile to family report that asad was a jew and a runaway slave asad s grandfather yazid was an early and prominent supporter of umayyads in first fitna while asad s father abdallah sided with ibn al zubayr in second fitna but was eventually pardoned by caliph abd al malik reigned 685 705 first governorship of khurasan thumb right 300px alt geophysical map of

throne asad s brother khalid al qasri was appointed to important post of governor of iraq with responsibility over entire islamic east which he held until 738 khalid in turn named asad as governor of khurasan two brothers thus became according to historian patricia crone among most prominent men of marwanid period asad s arrival in khurasan found province in peril his predecessor muslim ibn sa id al kilabi had just attempted a campaign against ferghana and suffered a major defeat so called day of thirst at hands of turgesh turks and soghdian principalities of transoxiana that had risen up against muslim rule according to historian h a r gibb this muslim defeat marks a period in history of arab conquests it was practically last aggressive expedition of arabs into transoxania for fifteen years but of much greater importance was blow which it struck at arab prestige roles were reversed from now onwards arabs found themselves on defensive and were gradually ousted from almost every district across oxus in this situation asad followed a policy of consolidation and limited military activity focusing on enforcing muslim control in minor local potentates and avoiding a direct confrontation with muslims main enemy turgesh thus in 107 ah 725 or 726 ad asad campaigned against king of al northeast of herat whom he forced to submit and convert to islam before going on to subdue region of ghur central afghanistan next year asad campaigned in khuttal in tokharistan where he was confronted by khagan who was called upon for aid by local ruler al sabal one tradition holds that asad retreated over oxus and went on to campaign with success in ghur in next year but according to another he suffered a heavy defeat by turgesh in either case asad s military ventures were only moderately successful and most importantly failed to address growing danger of turgesh who with support of local princes threatened to expel arabs back beyond oxus at same time asad tried to conciliate local population hoping to prevent them from supporting turgesh he continued his predecessor s policy of appointing men known for their honesty as his fiscal agents his reforms aimed to stop discrimination against mawali native converts to islam by ceasing collection of jizya from them this measure was vehemently opposed by arab settlers of khurasan but according to khalid yahya blankinship it may have helped to discourage turks for a couple of years by keeping on muslims side despite asad s efforts and his good relations with local iranian land owning class dihqans taxation remained a heavy burden for subject populations and greed and cruelty of arab and iranian tax collectors alike meant that khurasan became a fertile field for shi ite and abbasid missionaries da wa among local nobility saman khuda ancestor of samanid dynasty is said to have been converted to islam by asad at this time and saman s eldest son was named asad in governor s honour thumb 300px alt obverse and reverse of a silver coin with arabic inscriptions silver dirham minted in hisham ibn abd al malik s name at mint of balkh 108 ah 726 or 727 ad in 726 asad rebuilt city of balkh which had been destroyed by qutayba ibn muslim following a revolt and transferred there arab garrison troops from nearby asad also resumed after almost a decade practice of sending envoys to chinese court this move was clearly linked to turgesh threat as turks were chinese vassals and were regarded by as agents of chinese emperor sent to deliver them from arab rule asad is also said to have built village of asadabad near nishapur which his descendants held until tahirid times asad was dismissed from his office in ramadan 109 ah december 727 or january 728 ad when in an outburst of anger he had chief representatives of four greatest arab tribes in khurasan ahl al aliyah azd tamim and bakr publicly flogged caliph hisham demanded his dismissal and after naming al hakam ibn awana al kalbi as his deputy asad returned to his brother in iraq second governorship of khurasan asad was replaced by ashras ibn abdallah al sulami 727 730 new governor at first continued asad s policy of conciliation but then reversed it leading to outbreak of a full scale rebellion in transoxiana which coupled with renewed turgesh attacks reduced arab presence there to samarkand and its environs ashras was able to recover bukhara but his successor junayd ibn abd al rahman al murri presided over disaster of battle of defile which crippled khurasani army in 731 by time of junayd s death in 734 muslim holdings in transoxiana had been reduced to bukhara and parts of tokharistan these military defeats long held grievances against umayyad government and forcible requisition of food by junayd during famine of 733 led to outbreak of a rebellion in early 734 led by al harith ibn surayj harith s uprising involved both arabs and native princes especially from hitherto loyal principalities of tokharistan and spread quickly with rebels capturing balkh new governor asim ibn abdallah al hilali managed to check harith s advance on capital marw and forced him to seek terms asim s position remained precarious however and he wrote to caliph asking for placement of khurasan once again under purview of iraq appointment of a new governor and substantial reinforcement of province with syrian troops hisham accepted recommendations and instructed khalid al qasri to send asad once again as governor to khurasan early in 735 harith renewed his rebellion this time whether due to pressure from local sympathizers in marw or as an expedient way to gain time for asad to arrive asim agreed to a truce with harith promising also to support harith s demands against caliph in early 735 asad arrived once more to take up governorship of khurasan this time accompanied by 20 000 syrian troops according to 11th century historian he imprisoned asim for embezzling money and failing to campaign against rebels and immediately took field himself he soon gained upper hand in a succession of victorious if costly battles with harith s supporters asad s success was aided by his long standing personal relations with local arab tribal leaders as well as by continuing tribal rivalries as a yamani opposed to mudari harith he could count on support of his fellow tribesmen thus most of rabi ah traditional enemies of harith s tamim tribe soon defected to him asad divided his forces sending kufan and syrian troops under abd al rahman ibn na yum towards marw rudh where harith s main army was located while he himself with basrans and remaining khurasanis marched on fortresses of amul and zamm rebel forces at amul surrendered and were pardoned and garrison of balkh followed soon after harith himself abandoned marw rudh and retreated across oxus before abd al rahman finding refuge with princes of tokharistan with their aid he laid siege to major crossing point over oxus at tirmidh in face of harith s forces asad s troops could not cross oxus but retreated to balkh tirmidh garrison however managed to defeat harith who retired eastwards to mountains of badakhshan asad followed up this success by persuading garrison of zamm to surrender on promises of amnesty and double pay asad then led an expedition to recover samarkand which had been lost in aftermath of defile he failed to take city and returned to balkh after destroying sluices of city s irrigation canals next year 736 asad s forces cleared mountains of upper tokharistan from remnants of harith s supporters many of latter including some of harith s relatives were blockaded in fortress of by asad s commander juday al kirmani with 6 000 men until they surrendered according to al tabari 400 of men were executed and other defenders including women and children were sold into slavery same year asad moved capital of khurasan to balkh this decision was influenced by several factors balkh was traditional pre islamic capital and remained so in eyes of local population it lay closer to tokharistan where asad concentrated his military activities and it was settled by reliable syrians removed from factional politics of khurasani arabs of marw at this time asad also captured and executed one of leaders of khurasani hashimiyya movement ammar ibn yazid known as by crucifixion in 737 asad again led his troops north of oxus in a retaliatory campaign against khuttal whose ruler had allied himself with both harith and turgesh while asad captured a few fortresses and pillaged land regent ibn al sa iji called for aid from turgesh khagan suluk turgesh army s arrival caught arab troops widely dispersed while ravaging countryside by surprise and precipitated a headlong flight across oxus turgesh followed after them and attacked and almost annihilated arab baggage train which asad had sent ahead timely arrival of asad s main army saved baggage train s remnants before both sides settled for winter quarters ominously for arabs khagan remained in khurasan instead of retiring north and harith now emerged from hiding and joined him harith now counselled khagan to take advantage of dispersal of arab army to its winter quarters and to resume his advance in early december khagan led turgesh army 30 000 strong with contingents from virtually every native ruler of transoxiana and upper tokharistan south they bypassed balkh and marched into juzjan hoping to raise hephthalite princes of lower tokharistan in revolt as well in this turgesh failed as king of juzjan joined asad who was approaching with what forces he could muster asad s advance caught khagan and harith off guard asad came upon them near kharistan where they were accompanied by only 4 000 men rest having scattered to plunder and forage in ensuing battle of kharistan asad routed turgesh harith and khagan barely escaped and fled north over oxus turgesh detachments south of oxus were largely destroyed piecemeal by juday al kirmani ending threat to khurasan after his victory over turgesh asad sent an expedition against badr tarkhan possibly a prince of in ghur who had taken advantage of turmoil of previous year and captured khuttal expedition was successful and khuttal returned to arab rule a short while later in february 738 asad died at balkh after a brief illness ja far ibn hanzala al bahrani succeeded him temporarily until in july nasr ibn sayyar was named to governorship legacy asad s second governorship was of crucial importance to future of central asia his victory at kharistan averted a possible collapse of muslim rule and ended turgesh threat to khurasan and transoxiana as gibb writes it was not only turning point in fortunes of arabs in central asia but gave signal for downfall of turgesh power khagan s defeat was a serious blow to his prestige encouraging his domestic rivals who assassinated him in early 738 backed secretly by chinese turgesh realm collapsed in civil war leaving muslims without a serious opponent in region at same time asad s excellent personal relationship with native nobility strengthened their ties to arab government as gibb writes he was able to attract to his side many of more influential elements in lower tokharistan and hephthalite lands to this in fact was largely due his success in struggle with turks his influence led to conversion to islam of several local rulers like saman khuda and possibly also even though as yet practically confined to ruling classes and limited to territories under direct arab control gibb credits asad with beginning a process of true reconciliation for this achievement he was greatly honoured by later generations as attested in work of 10th century bukharan historian his successor nasr ibn sayyar was able to build upon asad s work and restore arab position over much of transoxiana muslim pre eminence over western central asia was sealed with battle of talas in 751 and withdrawal of chinese influence after outbreak of an lushan rebellion
