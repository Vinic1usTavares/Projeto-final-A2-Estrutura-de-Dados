zhukov minister of defence of bonapartism at central committee plenum that removed him from all party and government posts removal of zhukov had effect of firmly subordinating armed forces to party control in a speech on 22 january 1958 khrushchev officially proposed to dissolve machine and tractor stations mts this reform had a particular salience on soviet ideology in marxist leninist doctrine cooperative ownership of property was considered a lower form of public ownership than state ownership khrushchev s proposal to expand cooperative ownership ran contrary to marxist theory as interpreted by stalin suslov who supported stalin s economic policy regarded khrushchev s proposal as unacceptable on ideological grounds in an election speech to supreme soviet in march 1958 suslov

khrushchev s statement that country had developed from socialist state of development to higher state of communist development he saw khrushchev s view as flawed and countered that his view had not been approved by party to discredit khrushchev s assertion further suslov deferred to karl marx and vladimir lenin suslov was becoming progressively more critical of khrushchev s policies his political intransigence and his campaign to eliminate what was left of old stalinist guard there were also deep seated divergences in foreign and domestic policy between suslov and khrushchev suslov

stalinisation and his economic decentralisation scheme suslov visited united kingdom in 1959 as a parliamentarian for supreme soviet visit was a success and hugh gaitskell leader of labour party travelled to soviet union later that year as a guest sino soviet relations had long been strained and as suslov told central committee in one of his reports crux of matter is that leadership of ccp has recently developed tendencies to exaggerate degree of maturity of socialist relations in china there are elements of conceit and these shortcomings are largely explained by atmosphere of cult of personality of comrade mao zedong who by all accounts himself has come to believe in his own infallibility suslov compared mao s growing personality cult with that seen under joseph stalin in years following failure of anti party group suslov became leader of opposition faction in central committee known as moscow faction to khrushchev s leadership khrushchev was able to hold on to power by conceding to various opposition demands in times of crisis such as during 1960 u 2 incident and cuban missile crisis in aftermath of u 2 crisis suslov was able to remove and replace several of khrushchev s appointees in politburo with new anti members khrushchev s position was greatly weakened after failure of cuban missile crisis and suslov s power greatly increased a campaign to oust

socialist unity party in october 1964 khrushchev was ousted suslov played a crucial role in event suslov was alongside premier alexei kosygin and first secretary leonid brezhnev one of most influential soviet politicians of 1960s following ouster of khrushchev having led opposition against khrushchev for years suslov had acquired and wielded great power within central committee when brezhnev rose to power however suslov was never interested in becoming leader of soviet union and was content to remain man behind scenes during most of his term suslov was one of four people who had both a seat in secretariat and politburo three others were brezhnev andrei kirilenko and fyodor a collective leadership was founded immediately after khrushchev s ouster consisting of brezhnev as first secretary kosygin as head of government and anastas mikoyan and later nikolai podgorny as head of state from beginning suslov was a vocal critic of one man rule such as that seen under joseph stalin and khrushchev while he condemned stalin s one man rule he equally criticised individualistic assertiveness of khrushchev s de stalinisation policy a strong supporter of democratic centralism suslov prevented brezhnev from taking over kosygin s post as head of government in 1970 kirilenko brezhnev and suslov were members of an unofficial troika within communist party leadership suslov was ranked fourth in politburo hierarchy behind brezhnev podgorny and kosygin ahead of kirilenko throughout brezhnev era suslov became increasingly hardline suslov was opposed to any sort of anti soviet policies attempted by eastern bloc leaders but voted against soviet military intervention in both people s republic of hungary in 1956 initially and in czechoslovak socialist republic in 1968 during prague spring suslov was regarded according to christian schmidt hauer as pope for orthodox communists in eastern bloc throughout his political career suslov became increasingly concerned that soviet union s leading role in communist movement would be compromised hauer in his book gorbachev path to power argues that suslov was a russian nationalist who believed russia was centre of universe it was during brezhnev era that suslov was given unofficial title chief ideologue of communist party suslov spent much time in memorializing legacies of vladimir lenin karl marx and friedrich engels however suslov followed party line and supported retreat from some of beliefs of marxism leninism examples of ideological retreat include end of single party approved natural science versions of biology chemistry and physics there still existed a tight ideological control over literature this included not only literature critical of soviet rule much of lenin s work was also routinely censored later

included such high ranking soviets as andropov minister of defence dmitriy ustinov minister of foreign affairs andrei gromyko and brezhnev s long time associate konstantin chernenko on 28 august commission considered soviet military intervention to stabilize region wojciech jaruzelski first secretary of polish united workers party was able to persuade commission that a soviet military intervention would only aggravate situation suslov agreed with jaruzelski s argument stating that if troops are introduced that will mean a catastrophe i think that we all share unanimous opinion here that there can be no discussion of any introduction of troops suslov was able to persuade jaruzelski and polish leadership to establish martial law in poland in january 1982 yuri andropov revealed to
