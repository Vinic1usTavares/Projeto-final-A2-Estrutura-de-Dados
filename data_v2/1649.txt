john ericsson class monitors were a group of five iron hulled monitors four were built for royal swedish navy and one for royal norwegian navy in mid to late 1860s they were designed under supervision of swedish born inventor john ericsson and built in sweden generally monitors were kept in reserve for majority of year and were only commissioned for several during year ships made one foreign visit to russia visits to norway did not count as foreign as that country was in a personal union with sweden in 1867 but remained in swedish or norwegian waters for rest of their careers two of monitors thordon and mjolner ran aground but were salvaged and repaired most of monitors were reconstructed between 1892 and 1905 with more modern guns but one was scrapped instead as it was not thought cost effective to rebuild such an old ship surviving ships were mobilized during world war i and sold for scrap afterwards design and description john ericsson class ironclads were designed to meet need of swedish and norwegian navies for small shallow draft armored ships capable of defending their coastal waters standoff between and much larger during battle of hampton roads in early 1862 roused much interest in sweden in this new type of warship as it seemed ideal for coastal defense duties a parliamentary committee set up earlier to investigate state of swedish navy had already concluded that existing fleet was obsolete and new construction would have to be steam powered and built of iron john ericsson designer and builder of monitor had been born in sweden although he had become an american citizen in 1848 and offered to share his design with swedes in response they sent lieutenant john christian d ailly to united states to study monitor design and construction under ericsson d ailly arrived in july 1862 and toured rolling mills gun foundries and visited several different ironclads under construction he returned to sweden in 1863 having completed drawings of a monitor type ship under ericsson s supervision harris pp 22 24 ships measured long overall with a beam of they had a draft of and displaced ships were divided into nine main compartments by eight watertight bulkheads over time a flying bridge and later a full superstructure was added to each ship between gun turret and funnel initially their crew numbered 80 officers and men but this increased to 104 as ships were modified with additional weapons harris p 26 loke last built ship in class was somewhat larger than her half sisters she was long overall with a maximum beam of ship drew and displaced fully loaded harris p p 169 propulsion john ericsson class ships had one twin cylinder vibrating lever steam engines designed by ericsson himself driving a single four bladed propeller their engines were powered by four fire tube boilers at a working pressure of engines produced a total of which gave monitors a maximum speed of in calm waters ships carried of coal enough for six day s steaming harris pp 26 27 armament lead ship john ericsson carried a pair of smoothbore dahlgren muzzleloaders donated by john ericsson in her turret each gun weighed approximately and fired solid shot and a explosive shell massive shells took 5 6 minutes to reload konstam p 88 they had a maximum muzzle velocity of bojerud p 177 these guns were designated as m 65 by swedes but they were not satisfied with their performance and replaced them with other guns in later ships thordon and tirfing were briefly armed with a pair of m 66 smoothbore gunsharris p 27 before being rearmed in 1872 73 with two m 69 rifled breech loaders derived from a french design loke being last ship delivered was equipped with these guns while building they weighed and fired projectiles at a muzzle velocity of at their maximum elevation of 7 5deg they had a range of an improved version was developed in 1870s and john ericsson was fitted with them when she was overhauled in 1881 guns were heavier but had a higher muzzle velocity of coupled with increased elevation of 11 29deg this gave them a range of other monitors gradually received their guns thordon in 1882 tirfing in 1885 and loke in 1890 bojerud pp 169 177 in 1877 each monitor received a pair of 10 barreled m 75 machine guns designed by helge palmcrantz each machine gun weighed and had a rate of fire of 500 rounds per minute its projectiles had a muzzle velocity of and a maximum range of these guns were replaced during 1880s by 4 barreled m 77 nordenfeldt gun which was an enlarged version of palmcrantz s original design gun had a rate of fire of 120 rounds per minute and each round had a muzzle velocity of its maximum range was bojerud pp 177 78 armor john ericsson class ships had a complete waterline armor belt of wrought iron that was high and thick armor consisted of five plates backed by of wood lower edge of this belt was thick as it was only three plates thick maximum thickness of armored deck was in two layers gun turret s armor consisted of twelve layers of iron totaling in thickness on first four monitors armor on turret was reinforced to a thickness of on its face and on its sides inside of turret was lined with mattresses to catch splinters base of turret was protected with a glacis high and turret s roof was 127 millimeters thick conning tower was positioned on top of turret and its sides were ten layers thick funnel was protected by six layers of armor with a total thickness of up to half its height construction shipbuilderlaid verkstad march november november december august january june july for

russia head of imperial russian navy these were only foreign visits ever made by three swedish monitors harris p 28 thumb 300px left john ericsson after her reconstruction generally monitors were kept in reserve for majority of year only being commissioned for two to four months during summer and fall john ericsson named for inventor silverstone p 399 kept up pattern between 1865 and 1873 but remained in reserve afterward until 1882 she was rearmed with 240 millimeter m 76 guns in 1881 and her original dahlgren guns became part of ericsson monument at filipstad ship was reactivated in 1882 and 1883 but only sporadically thereafter john ericsson was reconstructed between 1892 and 1895 her gun turret was fixed in place and modified to serve as a barbette for her two new bofors m 89 guns guns could depress to 5deg and elevate to 13deg and they had a firing arc of 290deg two nordenfeldt m 92 quick firing guns were also added on superstructure ship s boilers were replaced by new cylindrical ones that had a working pressure of and john ericsson reached on sea trials on 14 may 1901 during early 1900s two 25 millimeter machine guns were removed and four later six more 57 millimeter guns added to superstructure bojerud p 178 ship was assigned to karlskrona local defense force during 1913 18 and she was sold to gotland cement company in november 1919 company converted her to a barge and used her for next forty years her final fate is unknown thordon later spelled tordon was laid up in reserve in 1868 and 1869 she was rearmed with 240 millimeter m 69 guns serial numbers 5 and 6 in 1872 but was laid up again from 1874 to 1882 ship ran aground and sank on lilla rimo island off norrkoping on 23 july 1883 she was salvaged on 4 august and managed to proceed under her own power to karlskrona naval dockyard for repairs bojerud pp 177 180 subsequent court martial ordered ship s captain to pay for costs of salvage and repairs despite a misplaced buoy that caused ship to ground she was recommissioned in 1885 and 1888 89 before being placed back in reserve tordon was reconstructed in 1903 05 she received a pair of new bofors m 94 guns that were given elevation limits of 7deg and 15deg ship also received eight 57 millimeter guns and new boilers she was reactivated during world war i and assigned to goteborg local defense flotilla thordon was decommissioned in 1922 and sold following year her new owner converted her into a barge and used her in stockholm harbor bojerud pp 178 180 tirfing was commissioned less often than first two monitors she was only active in 1867 1873 1880 1885 and 1888 89 before she was mobilized for world war i tirfing received her 240 millimeter m 69 guns in 1873 ship was reconstructed at same time and in a similar manner as was tordon except that she received eight m 95 quick firing guns taken from and s tirfing joined her sister thordon as part of goteborg flotilla during world war i and shared her fate bojerud pp 177 78 180 loke made only seven cruises before she was finally placed in reserve in late 1880 funds were requested to rebuild her in 1903 and 1908 but they were refused she was decommissioned on 21 august 1908 and advertised for sale details of her fate are unknown but presumably she was sold and scrapped bojerud p 180 norwegians had built one monitor type ship of their own in 1865 and laid down several others but norwegian parliament authorized construction of mjolner in 1867 in sweden at cost of 1 102 000 norwegian krone exact relationship between norwegian s and john ericsson class is unclear harris says that class merely had five instead of four boilers and were otherwise identical see p 34 but gardiner cites slightly different dimensions and counts mjolner as part of class see p 368 as does silverstone p 350 she was armed with a pair of steel armstrong rifled muzzle loading guns in her turret as well as a gun ship ran aground in 1869 but was only lightly damaged she was visited by king charles xv of sweden on one occasion when visiting one of sweden s west coast ports in early 1870s mjolner was reconstructed in 1897 her turret was converted to a barbette and her main guns were replaced by a pair of cockerill 120 millimeter quick firing guns in addition two and two cockerill guns were mounted in her superstructure as well as two 37 millimeter hotchkiss 5 barrel revolving guns mjolner spent most of her career in oslo fjord and was scrapped in 1909 harris pp 27 28 notes footnotes references category ships built in norrkoping
