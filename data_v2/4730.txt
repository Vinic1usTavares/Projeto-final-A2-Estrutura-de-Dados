bugun liocichla liocichla is a passerine bird species from family closely related to emei shan liocichla first spotted in 1995 in arunachal pradesh india it was described as a new species in 2006 description was made without collection of a type specimen as they were too few to risk killing one it is thought to be an endangered species with a small population and a very restricted distribution range within which commercial development threatens habitat description bugun liocichla is a small babbler with olive grey plumage and a black cap face is marked with prominent orange yellow lores and wings have yellow red and white patches tail is black with crimson coloured undertail coverts and red tips feet are pink and bill is black at face fading to pale white a second duller individual was mist netted which was probably female voice is described as and distinctive a study of evolution of species within genus liocichla based on mitochondrial dna sequence similarity showed that species is most closely related to l omeiensis with hengduan mountains possibly acting as isolating barrier between two distribution and habitat all sightings of species have been at an altitude of on disturbed hillsides covered with shrubs and small trees with exception of one sighting on edge of primary forest it lives in a territory similar to that of emei shan liocichla small flocks were observed during january whereas pairs were observed in may with an estimated total of 14 individuals it is thought that pairs may hold and defend territories bugun liocichla is only currently known from just one location populations may be discovered in other areas of arunachal pradesh or neighbouring bhutan attempts have been made to identify new locations where species could occur based on identification of suitable habitats using computational models species discovery species was described in 2006 after being discovered in eaglenest wildlife sanctuary in arunachal pradesh india by an astrophysicist ramana athreya species was first spotted in sanctuary in 1995 but was not seen again for ten years athreya spotted them again in january 2005 but did not publicize it until he was able to confirm it to be a new species it was initially identified as appearing most similar to an emei shan liocichla liocichla omeiensis a species of liocichla endemic to china it was however distinctly different and full description was finally made by capturing and examining two individuals using in may 2006 due to apparent rarity of species no type specimen was collected instead feathers from mist net photographs recordings and notes were used as holotype international code of zoological nomenclature does not allow for new species to be described without collection of type specimens but this provision was circumvented in this case by collection of feathers code allows for any part of an animal to be treated as a type specimen art 72 5 1 international code of zoological nomenclature 1991 description of an african species later considered invalid lacked a specimen and only blood samples were collected and has been more controversial a detailed review of discovery of species was published in 2007 first report of species was made in a posting to india an electronic mailing list in 1996 it was only in 2006 however that species was formally described taxonomy and systematics species scientific and common names are derived from bugun tribe in whose communal forests species was discovered species is a sister of liocichla omeiensis and speciation may have been caused by isolating geographic barrier of hengduan mountains threats and conservation for a spectacular bird with distinctive calls to have been overlooked until 1995 suggests that species is not common only three breeding pairs are currently known and is listed as critically endangered while species is capable of living in degraded forests its small population is considered threatened especially in light of plans to build a highway through an area thought to be its primary habitat references external links field sketch of bird prior to study and description eaglenest biodiversity project photograph of holotype more photographs bugun liocichla category birds of northeast india category endemic fauna of india bugun liocichla category critically endangered fauna of asia bugun liocichla
