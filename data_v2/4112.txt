legislative assemblies of roman republic were political institutions in ancient roman republic according to contemporary historian polybius it was people and thus assemblies who had final say regarding election of magistrates enactment of roman laws carrying out of capital punishment declaration of war and peace and creation or dissolution of alliances under constitution of roman republic people and thus assemblies held ultimate source of sovereignty since romans used a form of direct democracy citizens and not elected representatives voted before each assembly as such citizen electors had no power other than to cast a vote each assembly was presided over by a single roman magistrate and as such it was presiding magistrate who made all decisions on matters of procedure and legality ultimately presiding magistrate s power over assembly was nearly absolute only check on that power came in form of vetoes handed down by other magistrates in roman system of direct democracy two primary types of gatherings were used to vote on legislative electoral and judicial matters first was assembly comitia which was a gathering that was deemed to represent entire roman people even if it did not contain all of roman citizens or like comitia curiata excluded a particular class of roman citizens plebs second was council concilium which was a gathering of citizens of a specific class in contrast convention was an unofficial forum for communication conventions were simply forums where romans met for specific unofficial purposes such as for example to hear a political speech voters always assembled first into conventions to hear debates and conduct other business before voting and then into assemblies or councils to actually vote assembly procedure thumb left growth of city region during kingdom there were no set dates to hold assemblies but notice had to be given beforehand if assembly was to be considered formal elections had to be announced 17 days before election took place likewise 17 days had to pass between proposal of legislation and its enactment by an assembly lintott 44 in addition to presiding magistrate several additional magistrates were often present to act as assistants taylor 63 there were also religious officials known as augurs either in attendance or on call who would be available to help interpret any signs from gods omens on several known occasions presiding magistrates used claim of unfavorable omens as an excuse to suspend a session that was not going way they wanted taylor 96 any decision made by a presiding magistrate could be vetoed by a magistrate known as a plebeian tribune in addition decisions made by presiding magistrates could also be vetoed by higher ranking magistrates on day of vote electors first assembled into their conventions for debate and campaigning taylor 2 in conventions electors were not sorted into their respective units curia centuries or tribes speeches from private citizens were only heard if issue to be voted upon was a legislative or judicial matter lintott 45 if purpose of ultimate vote was for an election no speeches from private citizens were heard and instead candidates for office used convention to campaign taylor 16 during convention bill to be voted upon was read to assembly by an officer known as a herald then if assembly was composed of tribes order of vote had to be determined a plebeian tribune could use his veto against pending legislation until point when order of vote was determined lintott 46 electors were then told to break up convention and assemble into formal assembly or council electors voted by placing a pebble or written ballot into an appropriate jar lintott 46 47 baskets that held votes were watched by specific officers who then counted ballots and reported results to presiding magistrate majority of votes in any curia tribe or century decided how that curia tribe or century voted each curia tribe or century received one vote regardless of how many electors each tribe or century held once a majority of curiae tribes or centuries voted in same way on a given measure voting ended and matter was decided taylor 40 if a law was passed in violation of proper procedures such as failing to wait 17 days before voting on a law senate could declare law nonbinding lintott 62 assembly of curiae curiate assembly comitia curiata was principal assembly during first two decades of roman republic curiate assembly was organized as an assembly and not as a council even though only patricians were members during these first decades people of rome were organized into thirty units called curiae byrd 3 4 curiae were ethnic in nature and thus were organized on basis of early roman family or more specifically on basis of thirty original patrician aristocratic clans abbott 250 curiae assembled into curiate assembly for legislative electoral and judicial purposes curiate assembly passed laws elected consuls only elected magistrates at time abbott 253 and tried judicial cases consuls always presided over assembly holland 5 shortly after founding of republic most of powers of curiate assembly were transferred to centuriate assembly and tribal assembly while it then fell into disuse it did retain some theoretical powers most importantly power to ratify elections of top ranking roman magistrates consuls and praetors by passing statute that gave them their legal command authority lex curiata de imperio in practice however they actually received this authority from centuriate assembly which formally elected them and as such this functioned as nothing more than a reminder of rome s regal heritage other acts that curiate assembly voted on were mostly symbolic and usually in affirmative at one point possibly as early as 218 bc curiate assembly s thirty curia were abolished and replaced with thirty lictors one from each of original patrician clans since curia had always been organized on basis of roman family curiate assembly actually retained jurisdiction over clan matters even after fall of roman republic in 27 bc under presidency of pontifex maximus it witnessed wills and ratified adoptions inaugurated certain priests and transferred citizens from patrician class to plebeian class or vice versa in 44 bc for example it ratified will of julius caesar and with it caesar s adoption of his nephew gaius octavian future roman emperor augustus as his son and heir however this might not have been comitia curiata but instead comitia assembly of centuries thumb left roman dictator sulla who attempted to increase power of centuriate assembly at expense of tribal assembly centuriate assembly comitia centuriata or army assembly of roman republic was originally democratic assembly of roman soldiers centuriate assembly organized roman citizens into classes which were defined by a means test and were economic in nature mccullough 943 roman army was divided into units called centuries and these gathered into centuriate assembly for legislative electoral and judicial purposes however since number of centuries in each class was fixed centuries could contain far more than 100 men only this assembly could declare war or elect highest ranking roman magistrates consuls praetors and censors abbott 257 centuriate assembly could also pass a statute that granted constitutional command authority to consuls and praetors and censorial powers to censors in addition centuriate assembly served as highest court of appeal in certain judicial cases and ratified results of census while voters in this assembly wore white undecorated togas and were unarmed while taking part in assembly they were classified as soldiers and as such they could not meet inside of physical boundary of city of rome president of centuriate assembly was usually a consul although sometimes a praetor only consuls highest ranking of all roman magistrates could preside over centuriate assembly during elections because higher ranking consuls were always elected together with lower ranking praetors once every five years after new consuls for year took office they presided over centuriate assembly as it elected two censors centuriate assembly was supposedly founded by legendary roman king servius tullius less than a century before founding of roman republic in 509 bc as such original design of centuriate assembly was known as servian organization under this organization assembly was supposedly designed to mirror roman army during time of roman kingdom soldiers in roman army were classified on basis of amount of property that they owned and as such soldiers with more property had more influence than soldiers with less property 193 centuries in assembly under servian organization were each divided into one of three different grades officer class enlisted class and a class of unarmed adjuncts taylor 85 officer class was grouped into eighteen centuries enlisted class was grouped into five separate property classes for a total of 170 centuries taylor 87 unarmed soldiers were divided into final five centuries abbott 21 of five enlisted classes wealthiest controlled 80 of votes e s staveley greek and roman

majority of 97 votes was victorious when a measure or candidate received 97 votes a majority of centuries voting ended and as such many lower ranking centuries rarely if ever had a chance to actually vote combined 18 equites and 80 centuries of first property class had one more century than needed and a unanimous vote from elite would thus elect a candidate rachel feig vishnia roman elections in

called proletarii of unarmed adjunct class this century was only century composed of soldiers who had no property and since it was always last century to vote it never had any real influence on elections in 107 bc in response to high unemployment and a severe manpower shortage in army general and consul gaius marius reformed organization of army and allowed individuals with no property to enlist as a consequence of these reforms this fifth unarmed century came to encompass almost entire roman army this mass disenfranchisement of most of soldiers in army played an important role in chaos that led to fall of roman republic in 27 bc during his dictatorship from 82 bc until 80 bc lucius cornelius sulla restored old servian organization to this assembly sulla died in 78 bc and in 70 bc consuls pompey magnus and marcus licinius crassus repealed sulla s constitutional reforms including his restoration of servian organization to this assembly thus they restored newer organization that had originated in 241 bc organization of centuriate assembly was not changed again until its powers were all transferred to roman senate by first roman emperor augustus after fall of roman republic in 27 bc abbott 107 assembly of tribes tribal assembly comitia populi tributa of roman republic was democratic assembly of roman citizens tribal assembly was organized as an assembly and not as a council during years of roman republic citizens were organized on basis of thirty five tribes which included patricians and plebeians tribes gathered into tribal assembly for legislative electoral and judicial purposes president of tribal assembly was usually either a consul highest ranking roman magistrate or a praetor second highest ranking roman magistrate tribal assembly elected three different magistrates quaestors curule aediles and military tribunes taylor 7 tribal assembly also had power to try judicial cases abbott 261 thirty five tribes were not ethnic or kinship groups but rather a generic division into which roman citizens were distributed when tribes were created divisions were geographical similar to modern parliamentary constituencies however since one joined same tribe that one s father belonged to geographical distinctions were eventually lost lintott 51 order that 35 tribes voted in was selected randomly by lot order was not chosen at once and after each tribe had voted a lot was used to determine which tribe should vote next taylor 77 first tribe selected was usually most important tribe because it often decided matter it was believed that order of lot was chosen by gods and thus that position held by early voting tribes was position of gods taylor 76 once a majority of tribes had voted same way voting ended plebeian council plebeian council concilium plebis was principal popular gathering of roman republic as name suggests plebeian council was organized as a council and not as an assembly it functioned as a gathering through which plebeians commoners could pass laws elect magistrates and try judicial cases this council had no political power until offices of plebeian tribune and plebeian aedile were created in 494 bc due to plebeian secession that year according to legend roman king servius tullius enacted a series of constitutional reforms in 6th century bc one of these reforms resulted in creation of a new organizational unit with which to divide citizens this unit tribe was based on geography rather than family and was created to assist in future reorganizations of army in 471 bc abbott 196 a law was passed which allowed plebeians to begin organizing by tribe before this point they had organized on basis of curia only difference between plebeian council after 471 bc and ordinary tribal assembly which also organized on basis of tribes was that tribes of plebeian council only included plebeians whereas tribes of tribal assembly included both plebeians and patricians plebeian council elected two plebeian magistrates plebeian tribunes and plebeian aediles usually plebeian tribune presided over assembly although plebeian aedile sometimes did as well originally statutes passed by plebeian council plebiscites only applied to plebeians byrd 31 however in 449 bc a statute of an assembly was passed which gave plebiscites full force of law over all romans plebeians and patricians abbott 51 it was not until 287 bc however that last mechanism which allowed roman senate to veto acts of plebeian council was revoked after this point almost all domestic legislation came out of plebeian council see also notes references further reading cambridge ancient history volumes 9 13 cameron a later roman empire fontana press 1993 crawford m roman republic fontana press 1978 gruen e s last
