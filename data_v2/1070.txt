soccer casuals rise of aberdeen casuals coincided with most successful period in club s history and has been chronicled in more than one published account whilst numbers have steadily declined with introduction of football banning orders preventing hooligans from travelling to games aberdeen casuals still appear at big fixtures often away from home and in uefa europa league there were clashes at

their geographically closest neighbours cove rangers peterhead brechin city montrose arbroath elgin city and forfar athletic so rivalries have tended to come from further afield cove rangers from same

dundee united pair were known as new firm however dundee united have their city neighbours dundee as close rivals and antagonism was not always reciprocated to same degree same situation applies to aberdeen s rivalry with rangers in that rangers have their own much older and well known old firm rivalry with celtic aberdeen s rivalry with rangers arose after a number of incidents in matches between two clubs in 1980s namely willie johnston s stamp on john mcmaster s neck in scottish league cup and neil simpson s tackle on ian durrant in 1988 as well as aberdeen s dominance in scottish football throughout decade there are still often violent clashes between both sets of supporters within and outwith stadium to this day aberdeen developed a minor rivalry with inverness caledonian thistle since inverness were first promoted to spl in 2004 it is known as north derby due to fact both aberdeen and inverness are two largest settlements in north of scotland aberdeen s re emerged as one of top teams in scotland during 2010s which increased rivalry with celtic both competitively and between supporters there have been minor incidents at games mainly relating to political disturbances by celtic supporters at games between clubs including disruption of minute s silences and display of banners showing support for 1981 irish hunger strike nicknames aberdeen are known as dons a name that has been in use since at least 1913 origin of this nickname is unclear one theory is that it derives from word don meaning teacher given aberdeen s history as a university town it may also be a reference to nearby river don or a contraction of before popular adoption of dons team were variously known as wasps or black and golds both names a reference to yellow and black striped shirts of time as with many teams that play in red aberdeen may also be called reds and are referred to by some supporters as dandy dons or dandies rival clubs occasionally refer to aberdeen sheep and their supporters sheep term was eventually accepted by club s supporters and fans began chanting sheep are on fire at games song was originally sung by away fans poking fun at an aberdeen fan set on fire on a train while wearing a homemade sheep costume this in turn led to specialised merchandise being sold by club and local businesses honours domestic scottish league winners 4 1954 55 1979 80
