usair flight 405 was a regularly scheduled domestic passenger flight between laguardia airport in queens new york city new york and cleveland ohio on march 22 1992 a usair fokker f28 registration flying route crashed in poor weather in a partially inverted position in flushing bay shortly after liftoff from laguardia undercarriage lifted off from runway however airplane failed to gain lift flying only several meters above ground aircraft then veered off runway and hit multiple obstructions before coming to rest in flushing bay just beyond end of runway of 51 people on board 27 were killed including captain and a member of cabin crew a similar accident had happened three years before in 1989 when air ontario flight 1363 crashed shortly after takeoff at dryden regional airport after ice had accumulated on wings and airframe out of 69 passengers and crew 24 were killed subsequent investigation revealed that due to pilot error inadequate de icing procedures at laguardia and several lengthy delays a large amount of ice had accumulated on wings and airframe this ice disrupted airflow over jet increasing drag and reducing lift which prevented jet from lifting off runway national transportation safety board ntsb concluded that flight crew were unaware of amount of ice that had built up after jet was delayed by heavy ground traffic taxiing to runway report also listed fact that aircraft had begun its takeoff rotation too early at a lower speed than was standard as a contributing factor to accident investigators also found that deicing procedures at laguardia were substandard while jet encountered a delay of up to 35 minutes they found that deicing fluid that was being used at airport and by majority of commercial airlines across united states was effective for only fifteen minutes accident led to a number of studies into effect that ice has on aircraft and several recommendations into prevention techniques flight history thumb a usair fokker f28 similar to aircraft involved in accident jet involved in accident was a fokker f28 series 4000 airplane manufactured in netherlands a two engine medium range jet fokker f28 is designed for transporting up to 95 passengers particular jet involved in accident was registered in united states as n485us it was first delivered to piedmont airlines in august 1986 and was acquired by usair us airways now named american airlines three years later in august 1989 when piedmont and usair merged n485us had amassed a total of 12 462 flying hours at time of accident captain wallace j majure ii 44 who was fully qualified to pilot f28 and four other commercial aircraft had accumulated approximately 9 820 total flying hours of which 2 200 hours were in f28 majure was initially hired as an f28 first officer by piedmont airlines in 1985 he was later reassigned to serve as a first officer and then a captain on a boeing 737 but finally returned to an f28 captain because of company cutbacks new york times reported that majure was a man who yearned to please his passengers and if he made them happy then he also made his airline happy he had often spoken to friends about how important it was for him to get travelers to their destinations on time and how proud he was of usair s on time record all same he was also portrayed as a by book cautious pilot first officer john rachuba 30 was hired by piedmont in 1989 at time of accident company records indicate that he had accumulated approximately 4 507 flying hours of which 29 hours were in f28 rachuba held a flight engineer certificate with ratings for turbojet powered aircraft and an expired instructor certificate issued on august 16 1987 he also held a federal aviation administration faa license for non federal control towers previously he had served as a flight engineer on boeing 737s and boeing 727s two flight attendants were debra andrews taylor and janice king janice king who was seated in aft died in crash accident poor weather deicing taxiing delays thumb 320px right an ntsb diagram of flight 405 s attempted takeoff showing it veer off left of runway and hit a water pump aircraft took off from jacksonville international airport florida several hours before accident although departure from jacksonville was delayed by poor weather over new york and removal of baggage of a passenger who decided not to board jet instrument approach landing was uneventful and jet was not significantly delayed while in air waiting to land however congestion on taxiways at laguardia delayed arrival of aircraft at gate one hour and six minutes behind schedule jet arrived at gate b1 where pilot advised a ground mechanic that his airplane was good to go flight crew then disembarked jet to use facilities in terminal poor weather did not improve as jet was deiced with type i fluid a heated 50 50 water glycol mixture following completion of this process one of two deicing trucks delayed pushback of jet when it experienced mechanical problems vehicle was immobilised for 20 minutes in such a position that it prevented aircraft from taxiing to runway following flight crew s return after deicing truck was repaired pilot requested a second deicing though flight crew did not perform a walkaround of their airplane and usair procedures did not require them to do so following second deicing laguardia ground control granted flight 405 permission to taxi to runway 13 flight crew completed pre flight checklist during taxi engine anti ice was turned on for two engines during taxi captain announced to passengers that flaps would remain up during taxi and they should not be worried seeing them in retracted position he placed an empty coffee cup on flap handle as a reminder of position of flaps a procedure used by many flight crews captain told first officer they would use standard usair contaminated runway procedures that included use of 18 degrees flaps and also decided that they would take off with a reduced v1 speed of 110 knots weather reports for laguardia showed that on night of accident all taxiways were coated with a thin covering of snow runway 13 was also covered with a thin layer of wet snow although it had been plowed treated with urea and it had been sanded first officer described snowfall as not heavy no large flakes he told authorities that snow was sliding off jet and nose of airplane was coated in a watery layer he used a light positioned on wing of his jet to check for signs of ice several times before they attempted to take off neither he or pilot saw any evidence of contamination on wing or on black strip and therefore decided against a third deicing he told investigators that he checked wings maybe 10 times but at least 3 he said that he did not consider snowfall heavy and he did not recall any wind blowing snow first officer stated that as they taxied they looked back at wings several times near time of takeoff he said looks good to me black strip is clear while taxiing flight discussed deicing procedures first officer suggested to pilot that aircraft ahead of them in queue might keep our wings clear for us pilot replied that it can cause us to re freeze too i don t want to be very close to him later first officer remarked look at all that stuff what is that to which pilot replied sand i guess urea sand pilot of a jet taxiing behind flight 405 northwest airlines flight 517 a boeing 757 stated that he had a good view of top of flight 405 s wing and that there was just enough snow on fuselage to fuzzy usair printing but that wings appeared to be clear he believed that snow had all but stopped and was more concerned about amount of vehicular traffic such as sweepers and ploughs than he was about snowfall second officer of trump shuttle flight 1541 which had landed around time flight 405 was taxiing said their boeing 727 had picked up a lot of snow quickly during my post landing walkaround but by finish it seemed to be more rain he described flight 405 as a fairly clean airplane he said that he could not comment on clear ice but that wings and fuselage were clear of snow jet already several hours behind schedule then suffered further delays taxiing to runway weather had created heavy ground traffic at laguardia and it was reported that there were queues of aircraft waiting for permission for takeoff investigators estimated that plane took between 25 and 45 minutes to taxi from gate to runway thumb 245px left flushing bay new york where aircraft came to rest in a partially inverted position crash following permission for takeoff from controllers flight crew initiated takeoff procedure and first officer made a callout of 80 knots and several seconds later a v1 callout followed shortly after by a vr callout approximately 2 2 seconds after vr callout nose gear left ground final report read that first officer described takeoff as normal through rotation he stated that no problem was evident with vibration rate of acceleration ambient noise or directional control however new york times reported that several passengers sensed that airplane was not going fast enough first officer said it was just like we lost lift as captain attempted to level wings crew used right rudder to manoeuvre aircraft back toward ground and avoid water below accident report found that first officer said that they seemed to agree that airplane was not going to fly and that their control inputs were in unison rachuba and majure continued to try to hold nose up to impact in a flat attitude although rachuba later stated that there were no heavy control inputs final report further noted that first officer stated that he did not touch power levers first officer later told investigators that flight crew s primary focus was to find a safe place to land just under five seconds after undercarriage left ground plane s left wing scraped against asphalt for 110 feet and stick shaker activated crew received six stall warnings before jet began banking to left then to right and then to left again still only several meters above ground aircraft struck two visual approach slope indicator posts touched down again for approximately 100 feet before lifting off again and striking an ils beacon and a water pump house left wing then separated from body of airplane before fuselage struck edge of flushing bay and came to rest in a partially inverted position parts of fuselage and cockpit were submerged in water confusion disorientation or entrapment most likely caused drowning of passengers who otherwise sustained only minor injuries and injuries that were not life threatening final report read prior to impact passengers did not assume brace position when airplane came to rest many of passengers in forward portion of cabin were upside down others who were upright were submerged in water over their heads some passengers tried to move from their seats while their seatbelts were still buckled and other passengers had difficulty locating and releasing their seatbelt buckles because of disorientation following accident passengers reported fires in forward left and aft portions of airplane including many small fires on water passengers stated that they escaped through large holes in cabin lead flight attendant and first officer escaped through a hole in cabin floor near flight attendant s position several passengers reported assisting others out of cabin and into knee deep water many of them walked in water to dike climbed up wall and over an embankment and slid down a steep hill to runway others were assisted out of water by ground personnel rescue attempts medical operation thumb 285px right crash site of usair flight 405 is highlighted by white oval tower cab coordinator on duty at time of accident stated that he saw a fireball emanating from crash site following accident upon seeing flames he sounded an alarm alerting port authority of new york and new jersey police who responded an investigation revealed that there were technical issues with an emergency telephone at laguardia however it was found that these issues did not hinder emergency response port authority of new york and new jersey police department initially sent four vehicles personnel in these vehicles reported that snow and fog hampered their visibility while heading to crash site and they could not see destroyed aircraft however one member of fire crew observed people standing on top of a dike near crash site police divers also entered water following crash although they found no one alive inside jet or in water fire fighters continued spraying fire and incident commander estimated that they had fire under control ten minutes after their arrival at scene new york times reported that accident sent thick black smoke billowing above airport as more than 200 emergency workers had to contend not only with blustery snow but powerful icy current in flushing bay tense drama of rescue continued into early hours with fire fighters and police officers in water up to their shoulders and helicopters shining spotlights on wreckage and an ice covered mound of earth at end of runway so slick rescue workers needed metal ladders to walk across it ntsb report on accident noted but did not criticise medical operation at scene it described how paramedics attended to those who were conscious with life threatening injuries but did not make any attempts to resuscitate victims who appeared drowned or lacked vital signs because they believed that they could not be revived because they had succumbed to cold salt water it was estimated by authorities who attended scene of crash that 15 ambulances responded to accident site all of which were used to transport injured to hospitals and that 40 additional ambulances were available near site of crash but were not needed report described emergency response as effective and contributed to survivability of airplane s occupants however response by emergency medical services personnel was inadequately coordinated and ambulance response times to hospitals were excessive final report read a basic principle of triage is to treat victims having most life threatening injuries first with available medical resources and to utilize limited medical personnel in a manner that will provide maximum effectiveness however safety board is also aware that in recent years a number of victims of cold water drowning have been successfully resuscitated they survived after periods of underwater including sea water as long as one hour or more in view of these facts safety board believes that all emergency response organizations should review their emergency plans to include contingencies for applying cardiopulmonary resuscitation cpr techniques as soon as a sufficient number of trained personnel arrive to perform cpr even during mass casualty triage incidents regardless of whether vital signs are present especially if cold water immersion near drowning is involved and where traumatic injuries do not indicate death investigation ntsb sent a team to crash site to investigate accident they concluded that unknown to crew ice had collected on wings which disrupted airflow and reduced lift inquiry lasted just under one year buildup of ice investigators suggested multiple reasons why jet was unable to gain lift but accident report states there was no evidence to suggest corrosion on wings airplane s flight control systems were also examined and revealed no failure prior to impact report reads that evidence did not support improper wing configuration airframe or system defects or deployment of speed brakes as reasons for loss of aerodynamic efficiency investigators also stated that takeoff roll of jet was not abnormal board came to conclusion that ice had built up on wings and this had contributed largely to accident when attempting to find out why ice was present on wings of jet board determined that airplane had been properly cleared of ice and snow during two deicing procedures at gate however approximately 35 minutes elapsed between second time that aircraft was deiced and initiation of takeoff during which airplane was exposed to continuing precipitation in below freezing temperatures ntsb were unable to determine how much ice had built up on wings following second deicing but considered it to be highly likely that some contamination occurred in 35 minutes following second deicing and that this accumulation led to this accident safety board views evidence as conclusive that primary factor in this accident was reduced performance of wing due to ice contamination therefore safety board evaluated extent to which decisions of and procedures used by flight crew could have contributed to accident read final report although when cockpit was examined engine anti ice switch was found in off position further investigations found that even slight pressure could move switch and ntsb ruled this out as a contributing factor in crash following accident usair sent out a maintenance directive ordering engine anti ice switches to be changed on f28s so they would lock into a selected position investigators found that a flaw in design of f28 s wings made them extremely vulnerable to ice buildup because of angle of wings even a very small amount of ice could have devastating effects when ntsb in collaboration with fokker investigated effect ice can have on an aircraft they found that ice particles as small as 1 2mm of a density of one particle per square centimeter can cause a loss of lift of over 20 a document written by fokker before accident detailed effect of ice on wing of an f28 warned that an uncontrollable roll would begin even with a small amount of ice on wings errors by flight crew report found that flight crew were aware that poor weather was likely to cause ice buildup however neither of them took any action to check condition of wing leading edge and upper surface aircraft was evaluated by ground crew and was deiced after mechanical failure of deicing truck investigators reported that as captain requested another deice there was an indication he was concerned about continuing exposure to precipitation and request was prudent and in accordance with usair guidance following second deicing flight crew was most likely satisfied that airplane was free of adhering contamination flight crew was not aware of exact delay that they would encounter before takeoff and their decision to leave gate was reasonable after taxiing when it became evident that they would be delayed for a prolonged period conversations between crew showed that they were aware of and probably concerned about risk of frozen contamination on wing they also found that usair guidance and flight crew training was sufficient and should have alerted flight crew to risk of attempting a takeoff while they were unaware of condition of wing usair guidance to flight crews specifically stated that it is captain s responsibility to exercise caution prior to takeoff if elapsed time since deicing exceeds 20 minutes careful examination of surfaces should be conducted to detect extent of accumulation of ice and to assure that takeoff can be made safely and in compliance with existing regulations final report read safety board believes that flight crew of flight 405 should have taken more positive steps to assure a contamination free wing such as entering cabin to look at wing from a closer range although safety board acknowledges that detection of minimal amounts of contamination sufficient to cause aerodynamic performance problems is difficult and may not be possible without a tactile inspection an observation from cabin would have improved chance of seeing some contamination and might have prompted flight crew to return to gate safety board believes that flight crew s failure to take such precautions and decision to attempt takeoff while unsure of wing cleanliness led to this accident and is a cause of it in a television interview one of ntsb investigators suggested that captain was faced with quite a problem if he wanted to be deiced a third time he would have had to get out of line of jets waiting to take off and taxi all way back to parking area and meet up with a deicing truck again that would have put him very very late and it may have even caused cancellation of flight ntsb carried out tests to discover why first officer was unable to see ice buildup on wing of jet when sliding window of cockpit was fully open first officer would have been able to see outer eighty percent of wing including black strip used to contrast white surface of wing so flight crew can search for a build up of ice when sliding window was shut as it was in accident it would be difficult to make out any details of wing and black strip would have been distorted by glass they also found that ice light made little difference to how much first officer would have been able to see investigators also requested that fokker conduct a study of effects of ice contamination and pilot technique on f28 aircraft ntsb evaluated data from tests and found that pilot initiated rotation five knots earlier at 119 knots instead of proper rotation speed of 124 knots data from fokker was correlated with cockpit voice recording and confirmed that first officer called a rotation speed of 113 knots but captain did not rotate until 119 knots it was never established why rotation was called and initiated earlier than was standard deicing procedures at laguardia investigators also focused on deicing practices at laguardia they found that airport was using only type i deicing fluid not type ii type i fluids are used for actual deicing of jet while type ii fluids are used for preventing buildup of ice at time of accident laguardia had prohibited use of type ii deicing fluid because tests suggested that if it fell onto runways it reduced friction investigators noted change had been made because of laguardia s shorter runways and fact that if an aircraft left vicinity of runway it would come to rest in cold water surrounding runway 13 accident report however criticised fact that majority of airplane operators in united states relied only upon type i fluids for protection and they do not use type ii board stated that tests have shown that both type i and type ii fluids do flow off wings of a treated airplane in significant amounts during initial takeoff ground run ntsb stated there are a number of views on potential uses of type i and ii fluids use of type i fluid raises concern because its holdover time is shorter than holdover time for type ii fluid under certain conditions both fluids are under scrutiny for their environmental impacts and it is uncertain if type ii fluid diminishes runway coefficient of friction since fluid rolls off airplane during takeoff roll also use of either type fluid may result in a temporary degradation in airplane s aerodynamic performance a reduced stall margin and an increase in drag safety card errors thumb 180px right an ntsb diagram of deaths and injuries to passengers aboard flight 405 while it was not named as a cause of accident investigators also found that passenger safety briefing cards in airplane showed two types of galley service doors however only one door is installed on a particular f28 model at any one time examination also showed that safety card did not show how to operate either of two types of galley service doors in emergency mode if normal opening mode failed however final report stated that this did not contribute to fatalities in accident conclusion final report published by ntsb cited probable cause of accident to be failure of airline industry and federal aviation administration to provide flight crews with procedures requirements and criteria compatible with departure delays in conditions conducive to airframe icing and decision by flight crew to take off without positive assurance that airplane s wings were free of ice accumulation after 35 minutes of exposure to precipitation following de icing ice contamination on wings resulted in an aerodynamic stall and loss of control after lift off contributing to cause of accident were inappropriate procedures used by and inadequate coordination between flight crew that led to a takeoff rotation at a lower than prescribed air speed aftermath ntsb recommendations ntsb made several recommendations to faa including requiring that flight crew members and appropriate ground personnel responsible for inspection of transport category airplanes for wing contamination receive specific periodic training that will illustrate what contamination looks like and feels like on a wing and amount of contamination that is detectable under different light conditions they also ordered airlines to establish a way to inform fight crews of type of deicing fluid and mixture used current moisture accumulation rate and available holdover time with regard to obstructions that airplane collided with during accident sequence ntsb ordered modification or replacement of all pump houses adjacent to runway 13 31 so that they are not obstructions to airplanes they also ordered a study on feasibility of building a frangible ils antenna array for laguardia airport further they ordered a review of fokker f28 4000 passenger safety briefing cards to ensure that they clearly and accurately depict operation of two types of forward cabin doors in both their normal and emergency modes and that they describe clearly and accurately how to remove overwing emergency exit and cover dryden report allegations crash was featured on national geographic channel in an episode of television program mayday air crash investigation air emergency entitled cold case where accident was compared with air ontario flight 1363 which crashed in dryden ontario after crew did not deice their jet program opened by saying that canadian investigators were stunned to hear of usair accident as it mirrored air ontario flight which had occurred three years earlier report on crash in dryden criticised approaches to deicing it made several points including recommending use of type ii deicing fluid rather than type i deicing trucks near runway rather than at gate and that crew should inspect their wings not only from cockpit but also cabin report concluded that competitive pressures caused by commercial deregulation cut into safety standards and that many of industry s sloppy practices and questionable procedures were placing pilots in difficult situations honourable virgil p moshansky who investigated crash in dryden and wrote report appeared in documentary alleging that if recommendations in his report had been followed usair accident could have been prevented moshansky told documentary that his report probably sat on somebody s at faa desk he said when i first heard about it i thought my god it s dryden all over again certainly if they had followed recommendations in my report f28 crash at laguardia could have been averted another investigator into air ontario accident told documentary that after all of this work investigating dryden crash after all of efforts to see it happen again was extremely frustrating documentary focused largely on these allegations while also reconstructing air ontario flight and usair flight however it was reported that faa refuted moshansky s allegations and they claim that they never received his report international conference on airplane ground deicing thumb 200px right these ice formations on propeller and fuselage surfaces of a test unit installed in icing research tunnel at aircraft engine research laboratory of national advisory committee for aeronautics cleveland ohio show what may happen to an aircraft in flight under certain atmospheric conditions following crash of flight 405 and air ontario accident in dryden faa began to research methods of improving deicing practices at airports to minimise number of accidents caused by a buildup of ice described by faa as a sharply focused effort experts convened on may 28 and 29 1992 in reston virginia for international conference on ground deicing at conference industry methods were discussed and agreed upon for actions that should be taken in long term and short term a report on conference by faa read a better understanding of airplane ground deicing and anti icing issues is a crucial prerequisite to implementation of feasible and effective safety improvements to achieve this goal faa sponsored a conference at which international aviation community could exchange thoughts and offer recommendation on a variety of issues concerning safe winter operations at conference more than 750 participants discussed problems posed by aircraft deicing and examined possible solutions it was reported that discussions over different types of deicing fluid were discussed along with different deicing equipment and techniques they also found that pilot in command was ultimate authority for take off decisions but that all operators had to provide proper training and criteria for pilot in command to base a proper decision on conference concluded with an amendment to faa regulations which air carriers operated under new regulations stated that airlines should put in place faa approved ground deicing or anti icing procedures anytime weather conditions of ice snow or frost prevailed new rules went into effect on november 1 1992 developments in deicing thumb 250px left an american airlines md 80 aircraft being deiced at syracuse hancock international airport in years that followed accident airlines started using type iv deicing fluid which is more effective than both type i and type ii fluids type iv fluids stick to aircraft for up to two hours chicago o hare international airport was first to introduce deicing facilities at runway something which has now become commonplace aircraft themselves now have more sophisticated deicing systems that can be used on ground and in air many modern civil fixed wing transport aircraft for example boeing 737 use anti ice systems on leading edge of wings engine inlets and air data probes using warm air this is bled from engines and is ducted into a cavity beneath surface to be anti iced warm air heats surface up to a few degrees above freezing preventing ice from forming system may operate autonomously switching on and off as aircraft enters and leaves icing conditions ground deicing technologies are also developing and a newer technology is infrared deicing this is transmission of energy by means of electromagnetic waves or rays infrared is invisible and travels in straight lines from heat source to surfaces and objects without significantly heating space air it passes through when infrared waves strike an object they release their energy as heat this heat is either absorbed or reflected by cooler surface infrared energy is continually exchanged between hot and cold surfaces until all surfaces have reached same temperature equilibrium colder surfaces more effective infrared transfer from emitter this heat transfer mechanism is substantially faster than conventional heat transfer modes used by conventional deicing convection and conduction due to cooling effect of air on deicing fluid spray aircraft deicing vehicles have also improved since accident usually consisting of a large tanker truck containing concentrated de icing fluid with a water feed to dilute fluid according to ambient temperature vehicle also normally has a cherry picker crane allowing operator to spray entire aircraft in as little time as possible an entire boeing 737 can be treated in under 10 minutes by a single de icing vehicle airport runways are also deiced by sprayers fitted with long spraying arms these arms are wide enough to cross entire runway and allow de icing of entire airstrip to take place in a single pass reducing length of time that runway is unavailable notable passengers richard lawson film and television actor survived accident see also 1992
