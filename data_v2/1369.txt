petitcodiac river known informally as chocolate river is a river in south eastern new brunswick canada river has a meander length of and is located in westmorland albert and kings counties draining a watershed area of about watershed features valleys ridges and rolling hills and is home to a diverse population of terrestrial and aquatic species ten named tributaries join river in its course toward its mouth in shepody bay before construction of a causeway in 1968 river had one of world s largest tidal bores which ranged from in height and moved at with opening of causeway gates in april 2010 river is flushing itself of ocean silts and bore is returning to its former size mi kmaq were first to settle near river and used it as part of a portage route between shubenacadie and village of petitcodiac where they had a winter camp acadians from port royal nova scotia colonised region in 1698 but were expelled in 1755 during seven years war acadian resistance fighters in village des blanchard now hillsborough fought under command of french leader charles deschamps de boishebert in battle of petitcodiac to fend off british troops and suffered destruction of most of their settlement british troops revisited river three years later and conducted petitcodiac river campaign in 1840s greater moncton area saw a shipbuilding boom but this was halted following arrival of steam train and forced town to these changes eventually marginalised petitcodiac river in 1968 a controversial rock and earth fill causeway was built between moncton and riverview to prevent agricultural flooding and to carry a crossing between two communities causeway caused many problems for river and its surrounding ecosystem an estimated of silt was deposited in 4 7 km 2 9 mi of river downstream from causeway in first three years following construction causeway restricted movement of fish and reduced region s salmon catches by 82 percent water quality has also dropped thanks to industrial expansion around area in 2003 earthwild international designated petitcodiac river as most endangered river in canada because of these problems on 14 april 2010 causeway s gates were opened permanently as part of a 68 million three phase project designed to restore river river will no longer flow through causeway gates at all come 2020 when a permanent bridge will be completed to redirect water way it naturally flowed etymology a popular belief suggests that name derives from french term petit coude meaning little elbow in fact name derives from an indigenous word probably maliseet or possibly mi kmaq according to maliseet elder and linguist dr peter paul of woodstock reserve name refers to a wall of water rushing in now they call that it means sound of thunder well

november 1758 during a downstream voyage from moncton to fort frederick near saint john admiralty referred to tidal bore in a hydrographic chart published in 1861 observing that after its passage rise of tide is very rapid until high water is attained and that during lowest tides bore still appears but its broken front usually is only a few inches high bores ranged from in height with speeds from in 1825 peter fisher noted that noise of bore is heard a great distance and animals immediately take to highland and manifest visible signs of terror if near it before causeway 1968 values were

many other aquatic organisms are thought to have once entered watershed due to low salinity of water six species have disappeared from river since mid 1980s petitcodiac river was only known canadian habitat of dwarf wedgemussel and was later isolated to just nine american watersheds after its elimination from petitcodiac atlantic salmon is no longer present in watershed and has since been listed as an endangered species in canada american shad was a favourite with fishermen and represented two thirds of entire canadian shad landings from 1870 to 1900 catches peaked at million kilograms two to six million pounds per year three other species have been eliminated from river striped bass atlantic sturgeon and atlantic tomcod however a project of petitcodiac riverkeeper funded by government of canada s environmental damage fund in 2005 noted that removal of causeway would result in a good chance of bringing back eliminated species and an excellent chance of increasing numbers of species deemed to have been reduced in numbers no data has been released for atlantic salmon or striped bass various insects and arachnids reside around petitcodiac river among them is stonefly mayfly caddisfly simulium subfamily of and non native species such as black footed spider beech scale white marked tussock moth and mountain ash sawfly have also made their home in petitcodiac river

and a winter camp at confluence of anagance and north rivers first europeans arrived in early 1604 when a french expedition to acadia now nova scotia and new brunswick led by explorer pierre dugua de mons and accompanied by cartographer samuel de champlain and future acadian governor jean de sailed into bay of fundy hoping to find an ideal site for a settlement they passed advocate harbour and saint john river before dugua chose to settle on saint croix island in present day maine although they did not explore petitcodiac region they returned to coasts of eastern nova scotia where they founded port royal in 1676 jacques bourgeois a colonist from nova scotian settlement settled in area of beaubassin now marshes by 1685 its population had grown to 129 with 19 out of 22 families living

river campaign part of expulsion french and indian war erupted in 1754 amid tensions between british and french over control of ohio valley initially inhabitants of acadia were uninvolved in conflict because french had already ceded land to britain under treaty of utrecht 1713 acadians were asked to take an oath declaring complete fidelity toward british monarch on several occasions but they refused at first they were not punished for doing so a declaration of neutrality was signed in 1730 and was accepted by nova scotia governor richard philipps this earned acadians nickname neutral french at outbreak of war in 1754 british again demanded unconditional oaths of fealty perceiving acadians as a possible threat in spite of resistance led by jean louis le loutre representatives eventually agreed to sign but their reluctance persuaded governor charles lawrence to order acadian population expelled from british territory about 1 100 acadians living around petitcodiac river were affected by this decision two hundred british troops led by major joseph frye were sent to destroy settlements of three rivers beginning with shepody and village des blanchard now hillsborough french resistance commander charles deschamps de boishebert hoping to evacuate as many acadians as possible was unable to march distance between and shepody settlement in time but fought at second threatened village on 28 august 1755 boishebert s troops composed of inhabitants from area and from shepody counter attacked suffering only one loss to twenty three british casualties this defeat is thought to have been reason for british abandonment of campaign at three rivers commander and evacuated acadians whom edward larracey estimated to total around 700 suffered a massive famine from 1756 to 1758 largely caused by scarce resources following battle thumb left alt a slightly degraded painting of a smiling middle aged man with grey hair in a black armoured suit charles deschamps de boishebert in 1758 joseph broussard also known as beausoleil by locals led raids against british vessels sailing in bay of fundy and cumberland basin this provoked british into initiating two raids of their own first took place in february in shediac where lieutenant colonel george scott tried to find boishebert when they were returning boishebert ambushed them killing two of scott s gunmen second raid took place at settlement of shepody in march where british were shocked to find that acadians had already begun rebuilding their homes on 28 june scott learned of reports that cattle were stolen outside of fort beausejour british issued an order for captain danks to send 75 men up petitcodiac river they arrived in moncton following night and about 30 acadians began firing at their vessel however danks held his offensive position and british killed 19 acadians taking nine others prisoner he and his troops continued to sail up river next day they sent 60 men to burn a settlement west of moncton historians presume that area had already been deserted acadians continued to survive in region overcoming results of raids scott sailed back to region to search for beausoleil and to weaken acadians before winter he arrived in moncton near midnight on 12 november but tide of petitcodiac river prevented him from sending more than twelve men they came back next morning with 16 prisoners scott was told that area was virtually defenceless so he sent three parties to la chapelle now bore park in moncton now lewisville and now dieppe scott recorded no deaths or prisoners but all buildings in sight were burned and cattle were brought back onto vessel additional raids by scott between 14 and 17 november captured a dozen acadian prisoners burned settlements and uncovered beausoleil s own schooner crew sent an acadian prisoner on 17th to request surrender of remaining residents but when he returned he reported that they had all begun to flee to cocagne shediac and settlements around miramichi river this prompted scott to return to fort frederick in saint john a few of acadians migrating to miramichi river probably died of hypothermia during trip due to 1758 59 winter those who survived joined refugees already present who had been persuaded by boishebert to seek refuge there inadequate housing and supplies among other reasons led to deterioration of reputation of french commander and only 700 acadians remained there by late 1759 meanwhile raiding rapidly took its toll on residents who stayed around three rivers as food supplies became scarce and reconstruction became impossible fall of quebec city in september 1759 also eliminated possibility of assistance from that area on 16 november 1759 190 acadians in region sent a delegate to fort beausejour which had been renamed fort cumberland to announce their surrender to newly promoted colonel frye settlements of miramichi and surrendered next day with a delegate sent to fort to represent their 700 refugees frye requested and received permission from governor lawrence to take them in for winter acadian refugees were offered land on isthmus of chignecto in early 1760 but most requested their original lands around three

moncton reached 100 composed mainly of descendants of these settlers moncton s shipbuilding era began in 1840 with arrival of stewart russell a shipbuilder from hopewell russell built which sailed down petitcodiac river to trade at ports in saint john and new england ship and its crew sank in a storm on 24 december 1850 during a trip to boston for christmas a ferry service on petitcodiac river was launched around 1841 thanks to a license obtained by simon outhouse larch built by stephen binney in 1845 was another important vessel becoming largest to sail on river but it was not until arrival of joseph salter in 1846 that shipbuilding boom began a shipyard founded by binney and salter produced 24 vessels from 1847 to 1859 and employed almost 500 of 1 000 inhabitants in moncton salter would become first mayor of moncton in april 1855 year town was incorporated european and north american railway was extended to link pointe du chene to moncton in 1857 with an eventual goal of reaching saint john in 1860 move according to larracey caused town to become but a station stop along a railway line this coincided with failure of moncton s shipbuilding industry and a population drop from a peak of 2 000 to about 500 town declared bankruptcy and was unincorporated in 1862 but it later regained its status in 1875 after it became intercolonial railway s headquarters for its shops in 1871 while petitcodiac river continued to aid in shipping of goods into 20th century shipbuilding essentially ended in 1890s final vessel built in moncton was ii on 14 may 1980 while final ship to sail up petitcodiac river was from france which arrived on 12 july 1986 and was ironically stranded in moncton until 3 november due to river s tidal fluctuations in 1924 petitcodiac tidal power company proposed a tidal power project this called for a dam to be built between hopewell cape and fort folly point company sold shares to raise funds for project and a series of on site and airborne studies were conducted by federal government but project fell through by 1928 as rail transport became more common it displaced river transportation around great depression in addition greater moncton international airport offered an airmail service from moncton to montreal by 29 december 1929 these factors further marginalised petitcodiac gunningsville bridge which crosses petitcodiac river to link moncton and riverview was built in 1867 it was damaged and rebuilt on four different occasions first was following saxby gale of 1869 which forced town to rebuild bridge in 1872 it went under extensive repairs mid 1892 but ice build up from petitcodiac continued to pose a threat for wooden structure leading to construction of a new steel version from 1915 to 1919 this fourth bridge would suffer through many collisions including one with mayflower in september 1929 which caused ship to capsize and drown two men gunningsville bridge would last 86 years before it would be demolished a final time making way for a four lane bridge crossing covered bridges were also built over petitcodiac river final extant one being hasty built in 1929 thumb alt a concrete and

present in 1968 provincial and federal governments completed construction of a causeway between communities of moncton and riverview to provide a crossing over river and to keep water levels from impeding agricultural production this was a benefit for federal government at time which had constantly maintained dykes in area it also benefited provincial government as federal government was willing to fund 3 million project but not a bridge although causeway was equipped with a fishway problems arose when fish were unable to cross it freely due to sedimentation build up some 82 percent of salmon were prevented from travelling upstream by structure sediment accumulated in of river downstream from causeway with over 10 million cubic metres 13 million cubic yards of silt deposited in first three years following construction several reports from 1969 to 1971 described its impact on aquatic ecosystem and proposals for amendments to causeway gates were released but no action was taken in 1976 and 1977 reports pointed out several problems related to gates function due to erosion winter ice jams and unsatisfactory fishway operation it was not until 1978 that new brunswick s department of transportation commissioned a study of problems final report recommended three alternatives for action to continue operation as is to continue operation without gates or to eliminate gate leakage and amend operation protocol third alternative was chosen two years later but did not substantially improve fish migration as expected provincial government decided to open gates between 15 april and 7 july 1988 to allow fish to migrate up stream this was repeated from 26 september to 31 october 1988 and in spring of 1989 and 1990 during low tides in 1991 new brunswick s department of oceans and fisheries recommended opening gates from april to december each year a provincial government committee report recommended an additional seven options for modification of causeway in may 1992 but government did not act upon any of these options due to low cost benefit factor more reports documented problems related to passage of fish in river until 1995 when department of transportation agreed to open one gate from april to december as suggested four years earlier a project was then organized in december 1996 to begin a trial for systematic opening of gates during year but conditions could not be physically met and it was terminated on 1 june 1999 in february 2001 niles report proposed an additional four modifications to causeway project to either replace fishway open gates during peak fish migration open gates permanently or replace entire causeway with a bridge new brunswick department of environment 2002 p 3 an environmental impact assessment study was commissioned in 2003 to develop and summarise these options and on its completion in 2005 it announced recognition of option 3 and option 4 as possible solutions first option had been ruled out following evaluation of other fish passage models which were deemed inapplicable to river second suggesting systematic gate opening periods was ruled out because of inability to cater to every marine species migration periods new brunswick department of environment 2005 pp 13 16 option 4 was split into three sub options mainly to list possible bridge lengths 170 280 and 315 metres 190 310 and 344 yards new brunswick department of environment 2005 p 16 provincial government later accepted proposal on 6 december 2006 and selected option 4b on 7 august 2007 which called for a bridge in place of causeway project was divided into three phases expected to cost a total of 68 million phase 1 consisted of prevention of erosion along shorelines improvements to nearby drainage system and construction of dikes and work was carried out from 7 july 2008 to 14 april 2010 phase 2 consists of opening gates to monitor river flow both upstream and downstream for two years phase 3 commenced in 2012 consisted of bridge s development and removal of causeway and is anticipated to be completed in 2021 confusion arose as to whether or not project would be funded by federal government they refused in spite of an earlier comment from department of fisheries and oceans which had hinted at a possible negotiation unwilling to wait provincial government came forward with an initial 20 million on 7 july 2008 to begin first phase approach of phase 2 was met with various complaints a biology professor at universite de moncton noted that 200 000 250 000 worth of pesticide would be required to keep mosquito population around city of moncton from doubling once gates open flood warnings were issued by provincial department of supply and services for town of riverview warning that high river tides could lead to flooding of over of sport fields and structures built in low lying areas however they added that causeway s flood gates were able to descend if required eliminating chances of such repercussions from a possible inundation residents near headpond west of causeway criticized project citing decrease in property values of about 480 homes by approximately 30 percent according to eia report 68 million price tag unstable ice conditions and a lower water quality in spite of legal threats by lake petitcodiac preservation association lappa and various residents causeway opened its gates on 14 april 2010 coinciding with beginning of various studies since opening river improved significantly surpassing original expectations for project an amec engineer participating in firm s studies jacques paynter said that banks of river had begun widening at a noticeable pace with tidal bore growing closer to its pre 1968 levels we were actually anticipating a fairly modest increase in height it seems to be already exceeding what we might have expected he noted that an estimated 40 000 gaspereau had returned to river and called for more studies to determine impact of causeway s opening recreation residents around petitcodiac have used river for various recreational purposes trips were made annually via river from moncton to beaumont for feast of saint anne celebrations with locals a towboat owned by and sons offered moonlight cruises in early 1930s for 50 cents approximately 6 50 in 2010 values note used values from 1930 service was popular until towboat capsized in front of embarking passengers causing them to lose interest during their environmental impact assessment in september 2005 amec cited recreational fishing and birdwatching as major pre causeway activities a fishery for atlantic salmon existed downstream from causeway for several years post 1968 moncton naturalists club also publishes their birding in moncton area a birdwatching
