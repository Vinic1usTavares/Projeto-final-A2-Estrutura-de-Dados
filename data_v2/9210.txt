gioachino rossini s petite messe solennelle little solemn mass was written in 1863 possibly at request of count alexis pillet will for his wife louise to whom it is dedicated composer who had retired from composing operas more than 30 years before described it as last of my peches de vieillesse sins of old age extended work is a missa solemnis but rossini labeled it not without irony petite little he scored it originally for twelve singers four of them soloists two pianos and harmonium mass was first performed on 14 march 1864 at couple s new home in paris rossini later produced an orchestral version including an additional movement a setting of hymn as a soprano aria this version of mass was not performed during his lifetime because he could not obtain permission to perform it with female singers in a church it was first performed three months after his death at salle ventadour in paris by company of theatre italien on 24 february 1869 while publications began that year first critical edition appeared only in 1980 followed by more editions in 1992 bicentenary of composer s birth history upright thumb composer in 1865 rossini composed petite messe solennelle in 1863 34 years after his last opera in passy where he spent last decades of his life rossini and his wife entertained a circle of friends holding samedi soirs for which he composed several pieces of chamber music often vocal which composer called his peches de vieillesse sins of old age mass was possibly commissioned by count alexis pillet will for his wife louise to whom it is dedicated but musicologist nancy p fleming points out that rossini may have had reasons of his own to compose it and dedicated it in response to staging first performance mass is structured in several extended movements in tradition of missa solemnis but composer labeled it petite with a grain of irony he wrote on last page of manuscript unusual scoring for voices two pianos and harmonium is in neapolitan harpsichord tradition of 18th century rossini specified on second page of his manuscript twelve singers in all noting on title page twelve singers of three sexes men women and castrati will suffice for its execution that is eight for choir four soloists in all twelve cherubim performances thumb upright 0 78 sisters carlotta and barbara marchisio who often appeared together including first performance of mass mass was first performed on 14 march 1864 at couple s new residence in paris hotel of louise comtesse de pillet will countess is dedicatee of this refined and elegant piece which avoids sentimental opulence of most contemporary liturgical works such as those by charles gounod albert lavignac aged eighteen conducted from harmonium soloists were sisters carlotta and barbara marchisio italo and luigi agnesi sisters marchisio had performed together in rossini s works before such as leading parts of lovers in his opera semiramide rossini who had helped prepare for performance turned pages for first pianist georges mathias and marked tempos by nodding his head among first listeners were giacomo meyerbeer daniel auber and ambroise thomas performance was repeated following day for a larger audience which included members of press in 1867 three years after first performance rossini discreetly orchestrated petite messe solennelle partly for fear that others would do it anyway after his death as he disliked sound of cathedral boys choirs he requested permission from pope to perform work with female voices at a church when his request was rejected he demanded that orchestral version would only be performed after his death composer preferred chamber music version anyway thumb upright gabrielle krauss soprano in first public performance thumb upright marietta alboni contralto first performance of orchestral version which was also first public performance of work took place on 24 february 1869 close to what would have been rossini s seventy seventh birthday it was performed at salle ventadour in paris by company of theatre italien with soloists gabrielle krauss marietta alboni ernest nicolas and luigi agnesi publication in 1869 both piano version and orchestral version were published first edition was a piano version by brandis dufour who made it available on day of premiere based on rossini s piano version but reduced to only one piano also cutting passages it was soon followed by editions from chappell in london ricordi in milan and oliver ditson in boston somewhat later by b sohne these four prints have in common that they were settings for harmonium and only one piano ricordi published a piano reduction of orchestral score rather than following rossini s original piano version some versions failed to mention that rossini intended work to be accompanied by two pianos a critical edition did not appear until 1980 when edizioni musicali in florence published a version faithful to composer s intentions edited by angelo coan three new editions of piano version were prepared celebrating rossini s 200th anniversary in 1992 two critical editions by oxford and carus verlag and one by novello with only one piano part reception reception of work was divided music critic filippo filippi in la noted this time rossini has outdone himself because no one can say what prevails science and inspiration fugue is worthy of bach for erudition a reviewer for l illustration wrote however giuseppe verdi was much less enthusiastic as he wrote to count arrivabene on 3 april 1864 lately rossini has made progress and studied studied what personally i would advise him to unlearn music and write another barber scoring thumb upright georges mathias principal pianist of first performance portrayed by marie alexandre in its original version performance of mass required four soloists soprano contralto tenor and bass a mixed choir of ideally twelve singers including soloists two pianos and harmonium which sometimes could be replaced by an accordion according to first idea of rossini but was considered too popular for a religious framework at time of creation this low number of performers contrasts with dimension of ensembles used at that time to interpret great works of sacred music this is what has earned this mass adjective petite in 1867 rossini orchestrated his mass for instrumental forces much larger three flutes two oboes two clarinets three bassoons four horns four trumpets three trombones two cornets timpani two harps organ and strings judgements about two versions diverge some musicologists argue that orchestrated version is preferred today to original while others explain that piano gives back its bite to original version which composer preferred structure mass is structured following five parts of liturgical text with a ternary kyrie a gloria in six movements a credo divided in four sections sanctus including hosanna and benedictus and agnus dei rossini added two earlier compositions using an instrumental piece in form of prelude and fugue for an offertory and inserting in orchestral version a soprano aria a setting of as fleming points out insertion of an instrumental offertory and or a motet such as was mentioned in in reviews of contemporary mass settings kyrie and gloria form part i other movements are combined as part ii in following table of movements markings keys and time signatures are taken from ricordi

spicy harmonic twists she summarizes his optimistic and deeply felt faith robert king conductor of king s consort notes it certainly is solennelle for it is a heartfelt religious work which shows extraordinary compositional capabilities of this astonishing man of theatre it is full of drama pathos colour and intensity kyrie structure of kyrie following liturgical three appellations kyrie eleison christe eleison kyrie eleison lord have mercy christ is ternary in form a b a kyrie eleison andante maestoso 108 a minor measures 1 35 christe eleison andantino moderato 66 in c minor measures 36 57 kyrie eleison as a reprise of first part but in other keys measures 58 90 work opens in a minor with two chords marked pppp extremely soft piano then begins an ostinato motif which remains present throughout movement a continuous flow of sixteenth appears in a pattern of first third and fourth played in octaves by left hand while second appears as a syncopated chord in right hand harmonium introduces motifs repeated by chorus voices pick up a slowly rising line on word kyrie marked sotto voce in imitation first tenor and bass a measure later alto a measure later soprano word eleison appears in contrasting homophonic chords marked forte but to piano for repeats of word a second appellation begins in measure 18 in c major marked pppp for kyrie but with another sudden forte and decrescendo for eleison upright 1 8 thumb beginning of a cappella christe eleison middle section christe eleison is a double canon in an style marked tutto sotto voce e legato it stays on one dynamic level different to dynamic contrasts of first part this music was composed by rossini s friend louis niedermeyer as et incarnatus of a solemn mass and included by rossini possibly as an affectionate personal tribute as musicologist david hurwitz points out second kyrie returns to first tempo and themes but through a tonally inverted path c minor instead of a minor then a major instead of c major after second exposition finale runs through a chain of surprising harmonies measures 75 to 80 leading to final cadence gloria upright 1 8 thumb beginning of gloria gloria is subdivided into six movements seven sections similar to baroque masses such as bach s short masses gloria in excelsis deo marked allegro maestoso 120 first line is introduced by two sequences of three chordal motifs separated by a measure of silence according to claire these represent trois coups announcing rise of curtain in french theater tradition sopranos alone sing first line glory to god in highest repeated by a four part harmonization et in terra pax upright 2 6 thumb bass solo after four measures of piano interlude bass soloist begins softly text and peace on earth joined later by other soloists finally four parts of chorus all repeat one after other gently te we pray to you and conclude section singing in homophony te we glorify you marked again sotto voce gratias upright 1 3 thumb theme of bass with piano second movement of gloria is a trio for alto tenor and bass it sets gratias agimus tibi propter magnam gloriam tuam we give you thanks for your great glory marked andante grazioso 76 in 2 4 it is made up of an introduction for piano theme a used in different voices measures 24 51 presentation of a new theme b measures 51 58 a chromatic digression for piano measures 59 65 a brief return to theme a measures 67 76 development of theme b measures 76 94 a long cadence measures 96 114 setting for three voices illustrates we give you thanks domine deus third movement of gloria is a tenor aria setting domine deus rex celestis lord god king of heaven marked allegro giusto and fortissimo 120 in common time it is introduced by a march like theme with a pattern of a syncopated long accented note on beat 2 of most measures which tenor picks up second thought domine deus agnus dei lord god lamb of god is presented in contrasting triple piano and even rhythm a third aspect domine deus filius patris lord god son of father appear forte and with an even accompaniment in triplets aria is by its music of energetic dotted rhythms and leaps an image of a majestic heavenly king qui tollis fourth movement of gloria is a duet for two female soloists expressing qui tollis mundi miserere nobis you who carries sins of world have mercy marked andantino mosso 76 in common time it has two voices often in parallels of thirds and sixths quoniam fifth movement of gloria is a bass aria on text quoniam tu solus sanctus for you alone are holy a short introduction marked adagio leads to an extended piano section marked allegro moderato 76 with contrasts in dynamics cum sancto spiritu final movement of gloria is a chorus on words cum sancto spiritu in gloria dei patris with holy spirit in glory of god amen they are presented first as in beginning of gloria returning to initial key then marked allegro a capella they are expanded to long fugue with a display of counterpoint shortly before end opening of gloria is repeated on first words unifying movement further credo different from gloria text of creed is mostly in same character interrupted only for a short soprano solo crucifixus crucified and an episode et resurrexit and risen concluded by another fugue word credo i believe is first sung by tenors then by sopranos again by choir this statement of belief is repeated several times throughout movement structuring and unifying it in a way that niccolo mozart and beethoven used before among others marked allegro cristiano 120 a strong beginning is contrasted by softly expressing in unum deum in one god beginning on same tone reminiscent of liturgical reciting tone then soloists with alto and tenor beginning sing passage et incarnatus est and was born in same mood female voices of chorus announce in unison et homo factus est and was made man repeated by male voices then piano plays a sequence of short motifs interrupted by many rests crucifixus crucifixion is illustrated by solo soprano marked andantino sostenuto 80 on a soft ostinato accompaniment et resurrexit resurrection is announced by sopranos first alone then by a strong chord in instruments which changes e flat they sing to d sharp of a b major chord in which other voices join after this surprise new text is sung to themes from first section concluded by credo another fugue expands text et venturi and life of a world to come amen it ends operatic with a a slow retarding line by all soloists finally a last credo for liturgical offertory rossini inserted an instrumental piece he had composed before a combination of prelude and fugue prelude sixteen measures of 4 4 andante maestoso 92 is written for piano and asks for dynamics ranging from double forte to double piano una corda it announces at same time f tonality and modulating character of movement by chords borrowed from distant keys solemn rhythmic style will not recur until four measure postlude of fugue upright 2 6 thumb fugue subject 17 21 rossini indicates that fugue without postlude explicitly written for piano may be played equally on piano or harmonium in 3 4 andantino mosso 76 with a regular rhythm of eighth notes fugue has a theme in form of a turn like bach motif which has same chromatic opening as famous subject of fantasy and fugue on theme b a c h by franz liszt rossini proves both his inventiveness particularly at level of management of tonality which frequently evolves into distant keys and his impressive capacity for mastering contradictions structure begins classically with a fugue with exposition of subject successively in three voices at a piano dynamic turn motif in f minor is repeated four times at interval of a rising third c e g and b followed by a development by a sequence of arpeggios in descending thirds melodic line proceeds to dominant to accompany exposition of subject in second voice with a series of eighth notes arranged in a constant interval of a third or a sixth with subject this arrangement repeats itself during exposition of subject in third voice in f minor a long episode of 29 measures follows where modulations are legion for example a sequence based on three first notes of turn theme is repeated eight times in a row starting in measure 47 numerous dynamics are marked in score piano forte crescendo and decrescendo this episode ends with dynamic double forte decrescendo on a perfect cadence of g d dominant seventh g major repeated twice identically g major chord becomes dominant of key of second exposition second exposition of subject begins at measure 70 in left hand in c minor then in right hand in g minor at measure 78 same 29 episodic measures as before are heard but transposed then extended by 26 measures of new development always using numerous sequences a full measure of rest measure 140 precedes a cadence in f minor then f major of which a transforms into tonic of key b minor for postlude then dominant of cadence in e minor followed by an e major chord and concluding without transition on an f major chord ritornello rossini wrote a brief instrumental passage probably to establish key of c major and mood for following sanctus ritornello and sanctus which follows are in effect in same key of c major both in 6 8 sanctus acclamation sanctus holy appears three times sung by choir each time more intense than before pleni sunt coeli et terra full are heaven and earth begins as a canon of choir voices beginning forte and ending softly hosanna in excelsis hosanna in highest is sung by pairs of soloists in unison for benedictus qui venit in nomine domine blessed who comes in name of lord choir presents a soft melody in triplets sequence is repeated in different harmonic development and with soloists taking over benedictus section movement culminates in a strong eight part affirmation of in excelsis o salutaris this movement was not part of rossini s original version for two pianos and harmonium but he inserted it in his version for orchestra he transposed an earlier composition which was originally in e major for alto however as alto soloist had to subsequently sing agnus dei it was reallocated to soprano it became customary to include it even in performances and editions with piano s thomas aquinas s hymn o salutaris has been used in mass settings close to agnus dei from renaissance it was set to music in 18th century by guillaume gabriel henry and jean paul martini and by franz liszt in 19th century rossini uses first four lines out of eight melodic line of soprano soloist begins with an upward broken seventh chord this movement in 3 4 with tempo andantino sostenuto 88 is structured as an introduction for piano of twenty measures an a b a section measures 21 to 91 a reprise of introduction shared between piano and soloist measures 92 to 103 an a b a section measures 104 to 154 a finale with piano in a noble style as similarly throughout work theme and its broken seventh chord g b d f which characterize this movement is stated first as a major seventh in two first passages of first section a with a discreet accompaniment to finish this section theme a dominant seventh in second a section theme first repeats major seventh before developing into a minor seventh with a minor third in second passage g b d f melodic line of part b is contrasting in both its static character and vehemence of piano accompaniment and by double forte dynamics as much by double forte dynamics which give a brutal character as by use of sequences e major to begin with then b major g major e major etc this section ends with a chromatic descent in accompaniment at quadruple piano dynamic up to a dominant seventh of g major to prepare return of second section a in original key a reprise of first measures of introduction uses only text bella armies pursue us while piano repeats introduction identically soprano doubles it several times for one or two measures interspersed with silences rest section a is largely in form of sequences section b uses most static part of theme b in another sequence return to key of section a repeated identically operates on an enharmonic equivalence g f as elsewhere in work agnus dei final movement of mass begins with an introduction that is similar to that to crucifixus piano then begins another ostinato pattern as base for expressive melodies by contralto soloist repeating many times agnus dei qui tollis mundi miserere nobis lamb of god you take away sins of world have mercy after an extended cadence choir sings a capella twice and very simply dona nobis pacem give us peace this process is repeated in different harmony and once more in a major mode leading to an intense request for peace of soloist and choir together then movement returns to introduction with its soft chords interrupted by rests and ends with a few strong hammered chords notes references bibliography general sources books journals
