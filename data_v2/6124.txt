caused a scandal with his 1921 novel simon called peter tale of a priest s wartime affair with a young nurse book sold 600 000 copies in 1920s alone was referenced in great gatsby and was cited in a double murder investigation feted in united states but critically less than well received keable moved to tahiti where he continued to write producing both novels and theological works until his death at age 40 of a kidney complaint keable was raised in bedfordshire and educated at magdalene college cambridge he entered a theological college after graduation and was ordained a priest in 1911 he spent next several years as a missionary in africa stationed on zanzibar and in basutoland before returning to europe as an army chaplain during first world war there he met and fell in love with a young nurse grace eileen joly beresford buck a development over which he eventually quit church of england and left his wife sybil returning to england after war keable resigned his ministry and began to write novels his first 1921 s simon called peter became a runaway success and launched keable into a life of literary celebrity increasingly disillusioned with hypocrisies he saw in contemporary british life he and buck left europe for tahiti in 1922 couple lived there happily until buck s death in childbirth in 1924 after which keable s health began to fade he nonetheless struck up a later relationship with a tahitian woman ina with whom he had a son and continued to publish novels until his death of a kidney condition in 1927 keable s most famous publication was his first novel simon called peter but he produced a prodigious literary output spanning theological tracts through poetry to travel guides simon called peter s sequel recompense was made into a film and his later novels all attracted substantial attention his writings generally met with much greater popular than critical approbation and simon called peter was sufficiently incendiary to be banned book nonetheless became a contemporary best seller much of keable s fiction contained autobiographical elements often centring on his attitudes toward and experience of christian religious establishment as well as these fictional explorations he produced a final non fiction work great galilean outlining religious views he developed during a lifetime s uneasy relationship to anglicanism and catholicism he came to believe that historical jesus bore little relationship to jesus of christian tradition and in great galilean attempted to reconcile his ambivalence about orthodoxies of church with his enduring belief in an all loving god keable s views earned him many unfavourable reviews and contempt of church in which he had practised but foreshadowed ideas of free love that became prominent later in 20th century early life thumb alt elizabeth brick college beside a river magdalene college cambridge keable s alma mater keable was named after his father robert henry keable a successful businessman who in 1904 when his son was 17 was ordained an anglican priest and became vicar at pavenham bedfordshire robert keable had a younger brother henry who died of typhoid c 1918 young keable attended whitgift school in croydon surrey where he was nicknamed and noted for his fluent and facetious contributions to school paper influenced by his father s piety he became an active lay preacher and member of ymca as a teenager keable s was an austere anglican upbringing effect of which his biographer hugh cecil has suggested was to leave young man industrious somewhat in his writing style and with a not particularly tied to specific faith in which he d been raised cecil 1995 p 158 keable went up to magdalene college cambridge in 1905 his peers there included future everest explorer george mallory and arthur tedder 1st baron tedder though his contemporaries described him as a quiet devout student who initially associated only with other religious minded men he later became more sociable and rowed in college second eight james 2000 p 67 he took a first in history tripos graduating with his ba in 1908 and receiving his ma in 1914 at magdalene he was a great friend of arthur grimble future commissioner of gilbert and ellice islands grimble s daughter in a biography of her father described undergraduate keable as devout earnest somewhat introspective and deeply literary she records that he spent his university vacations on missionary work he is known also to have taught in east africa under ymca auspices and to have climbed mount kilimanjaro among most significant acquaintances keable made at cambridge were two brothers among fellowship arthur and hugh benson bensons were sons of a highly accomplished academic and religious family their father edward white benson was archbishop of canterbury and their mother mary sidgwick benson sister of philosopher henry sidgwick had set up a lesbian household with lucy tait daughter of previous archbishop of canterbury after her husband s death in years just before keable came to cambridge hugh benson inspiration for keable s character father vassall in peradventure 1921 cecil 1995 p 171 had departed from anglicanism of his upbringing in favour of roman catholic church being ordained a catholic priest in 1904 according to keable s contemporaries two met when a neighbour on keable s staircase invited them both to lunch keable fell under spell of fr benson s winning personality wrote james i james a college acquaintance of keable s keable s anglican loyalty remained but it was a new kind of loyalty he spoke no more of protestantism but always of catholicism in chapel he now and crossed himself a strange mystic element deep down in his being began to stir i often suspected that fr benson had posed to this clever mind for keable was clever arguments that had recently brought himself to catholicism benson was also a novelist and under his influence sensory aesthetic dimension of keable s own writing and of his faith began to develop benson sensed in keable an inclination to rome but keable elected for anglican priesthood joining theological college of westcott house and serving as canon at bradford after completing his studies cecil 1995 p 160 priesthood in 1911 keable was ordained a priest of church of england at ripon his friend hugh benson regretted that keable had not turned to catholicism a decision benson felt would lead keable to ultimate disenchantment with church in a letter he told keable african missions from 1912 1914 keable was sent overseas with universities mission to central africa a decision perhaps intended to save him from rome he served under frank weston bishop of zanzibar a staunch anglican with whom keable clashed keable objected to weston s unorthodox methods for training black african priests weston a vehement supporter of these priests saw prejudice in keable s views weston was to inspire bishop of mocambique character in keable s 1921 novel peradventure in africa keable wrote his first two books 1912 s darkness or light a history of universities mission to central africa and manuscript for city of dawn published in 1915 a portrait of zanzibar that showed genuine religious fervour as well as a characteristic sentimentality cecil 1995 p 161 keable returned to uk in 1914 as a result of illness precipitated perhaps by rigour of service upon which weston insisted in zanzibar he was offered a church posting in sheffield but declined fearing pull of rome if left within reach of catholic influences in britain instead he made two attempts to enlist for armed service during first world war ill health thwarted both so he returned to africa for mission work becoming rector of three parishes including leribe basutoland under diocese of bishop of bloemfontein he published some ten devotional works and works on missionary practice during this time including loneliness of christ and a book of verse titled songs of narrow way damaging effects of illness he had suffered were compounded by an assault while in field accounts vary with some friends recalling that keable received a blow to head from a powerful native james 2000 p 68 and others describing a gunshot wound to thigh inflicted by a probably drunk or deranged editorial footnote by archivist dr hyam to james 2000 p 68 keable s biographer cecil has suggested that whole incident may have been a fabrication of keable s in 1915 keable married sybil armitage at durban pair had met in bradford sybil was passionately religious with a strong social conscience and robust health a big handsome some thought beautiful woman with auburn hair cecil 1995 p 162 she was well suited to demands of life as a missionary s wife and inspired character edith in keable s later novel peradventure but pair were temperamentally ill matched and described by keable s biographer cecil as sexually incompatible they had no children hugh benson suspected that marriage had been a gesture on keable s part to render impossible lingering prospect that he might become a monk first world war thumb left alt stone monument in a park a memorial to south african soldiers who fought in first world war like company for which keable was chaplain keable eventually achieved his wish of going to war in 1917 when a south african contingent was mustered for military service in france and keable volunteered to go with them as chaplain his experiences there were to form basis for his first and most successful novel simon called peter appointed an army chaplain on 26 may 1917 keable travelled to rouen sector with a native labour contingent of 21 000 men these men were paid ps3 per month to unload supply ships and provide infrastructure support for military operations in europe as a chaplain with rank of captain keable was expected to be at disposal of army at large and ministered to those seeing active infantry service as well as to labourers padres were formally required to remain behind lines but it is apparent that keable nonetheless saw something of realities of frontline cecil 1995 p 164 like many padres during first world war keable reassessed his approach to his congregation men to whom he ministered he came to believe cared nothing for finer points of anglican theological dispute from church they wanted only entertainment and a barely spiritual form of practical christianity cecil 1995 p 167 keable argued as much openly suggesting that protestant chaplaincy in france should be amalgamated into operations of ymca and that only roman catholic padres who seemed to have quite a different more immediate relationship with their celtic and lancastrian companies should remain his public airing of these views attracted censure from church and particularly from frank weston who was also serving but reflected openness that made him popular with officers in france a smoker he was known to share whisky and sodas in officers mess and as does title character in simon called peter to have become acquainted with a devoutly religious french prostitute another transformative experience of keable s war was his acquaintance with grace eileen joly beresford buck known as jolie an 18 year old nurse from a prominent british family daughter of william tenant buck and beatrice elinor beresford her ancestors included dukes of rutland who was driving trucks for canadian lumber corps when two met cecil 1995 p 168 pair began a lifelong affair though keable did not yet leave his wife instead at war s close he returned to leribe he remained until 1919 torn by his increasing alienation from church and his experiences during war there he wrote his first novel simon called peter in an intensive 20 day spell i laid a parson s life bare he said of his writing and didn t care a damn robert keable quoted in cecil 1995 p 155 at last in 1919 keable resigned his ministry and left anglican church cecil 1995 p 170 literary career after leaving church keable and sybil moved back to england settling at west wratting cambridgeshire where both began to explore roman catholic church sybil converted and became a devout catholic but keable also read works in contemporary philosophy and books of charles darwin and appears briefly to have lost his faith altogether he wrote of history of christianity i can see creative evolution at work what is behind it i don t know but i m inclined to think that i do not believe it is anything which old concept of god really covers paul keable quoted in cecil 1995 p 170 to support family keable worked during 1921 as an assistant master at dulwich college and served following year at dunstable grammar school he continued to write manuscript for simon called peter had found a publisher michael sadleir at constable who liked its prospects and commissioned from keable a second novel he commenced mother of all living an intense love drama set in south africa which reflected his new interest in african traditional religion and featured a concept of life force as an alternative to theology then simon called peter was published and met with astonishing success book reportedly sold over 600 000 copies during 1920s reaching a 66th edition by 1922 a largely autobiographical work simon called peter is tale of a priest peter graham who has an affair in wartime france with a nurse named julie title character almost abandons his faith for love but experiences a direct revelation of christ while watching a catholic mass and is given up by his lover who sees his sincerity its runaway popularity won keable a level of celebrity he spent a lot of time in london and took up again with buck who was now usually known as betty she by her token called keable bill two met often at gwen otter s salon at no 1 ralston street in chelsea near to where keable had lodgings they made many friends though refrained from fully overt displays of out of deference to buck s distressed parents and keable s wife at this time keable appears to have become in some measure a proponent of open relationships and free love he concluded that buck had a right to pursue relationships with other men though there is no firm evidence that she did and that a warm and spontaneous sexual nature far from being in conflict with christian love was in fact a manifestation of it cecil 1995 p 172 keable s developing attitudes and relationship with betty disgusted his wife sybil but as a devout catholic she refused to divorce this left keable unable to marry buck and contributed to a growing sense on his part of alienation from english society at last in 1922 he managed legally to separate from his wife he took up suggestion of former college friend arthur grimble by then a colonial administrator in ellice islands that he visit south pacific a fashionable destination for 1920s europeans to keable south seas appeared to offer escape from hypocrisies of british society as well as furnishing a climate better suited to his never hearty constitution in 1922 keable and buck sailed aboard bendigo for south pacific via australia where keable undertook a book tour giving lectures in which he broadcast his new sexual ethics that unmarried couples in love could have deeply moral relationships while loveless spouses who stayed together for convention s sake were committing acts of deep immorality his views scandalised contemporary press but frank weston noted in correspondence that keable as a shipwrecked priest made quite a useful cautionary tale for novices cecil 1995 p 174 tahiti right thumb alt aerial view of tahiti coastline with boats in harbour papeete in tahiti keable s adopted home keable was to remain resident in tahiti for rest of his life he wrote once of his regret that had not succeeded in converting william ellis a nineteenth century christian missionary sent there to attempt to proselytise them bill and betty settled at first in paul gauguin s former home at cecil 1995 p 165 house was quite luxurious overlooking a bay with views of moorea island buck drove a dodge and enjoyed tahiti s ample supplies of cheap french wine keable brooded on gauguin s gesture against spiritual suffocation cecil 1995 p 175 and eventually moved household further inland to a native style house in wilder surrounds of near couple made friends with swedish artist paul engdahl keable continued to write copiously adding to his oeuvre novel recompense a sequel to simon called peter he undertook several book tours of united states and spent his spare time answering fanmail swimming and sailing then in 1924 buck fell pregnant couple agreed that she should return to england for better healthcare during birth and she went there to set up a home with her mother s help in early november 1924 she gave birth prematurely to a son anthony and a few days later died of poisoning from chloroform administered against pain of delivery grief stricken keable s own health worsened and he was advised to return to tahiti baby too weak to travel was left in england with jack and rita elliott friends of couple s since ralston street salon days were eventually to adopt him cecil 1995 p 177 179 keable remained in tahiti his health worsening he suffered weight loss diabetes high blood pressure and fever all stemming from a kidney illness nonetheless he completed novel numerous treasure which he had begun before buck s death bittersweet tale of a polynesian woman who shared her name with a cocktail and a brand of cigarettes was a commercial success and has been considered a valuable portrait of early century tahitian life cecil 1995 p 179 his health and spirits rallied in years after buck s death he completed a travel book tahiti isle of dreams and a book tour of united states and europe on returning to tahiti he struck up a relationship with a mixed race islander named ina and made many new friends including writers alec waugh elder brother of evelyn who had been inspired to visit tahiti by numerous treasure zane grey and james norman hall waugh described keable of this period reclined among cushions clad only in a while his tahitian princess bare shouldered and bare footed her black hair falling to her waist and a white flower behind her ear glided negligently about house and yet noted that on suggesting a cup of tea keable s voice still took on intonation with which fifteen years earlier he had summoned parish children to a sunday school treat alec waugh quoted in cecil 1995 p 180 1927 s lighten our darkness or ann decides was his last important novel cecil 1995 p 181 tale of a catholic priest restored to faith by a woman s love was however poorly received and follow up madness of monty a kindly innocuous comedy went over worse still cecil 1998 p 181 instead helped by james norman hall to overcome his failing eyesight keable devoted his attention to great galilean a non fictional account of historical jesus and his relationship to jesus of religious tradition cecil 1995 p 181 2 away from his writing he and ina conceived a child ina gave birth to a son named henry meaning glorious warrior with whom keable was delighted and to whom he bequeathed all his tahitian properties in november 1927 he initiated formal divorce proceedings against sybil in an attempt to legitimise this son cecil 1995 p 182 in december 1927 keable contracted a worsened kidney infection became septic and delirious and on 22 december died at home new york times obituary identified illness that killed him as bright s disease term was used to refer to a number of kidney conditions though according to acquaintances many of his friends had heard nothing from him since his departure for tahiti his will made provision for a scholarship at magdalene and named college as his residuary legatee his literary assets at death were valued at ps5 007 though keable received a protestant burial in papeete some accounts suggest that in last weeks of his life he formally converted to catholicism other commentators suggest pagan sentiments he expressed about birth of his new son as a riposte to social convention tend to indicate otherwise cecil 1995 p 183 hugh cecil argues that at his death keable most likely just became able to reconcile his two ideals romantic erotic and religious and could die peacefully accepting rituals he loved religious views religious views keable developed after leaving church of england influenced his novels he eventually articulated his own theology in his final book great galilean a theological work of his views was not always well received a reviewer of his novel peradventure observed peradventure starts as a church of england tract becomes what would appear to be a roman catholic tract and before end is reached reader is in doubt as to just what sort of tract it is his last book great galilean has been characterised by one biographer as keable s attempt to his love of jesus with his failure to believe in him as a god book sought to distinguish historical jesus of record from traditional jesus of church worship historical jesus keable said was so poorly known that there survived too little information for a three line obituary instead figure that christians worshipped was a traditional jesus recorded in gospels from an oral tradition that was not really biographical this traditional jesus became a literary jesus central figure of four gospels and it is on this figure quite distinct from actual historical jesus that contemporary church centred keable sought to criticise attitude in contemporary church toward traditional jesus given how much of rest of traditional religion protestantism had discarded however keable was at pains to stress that traditional jesus should not be seen as an imposture or something to be discarded of traditional jesus he said should not be a reason to leave church without this traditional jesus he predicted western civilisation would fade and fall he was then critical of specific ways in which contemporary church construed jesus in its attempts to conflate traditional jesus with historical jesus which keable considered impossible he blamed these actions of church for declining numbers of worshippers and accused it of draining christianity of profundity by relying too heavily on rationalism and rigid structure though he believed that historical jesus was barely known keable nonetheless devoted much attention in last galilean to trying to understand figure he emphasised humanity of historical jesus who he wrote had shared humanity s ignorance though had also been blessed with an extraordinarily undistorted mind he wrote of a jesus tolerant even fond of sinners and one who understanding importance of love and sex to average man advocated love as most important thing above any church rule or regulation this jesus was a great prophet of free love associated and in harmony with a spirit of all life great galilean was not well received new york times reviewer called it hopelessly muddled finding keable s claims about unknowability of jesus contrary to his efforts to understand and worship him frankly we do not know what to make of it we can only suppose that street preaching at cambridge and even climbing kilimanjaro are not conducive to logic critical reception keable s novels won him immense international popularity and intense controversy his novels were equated with mrs humphry ward s robert elsmere a similarly scandalous tale of religious doubt among clergy published 40 years earlier h d a major editor of modern churchman magazine made this comparison with respect to keable s peradventure noting it is slighter but it has need to be twentieth century novel reader is intellectually and morally lighter than nineteenth reporting his death melbourne argus attributed best selling popularity of keable s novels to licentiousness of their contents they have no literary value his former college acquaintance james later wrote that his friends sought to dissuade him from publication transition from beautiful book on loneliness of christ 1914 of his central african period to simon called peter 1921 came as a great shock to all who had known and loved him in earlier days where rosemary grimble calls keable s novels splendidly erotic a birmingham news correspondent in birmingham alabama accused keable of fashioning abnormalities other critics called his success undeserved and attributed it to prurience on part of his readers reviewers also suggested that contrast between keable s ecclesiastical background and frank often sexual content of his novels attracted curiosity in itself a time columnist j f expressed fascination of this disconnect overtly responding to a piece titled censorship of thought that keable had contributed to a 1922 volume sic after simon called peter s publication had made him notorious surely here is a modern personality worth study of psychologists j f wrote noting romance of keable s unusual circumstances from a quiet english clergyman to author of a sensational best seller who has taken up his permanent residence in south seas seems a long jump in person he said keable was antithesis of his novels striking directness he does not impress one as a radical gentleman there is nothing to suggest resigned clergyman author of books marked by their sex frankness and melodrama in fact his scholarly bearing and gentleness mark him rather as country curate who should be acting as a character in a novel by may sinclair and passing out crumpets to maiden ladies in a decorous drawing room instead of writing of tahitian damsels as he has done in his new novel numerous treasure it was for simon called peter a tale of a wartime romance between an english priest and a red cross nurse that keable acquired most of his notoriety as well as its best selling print editions story was adapted as a stage play by jules eckert goodman and edward in 1924 show enjoyed popular success in chicago before moving on to new york a great deal of media coverage of simon called peter concerned its involvement in a prominent united states court case over double murder in new brunswick new jersey of edward wheeler hall a rector and mills a married member of his congregation with whom he had been conducting an affair during their courtship hall had presented mills with copies of simon called peter which also featured a romance between a priest and a woman and mother of all living john sumner secretary of society for suppression of vice seized upon this fact and tried to have books american publisher arrested he claimed that simon called peter could be used to corrupt and seduce innocent published with a title savouring of religion and written by a clergyman it had an innocent look which admitted it to society where ordinary licentious novel could not circulate a magistrate declining request to issue an arrest warrant against publisher nonetheless agreed that book was nasty and particularly objectionable because written by a clergyman shortly afterwards a boston judge deemed book obscene and fined a librarian who protested that she had a long queue of patrons waiting to borrow book us 100 for circulating it keable himself professed surprise at intensity of reaction to book saying that his missionary and military experiences must have blunted his perceptions as to what general public felt in response to banning in boston of another of his books numerous treasure he wrote to his editor george putnam that he had in past month received fanmail from a bookseller a request for his photograph from a girls high school library and an intimation that i had been adopted as literary patron of a class at an american university i feel vaguely that boston ought to be told net effect of simon called peter controversy was to make keable a celebrity book became so well known that f scott fitzgerald who described novel as really immoral gave it to protagonist nick to read in his famous novel great gatsby and had character pronounce either it was terrible stuff or whiskey distorted things because it didn t make sense to me fitzgerald 1998 p 26 book s sequel recompense was optioned as a film by warner brothers starring marie prevost and monte blue keable himself found screenplay so altered from original text he wryly proposed that he write another novel based on it his first visit to united states in autumn 1924 was announced in new york times he took in a production of simon called peter stage play in new york before returning to polynesia via new orleans los angeles and san francisco on his return times printed a very lengthy letter from keable on subject of origins of cocktail headlining it robert keable in his tahiti retreat makes a case for englishmen or their greek and roman ancestors as inventors same paper had received keable s second novel 1922 s mother of all living favourably reviewer louise fields called it not only better from an artistic point of view than simon called peter its general outlook is both steadier and more mature book has in it so much that is well done and worth while that one does not feel inclined to carp at its comparatively few weaknesses on whole other reviews were less favourable characters in both peradventure and recompense were criticised for lacking depth reviewers said they served only as vehicles for conveying different theoretical points of view a later book 1927 s ann decides was dismissed succinctly by chicago daily tribune as tosh p w wilson in a new york times piece on contemporary religious literature two years after keable had died called keable s life a spiritual tragedy and described his thinking as fundamentally contradictory his mind like rock reveals by strata volcanic and other experiences to which it has been subjected keable s distinction between historical and traditional jesus wilson argued was ultimately muddled and internally inconsistent his verdicts on of contemporary church at odds with his own abiding conviction late in 20th century keable received some revisionist attention simon called peter came back into print with a recent edition published in 2008 biographer hugh cecil including keable in his 1995 anthology of neglected great war writers
