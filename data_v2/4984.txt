united kingdom there are two such authorities court of lord lyon in scotland and college for rest of united kingdom college has had its home in city of london since its foundation and has been at its present location on queen victoria street since 1555 college originally occupied a property between st paul s and thames st known as derby place which burned in great fire replacement building known

important rolls of arms while still duke of gloucester and constable of england for his brother edward iv from 1469 he in latter capacity supervised heralds and made plans for reform of their organisation soon after his accession to throne he created sir john howard as duke of norfolk and earl marshal of england who became first howard appointed to both positions in first year of his reign royal heralds were incorporated under royal charter dated 2 march 1484 under latin name le garter regis armorum regis armorum partium australium regis armorum partium regis armorum et heraldorum sive armorum translated as garter king of arms of england king of arms of southern parts king of arms of northern parts king of arms of wales and all other heralds and pursuivants of arms translated by author from latin charter then goes on to state that heralds for time being shall be in perpetuity a body corporate in fact and name and shall preserve a succession unbroken this charter titled literae de heraldorum is now held in british museum there has been some evidence that prior to this charter royal heralds had already in some ways behaved like a corporation as early as 1420 nevertheless charter is earliest surviving document to affirm chapter as a corporate body of heralds charter outlines constitution of officers their hierarchy privileges conferred upon them and their jurisdiction over all heraldic matters in kingdom of england king empowered college to have and use only one common seal of authority and also instructed them to find a chaplain to celebrate mass daily for himself anne neville queen consort and his heir prince edward college was also granted a house named coldharbour formerly poulteney s inn on upper thames street in parish of all hallows less

of 1485 passed an act of resumption in which large grants of crown properties made by his two predecessors to their supporters were cancelled whether this act affected status of college s charter is debatable however act did facilitate de facto recovery of coldharbour to crown henry then granted house to his mother lady margaret beaufort for life this was because it was supposed that house was granted personally to john writhe garter king of arms and not to heralds as a corporation as a result heralds were left destitute and many of their books and records were lost despite this ill treatment from king heralds position at royal court remained and they were compelled by king to attend him at all times albeit in rotation of reign of king henry viii it has been said that at no time since its establishment was college in higher estimation nor in fuller employment than in this reign henry viii was fond of pomp and magnificence and thus gave heralds plenty of opportunity to exercise their roles in his court in addition members of college were also expected to be regularly despatched to foreign courts on missions whether to declare war accompany armies summon garrisons or deliver messages to foreign potentates and generals during his magnificent meeting with francis i of france at field of cloth of gold in 1520 henry viii brought with him eighteen officers of arms

college s petitions to king and to duke of suffolk in 1524 and 1533 for return of their chapter house were rejected and heralds were left to hold chapter in whichever palace royal court happened to be at time they even resorted to meeting at each other s houses at various and even a hospital furthermore henry viii s habit of raising ladies in situation of subjects to queens and then awarding them many heraldic augmentations which also extended to their respective families was considered harmful to science of heraldry noted antiquarian and heraldist charles boutell commented in 1863 that arms of queen anne boleyn are first which exemplify usage introduced by henry viii of granting to his consorts augmentations to their paternal arms it is a striking illustration of degenerate condition of heraldry under second tudor sovereign it was also in this reign in 1530 that henry viii conferred on college one of its most important duties for almost a century heraldic visitation provincial kings of arms were commissioned under a royal warrant to enter all houses and churches and given authority to deface and destroy all arms unlawfully used by any knight esquire or gentleman around time of dissolution of monasteries this duty became even more necessary as monasteries were previously repositories of local genealogical records from then on all genealogical records and duty of recording them was subsumed by college these visitations were serious affairs and many individuals were charged and heavily fined for breaking law of arms hundreds of these visitations were carried out well into 17th century last was in 1686 reincorporation thumb right upright roll of grants of arms during tudor period by sir thomas wriothesley c 1528 college found a patroness in mary i although it must have been embarrassing for both sides after heralds initially proclaimed right of her rival lady jane grey to throne when king edward vi died on 6 july 1553 lady jane grey was proclaimed queen four days later first in cheapside then in fleet street by two heralds trumpets blowing before them however when popular support swung to mary s side lord mayor of london and his councils accompanied by garter king of arms two other heralds and four trumpeters returned to cheapside to proclaim mary s ascension as rightful queen instead college s excuse was that they were compelled in their earlier act by duke of northumberland lady jane s father in law who was later executed an excuse that mary accepted queen and her husband and co sovereign philip ii of spain then set about granting college a new house called derby place or derby house under a new charter dated 18 july 1555 at hampton court palace house was built by thomas stanley 1st earl of derby who married lady margaret beaufort in 1482 and was created 1st earl of derby in 1485 house was built in 1503 and was given to crown by 3rd earl in 1552 3 in exchange for some land charter stated that house would enable them college to assemble together and consult and agree amongst themselves for good of their faculty and that records and rolls might be more safely and conveniently deposited charter also reincorporated three kings of arms six heralds and all other heralds and pursuivants and their successors into a corporation with perpetual succession a new seal of authority with college s full coat of arms was also engraved on 16 may 1565 name house of office of arms was used thereafter in may 1566 our colledge of armes and in january 1567 our house of college of office of arms derby place was situated in parish of st benedict and st peter south of st paul s cathedral more or less on college s present location there are records of heralds carrying out modifications to structure of derby place over many years however little record of its appearance has survived except description that buildings formed three sides of a quadrangle entered through a gate with a portcullis on west side on south range roughly where queen victoria street now stands was a large hall on western end derby place s hearth tax bill from 1663 discovered in 2009 at national archives at kew showed that building had about thirty two

confirmed by an act of parliament in 1566 as well as drawing up of many important internal statutes and ordinances for college by thomas howard duke of norfolk earl marshal dated 18 july 1568 long reign saw college distracted by many quarrels between garter william clarenceux robert cooke and york herald ralph brooke about their rights and annulments disputes in which other officers also took part often occurred among lesser heralds against each other historian mark noble wrote in 1805 that these fights often involved use of every epithet that was disgraceful to themselves and their opponents and that their accusations against each other would fill a volume during these years college s reputation was greatly injured in eyes of public reason behind these discords were laid on imperfect execution of reorganisation of college in 1568 and uncertainty over issue of granting arms to new and emerging gentry of era an enquiry into state of college lasted for one year finally reporting to william cecil baron burghley in 1596 as a consequence many important measures of reform for college were made in reign of james i eventually these animosities among heralds in college ended only after expulsion of one and death of another civil war when english civil war began in 1642 during reign of king charles i college was divided three kings of arms three heralds and one pursuivant sided with king and royalists while other officers began to court services of parliamentarian side nevertheless heralds petitioned parliament in same year to protect their books of record registers entries precedents arms pedigrees and dignities in 1643 heralds joined king at oxford and were with him at naseby and followed him on all of his campaigns sir edward walker garter king of arms from 1645 was even appointed with permission of parliament to act as king s chief secretary at negotiations at newport after execution of charles i walker joined charles ii in his exile in netherlands meanwhile on 3 august 1646 committee of sequestration took possession of college premises and kept it under its own authority later in october parliament ordered committee to directly remove those officers whose loyalty were with king and to nominate their own candidates to fill these vacant offices those officers whose loyalty remained with king were persecuted first they were deprived of their offices then of their annulments then a fine was imposed and some were even imprisoned in spite of this institutional college was protected by parliamentarians and their rights and work continued unabated edward bysshe a member of parliament from was appointed garter thus parliament which rejected its king created for itself a king of arms during this time heralds continued

lancaster herald by charles i but then sided with cromwell did not even have a tabard with royal arms as his own had been plundered in wars he had to borrow a decorative one from tomb of james i in westminster abbey instead garment was duly returned next day restoration of charles ii annulled all acts of parliament and all actions of lord protector without penalising any of their supporters except for regicides accordingly all grant of arms of commonwealth college was declared null and void furthermore all heralds appointed during interregnum lost their offices while those appointed originally by charles i returned to their places exception was edward bysshe who was removed as garter but was instead appointed clarenceux in 1661 much to chagrin of garter edward walker in 1666 as great fire of london swept through city derby place college s home since 1555 was completely gutted and destroyed fortunately college s library was saved and at first was stored in palace of whitehall then later moved to palace of westminster where a temporary office was opened in an apartment called queen s court an announcement was also made in london gazette to draw public notice to situation due to a shortage of funds planned rebuilding of a new college was delayed until 1670 it was then that francis sandford rouge dragon pursuivant and morris emmett king s bricklayer were together able to design and begin construction of a new structure on old site costs of rebuilding was financed in stages and structure was erected slowly in parts heralds contributed significantly out of their own pockets at same time they also sought subscriptions among nobility with names of contributors recorded into a series of splendid manuscripts known as benefactors books thumb left college of arms as it looked in 18th century engraved by benjamin cole and published in william maitland s history and survey of london from its evolution to present time in 1756 by 1683 college part of structure was finished new building was built out of plain bricks of three storeys with basement and attic levels in addition college consists of an extensive range of quadrangular buildings apart from hall a porter s lodge and a public office rest of building was given over to heralds as accommodation to east and south sides three terraced houses were constructed for leases their facade in keeping with original design in 1699 hall which for some time had been used as a library was transformed into earl marshal s court or court of chivalry it remains so to this day in 1776 some stylistic changes were made to exterior of building and some details such as pediments and cornices were removed transforming building to then popular but austere neo classical style magnificent coronation of james ii in 1685 saw college revived as an institution of state and monarchy however abrupt end of his reign saw all but one of heralds taking side of william of orange and mary ii in glorious revolution period from 1704 to 1706 saw not a single grant of arms being made by college this nadir was attributed to changes in attitude of times acts of union 1707 between england and scotland in reign of anne did not affect jurisdiction or rights of college college of arms and court of lord lyon were to exist side by side in their respective realms however in matter of precedence lord lyon when in england was to take immediate precedence behind garter king of arms comfortable decay thumb right 250px design by robert abraham 1773 1850 for a new college of arms in trafalgar square at heart of regency london in 1820s plan was not executed due to a lack of funds hanoverian succession to throne of great britain led to reigns with less ceremony than in any since incorporation of heralds only notable incident for college in this period during reign of george i happened in 1727 when an impostor called robert harman pretended to be a herald knave was prosecuted by college in county of suffolk and was sentenced to be pilloried in several market towns on public market days and afterwards to be imprisoned and pay a fine this hefty sentence was executed proving that rights of college were still respected in 1737 during reign of george ii college petitioned for another charter to reaffirm their rights and remuneration this effort proved unsuccessful apart from these events influence of college was greatly diminished in 1742 a sugar house was built against wall of college this structure was a fire risk and cause of great anxiety among heralds in 1775 college surveyor drew attention to this problem but to no avail in february 1800 college was asked by a select committee of house of commons to report to them state of public records again heralds drew attention to proximity of sugar house members of committee inspected college premises and reported to house that college must either be moved to a new building or secured against risk of fire again nothing was done in 1812 water seeped through walls of college damaging records surveyor traced leak back to a shed recently erected by mr alderman smith owner of sugar house who declared his readiness to do everything he could but who actually did very little to rectify situation after years of negotiation college in 1820 bought sugar house from smith for sum of ps1 500 thumb left herald s college bennet s hill drawn

prince regent future george iv granted to college an annual endowment by royal warrant on 29 february 1820 this generous endowment from crown first since 1555 was applied towards reparation and support of college despite successes of purchase of sugar house and royal endowment college still looked upon possibility of moving its location to a more suitable and fashionable place john nash was at same time laying out his plans for a new london and in 1822 college through deputy earl marshal asked government for a portion of land in new districts on which to build a house to keep their records a petition from college was given to lords of treasury setting out herald s reason for move that local situation of college is so widely detached from proper scene of official duties and occupations of your and from residences of that class of persons by whom records in their charge are chiefly and most frequently consulted nash himself was asked by college to design a new building near fashionable trafalgar square but nash s elaborate plan proved too costly and ambitious for college at same time college also asked robert abraham to submit to them a second plan for building when nash heard that another architect was approached behind his back he reacted vehemently and attacked heralds college nevertheless continued with their plans however they were constantly beset by conflicts between different officers over amount needed to build a new building by 1827 college still had no coherent plan duke of norfolk ordered college to drop matter altogether by 1842 heralds were reconciled with their location and once again commissioned abraham to build a new octagonal shaped record room on site of old sugar house in 1861 a proposal was made to construct a road from blackfriars to mansion house this would have resulted in complete demolition of college however protests from heralds resulted in only parts of south east and south west wings being sliced off requiring extensive remodelling college was now a three sided building with an open courtyard facing new queen victoria street laid out in 1866 terrace steps and entrance porch were also added around this time reform thumb right upright 1862 map showing layout of college labelled herald off carter lane and upper thames street can be seen running parallel to north and south of college respectively st benet paul s wharf official church of college since 1555 can be seen to south west on 18 october 1869 a warrant for a commission of inquiry into state of college was established warrant issued on behalf of duke of norfolk stated that it is desirable that college of arms should be visited and an inquiry instituted with view of ascertaining whether rules and orders for good government of said college are duly obeyed and fulfilled and whether by change of circumstances or any other cause any new laws ordinances or regulations are necessary to be made for said college commission had three members lord edward fitzalan howard deputy earl marshal sir william alexander queen s counsel and edward a sergeant at law sir bernard burke of famous burke s peerage at time ulster king of arms gave commission advice that college should be made a government department let its officers receive fixed salaries from government and let all its fees be paid into public exchequer this arrangement would i am sure be self supporting and would raise at once character of office and status of heralds burke s suggestion for reform was same arrangement that had already been applied to lord lyon court in scotland in 1867 and was to be applied to his own office in 1871 however unlike lyon court which was a court of law and part of scottish judiciary college of arms has always been an independent corporate body overseen by earl marshal while lord lyon depended on government for its reforms and statutes college has always been able to carry out changes from within itself commission also drew attention to fees annulments and library of college as well as general modernisation of chapter as a whole when commission made its report in 1870 it recommended many changes and these were duly made

issues surrounding status and position of college continued at beginning of 20th century these issues were once again brought to forefront in 1903 an inquiry was set up at instructions of arthur balfour soon to be prime minister committee of inquiry was to consist of eight members sir algernon west was made chairman they were tasked to investigate constitution duties and administration of heralds college main issues being anomalous position of college who are theoretically officials of royal household but actually derive their income from fees paid by private individuals for their services some of members of committee a minority wanted like burke thirty four years earlier to make officers of college of arms into salaried civil servants of state despite concluding that some form of change was necessary inquiry categorically stated that any changes is at present time and in present circumstances impracticable in 1905 generous endowment from crown as instituted by george iv was stopped by liberal government of day as part of its campaign against house of lords and class system a second inquiry was established in 1928 under chairmanship of lord birkenhead inquiry was called soon after a secret memorandum written in 1927 was circulated by home office criticising constitution and workings of heralds memorandum states that they have as will be seen from this memorandum in many cases attempted to interfere with exercise by secretary of state of his constitutional responsibility for advising crown and that college had adopted practices in connection with matters within their jurisdiction which seem highly improper in themselves and calculated to bring royal prerogative into contempt these accusations concern actions of certain heralds who advocate cases of their paid clients even against opposition of ministers of day sir anthony wagner writes that officers of these departments no doubt in overconfident way of their generation esteemed college an anachronistic and anomalous institution overdue for reform or abolition memorandum ended by saying that college of arms is a small and highly organised luxury trade dependent for its living on supplying demand for a fancy article among well to do and like many such trades it has in very many cases to create demand before it can supply it when committee made their report in june 1928 they suggested several reforms to tackle main issues which had brought college into so much conflict with home office firstly they concluded that fees systems were adequate and no change was necessary in that regard they justified this by stating that placing all or even a few of officers on a fixed salary outweigh any advantages which might be expected to result from change secondly they concluded that from now on college was to be entirely subordinated to home office and that a standing inter departmental committee be established to settle any future conflicts present thumb right college of

lost when a change in wind saved it at end of war all of records were returned safely to college in 1943 college was given new responsibilities when office of ulster king of arms was annexed and

accession council made up of privy councillors and other officers such as lord mayor of london meets at st james s palace to make a formal proclamation of accession of next sovereign traditional method of publishing council s proclamation recognising new monarch is by way of it being physically read out this task is assigned to various members of college by way of earl marshal who receives text of proclamation from council in person proclamation is to be read at several locations in london traditionally first reading is made from friary court balcony at st james s palace another reading

monarch however monarch has delegated this power to two authorities lord lyon with jurisdiction over scotland and college of arms over england wales and northern ireland under latter s jurisdiction right to arms is acquired exclusively either by proving descent in an unbroken male line from someone registered as so entitled or by a new grant from king of arms these are most common way of gaining this right however technically arms can also be gained by a grant from crown by prescription meaning in use since time immemorial by succeeding to an office or by marriage descent of arms follow strongly law of heraldic arms which is a branch of english law interpreted by civil lawyers in court of chivalry sir edward coke in his commentary upon littleton 1628 wrote that gentry and armes is nature of for they descend to all sonnes arms in england therefore descend to all of male lines and not just most senior alone unlike in scotland when a new grant of arms is to be made it is granted through a letters patent crown delegates all of this authority to king of arms however before any letters can be issued they must have a warrant from earl marshal agreeing to granting of arms this has been case since 1673 when authority of earl marshal which heralds had challenged was established by a royal declaration stating among other things that no patents of arms should be granted without his consent this established present system whereby royal authority to approve candidates for grants of arms is exercised by earl marshal and royal authority to grant arms themselves is exercised by kings of arms firstly a petition is submitted called a memorial to earl marshal this memorial will be drawn up for petitioner by an officer of arms if it is felt that such a petition would be accepted

howard cullen 6th bishop of grahamstown grant was issued by garter king of arms sir george rothe bellew in 1950s in past this issue of eligibility have been a source of great conflict between heralds as such submissions are made on an officer for clients basis which meant some unsuitability was ignored in lieu of profit by past officers suitability rested on phrase eminent men originally test applied was one of wealth or social status as any man entitled to bear a coat of arms was expected to be a gentleman by 1530 heralds applied a property qualification requiring successful candidates for a grant of arms to have an income from land of ps10 per annum or movable wealth of ps300 however this was not always case in 1616 ralph brooke york herald tricked garter king of arms william segar into granting a coat of arms to gregory brandon a common hangman for a fee of 22 shillings when king found out he had them both imprisoned at marshalsea they were freed a few days later fee for grant of arms is due when memorial is submitted amount being laid out in earl marshal s warrant as of 1 january 2016 fees for a personal grant of arms including a crest is ps5 875 a grant to a non profit body is ps12 375 and to a commercial company is ps18 350 this grant however does not include a grant of a badge supporters or a standard their inclusion into grant requires extra fees fees mainly go towards commissioning artwork and calligraphy on vellum letters patent which must be done by hand and in a sense a work of art in itself plus other administrative costs borne by heralds and for upkeep of college once earl marshal has approved petition he will issue his warrant to king of arms this will allow them to proceed with granting of arms it is during this stage that designing and formation of arms begin although king of arms has full discretion over composition of arms he will take into full account wishes of applicant these will include allusions and references to applicant s life and

therein as perpetual property of himself and his heirs a copy of grant is always made for college s own register once granted a coat of arms becomes hereditary and inheritable property of owner and his descendants however this can only be so if inheritor is a legitimate male line descendant of person originally granted with arms to establish right to arms by descent one must be able to prove that an ancestor had his arms recorded in registers of college if there is a possibility of such an inheritance one must first make contact with an officer in waiting at college who could then advise on course of action and cost of such a search research into a descent of arms requires details of paternal ancestry which will involve examination of genealogical records first step involve a search of family name in college s archives as coats of arms and family name has no connection officer could prove through this method that there is in fact no descent however if a connection is found a genealogical research outside of college s archives would then be undertaken to provide definitive evidence of descent from an armigerous individual change of names college of arms is also an authorised location for enrolling a change of name in common law there is no obligation to undergo any particular formality to change one s name however it is possible to execute a deed poll more

instructing them to exemplify transferred arms or a version of them to licensee in his or her new name royal licences are issued on advice of garter king of arms and are usually dependent on there being some constraining circumstances such as a injunction a requirement in a will or a good reason to wish to perpetuate a particular coat of arms royal licence is of no effect until and unless exemplification is issued and recorded in college royal licences are gazetted and make a deed poll unnecessary genealogical records thumb right an example of an elizabethan pedigree of de euro family

genealogical materials such as pedigree charts and family trees college s extensive records within this realm of study dates back over five centuries an individual could if he so wishes have his family s pedigree placed inside college s records this would require services of an officer of college who would then draft a pedigree officer would ensure that pedigree was in correct format and also advise client on documentary evidences necessary to supports such a draft after this is done officer would submit pedigree to a chapter of two other officers who would then examine pedigree for any mistakes or in some cases demand more research after this examination is completed pedigree would then be scrivened and placed into pedigree register of college roll of peerage house of lords act 1999

s wardrobe has always been their tabards since 13th century records of this distinctive garment were apparent at first it is likely that herald wore his master s cast off coat but even from beginning that would have had special significance signifying that he was in effect his master s representative especially when his master was a sovereign prince wearing of his coat would haven given herald a natural diplomatic status john anstis wrote that wearing outward robes of prince hath been esteemed by consent of nations to be an extraordinary instance of favour and honour as in precedent of mordecai under a king of persia last king of england to have worn a tabard with his arms was probably king henry vii today herald s tabard is a survivor of history much like judges wigs and until last

pursuivant of damask silk tabards of all heralds ordinary and extraordinary are inscribed with sovereign s royal arms richly embroidered it was once custom for pursuivants to wear their tabards with sleeves at front and back in fact in 1576 a pursuivant was fined for presuming to wear his tabard like a herald but this practice was ended during reign of james ii until 1888 all tabards was provided to heralds by crown however in that year a parsimonious treasury refused to ask parliament for funds for purpose ever since then heralds either paid for their own tabards or bought one used by their predecessors newest tabard was made in 1963 for welsh herald extraordinary a stock of them is now held by lord chamberlain from which a loan during tenure of office is made upon each appointment they
