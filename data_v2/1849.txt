similar to naruto when he was young their personalities are developed differently boruto s relationship with his father reflects kishimoto s relationship with his children in japanese version boruto is voiced by kokoro kikuchi in last naruto movie and by yuko sanpei in all subsequent appearances sanpei enjoyed doing work of boruto s acting finding him endearing in english version he is voiced by amanda c miller boruto s character has received mixed critical responses his relationship with his father has been criticized due to reviewers finding concept overused in naruto manga in boruto naruto movie his development was praised due to his action scenes and how he understood his father s actions creation and conception masashi kishimoto created boruto in 2013 when manga naruto was at its climax motivation for creation was him wanting naruto uzumaki to become a father when manga ends in finale of naruto boruto makes a prank in mountain of konoha that shows all its leaders kishimoto wanted boruto to act like his father but at same time have differences between each other despite not wishing to reveal much about boruto due to developments of boruto naruto next generations he added that boruto is not as direct as naruto boruto s first name is a reference to character neji hyuga as an homage to his death in naruto while protecting both of boruto s parents in boruto naruto movie kishimoto developed boruto and naruto s relationship from his relationship with his sons he wanted film to depict father and son relationship between boruto and naruto film s theme song by kana boon serves as a reference to boruto one of singers of band stated that it reflects how character constantly changes from beginning to end of story boruto s mentorship by naruto s rival and best friend sasuke uchiha was influenced due to latter having few appearances in naruto movies kishimoto decided that he wanted sasuke to have a major role in boruto naruto movie which he wrote in film sasuke becomes teacher of naruto s first son boruto inspired by piccolo from dragon ball manga series by akira toriyama a former enemy of dragon ball protagonist goku piccolo becomes teacher of goku s first son gohan studio pierrot boruto anime and film director hiroyuki yamashita said that when first seeing character in sarada uchiha s spin off he liked his character in making of boruto film yamashita said some scenes regarding to boruto were removed due to time constraints such as one of character s interactions with his father as well as another interaction between boruto and sarada a difficult scene for staff was use of boruto s technique which had to disappear shortly after being used and then appearing again in an attack scene in which naruto passes his son all of his chakra to increase his rasengan was carefully storyboarded in film although boruto is protagonist of next generations series ikemoto stated in early 2019 that relationship between boruto and kawaki will be most important point in story as manga is aimed to reach flashforward scene from first chapter where both characters start fighting against each other design thumb left boruto s teenage appearance was made in a rush as a result mikio ikemoto believes that once series reaches this moment design will change drastically in designing character kishimoto intended boruto to be similar to his father but at same time avoided facial similarities in eyes and cheeks due to fact naruto had nine tailed demon fox kurama sealed inside him unlike his son additionally he gave him a simpler costume than naruto s original one that would yet remain symbol of uzumaki clan author purposefully let boruto wear his clothes casually by making him wear his jacket unzipped since he found it suitable for character s personality for finale of manga kishimoto originally intended to give boruto byakugan an eye technique which he would inherit from his mother hinata hyuga however author forgot about it and instead gave him an unknown eye technique it allows him to see chakra an energy source within ninjas to perform jutsu which is often shown on boruto s right eye during july 2017 one of animators from boruto naruto next generations revealed boruto s eye is called and that its powers are related to byakugan and naruto s ability to sense negative emotions however animator refrained from explaining more about since would be explained later in series in first few pages of first chapter boruto naruto next generations an encounter between an older teenage boruto against another one named kawaki was briefly shown as a flashforward purpose was to attract more fans so they could look forward to battle as it has a chaotic state to it battle against kawaki was shown instead in first chapter rather than sasuke s one against kinshiki otsutsuki from boruto film to generate a different impact within fans despite sharing same storyline boruto s teenage design was first illustrated in little time as a result mikio ikemoto stated that once boruto reached this moment older protagonist s design might change as story in manga progresses boruto s facial expressions change when interacting with other character with friendly tento boruto s eyes are shown bigger due to portrayal of boruto s childish personality however upon meeting kawaki boruto s eyes are illustrated smaller due to author s intent to show a more rebellious take on boruto due to staff of naruto anime referring to naruto and sasuke as legendary characters anime developers pierrot aim to carefully portray boruto and his friends new generation as new protagonists they also seek to have them developed as previous generation however kishimoto is concerned about how boruto and his friends could reach naruto and sasuke s strength as he finds it repetitive ikemoto stated that boruto s look is predetermined by storyline so author instead could not draw character on his own completely however scene from 9th chapter where boruto creates a rasengan with his father left a big impression on him believing it was important for storyline voice actors in japanese version he was voiced by kokoro kikuchi in last as a toddler for boruto film and anime he is voiced by yuko sanpei sanpei has been a fan of naruto manga series ever since she was young while identifying herself with naruto uzumaki s character actress noted bond

difficulties voicing boruto when she received her script for film she began to understand boruto s concept as boy who loves his father dearly which helped her voice character better please with film boruto sanpei asked kishimoto to make another one which resulted in kishimoto asking her to let him rest for another one in english version he was voiced by maile flanagan in last naruto movie film as a toddler and amanda c miller in boruto film as a teenager boruto is first main character miller has ever voiced while enjoying work she does as boruto s english voice she stated she felt stress about it due to how important her character is considering his role in story miller and other boruto english voice actors felt honored to play characters based on how large franchise is appearances boruto

boruto shinobi striker as a playable character as well as naruto x boruto ninja voltage he is also featured in boruto light novel reception critical reception to boruto s character has been generally mixed upon first seeing him ramsey isler from ign found him too similar to his father on other hand andy hanley from uk anime network said despite his similar design and actions to his father naruto boruto is not like him and has a different personality amy mcnulty from anime news network and hanley enjoyed boruto s relationship with his father naruto due to differences in their childhoods and how that becomes focus of film boruto naruto movie mcnulty also liked how boruto develops as he became afraid of his father s fate during an attack from antagonist she praised amanda c miller s role as boruto s english actor but feeling voice often sounded more feminine than his japanese counterpart christian chiok from japanator enjoyed boruto s character development his relationship with his father and how heartwarming it becomes in movie alexandria hill from otaku usa enjoyed boruto s fight against film s villain and his team up with naruto and sasuke chris zimmerman from dvd talk noted how writers fairly conceived boruto s poor relationship with his father and how it improves during climax of film rebecca silverman from anime news network praised how writers manage to develop boruto s angst without coming across as teen whining and how sasuke uchiha decides to train him upon seeing his similarities with his father leroy douresseaux liked how boruto s character has already started development by second volume of series mcnulty expressed joy in how viewer of boruto anime gets to see boruto s days in ninja academy which naruto briefly showed and how boruto does not have same behavior as his father when being a child while noting that boruto has still to fight enemies possessed by shadows in anime anime now writer sarah nelkin found this more lighthearted than naruto s actions in first series such as his final fight against sasuke uchiha where both became friends after nearly killing each other upon build up of anime s first story arc mcnulty praised fight between boruto mitsuki and sumire was praised for its animation with reviewer also noting how boruto inherited his father s ways of seeing on good parts of his enemies in order to avoid violence viz media senior director kevin hamric referred to boruto described his differences with his father such as his lack of desire to become village s leader and instead do other activities like playing video games however hamric said he initially has desire to surpass his father denki s voice actress ikki said she liked how boruto protects denki from bullies in series beginning having once being bullied when she was younger in regards to flashforward with destroyed village ikki said she had no idea what was going on but expects denki will be in that future to aid older boruto to protect ninja world from antagonist threatening it while boruto s character development was met with praise other critics felt otherwise richard eisenbeis from kotaku was critical to boruto s development as he felt that his bond with his father at end of boruto film was unthinkable and weak thais valdivia from hobby consolas stated that while viewers of film may initially dislike boruto s personality his character arc helps to make him more appealing adding his fight alongside naruto and sasuke as one of highlights chris beveridge from fandom post disliked large focus between naruto and boruto s relationship on first chapter of boruto manga nevertheless he enjoyed foreshadow of an older boruto on a fight against an unknown character for anime beveridge remarked boruto s characterization which he felt was superior to one from manga sam stewart from ign felt boruto s personality was far less enthused as reviewer commented he found character s dislike toward his father misguided and finding types of stories too common in fiction in a review from manga nick smith from icv2 found boruto as weak part of series due to his personality that contrasted naruto in original naruto series he also said politicking within power structure surrounding naruto and boruto becomes more interesting than boruto himself and as a result expected boruto to change in upcoming chapters to make series more appealing however melina dargis liked how boruto realizes his father s goals and joined sasuke and kages in order to save naruto additionally dargis noted boruto s early strained relationship with his father as well as his use of technology to fight might reflect on modern audiences who might understand his character more as a result as character developed stewart enjoyed boruto due to his childish personality as he starts acting like a hero from an action film he just watched worrying his family in process additionally reviewer liked how boruto s mysterious eye technique started making references to a previous naruto film while comparing boruto s traits to main characters often seen in other manga series mcnulty felt that boruto s growth across anime series helped to make him more likable theatergoers for boruto film were given two different types of fans with one of them using boruto and naruto s images boruto s entire clothing is also being sold as merchandising see also
