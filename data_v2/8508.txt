alasdair cochrane born 31 march 1978 is a british political theorist and ethicist who is currently a senior lecturer in political theory in department of politics at university of sheffield he is known for his work on animal rights from perspective of political theory which is subject of his two books an introduction to animals and political theory 2010 palgrave macmillan and animal rights without liberation 2012 columbia university press his third book politics will be published by oxford university press in 2018 he is a founding member of centre for animals and social justice a uk based think tank focussed on furthering social and political status of nonhuman animals he joined department at sheffield in 2012 having previously been a faculty member at centre for study of human rights london school of economics cochrane s work forms part of political turn in animal ethics that is emergence of academic literature exploring normative aspects of human nonhuman animal relationships from a political perspective he is known for his interest based account of animal rights a theory of justice according to which animals have rights based on their possession of significant interests account is a two tiered one with individuals strong interests grounding prima facie rights and some prima facie rights becoming concrete or all things considered rights in this picture violation of concrete rights but not necessarily prima facie rights represents an injustice in particular cochrane argues that sentient animals interests against suffering and death ground prima facie rights against infliction of suffering and death these prima facie rights convert to concrete rights in for example animal agriculture and animal testing meaning that killing nonhuman animals or making them suffer for these purposes is unjust cochrane argues that nonhuman animals do not possess an intrinsic interest in freedom therefore owning or using nonhuman animals is not in itself unjust this aspect of his thought has generated responses by others including political theorist robert garner and philosopher john hadley who argue that there may be reasons to claim that nonhuman animals do possess an interest in freedom cochrane has also proposed a cosmopolitan alternative to sue donaldson and will kymlicka s picture of a political animal rights explicated in their 2011 book zoopolis though donaldson and kymlicka have defended their account against cochrane s criticism they have said that they welcome attempts to develop alternative political theories of animal rights to their own cochrane s other research focusses variously on bioethics punishment just war and human rights life education alasdair cochrane studied in department of politics at sheffield as an undergraduate there he was taught by james a specialist in environmental politics who sparked his interest in political and environmental philosophy during a course on environmental politics cochrane read joel feinberg s rights of animals and unborn generations which he recalled as probably first piece of pro animal scholarship he read first piece of pro animal scholarship he wrote was his undergraduate dissertation in which he explored possibility of a reconciliation between sustainable development and animal rights cochrane received a first class honours degree in politics in 2000 from university he subsequently obtained an msc in political theory from london school of economics lse it was during this time that he met cecile fabre who went on to become his phd supervisor in 2007 cochrane received a phd from department of government at lse his thesis supervised by fabre with paul kelly acting as an advisor was entitled moral obligations to non humans in that year cochrane published his first peer reviewed research article animal rights and animal experiments an interest based approach paper a reworked version of chapter five non human animals and experimentation of moral obligations to non humans appeared in res publica and was winner of journal s second annual postgraduate essay prize academic career thumb right cochrane presenting at ethics and or politics approaching issues concerning nonhuman animals university of birmingham april 2015 chaired by tatjana in 2007 after completing his postgraduate studies cochrane joined centre for study of human rights at lse he was initially a fellow then became a lecturer in 2009 he published articles in and political studies defending his liberty thesis idea that nonhuman animals lack an intrinsic interest in freedom this claim has attracted article length responses from political theorist robert garner and philosophers john hadley andreas t schmidt and valery giroux cochrane s first book an introduction to animals and political theory was published in 2010 and was one of first to consider nonhuman animals from perspective of political theory book introduces readers to debate about inclusion of nonhuman animals within accounts of justice he first addresses historical dimension of question arguing that there was disagreement in classical exploration of issue unanimous rejection in medieval considerations and disagreement in contemporary treatments he then considers place of nonhuman animals in utilitarian liberal communitarian marxist and feminist political theory concluding that no single tradition is sufficient to account for place nonhuman animals should have in politics but that all have something worthwhile to offer to debate in 2011 cochrane became a founding member of centre for animals and social justice casj casj is a think tank that aims to bring academics and policy makers together with a view to understanding and furthering social and political status of nonhuman animals in january 2012 cochrane became a faculty member in department of politics at university of sheffield first as a lecturer in political theory and then as a senior lecturer in political theory his second book animal rights without liberation was released that year by columbia university press book is based upon research he completed during his phd at lse and offers an extended defence of theoretical basis and practical consequences of his interest based rights account of animal ethics in 2013 he edited a special section in journal global policy entitled international animal protection section included articles by philosopher oscar horta environmental law scholar stuart r harrop and animal law scholar steven white with an introduction by cochrane he also contributed to inaugural issue of journal law ethics and philosophy as a part of a symposium on sue donaldson and will kymlicka s zoopolis cochrane s paper argued for a cosmozoopolis a cosmopolitan alternative to donaldson and kymlicka s proposal for a zoopolis a picture of a mixed human nonhuman animal state with group differentiated political rights for nonhuman animals a reply to cochrane s piece as well as other contribution by horta from donaldson and kymlicka was also included in 2014 he was named a bbc radio 3 new generation thinker for his work on animal rights cochrane s third book sentientist politics will be released by oxford university press in 2018 book addresses topic of animal rights and global justice covering questions of cross border obligations to nonhuman animals and idea of international politics taking rights of all sentient beings seriously research cochrane has research interests in animal ethics bioethics environmental ethics rights theory and human rights as well as contemporary political theory more broadly he is a leading figure in what garner calls political turn in animal ethics though precisely what this means is disputed garner robert forthcoming political animals and animal politics palgrave macmillan animal ethics series environmental values similarly tony milligan characterises cochrane as a key figure in political turn in animal rights while ahlhaus and peter niesen identify a discipline of animal politics of which cochrane s work is a major part separate from animal ethics literature to which these authors variously refer explores relationships of humans and nonhuman animals from perspective of normative political theory cochrane has himself writing with garner and siobhan o sullivan explored nature of political turn cochrane garner and o sullivan argue both that new literature is importantly unified and that it is distinct from more traditional approaches to animal ethics presenting focus on justice as key feature they write that crucial and distinctive feature of these contributions and what can properly be said to mark them out as a political turn is way in which they imagine how political institutions structures and processes might be transformed so as to secure justice for both human and nonhuman animals interest based rights approach cochrane advocates interest based rights approach to animal rights which he distinguishes from intrinsic value approach of tom regan and relational account of donaldson and kymlicka rights set limits on what can be done even in pursuit of well being cochrane suggests that rights should be grounded in interests and follows joseph raz s formulation that x has a right if and only if x can have rights and other things being equal an aspect of x s well being his interest is a sufficient reason for holding some other person s to be under a duty cochrane draws out several aspects of this account which serves as basis of analysis in his animal rights without liberation and elsewhere first interests must be sufficient to give grounds for holding another to be under a duty judging this entails considering strength of an interest as well as all other considerations so for example individuals may have a very strong interest in free expression but all things considered this fact does not necessitate protection of slander greater interest of victim of slander can outweigh interest in free expression and so context is important this is difference between prima facie rights and concrete rights former exist on an abstract level outside of particular circumstances prima facie rights can translate into concrete rights when considered in particular situations but they do not always as free expression example illustrates account is for moral rights and cochrane s normative claims are intended to form part of a democratic informing and persuading political communities strength of an interest is determined by a consideration of value of something to an individual though this is not understood purely subjectively and relationship between individual at this time and individual when he or she has interest satisfied see personal identity sentient animals cochrane argues possess significant interests in not being made to suffer and in not being killed and so have a prima facie right not to be made to suffer and a prima facie right not to be killed whether these prima facie rights translate into concrete rights depends on situation in question cochrane explores consequences of account in his animal rights without liberation arguing that with very few exceptions nonhuman animals have a concrete rights not to be killed or made to suffer in animal testing animal agriculture in entertainment for environmental purposes and in cultural practices despite this because cochrane does not posit a right against use for nonhuman animals his account is highly permissive when contrasted with other animal rights accounts in a 2016 article cochrane extended his interest based rights approach to include labour rights for nonhuman animals on basis that working animals are members of our society and workers these rights include a right to representation in a union a right to just and favourable remuneration a right to safe and healthy conditions of work and a right to time off from work in his interest based rights approach cochrane draws upon a number of normative theories but most particularly utilitarianism and liberalism and framework has been presented by commentators as a possible middle ground between rights theory of regan and utilitarian account offered by peter singer cochrane is not first theorist to advocate an interest based account of animal rights garner identifies joel feinberg james rachels and steve as three philosophers who have previously used language of interest rights while cochrane identifies r g frey and regan as two others who have addressed possibility interest based approaches to animal ethics have become significant in recent academic literature milligan identifies a strong emphasis upon animal interests but in context of a rights theory rather than a singer style as one of key components of political turn liberty thesis thumb right robert garner pictured criticises cochrane for underestimating force of argument from marginal cases in his claims about liberty but nonetheless suggests that an account of animal rights without a right to freedom could make significant progress for nonhuman animals cochrane s liberty thesis is that nonhuman animals with possible exception of some great apes and cetaceans do not have an intrinsic interest in freedom nonetheless cochrane claims nonhuman animals may often have an extrinsic interest in freedom this is because restricting a nonhuman animal s freedom may result in its suffering and regardless of their interest in freedom sentient animals possess an interest in not suffering schmidt summarises cochrane s argument as following p1 to have a moral right to freedom one needs to have a sufficient intrinsic interest in freedom p2 to have a sufficient and intrinsic interest in freedom implies that freedom by itself contributes to a person s wellbeing p3 only in case of autonomous persons does freedom contribute by itself to their wellbeing because only for autonomous persons does undermine ability to frame and pursue their own conception of good p4 non human animals are not autonomous persons c1 therefore freedom does not by itself contribute to wellbeing of non human animals c2 therefore non human animals do not have an intrinsic interest in freedom c3 therefore non human animals do not have a moral right to freedom though cochrane argues that nonhuman animals are not victim of an injustice simply because they are owned he claims that ownership of an animal must be understood as not entailing absolute control over said animal he owned animals as individual sentient creatures with interests of their own in understanding owned animals in this way he challenges alternative accounts that frame owned animals variously as living artifacts slaves co citizens or beings who have strategically situated themselves alongside humans in animal rights without liberation cochrane argues that there is nothing intrinsically wrong with using or owning animals and so as long as their interests are respected there is nothing intrinsically wrong with using them for example in scientific tests or for agricultural purposes ahlhaus and niesen characterise book as a whole as a critique of singer s animal liberation saying that former explores latter s undeclared premise that liberation is what animals want or need schmidt criticises cochrane s liberty thesis on grounds that nonhuman animals may have a non specific instrumental interest in freedom meaning that although freedom is not intrinsically valuable for these animals it may be that they can achieve other things that are intrinsically valuable only through possessing freedom thus cochrane s thesis underestimates value that freedom could have for nonhuman animals hadley criticises cochrane s non pragmatic approach arguing that cochrane as an animal advocate is wrong to deny that nonhuman animals possess an intrinsic interest in freedom hadley links freedom to value of nonhuman animals arguing that latter can be undermined by arguing against former garner criticises cochrane s thesis on grounds that cochrane has garner claims underestimated weight of argument from marginal cases to extent that cochrane s argument works for nonhuman animals garner suggests it will also work for many humans leading to counter intuitive consequences garner ties autonomy not merely to liberty but also life which means that cochrane s argument would imply that some humans have less of an interest in life than others nonetheless garner argues that cochrane s liberty thesis is not destructive of animal rights and that animal rights positions can still make claims of significance without endorsing claim that nonhuman animal use is in itself problematic indeed merely a right against suffering garner suggests could go a long way towards achieving abolitionist goal of end of animal industry all three authors praise cochrane for drawing attention to previously under examined issue abolitionist theorist jason wyckoff draws attention to cochrane s argument that nonhuman animals do not have an interest in not being owned he cochrane s argument as follows 1 possession understood as restriction of freedom is something to which we do not object across board even in case of human children so there is no across board objection to possession when case involves animals 2 non lethal use of animals that does not cause suffering is consistent with full respect for interests of those animals provided that those animals are not treated exclusively as means to human ends 3 at least some of animals including sales are consistent with full respect for those animals interests provided that transfer does not cause suffering 4 rights to possess use and transfer items are at core of our concept of property 5 therefore property status of animals is compatible with full respect for interests of animals he claims that cochrane s argument is invalid because it assumes that nonhuman animals are harmed by being owned only if they are killed or have suffering inflicted on them and because it assumes that ownership is permissible when it does not compromise interests of particular owned animal both of these assumptions are false claim wyckoff as though instances of possession use and transfer may possibly not violate interests of an individual systematic treatment of that individual as kind of entity that can be possessed used and transferred constructs that entity and others like it or him or her as an object and when that entity is a moral patient with interests that construction as an object subordinates interests of that patient and similar patients to those who benefit from objectification of individual philosopher friederike schmitz draws upon wyckoff s argument in her challenge to cochrane arguing that it is necessary not only to consider whether ownership will harm animals in particular cases but to explore effects of institution of animal ownership international animal rights thumb left as an alternative to zoopolis of will kymlicka pictured and sue donaldson cochrane argues for a cosmozoopolis some of cochrane s research concerns animal rights from an international or cosmopolitan perspective as an alternative to donaldson and kymlicka s proposal for a zoopolis cochrane proposes a cosmozoopolis drawing upon cosmopolitan theory zoopolis picture cochrane suggests unfairly elevates interests of nonhuman citizens over other nonhuman animals even though these other animals may have comparable interests and in offering sovereignty to free living animals denies importance of nonhuman animal mobility ahlhaus and niesen consider cochrane s criticism of donaldson and kymlicka valuable but question extent to which his cosmozoopolis picture is compatible with his liberty thesis donaldson and kymlicka offer a defence of their zoopolis picture against cochrane s criticism affirming importance of nonhuman animals interests in their territory and legitimacy of offering benefits to members of particular societies denied to non members despite this they say that citing cochrane s cosmozoopolis picture as an example one of their aims is to inspire people to develop alternative political theories of animal rights to their own cochrane is of view that a lack of a clear focused and coherent set of international standards and policies for animal protection is an important contributing factor to gulf between theoretical and legal valuation of nonhuman animals and their treatment around world with steve cooke he argues that it is theoretically acceptable drawing upon simon caney s account of just war for states to go to war to protect nonhuman animals nonetheless pair argue that it will almost never be acceptable in practice other research cochrane is critical of use of claims about dignity in debates about genetic engineering of nonhuman animals in questions about use of nonhuman animals in human entertainment and in bioethics literature he holds that nonhuman animals do not possess an interest against being treated in undignified ways and endorses undignified bioethics bioethics without concept of dignity cochrane has sympathy for standard criticisms of dignity in bioethics that concept is indeterminate reactionary and redundant and in a 2010 paper defends these criticisms against counter claims from those who endorse various understandings of dignity bioethicist de melo martin responded to cochrane s article claiming that problems cochrane identifies are problems with common understandings of concepts of dignity not with concepts themselves and arguing that cochrane s conclusion leads to a conception of bioethics almost devoid of ethics recent literature exploring bioethical questions from a human rights perspective has been criticised on grounds that human rights theory contains unresolved problems bioethicists have claimed that bioethical inquiry can contribute to resolving these problems cochrane claims that this contribution to human rights literature offers three insights but that these are not entirely original these insights are questions about institutional fairness rights as trumps and rights as solely belonging to humans cochrane holds that human rights should be reconceptualised as sentient rights grounding of human rights he claims are not distinct from grounding of human obligations to nonhuman animals and attempts to distinguish human rights from rights of other sentient beings ultimately fail cochrane has also published work on environmental ethics and punishment concerning latter he argues building upon thomas mathiesen s claim that prison is not justified by classic theories of punishment that institution cannot be justified on basis of antony duff s communicative account of punishment select bibliography books cochrane alasdair 2018 sentientist politics oxford oxford university press cochrane alasdair 2012 animal rights without liberation new york columbia university
