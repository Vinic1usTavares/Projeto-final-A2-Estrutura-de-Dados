richelieu class were fast battleships built for french navy between 1930s and 1950s initially two ships were ordered in 1935 in response to italian orders for s previous year richelieus were based on preceding but scaled up to accommodate more powerful guns and armor to protect them from guns of same caliber to keep ships within displacement limits imposed by washington naval treaty they featured same concentrated arrangement as dunkerques for main battery two quadruple gun turrets placed forward they also incorporated new more compact boilers that allowed for a shorter hull which required less heavy armor for desired top speed after germany ordered two s france responded with another pair of richelieus but built to modified designs first clemenceau received modified secondary and anti aircraft batteries while gascogne had her superfiring main battery turret shifted aft along with other changes none of members of class had been completed by outbreak of world war ii was finished shortly before french defeat in battle of france while was hurriedly prepared to be ready to go to sea during campaign both vessels fled to french colonies in africa richelieu steamed to dakar and jean bart went to casablanca work on clemenceau and gascogne stopped after germans occupied france in mid 1940 richelieu was attacked twice and damaged by british forces attempting to coerce crew to defect to free france while jean bart was badly damaged by american forces during operation torch in november 1942 after french african colonies shifted to free french control richelieu was taken to united states to be repaired and modernized while jean bart was not completed richelieu saw active service with british home fleet in early 1944 before being transferred to eastern fleet later that year there she took part in numerous operations against japanese forces in indian ocean she was present for japanese surrender of singapore at end of war after war richelieu took part in initial campaign to restore control of french indochina before returning to france where she saw limited activity into early 1950s during this period french navy discussed proposals to complete jean bart or convert her into an aircraft carrier ultimately settling on former she was finally commissioned in 1955 thereafter taking part in french intervention in suez crisis in november 1956 her career proved to be a short one and she was placed in reserve in 1957 both vessels were used as training and barracks ships into 1960s richelieu was sold to ship breakers in 1968 and jean bart followed her in 1970 design thumb left earlier battleship which provided basis for richelieu design in early 1930s french navy began construction of two small s in response to german s italian regia marina royal navy france s other major naval rival announced on 11 june 1935 that it would begin building two battleships of in response to dunkerques italian ships were to be armed with nine guns significantly more powerful than eight guns of french ships in order to maintain parity french realized that similar vessels would be required to counter new italian ships at time battleship construction was governed by washington naval treaty which limited displacement to 35 000 tons and gun armament to thumb left recognition drawing of construction of which prompted french response with richelieu french naval command issued specifications for a new battleship design in response to on 24 july less than two weeks after italian ships were announced new ships would be built to maximum washington limits 35 000 tons displacement and a battery of eight guns of either 380 mm or 406 mm vessels would also carry a secondary battery of dual purpose guns be capable of a speed of and carry belt armor that was thick vice amiral vice admiral georges durand viel chief of staff of french navy favored using basic dunkerque design scaled up to account for increases in displacement armament and armor to reduce amount of time needed to design ship dunkerques had adopted an unusual arrangement of main battery that grouped all eight guns in a pair of four gun turrets placed forward of superstructure in a superfiring pair initial studies by design staff quickly demonstrated that a battery of 406 mm guns would be impossible if other characteristics would be fulfilled within allotted displacement six proposals were submitted on 27 november first project 1 was a scaled up dunkerque while project 2 3 and 4 were variations on that design with main battery arrangements based on british mounting three turrets forward of superstructure project 2 used one twin and two triple turrets project 3 incorporated one quadruple and two twin turrets while project 4 used three triple turrets two related variants project 5 and 5 bis adopted an even more unusual arrangement featuring two quadruple turrets placed amidships between fore and aft superstructures inspired by ideas of italian admiral vincenzo de feo secondary armament for designs amounted to twelve guns in quadruple turrets as on dunkerques all six designs were overweight and last two were quickly rejected since their layout significantly limited firing arc of main battery naval command quickly settled on project 1 as it had most balanced combination of speed and combat power offensively and defensively that could realistically be achieved within displacement constraints imposed by washington treaty and existing french shipyard facilities but concerns over perceived lightness of secondary battery compared to foreign capital ships led command to request studies for a new secondary battery despite fact that this would preclude possibility of using dual purpose guns designers submitted two options five triple or four triple turrets with a heavy anti aircraft battery of guns five turret variant would include six of 75 mm guns while four turret version would add two of 75 mm weapons these proposals presented several problems first anti aircraft guns were sensitive to blast effects from main and secondary batteries which would require additional space that was not available and second project 1 design was already overweight and added guns would increase displacement even further naval command ultimately decided on 14 april 1935 that new dual purpose mounts for 152 mm guns would have to be developed weight problem was solved by adopting a new type of boiler designated sural short for pressure fired these boilers were much more compact than type used in dunkerque class and richelieus had a wider beam allowing three boilers side by side instead of just two so boiler rooms could be reduced from three to two with total machinery space shortened considerably since machinery spaces required heavy armor protection this reduced length of hull that needed to be covered by armor belt by almost belt was also decreased in thickness from 360 mm to 330 mm though angle of inclination was increased to compensate for reduction coupled with minor reductions in armor elsewhere in ship these changes offset weight of 152 mm battery and brought displacement within washington limits work on design proceeded quickly and on 14 august navy placed orders for first two ships and despite fact that both vessels remained within displacement limits when construction of richelieu began in october france had violated washington treaty treaty had included a moratorium on new battleship construction that was extended by london naval treaty of 1930 which france had signed but not ratified though france and italy had secured an exception to allow them to build up to of new battleships as their fleets were older than those of other signatories combined with two dunkerques richelieu brought total french construction program to and when jean bart was laid down in december 1936 total rose to britain objected to construction program but france dismissed them by pointing out that britain had unilaterally signed anglo german naval agreement earlier in 1935 effectively abrogating disarmament clauses of treaty of versailles that had severely constrained size and effectiveness of german fleet from french perspective if britain would cavalierly strengthen france s enemy french would similarly disregard their own treaty obligations in favor of self defense general characteristics thumb left side plan of ship upright 2 5 by time first vessel was completed richelieu class ships displaced standard and fully loaded they were long between perpendiculars and were long overall they had a beam of and a maximum draft of because compact sural boilers allowed machinery spaces to be shortened ships featured a very compact superstructure this in turn allowed for a long forecastle that significantly improved seakeeping and helped to keep bow dry in heavier seas ships superstructure was fairly minimal it featured a single tower mast directly behind armored conning tower along with a small deck house directly aft of funnel their crew numbered 1 569 officers and men though this changed considerably over course of their careers particularly as their anti aircraft batteries were revised they carried a number of small boats including eight motor boats a pair of motor launches three motor pinnaces two whale boats two dinghies and two small flat bottomed boats compact superstructure also allowed for aviation facilities of ships to be expanded compared to dunkerques a long quarterdeck housed a pair of catapults and a long hangar that could accommodate two loire 130 seaplanes with their wings folded with a third carried on top of hangar two more aircraft would be carried ready to launch on catapults catapults were offset en echelon with starboard mount further forward than that on port side a large crane was used to recover aircraft after they landed in sea near ship and when not in use it could be folded flat machinery thumb diagram showing arrangement of boilers brown turbines pink and turbo generators dark gray richelieu class ships were powered by four parsons geared steam turbines and six oil fired sural water tube boilers manufactured by indret for richelieu and by penhoet and ac de la loire for jean bart sural boilers were experimental and were thus a major risk to take with what were to be most powerful capital ships of french fleet they nevertheless proved to be generally reliable in service like dunkerques richelieus used unit system of machinery for their propulsion system which split machinery into two separate systems three boilers were placed in one boiler room followed by forward engine room that housed pair of turbines that drove outer pair of propellers next astern was a second boiler room followed by a second engine room which powered inner

provided by four turbo generators and three diesel generators with a pair of diesel generators for emergency backup power turbo generators provided power while ship was underway and two were placed in engine room 1 while other pair were their own compartment aft of propulsion machinery main diesel generators were housed in their own compartment between magazines for main battery turrets and they

a single hit turrets allowed elevation to 35 degrees which provided a maximum range of guns could depress to 5 degrees loading could be accomplished at any angle and owing to heavy propellant charges rate of fire was relatively slow at 1 3 shot per minute their secondary armament was to have consisted of fifteen 55 mle 1930 guns mounted in five mle 1936 triple turrets three of which were arranged

cruisers with improved elevation to 90 degrees to allow them to engage aerial targets turrets suffered from serious problems that limited their effectiveness including slow elevation and training

surface targets guns had a range of they were supplied with a total of 3 600 semi ap and high explosive rounds former for surface targets and latter for use against aircraft as designed light anti aircraft battery was to have consisted of automatic guns in twin mle 1935 mounts but these were not ready by 1939 and so two amidships 152 mm turrets were replaced with a group of twelve 45 mle 1930 anti aircraft guns in twin turrets these were dual purpose guns but were outfitted primarily with time fused shells for anti aircraft defense as 152 mm guns were expected to fulfill close range anti ship role since automatic 37 mm guns were not available eight 37 mm mle 1925 semi automatic guns in four twin mounts were added these light guns were complemented with a battery of twenty four machine guns in six quadruple mounts fire control systems control for ships armament relied on five main directors three of them were mounted on foremast on top of each other with other two aft one for secondary guns atop funnel in a mack type arrangement and other for main battery atop a deck house directors for main battery were fitted with a stereoscopic rangefinder in foremast position and an rangefinder in aft position while both turrets were fitted with their own 14 m rangefinder for operations under local control two upper directors for secondary battery on foremast had 8 and rangefinders while mack director also had a 6 m rangefinder each secondary turret had its own 8 m rangefinder a pair of rangefinders for use by an admiral s flag staff were installed on sponsons in conning tower directors gathered range and bearing data on targets and transmitted it to a central processing station that fed instructions to gun crews protection thumb upright diagram of side armor

belt was inclined at from vertical to increase its effectiveness against long range fire and it was backed with of teak planking it consisted of a single strake of armor plate that was tall of which was above waterline at its lower edge belt tapered to main armored deck was over machinery spaces and increased to over magazines backed by a layer of steel plating lower armor deck was thick on flat

protected by of armor plate on faces on sides on roofs and on rears of forward turret and on superfiring one barbettes that supported turrets had thick armor above main deck and reduced to below secondary battery turrets had 130 mm faces sides and roofs and rears their barbettes were 100 mm thick conning tower had thick sides a rear and 170 mm on roof tower mast was covered with light plating that was thick to protect it from strafing attacks while fire control directors received of plating ships underwater protection system was based on system used in dunkerque class void between armor belt and outer hull plating was filled with a rubber based compound referred to as ebonite mousse material was used to absorb impact of an explosion and prevent water from flooding uncontrollably behind this compartment there was a bulkhead that was thick compartment created between this bulkhead and ebonite mousse was used to store fuel oil in peacetime but was kept empty in combat conditions further inboard a torpedo bulkhead would contain blast effects of a torpedo or mine detonation this bulkhead was increased to abreast of secondary magazines and forward main battery turret as narrowing hull reduced total width of underwater protection system additional ebonite mousse was placed between torpedo bulkhead and fuel tanks for additional flooding control compound was also used in compartments on either end of transverse bulkheads to ensure that central citadel remained watertight clemenceau and gascogne variants by 1937 tensions in europe had increased significantly as germany and italy took increasingly aggressive positions raising likelihood of war in near future german naval construction was at that time directed against france two s had been laid down to counter dunkerques and two s had been ordered to match two richelieus since two french battleships had been ordered in response to expanding italian fleet french naval command determined that another pair of battleships would be needed to balance bismarcks two ships were authorized on 2 may 1938 under names clemenceau and gascogne but delays in construction program owing to a shortage of dockyards large enough to handle additional hulls of this size allowed time for additional design studies at request of naval command command wanted to compare their new ships with latest foreign contemporaries they noted that all other battleships carried their main armament forward and aft and several of them used dedicated high and low angle guns for their secondary batteries 130 mm dual purpose guns used on dunkerques were proving to be troublesome in service and command wanted to determine whether arrangement would be suitable for future construction vice amiral francois darlan who had by now replaced durand viel as chief of staff issued a request for studies on 2 december 1937 with requirements that proposals be based on richelieu design armed with eight or nine 380 mm guns in quadruple or triple turrets equipped with a secondary battery of 152 mm or 130 mm dual purpose guns or a mixed battery of 152 mm and 100 mm guns and with armor on same scale as richelieu a series of proposals were submitted ranging from effective repeats of richelieu design with minor improvements project a series to plans that shifted superfiring main battery turret aft of superstructure project b series to nine gun variants that kept two triple turrets forward and a third aft project c series all three basic formats included several variations that incorporated changes to composition and arrangement of secondary and anti aircraft batteries project c variants all displaced close to and thus were not seriously considered as they exceeded displacement limits by a wide margin designers submitted a and b variants to darlan on 19 march 1938 and he chose one version of each for clemenceau and gascogne respectively as a result former would retain basic richelieu layout while latter would adopt an arrangement with one main battery turret shifted aft both variants necessitated significant changes to arrangement of other equipment including light anti aircraft batteries and aviation facilities but gascogne required much more radical work rest of naval command preferred b version adopted for gascogne and questioned why darlan had approved a variant for clemenceau he stated that he hoped to be able to lay down third richelieu class ship in late 1938 and that necessary redesign work for hull interior that b variant required would delay construction by twelve months at a minimum command concurred and authorization for next ship was issued on 24 august clemenceau specifications most significant change to design for clemenceau was to arrangement of secondary and anti aircraft batteries number of triple 152 mm turrets was reduced to four with two amidships wing turrets and two turrets on centerline aft of superstructure though number of guns was reduced new arrangement actually secured same broadside as three turrets could still be brought to bear to either side of ship in an effort to keep displacement from growing too much belt armor was reduced to hangar would have to be shortened to accommodate centerline arrangement of 152 mm guns but hangar would also be widened to allow two aircraft to be stored side by side thus preserving same complement as richelieu reduction in weight achieved by removal of one of these turrets allowed for adoption of new dual purpose 100 mm mle 1937 autocannon six of these twin mounts were to be installed around forward superstructure four abreast rear superstructure and two between conning tower and main battery these were same guns that had been adopted for richelieu during construction but mounts were new fully enclosed gun turrets compared to open mounts aboard earlier vessel six new 37 mm acad twin mounts would be added to supplement 100 mm guns four of these would be placed a deck higher and further inboard than 100 mm guns aft and other two would be placed on either side of superfiring main turret these guns proved to be problematic during development owing to excessive barrel wear that resulted from its very high muzzle velocity and weight of projectile efforts to correct problem had delayed adoption of this gun for earlier richelieus and it never actually entered service apart from a prototype installed on aviso additional fire control directors were installed for new guns to keep design delays to a minimum internal compartments were kept as similar to richelieu as possible existing magazines for 152 mm guns were modified to store ammunition for 100 mm and 37 mm guns standard displacement was kept at 35 000 tons to comply with washington treaty limits but full load displacement increased slightly to owing to additional anti aircraft guns ship was in most respects identical to her half sisters with same dimensions and propulsion system main battery and armor layout increases to her anti aircraft armament brought her crew up to a total of 1 670 officers and men gascogne specifications gascogne represented a much more radical redesign superfiring main battery turret was moved to quarterdeck with three secondary turrets moved to centerline two superfired over forward main battery turret and third superfired aft rearranging primary and secondary batteries had several benefits most significantly freeing up sides of ship for anti aircraft battery where they would be further from blast effects of larger guns it also allowed all around fire for main and secondary batteries as opposed to other designs that had a fairly wide blind arc astern for main guns but it also presented problems for design staff since superstructure would have to be moved forward to have enough space aft for main battery turret and magazine which then required extensive redesign of hull to move machinery spaces and keep a proper trim it also forced aviation facilities to be completely redesigned as aft main turret occupied space that had previously housed hangar designers eventually settled on solution that american battleship designers had adopted using an internal hangar in hull with a crane to lift aircraft onto a single catapult only three aircraft could be stored with this system however two in hangar and one on catapult ship would carry nc 420 floatplane which had been developed to replace loire 130 another major effect of main battery rearrangement was need to lengthen belt armor which necessitated alterations to keep displacement in check compartment filled with ebonite mousse was shortened and partially converted to fuel storage secondary turrets received thicker armor protection as compensation for reduction in number of guns though increases were limited by power of motors that operated turrets displacement was reduced slightly construction shipnamesakebuilderlaid jean cardinal du plessis de de october january july 1940 vichy france 10 october 1943 free french

increasingly likely in 1939 and she was completed just days before germans won battle of france in june 1940 ship still missing most of its anti aircraft guns fled to dakar in french west africa to keep her under french control there she came under repeated british attacks that had been intended to either compel battleship to join free french naval forces or sink her first during operation catapult in july 1940 centered on attacks by fairey swordfish torpedo bombers that scored one torpedo hit but did not do serious damage second attack resulting in battle of dakar followed in september and involved a planned landing of free french forces to seize colony a pair of british battleships and attacked ship at long range though fire from richelieu and nearby coastal batteries kept british at bay until submarine torpedoed and badly damaged resolution forcing british to withdraw richelieu had been hit once in battle and more importantly for her state of readiness three of her main battery guns had exploded from faulty shells during action after allied invasion of north africa in november 1942 that resulted in defection of significant parts of french overseas empire richelieu was transferred to free french control she was sent to united states for permanent repairs and modernization to bring ship up to latest american and british standards including a powerful anti aircraft battery of fifty six bofors guns and forty eight oerlikon autocannon though us navy refused to share its most advanced radars with french after completing overhaul and modernization ship served with british home fleet in early 1944 there she served as part of force guarding against german battleship that threatened convoy lanes to soviet union she saw no action during this period as german fleet remained in port largely result of crippling fuel shortages thumb richelieu astern of during operation bishop in april she was transferred to reinforce eastern fleet for operations against japanese in indian ocean these included escorting british and american aircraft carriers as they struck japanese facilities in occupied dutch east indies and several bombardment operations that revealed problems with excessive shell dispersion from her main battery guns during this period she was present for operations cockpit transom pedal and crimson ship returned to france for a refit in late 1944 that also included installation of more advanced radar sets she arrived back in indian ocean in january 1945 for further operations in area including operations sunfish bishop and dukedom latter an attempt to ambush and destroy a japanese heavy cruiser and destroyer in may that resulted in battle of malacca strait richelieu was too far away to engage japanese ships before they were sunk by other vessels richelieu then went to south africa for another refit and by time this was completed in mid august japan had surrendered ending war richelieu was part of force that liberated singapore and other parts of dutch east indies following official japanese surrender in september during which she detonated a magnetic mine but suffered little damage she thereafter operated in french indochina as part of initial effort to restore french colonial rule there she provided fire support to french forces fighting in colony during operation recalled to france in december 1945 she was repaired and modernized slightly in 1946 testing determined cause of shell dispersion issue and modifications were made to turrets to delay outer guns by 60 milliseconds which corrected problem ship saw relatively limited peacetime training in immediate postwar years and in 1952 she was removed from active service for use as a gunnery training ship in 1956 she was placed in reserve and was thereafter used as a stationary training vessel and barracks ship until 1967 when french navy decided to discard her sold for scrap in 1968 she was broken up in italy from 1968 to 1969 jean bart thumb left jean bart under repair in casablanca january 1943 jean bart had only recently been launched by beginning of battle of france in may 1940 so shipyard focused as much effort on getting ship ready for sea as possible workers focused on installing turbines and boilers to allow her to get underway with german forces approaching saint nazaire jean bart was rushed through a hastily dredged channel to escape via atlantic ocean south to casablanca by that time she had only one of her main turrets installed along with a handful of anti aircraft guns some of which had been scrounged from another vessel in harbor shell handling equipment and ammunition hoists were not completed for main battery and only usable guns were three 37 mm and six of 13 2 mm mounts after being attacked and hit once but not seriously damaged by german heinkel 111 bombers while en route ship reached casablanca with an escort of two destroyers on 22 june while in casablanca french attempted to prepare ship for action as much as was possible in light of limited infrastructure and lack of many necessary parts to complete vessel facilities there were not capable of completing second main battery turret nor were germans interested in allowing needed armor plates and guns to be shipped there instead to protect ship s interior french covered open barbette with concrete empty secondary barbettes received same coverings a makeshift fire control director was installed in 1941 but it proved to be unreliable and so an ad hoc director system was set up using shore based observation points to triangulate targets for main battery her anti aircraft armament was slowly strengthened as guns became available and a search radar was fitted in 1942 unlike her sister jean bart was not targeted by british forces during this period in november american and british forces invaded french north africa in operation torch jean bart initially helped to resist attack engaging in a gunnery duel with american battleship and heavy cruisers on first day of invasion hit several times by shells from massachusetts one of which jammed her operational turret jean bart was nevertheless not seriously damaged and unknown to americans her main battery remained in operation after damaged armor plate was cut away later that day next morning after engaging american heavy cruiser at long range jean bart came under heavy air attack from american dive bombers and was badly damaged by a pair of bombs she sank by stern in shallow harbor but her guns remained serviceable thumb jean bart passing through suez canal in 1956 following defection of french forces in region to allied side french attempted to have ship completed in united states they submitted proposals to complete vessel to modified designs including one with as many as thirty four 38 caliber dual purpose guns for use as an anti aircraft battleship but requests came to nothing as us navy had no interest in project by that stage of war american and british fleets had a more than sufficient number of modern battleships for their purposes and american shipyards available would not have been able to manufacture necessary parts jean bart was accordingly repaired as much as possible in casablanca though this work was hampered by fact that french shipyards were either still under german occupation or had been wrecked during war nevertheless shipyard workers had repaired her hull damage by september 1943 and she spent rest of war as a training ship in mediterranean sea in 1945 discussions as to fate of ship considered converting her into an aircraft carrier finishing her as a battleship or discarding her altogether since carrier conversion would have produced a mediocre vessel at great expense and effort decision was ultimately made to finish her as a battleship a process that took several years most work on ship was completed by 1955 when she formally entered active service and she conducted two overseas cruises to visit denmark and united states shortly thereafter she took part in french intervention in suez crisis in november 1956 including a brief four shot bombardment of port said reduced to reserve in august 1957 she was used as a barracks ship until 1961 she remained unused in french navy s inventory until 1970 when she was struck from naval register and sold for scrap clemenceau and gascogne clemenceau was laid down on 17 january 1939 at no 4 dock in brest directly after richelieu had been launched from that dock earlier that day owing to increased tensions with germany work on ship was expedited and she was slated to be launched in 1941 with completion projected for late 1943 on 28 september 1939 work was halted temporarily as french had begun large scale mobilization for war with germany which reduced available workforce what men were available were allocated to richelieu since she was nearing completion shipyard resumed work on 6 december during phony war but progress was slow and only 10 percent of hull a length of about had been assembled by 10 june when work again halted in wake of german victories when german forces approached brest shipyard workers flooded drydock ship was seized by germans renamed r battleship r with consideration briefly given to completing ship but shortages of materials and shipyard workers rendered it an unrealistic project hull was floated out in 1941 so slipway could be used for other purposes according to historians john jordan and robert dumas hull was then moored in front of u boat pen in brest though henri le masson states that she was towed to landevennec in roadstead of brest allied bombers sank hulk on 27 august 1944 and after war navy placed wreck for sale on 23 february 1948 there were no buyers so navy refloated vessel to clear harbor bottom and while under tow it broke in half and sank again salvors eventually purchased wreck on 1 august 1951 gascogne was never laid down as she had to wait until jean bart was launched by which time war had begun orders for material had been placed in june 1939 but further work was stopped on 28 september before restarting on 12 april 1940 approximately six percent of hull materials had been manufactured by 1 june with a view toward laying ship down at some point in following months with a projected launching in 1942 and completion by june 1944 but events of june 1940 of course precluded any work being started footnotes notes citations references category battleship classes
