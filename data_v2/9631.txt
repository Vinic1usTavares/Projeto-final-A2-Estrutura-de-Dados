national liberation army unla as a result ugandan government was deposed and replaced by a new one under nra leader yoweri museveni in 1981 museveni initiated an insurgency in uganda against government which was controlled by uganda national liberation front unlf he soon joined nascent national resistance movement nrm and took control of its armed wing nra in 1985 nra inflicted several key defeats on unlf s armed wing unla leaving ugandan capital kampala vulnerable to attack feeling pressured unlf government led by president tito okello pursued negotiations with nrm resulting peace agreement failed to end conflict and okello amassed a large force of unla troops and allied militias to garrison kampala in preparation for an attack though its effectiveness was weakened by low morale internal friction and subterfuge on 17 january 1986 nra began advancing on kampala they managed to occupy territory around city but unla stemmed their advance by placing an artillery battery at a strategic roundabout on 24 january unla withdrew its battery and nra began its main attack on following day nra besieged several unla installations in kampala and by evening had secured republic house unla headquarters on 26 january nra captured radio uganda but 1 000 unla troops from entebbe broke through a roadblock and began advancing towards city museveni and his chief of staff salim saleh redeployed their forces to counter threat in process opening a gap in their cordon around kampala and allowing many unla troops to escape okello fled in a helicopter and flew to sudan in evening an nra battalion ambushed unla troops advancing from entebbe while a company moved to attack their rear forcing them to capitulate and ending battle on 29 january museveni was sworn in as president of uganda unla attempted to regroup in northern uganda but collapsed in following months after being subject to further nra attacks background in april 1979 tanzanian forces and uganda national liberation army unla a coalition of armed rebel groups united under uganda national liberation front unlf deposed president of uganda idi amin a new unlf government was installed but it was weak and exercised little control over country this was in part due to unlf s and its army s own internal divisions several hundred strong kikosi maalum group was loyal to milton obote who had served as president before amin took power yoweri museveni controlled front for national salvation which had about 3 000 members over time power shifted to pro obote elements in government and army obote assumed power in 1980 through a disputed election and ruled through repressive methods including incarceration and killing of dissidents in february 1981 museveni and a small band of rebels began attacking unla forces initiating ugandan bush war shortly thereafter a new rebel coalition was organised as national resistance movement nrm museveni was made vice chairman of national resistance council group s political body and chairman of high command of national resistance army nra movement s armed organ by july 1985 nra had been largely defeated and pushed out of its strongholds and museveni retired to sweden on 27 july several officers of unla launched a coup which overthrew president obote general tito okello assumed power in his place new regime was weak and unstable and okello made overtures to anti obote rebel groups to form a coalition government and end fighting coup upset many lango soldiers which constituted second largest ethnic group in unla and were loyal to obote nrm was highly critical of new government and accused unla of committing atrocities unlf conscious of its weakening political position nevertheless pursued negotiations with nrm museveni took advantage of disruption caused by coup to return to east africa and rebuild nra in august nra launched a series of co ordinated attacks that resulted in capture of significant amounts of territory in central and western uganda in late september nra laid siege to unla troops in provincial centre of masaka and soon thereafter town of mbarara both key urban areas in southern uganda in october museveni warned that in event of failure negotiations ongoing between nrm and unlf in nairobi nra would take kampala by force on 3 december okello s government released a document allegedly seized from nra which carried an order from museveni to nra chief of staff salim saleh to prepare to attack ugandan capital kampala if a peace agreement did not materialise nrm did not comment on disclosure on 10 december masaka s garrison surrendered to nra on 17 december unlf and nrm concluded talks and signed nairobi peace agreement accord nominally ended war and declared okello and museveni president and vice president of uganda respectively and required of kampala until a new army could be established it also carried a provision which stipulated that one belligerent could disregard agreement if other was found to be violating human rights nrm accused unla of failing to respect ugandans rights and nra continued fighting on 31 december unlf government accused nra of failing to uphold its terms of peace agreement by launching attacks impeding flow of food to mbarara garrison and refraining from nominating representatives to coordinate further peace measures with government unla forces at mbarara capitulated soon thereafter prelude following their victories nra was able to greatly expand its manpower and gained access to important military equipment in contrast unla s remaining forces were increasingly suffering from defections low morale and internal divisions along ethnic lines nra s success at masaka and mbarara also solidified their control of centre and south western sections of country and left kampala vulnerable to attack to take advantage of its improving military situation nra high command decided to launch an offensive to capture city saleh drew up plans of attack about 9 600 fighters were allocated for this operation many of which were unla defectors from masaka garrison at same time nra s 9th and 19th battalions blocked hoima road so that unla units which were still active in northern uganda could not reinforce kampala realising that rebels would launch an attack on capital president okello attempted to bolster kampala s garrison by enlisting aid of anti nra militias including former uganda national army funa and uganda freedom army in truth many of these alleged anti nra fighters were nra spies and acted as a fifth column entire uganda freedom army was probably a front organisation of nra in addition funa suffered from extensive indiscipline and civilians in capital despite denials by its commander isaac kampala s garrison was at least 12 000 strong unla also established a battery at summit view on kololo a hill overlooking kampala troops were deployed to strategic locations including radio uganda building uganda television building

and 11th battalions had taken up position on mutundwe another hill overlooking kampala unla and funa troops blocked their advance by placing artillery including anti aircraft guns at busega roundabout where masaka and fort portal roads entered capital commander of nra s 1st battalion pecos in a fit of anxiety claimed he was ill museveni ordered him to remain at local nra headquarters while his second in command fred mugisha took charge of unit on front lines on 24 january unla withdrew from busega roundabout a band of nra soldiers led by reconnoitred area and discovering that it had been

seized upon hearing that his troops had entered kampala museveni relocated his headquarters from mpigi to trinity college meanwhile three young nra guerrillas reconnoitred unla defences on kololo under guise of playing football for most part unla and funa soldiers defending city were demotivated and poorly led many deserted or outright defected to nra on 25 january nra s 7th battalion attacked unla barracks at makindye and 3rd battalion assaulted lubiri barracks while 1st battalion acted as a reserve nra artillery positioned on mutundwe traded fire with unla battery at summit view fighting at lubiri was severe unla garrison successfully blunted an attempt by nra troops to scale barracks wall so latter resorted to besieging installation with grenades and machine guns all foreign missions in city closed their facilities governments of united states and united kingdom advised their nationals in capital to seek shelter indoors radio uganda broadcast a request from okello to nra for a ceasefire and for implementation of nairobi peace agreement in afternoon nra artillery struck an armoury near unla s headquarters republic house causing a large series of explosions republic house was

avenue an nra btr 60 armoured personnel carrier apc was struck by a unla rocket propelled grenade rpg apc attempted to reverse to evade further fire but collided with a lorry which was hauling a 37 mm anti aircraft gun unla troops subsequently set both vehicles ablaze and radio uganda which had been broadcasting unla propaganda throughout battle declared that an nra tank had been destroyed soldiers of 1st battalion and 3rd battalion led by mugisha and patrick lumumba employed rpgs to eliminate unla anti armour defences around radio uganda by 15 00 nra had secured radio uganda station killing a unla officer and capturing three soldiers meanwhile 11th battalion under ali captured makerere and unit then rushed unla position at summit view forcing troops manning artillery to surrender and forcing others including their commanding officer lieutenant colonel eric to retreat telecommunications running out of country were severed while 7th battalion continued to battle makindye garrison a unla force of about 1 000 men penetrated nra s 5th battalion s roadblock along entebbe road causing museveni deep consternation as 1st battalion was engaged near jinja road and 11th battalion was mopping up unla presence on kololo he deployed his reserve two companies of 3rd battalion to stop advance from entebbe saleh ordered nra s 500 strong special force under jet to redeploy from a roadblock on jinja road to assist ivan s 13th battalion in northern section of city near gulu road after some fighting battalion reached and secured kawempe with removal of roadblock on jinja road unla forces began retreating from kampala taking their families with them saleh accompanied 3rd battalion companies to namasuba valley where they linked up with a company of 5th battalion and took up positions along entebbe road early in evening 7th battalion captured makindye barracks and museveni sent them to kisubi roundabout to act as a reserve for forces guarding entebbe route as dusk fell 1 000 unla troops entered namasuba valley and were ambushed they retreated and nra forces advanced and occupied zana hill another nra company stationed at kisubi began moving towards unla force s rear fearing that they were about to be subject to a pincer attack unla men dispatched an emissary to zana to offer their surrender saleh accepted and at around 22 00 radioed news of capitulation to museveni by end of day nra had secured kampala saleh went to radio uganda link up with 1st battalion and sleep three high ranking unla commanders surrendered when city fell to nra namely chief of staff lieutenant general zed maruru brigadier fred and colonel samuel okello fled via helicopter to sudan with several members of his staff aftermath analyses battle of kampala was largest battle nra had partaken in since its inception unlike previous drawn out engagements in ugandan bush war nra had won battle through overwhelming force and direct attack removal of nra roadblock on route to jinja allowed many unla troops to escape city and reorganise to launch a new rebellion eight months later saleh maintained that he had ordered roadblock s removal in consideration of humanitarian reasons as there could have been a blood bath and unla troops families would perish in fighting in contrast historians tom cooper and adrien fontanellaz regarded roadblock s removal as result of a faulty order course of war thumb nra leader yoweri museveni pictured in 1987 was sworn in as president of uganda following battle of kampala overall about 20 nra and 80 unla funa soldiers were killed in fighting while nearly 3 000 unla troops were captured most of unla casualties were incurred as troops were shot while attempting to abandon their positions at radio uganda and uganda television and flee towards kololo about 9 000 unla soldiers and their families managed to escape from kampala many of these troops retreated towards jinja and gulu looting as they fled buildings along kampala avenue main road in city were left heavily damaged by battle unlike previous military takeovers in kampala nra soldiers did not loot in city following battle nra s 5th battalion and one platoon from 3rd battalion captured entebbe on 29 january museveni was sworn in as president of uganda in front of parliament building with a crowd of tens of thousands in attendance in his inaugural address he promised to support national unity public security and democracy pledging that his government would schedule elections as soon as possible his appointed cabinet consisted mostly of nrm members and civil servants despite museveni s promises many northerners in kampala viewed as beneficiaries of obote and okello regimes especially acholi and lango people were subject to abuse and discrimination following nra s takeover some were killed in streets or forced out of their jobs or homes several nra soldiers stole automobiles from them other northerners fled from repression to their lands of origin museveni condemned violence museveni s government sent an emissary to sudan to entreat okello to order remaining unla forces to surrender but he stated that he no longer controlled them nra subsequently attacked jinja capturing it by late january followed by tororo in early february at this point unla attempted one last time to stem rebel advance by launching a counter attack against tororo and fortifying crossings of nile to prevent nra from advancing into northern uganda nevertheless museveni s forces inflicted further defeats on unla in late february and early march resulting in complete collapse of latter a presidential election was not held in country until 1996 museveni won by a large margin notes citations references category conflicts in 1986 category january 1986
