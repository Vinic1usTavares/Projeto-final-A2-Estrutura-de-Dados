performance as perhaps first female equivalent of white negro cinematographer james wong howe shot hud in black and white to elevate its dramatic propensities filmed in panavision howe used high contrast with unbalanced light and dark tones he highlighted white ground and clear skies making shadows black dark tones were overpowered by light ones creating a sense of infinite space for faces and structures howe used light reflected from ground contrast between environment and objects silhouetted against background provides a sense of depth ritt s biographer carlton jackson wrote that in hud scenery becomes a part of thematic development itself according to texas monthly howe s austere rendition of texas landscapes remains one of film s most distinctive pleasures filming hud was shot

filter its meaning and theme lucidly through its characters and story although it called four leads performances excellent through character of hud ritt and newman had intended to show corruption of modern capitalism and pitfalls of admiring an individual blindly without observing his character critics however did not universally echo this view lifes review described hud as likable smart and with potential to measure up to his tough honorable father and saturday review called him a charming raffish monster according to outlook hud bannon is a mean unscrupulous man who never has even a momentary twinge of conscience or change of heart in end scene hud p down shade on world of goodness and decency pauline kael initially described film as an anti western she called it an anti american film which was so astutely made and yet such a mess that it was redeemed by its fundamental dishonesty although hud was conceived as an outwardly charming but morally repugnant character audiences especially young people found him likable even admirable paul newman said we thought last thing people would do was accept hud as a heroic character his amorality just went over audience s head all they saw was this western heroic individual martin ritt later attributed audience interpretation of character to counterculture of 1960s which changed values of young audiences who saw hud as a hero
