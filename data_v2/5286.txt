after returning home bassist matthew rubano sent rest of band song ideas which were ignored after two weeks with no communication three members of band and their manager held a conference call with

and rubano announcing their departure from group were posted on band s website two days later it was announced that former members guitarist john nolan and bassist shaun cooper had re joined band nolan and cooper had left band in 2003 going on to form straylight run idea of reuniting with nolan and cooper was first proposed in january 2010 when mark o connell suggested lazzara talk with nolan on phone lazzara said one day he o connell called me and was like hey man what do you think about us going back to our original lineup and i was like are you crazy i haven t talked to john nolan in like seven years i don t know if he d want to do it o connell continued to insist on idea and then i got a call from john nolan it felt like no time had passed like we had just talked a few days ago pair did not discuss creating music initially instead we got reacquainted with what had been going on in our lives because for me i genuinely missed his friendship and same with shaun cooper composition as discussions between lazzara and nolan continued they began sending each other music at first pair thought it would not work out eventually it got to point where we were like oh man i think this could work according to lazzara in march group relocated to a farm close to texas mexico border group spent a few weeks writing material at sonic ranch studio in el paso texas song writing process started off with a guitar part nolan and lazzara would work on lyrics and melodies and then bounce ideas off other members lazzara would suggest bass parts and drummer mark o connell would contribute guitar parts first song group wrote was best places to be a mom which was written in 20 minutes group wrote seven songs which would ve typically take n taking back sunday six months to do instead we did it in a week cooper noted that all members had gotten better at playing and writing songs cooper said band members relied on each other instead of forcing each other to play something guitarist eddie reyes insisted on playing his own part as opposed to a chord progression on several occasions cooper said so instead of trying to force him to play one thing he ll go and do his own thing that s way more cool and unique that any of us could imagine lazzara mentioned there was an urgency and an energy and an excitement embedded into material which you can t create or fake nolan stated that straylight run helped cooper and himself as musicians we learned we grew and were much more mature coming back to tbs cooper mentioned that towards end of writing process group s creative juices were just so depleted recording in april band began demoing material and said they were aiming to release a new album later in year in august band announced they would be recording in a few weeks time and were aiming for a spring 2011 release after some shows in summer band began recording in october eric valentine produced sessions at barefoot recording in hollywood california valentine also engineered sessions with assistance from cian riordan band used undertone audio consoles during recording at start of recording group had 18 songs they whittled this number down little by little and wrote additional songs at robert lang studios in seattle washington nolan said recording album was a learning process since way that band had been making records was very different than what shaun and i were used to coming back into it nolan said their label was pretty nervous and unsure about what was going to happen in addition to this label would hear their progress throughout recording process and would infrequently provide feedback towards end of their relationship with label said it was a whole new staff and i don t think anyone cared anymore looking back in 2015 nolan said group ended up not feeling very good about having their label check on proceedings drums tracks were completed in early october 2010 valentine helped group arrange their parts according to nolan he has this way of weaving those parts together in a way that we wouldn t have been able to do on our own nolan said valentine took control of amp stuff which made sense to him because he knows so much more about that stuff group spent some time messing around with guitar pedals according to nolan on december 8 band posted a behind scenes video of themselves in studio on january 10 2011 band announced that recording was officially completed a week later band said album s artwork was being produced and valentine was mixing tracks while 11 tracks ended up on final version of album a further seven or eight songs were recorded howie weinberg mastered recordings at howie weinberg mastering in march music and lyrics choosing to self title album lazzara said we haven t had a self titled album and going back to original lineup it seems appropriate nolan mentioned a recurring theme throughout album issue of being an adult with a real life and a long term relationship or marriage and trying to make that work album s sound has been described as rock and post hardcore band members made up their own sequences for track listing then noted similarities lazzara said with el paso why not come out swinging track was one of first songs written for album and lazzara said it encapsulates both mood of environment we were in down there and mood we were in about being back together again and writing new music lazzara called it probably heaviest rock song we ve ever written after group finished track they listened to it 15 or 16 times in a row and proceeded to exclaim holy shit when everybody s like holy shit about something you re onto something it s a total motorcycle raging down highway kind of song lazzara said faith when i let you down matches a huge punishing chorus with a soft verse which comes across as a roller coaster to him lazzara mentioned that track took longer to work on compared to other songs on album going through 4 or 5 sets of lyrics one day lazzara was checking his emails and saw phrase best places to be a mom roll across news ticker he thought it was funny and in context it is track started out as a slow song before being sped up by reyes lazzara said track was strikingly similar to you know how i do opening track on tell all your friends sad savior feature nolan playing a 1950s buddy holly esque guitar riff reminding lazzara that he had missed john nolan s guitar playing i missed john s guitar playing especially coupled with eddie reyes s lazzara said money let it go has a james bond kind of spy surf y vibe and features a really cool surf y solo by nolan o connell created chord progression for this is all now while nolan came up with melody for song s chorus track s lyrics went through three or four different drafts lazzara said it was about group s relationship with faith and growing up in and out of church band referred to bridge in since you re gone as beatles bridge because it was very unlike us according to lazzara lazzara described call me in morning a ballady kind of sentimental tune when group recorded track they sat in a circle with this crazy microphone in middle and we were all playing together you were right started as an acoustic
