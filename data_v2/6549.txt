looking forward to competing in marrakesh but had knowledge that it would not be easy to repeat his hong kong victory he was aware of how different two tracks were and said that it would be exciting to visit city for first time his team wanted to maximise every detail feasible and buemi could not wait to drive on track mahindra driver felix rosenqvist stated that his objective for eprix was to continue momentum his team built at season s previous round he wanted to extract maximum amount possible from his car s package as soon as he could even at cost of still learning slightly more about his vehicle however he was unsure whether track s layout suited him because it required a different driving style and rhythm than in hong kong layout of long anti clockwise track was revealed on 17 october nelson piquet jr said that he felt it would be a fast circuit because it was purpose built for motor racing and other series had visited track before he described it as seeming like it would be slightly wider and easier along with relying less on driver skill and making competitive racing closer heidfeld stated that track layout would mean drivers would be challenged on electrical energy management and there would a high chance of a full course yellow flag being shown or a safety car being deployed because of large amount of barriers lining circuit virgin s jose maria lopez who raced on track in wtcc said it would be tricky having been used to touring cars which require more space and it would feel wider with formula e vehicles but spoke off his feeling there would be plenty of space for overtaking manoeuvres practice and qualifying two practice sessions both on saturday morning were held before saturday late afternoon race first session ran for 45 minutes second for 30

he drove cleanly in track s next section before running smoothly to move into first with a time of one minute and 21 509 seconds vergne was unable to set a lap time because an operational error by his
