m theory is a theory in physics that unifies all consistent versions of superstring theory existence of such a theory was first conjectured by edward witten at a string theory conference at university of southern california in spring of 1995 witten s announcement initiated a flurry of research activity known as second superstring revolution prior to witten s announcement string theorists had identified five versions of superstring theory although these theories appeared at first to be very different work by several physicists showed that theories were related in intricate and nontrivial ways in particular physicists found that apparently distinct theories could be unified by mathematical transformations called s duality and t duality witten s conjecture was based in part on existence of these dualities and in part on relationship of string theories to a field theory called eleven dimensional supergravity although a complete formulation of m theory is not known theory should describe two and five dimensional objects called branes and should be approximated by eleven dimensional supergravity at low energies modern attempts to formulate m theory are typically based on matrix theory or ads cft correspondence according to witten m should stand for magic mystery or membrane according to taste and true meaning of title should be decided when a more fundamental formulation of theory is known duff 1996 sec 1 investigations of mathematical structure of m theory have spawned important theoretical results in physics and mathematics more speculatively m theory may provide a framework for developing a unified theory of all of fundamental forces of nature attempts to connect m theory to experiment typically focus on compactifying its extra dimensions to construct candidate models of our four dimensional world although so far none has been verified to give rise to physics as observed in high energy physics experiments background quantum gravity and strings right thumb alt a wavy open segment and closed loop of string fundamental objects of string theory are open and closed strings one of deepest problems in modern physics is problem of quantum gravity current understanding of gravity is based on albert einstein s general theory of relativity which is formulated within framework of classical physics however nongravitational forces are described within framework of quantum mechanics a radically different formalism for describing physical phenomena based on probability a quantum theory of gravity is needed in order to reconcile general relativity with principles of quantum mechanics but difficulties arise when one attempts to apply usual prescriptions of quantum theory to force of gravity string theory is a theoretical framework that attempts to reconcile gravity and quantum mechanics in string theory point like particles of particle physics are replaced by one dimensional objects called strings string theory describes how strings propagate through space and interact with each other in a given version of string theory there is only one kind of string which may look like a small loop or segment of ordinary string and it can vibrate in different ways on distance scales larger than string scale a string will look just like an ordinary particle with its mass charge and other properties determined by vibrational state of string in this way all of different elementary particles may be viewed as vibrating strings one of vibrational states of a string gives rise to graviton a quantum mechanical particle that carries gravitational force there are several versions of string theory type i type iia type iib and two flavors of heterotic string theory and different theories allow different types of strings and particles that arise at low energies exhibit different symmetries for example type i theory includes both open strings which are segments with endpoints and closed strings which form closed loops while types iia and iib include only closed strings zwiebach 2009 p 324 each of these five string theories arises as a special limiting case of m theory this theory like its string theory predecessors is an example of a quantum theory of gravity it describes a force just like familiar gravitational force subject to rules of quantum mechanics becker becker and schwarz 2007 p 12 number of dimensions left thumb alt a tubular surface and corresponding one dimensional curve an example of compactification at large distances a two dimensional surface with one circular dimension looks one dimensional in everyday life there are three familiar dimensions of space height width and depth einstein s general theory of relativity treats time as a dimension on par with three spatial dimensions in general relativity space and time are not modeled as separate entities but are instead unified to a four dimensional spacetime three spatial dimensions and one time dimension in this framework phenomenon of gravity is viewed as a consequence of geometry of spacetime wald 1984 p 4 in spite of fact that universe is well described by four dimensional spacetime there are several reasons why physicists consider theories in other dimensions in some cases by modeling spacetime in a different number of dimensions a theory becomes more mathematically tractable and one can perform calculations and gain general insights more easily there are also situations where theories in two or three spacetime dimensions are useful for describing phenomena in condensed matter physics zee 2010 parts v and vi finally there exist scenarios in which there could actually be more than four dimensions of spacetime which have nonetheless managed to escape detection zwiebach 2009 p 9 one notable feature of string theory and m theory is that these theories require extra dimensions of spacetime for their mathematical consistency in string theory spacetime is ten dimensional nine spatial dimensions and one time dimension while in m theory it is eleven dimensional ten spatial dimensions and one time dimension in order to describe real physical phenomena using these theories one must therefore imagine scenarios in which these extra dimensions would not be observed in experiments zwiebach 2009 p 8 compactification is one way of modifying number of dimensions in a physical theory in compactification some of extra dimensions are assumed to close up on themselves to form circles yau and nadis 2010 ch 6 in limit where these curled up dimensions become very small one obtains a theory in which spacetime has effectively a lower number of dimensions a standard analogy for this is to consider a multidimensional object such as a garden hose if hose is viewed from a sufficient distance it appears to have only one dimension its length however as one approaches hose one discovers that it contains a second dimension its circumference thus an ant crawling on surface of hose would move in two dimensions dualities right thumb alt a diagram indicating relationships between m theory and five string theories 250px a diagram of string theory dualities yellow arrows indicate s duality blue arrows indicate t duality these dualities may be combined to obtain equivalences of any of five theories with m theory becker becker and schwarz 2007 pp 339 347 theories that arise as different limits of m theory turn out to be related in highly nontrivial ways one of relationships that can exist between these different physical theories is called s duality this is a relationship which says that a collection of strongly interacting particles in one theory can in some cases be viewed as a collection of weakly interacting particles in a completely different theory roughly speaking a collection of particles is said to be strongly interacting if they combine and decay often and weakly interacting if they do so infrequently type i string theory turns out to be equivalent by s duality to heterotic string theory similarly type iib string theory is related to itself in a nontrivial way by s duality becker becker and schwarz 2007 another relationship between different string theories is t duality here one considers strings propagating around a circular extra dimension t duality states that a string propagating around a circle of radius is equivalent to a string propagating around a circle of radius in sense that all observable quantities in one description are identified with quantities in dual description for example a string has momentum as it propagates around a circle and it can also wind around circle one or more times number of times string winds around a circle is called winding number if a string has momentum and winding number in one description it will have momentum and winding number in dual description for example type iia string theory is equivalent to type iib string theory via t duality and two versions of heterotic string theory are also related by t duality in general term duality refers to a situation where two seemingly different physical systems turn out to be equivalent in a nontrivial way if two theories are related by a duality it means that one theory can be transformed in some way so that it ends up looking just like other theory two theories are then said to be dual to one another under transformation put differently two theories are mathematically different descriptions of same phenomena zwiebach 2009 p 376 supersymmetry another important theoretical idea that plays a role in m theory is supersymmetry this is a mathematical relation that exists in certain physical theories between a class of particles called bosons and a class of particles called fermions roughly speaking fermions are constituents of matter while bosons mediate interactions between particles in theories with supersymmetry each boson has a counterpart which is a fermion and vice versa when supersymmetry is imposed as a local symmetry one automatically obtains a quantum mechanical theory that includes gravity such a theory is called a supergravity theory duff 1998 p 64 a theory of strings that incorporates idea of supersymmetry is called a superstring theory there are several different versions of superstring theory which are all subsumed within m theory framework at low energies superstring theories are approximated by supergravity in ten spacetime dimensions similarly m theory is approximated at low energies by supergravity in eleven dimensions branes in string theory and related theories such as supergravity theories a brane is a physical object that generalizes notion of a point particle to higher dimensions for example a point particle can be viewed as a brane of dimension zero while a string can be viewed as a brane of dimension one it is also possible to consider higher dimensional branes in dimension these are called branes branes are dynamical objects which can propagate through spacetime according to rules of quantum mechanics they can have mass and other attributes such as charge a brane sweeps out a dimensional volume in spacetime called its worldvolume physicists often study fields analogous to electromagnetic field which live on worldvolume of a brane word brane comes from word membrane which refers to a two dimensional brane moore 2005 in string theory fundamental objects that give rise to elementary particles are one dimensional strings although physical phenomena described by m theory are still poorly understood physicists know that theory describes two and five dimensional branes much of current research in m theory attempts to better understand properties of these branes history and development kaluza klein theory in early 20th century physicists and mathematicians including albert einstein and hermann minkowski pioneered use of four dimensional geometry for describing physical world yau and nadis 2010 p 9 these efforts culminated in formulation of einstein s general theory of relativity which relates gravity to geometry of four dimensional spacetime yau and nadis 2010 p 10 success of general relativity led to efforts to apply higher dimensional geometry to explain other forces in 1919 work by theodor kaluza showed that by passing to five dimensional spacetime one can unify gravity and electromagnetism into a single force this idea was improved by physicist oskar klein who suggested that additional dimension proposed by kaluza could take form of a circle with radius around cm yau and nadis 2010 p 12 kaluza klein theory and subsequent attempts by einstein to develop unified field theory were never completely successful in part this was because kaluza klein theory predicted a particle that has never been shown to exist and in part because it was unable to correctly predict ratio of an electron s mass to its charge in addition these theories were being developed just as other physicists were beginning to discover quantum mechanics which would ultimately prove successful in describing known forces such as electromagnetism as well as new nuclear forces that were being discovered throughout middle part of century thus it would take almost fifty years for idea of new dimensions to be taken seriously again yau and nadis 2010 p 13 early work on supergravity left thumb alt a portrait of edward witten in 1980s edward witten contributed to understanding of supergravity theories in 1995 he introduced m theory sparking second superstring revolution new concepts and mathematical tools provided fresh insights into general relativity giving rise to a period in 1960s 70s now known as golden age of general relativity wald 1984 p 3 in mid 1970s physicists began studying higher dimensional theories combining general relativity with supersymmetry so called supergravity theories van 1981 general relativity does not place any limits on possible dimensions of spacetime although theory is typically formulated in four dimensions one can write down same equations for gravitational field in any number of dimensions supergravity is more restrictive because it places an upper limit on number of dimensions in 1978 work by werner nahm showed that maximum spacetime dimension in which one can formulate a consistent supersymmetric theory is eleven nahm 1978 in same year eugene cremmer bernard julia and joel scherk of ecole normale superieure showed that supergravity not only permits up to eleven dimensions but is in fact most elegant in this maximal number of dimensions cremmer julia and scherk 1998 p 65 initially many physicists hoped that by compactifying eleven dimensional supergravity it might be possible to construct realistic models of our four dimensional world hope was that such models would provide a unified description of four fundamental forces of nature electromagnetism strong and weak nuclear forces and gravity interest in eleven dimensional supergravity soon waned as various flaws in this scheme were discovered one of problems was that laws of physics appear to distinguish between clockwise and counterclockwise a phenomenon known as chirality edward witten and others observed this chirality property cannot be readily derived by compactifying from eleven dimensions in first superstring revolution in 1984 many physicists turned to string theory as a unified theory of particle physics and quantum gravity unlike supergravity theory string theory was able to accommodate chirality of standard model and it provided a theory of gravity consistent with quantum effects another feature of string theory that many physicists were drawn to in 1980s and 1990s was its high degree of uniqueness in ordinary particle theories one can consider any collection of elementary particles whose classical behavior is described by an arbitrary lagrangian in string theory possibilities are much more constrained by 1990s physicists had argued that there were only five consistent supersymmetric versions of theory relationships between string theories although there were only a handful of consistent superstring theories it remained a mystery why there was not just one consistent formulation however as physicists began to examine string theory more closely they realized that these theories are related in intricate and nontrivial ways duff 1998 in late 1970s claus montonen and david olive had conjectured a special property of certain physical theories montonen and olive 1977 a sharpened version of their conjecture concerns a theory called supersymmetric yang mills theory which describes theoretical particles formally similar to quarks and gluons that make up atomic nuclei strength with which particles of this theory interact is measured by a number called coupling constant result of montonen and olive now known as montonen olive duality states that supersymmetric yang mills theory with coupling constant is equivalent to same theory with coupling constant in other words a system of strongly interacting particles large coupling constant has an equivalent description as a system of weakly interacting particles small coupling constant and vice versa duff 1998 p 66 by spin moment in 1990s several theorists generalized montonen olive duality to s duality relationship which connects different string theories ashoke sen studied s duality in context of heterotic strings in four dimensions sen chris hull and paul townsend showed that type iib string theory with a large coupling constant is equivalent via s duality to same theory with small coupling constant hull and townsend 1995 theorists also found that different string theories may be related by t duality this duality implies that strings propagating on completely different spacetime geometries may be physically equivalent duff 1998 p 67 membranes and string theory extends ordinary particle physics by replacing zero dimensional point particles by one dimensional objects called strings in late 1980s it was natural for theorists to attempt to formulate other extensions in which particles are replaced by two dimensional or by higher dimensional objects called branes such objects had been considered as early as 1962 by paul dirac dirac 1962 and they were reconsidered by a small but enthusiastic group of physicists in 1980s supersymmetry severely restricts possible number of dimensions of a brane in 1987 eric bergshoeff sezgin and paul townsend showed that eleven dimensional supergravity includes two dimensional branes bergshoeff sezgin and townsend 1987 intuitively these objects look like sheets or membranes propagating through eleven dimensional spacetime shortly after this discovery michael duff paul howe takeo and kellogg stelle considered a particular compactification of eleven dimensional supergravity with one of dimensions curled up into a circle duff et al 1987 in this setting one can imagine membrane wrapping around circular dimension if radius of circle is sufficiently small then this membrane looks just like a string in ten dimensional spacetime in fact duff and his collaborators showed that this construction reproduces exactly strings appearing in type iia superstring theory in 1990 andrew strominger published a similar result which suggested that strongly interacting strings in ten dimensions might have an equivalent description in terms of weakly interacting five dimensional branes strominger 1990 initially physicists were unable to prove this relationship for two important reasons on one hand montonen olive duality was still unproven and so strominger s conjecture was even more tenuous on other hand there were many technical issues related to quantum properties of five dimensional branes duff 1998 pp 66 67 first of these problems was solved in 1993 when ashoke sen established that certain physical theories require existence of objects with both electric and magnetic charge which were predicted by work of montonen and olive sen 1993 in spite of this progress relationship between strings and five dimensional branes remained conjectural because theorists were unable to branes starting in 1991 a team of researchers including michael duff ramzi lu and ruben minasian considered a special compactification of string theory in which four of ten dimensions curl up if one considers a five dimensional brane wrapped around these extra dimensions then brane looks just like a one dimensional string in this way conjectured relationship between strings and branes was reduced to a relationship between strings and strings and latter could be tested using already established theoretical techniques second superstring revolution right 350px thumb alt a star shaped diagram with various limits of m theory labeled at its six vertices a schematic illustration of relationship between m theory five superstring theories and eleven dimensional supergravity shaded region represents a family of different physical scenarios that are possible in m theory in certain limiting cases corresponding to cusps it is natural to describe physics using one of six theories labeled there speaking at string theory conference at university of southern california in 1995 edward witten of institute for advanced study made surprising suggestion that all five superstring theories were in fact just different limiting cases of a single theory in eleven spacetime dimensions witten s announcement drew together all of previous results on s and t duality and appearance of two and five dimensional branes in string theory witten 1995 in months following witten s announcement hundreds of new papers appeared on internet confirming that new theory involved membranes in an important way duff 1998 pp 67 68 today this flurry of work is known as second superstring revolution becker becker and schwarz 2007 p 296 one of important developments following witten s announcement was witten s work in 1996 with string theorist petr horava horava and witten and witten 1996b witten and horava studied m theory on a special spacetime geometry with two ten dimensional boundary components their work shed light on mathematical structure of m theory and suggested possible ways of connecting m theory to real world physics duff 1998 p 68 origin of term initially some physicists suggested that new theory was a fundamental theory of membranes but witten was skeptical of role of membranes in theory in a paper from 1996 horava and witten wrote in absence of an understanding of true meaning and structure of m theory witten has suggested that m should stand for magic mystery or membrane according to taste and true meaning of title should be decided when a more fundamental formulation of theory is known matrix theory bfss matrix model in mathematics a matrix is a rectangular array of numbers or other data in physics a matrix model is a particular kind of physical theory whose mathematical formulation involves notion of a matrix in an important way a matrix model describes behavior of a set of matrices within framework of quantum mechanics banks et al douglas and schwarz 1998 one important example of a matrix model is bfss matrix model proposed by tom banks willy fischler stephen and leonard susskind in 1997 this theory describes behavior of a set of nine large matrices in their original paper these authors showed among other things that low energy limit of this matrix model is described by eleven dimensional supergravity these calculations led them to propose that bfss matrix model is exactly equivalent to m theory bfss matrix model can therefore be used as a prototype for a correct formulation of m theory and a tool for investigating properties of m theory in a relatively simple setting noncommutative geometry in geometry it is often useful to introduce coordinates for example in order to study geometry of euclidean plane one defines coordinates and as distances between any point in plane and a pair of axes in ordinary geometry coordinates of a point are numbers so they can be multiplied and product of two coordinates does not depend on order of multiplication that is this property of multiplication is known as commutative law and this relationship between geometry and commutative algebra of coordinates is starting point for much of modern geometry connes 1994 p 1 noncommutative geometry is a branch of mathematics that attempts to generalize this situation rather than working with ordinary numbers one considers some similar objects such as matrices whose multiplication does not satisfy commutative law that is objects for which is not necessarily equal to one imagines that these objects are coordinates on some more general notion of space and proves theorems about these generalized spaces by exploiting analogy with ordinary geometry connes 1994 in a paper from 1998 alain connes michael r douglas and albert schwarz showed that some aspects of matrix models and m theory are described by a noncommutative quantum field theory a special kind of physical theory in which coordinates on spacetime do not satisfy commutativity property this established a link between matrix models and m theory on one hand and noncommutative geometry on other hand it quickly led to discovery of other important links between noncommutative geometry and various physical theories nekrasov and schwarz and witten 1999 ads cft correspondence overview thumb left alt a disk tiled by triangles and quadrilaterals which become smaller and smaller near boundary circle a tessellation of hyperbolic plane by triangles and squares application of quantum mechanics to physical objects such as electromagnetic field which are extended in space and time is known as quantum field theory in particle physics quantum field theories form basis for our understanding of elementary particles which are modeled as excitations in fundamental fields quantum field theories are also used throughout condensed matter physics to model particle like objects called quasiparticles one approach to formulating m theory and studying its properties is provided by anti de sitter conformal field theory ads cft correspondence proposed by juan maldacena in late 1997 ads cft correspondence is a theoretical result which implies that m theory is in some cases equivalent to a quantum field theory in addition to providing insights into mathematical structure of string and m theory ads cft correspondence has shed light on many aspects of quantum field theory in regimes where traditional techniques are ineffective klebanov and maldacena 2009 in ads cft correspondence geometry of spacetime is described in terms of a certain vacuum solution of einstein s equation called anti de sitter space klebanov and maldacena 2009 p 28 in very elementary terms anti de sitter space is a mathematical model of spacetime in which notion of distance between points metric is different from notion of distance in ordinary euclidean geometry it is closely related to hyperbolic space which can be viewed as a disk as illustrated on left maldacena 2005 p 60 this image shows a tessellation of a disk by triangles and squares one can define distance between points of this disk in such a way that all triangles and squares are same size and circular outer boundary is infinitely far from any point in interior maldacena 2005 p 61 thumb right alt a cylinder formed by stacking copies of disk illustrated in previous figure 350px three dimensional anti de sitter space is like a stack of hyperbolic disks each one representing state of universe at a given time one can study theories of quantum gravity such as m theory in resulting spacetime now imagine a stack of hyperbolic disks where each disk represents state of universe at a given time resulting geometric object is three dimensional anti de sitter space it looks like a solid cylinder in which any cross section is a copy of hyperbolic disk time runs along vertical direction in this picture surface of this cylinder plays an important role in ads cft correspondence as with hyperbolic plane anti de sitter space is curved in such a way that any point in interior is actually infinitely far from this boundary surface this construction describes a hypothetical universe with only two space dimensions and one time dimension but it can be generalized to any number of dimensions indeed hyperbolic space can have more than two dimensions and one can stack up copies of hyperbolic space to get higher dimensional models of anti de sitter space an important feature of anti de sitter space is its boundary which looks like a cylinder in case of three dimensional anti de sitter space one property of this boundary is that within a small region on surface around any given point it looks just like minkowski space model of spacetime used in nongravitational physics zwiebach 2009 p 552 one can therefore consider an auxiliary theory in which spacetime is given by boundary of anti de sitter space this observation is starting point for ads cft correspondence which states that boundary of anti de sitter space can be regarded as spacetime for a quantum field theory claim is that this quantum field theory is equivalent to gravitational theory on bulk anti de sitter space in sense that there is a dictionary for translating entities and calculations in one theory into their counterparts in other theory for example a single particle in gravitational theory might correspond to some collection of particles in boundary theory in addition predictions in two theories are quantitatively identical so that if two particles have a 40 percent chance of colliding in gravitational theory then corresponding collections in boundary theory would also have a 40 percent chance of colliding maldacena 2005 pp 61 62 6d 2 0 superconformal field theory left thumb alt a collection of knot diagrams in plane 350px six dimensional 2 0 theory has been used to understand results from mathematical theory of knots one particular realization of ads cft correspondence states that m theory on product space is equivalent to so called 2 0 theory on six dimensional boundary maldacena 1998 here 2 0 refers to particular type of supersymmetry that appears in theory in this example spacetime of gravitational theory is effectively seven dimensional hence notation and there are four additional compact dimensions encoded by factor in real world spacetime is four dimensional at least macroscopically so this version of correspondence does not provide a realistic model of gravity likewise dual theory is not a viable model of any real world system since it describes a world with six spacetime dimensions nevertheless 2 0 theory has proven to be important for studying general properties of quantum field theories indeed this theory subsumes many mathematically interesting effective quantum field theories and points to new dualities relating these theories for example luis alday davide gaiotto and yuji tachikawa showed that by compactifying this theory on a surface one obtains a four dimensional quantum field theory and there is a duality known as agt correspondence which relates physics of this theory to certain physical concepts associated with surface itself alday gaiotto and tachikawa 2010 more recently theorists have extended these ideas to study theories obtained by compactifying down to three dimensions gaiotto and 2010 in addition to its applications in quantum field theory 2 0 theory has spawned important results in pure mathematics for example existence of 2 0 theory was used by witten to give a physical explanation for a conjectural relationship in mathematics called geometric langlands correspondence witten 2009 in subsequent work witten showed that 2 0 theory could be used to understand a concept in mathematics called khovanov homology witten 2012 developed by mikhail khovanov around 2000 khovanov homology provides a tool in knot theory branch of mathematics that studies and classifies different shapes of knots khovanov 2000 another application of 2 0 theory in mathematics is work of davide gaiotto greg moore and andrew neitzke which used physical ideas to derive new results in geometry gaiotto moore and neitzke 2013 abjm superconformal field theory another realization of ads cft correspondence states that m theory on is equivalent to a quantum field theory called abjm theory in three dimensions in this version of correspondence seven of dimensions of m theory are curled up leaving four non compact dimensions since spacetime of our universe is four dimensional this version of correspondence provides a somewhat more realistic description of gravity aharony et al 2008 abjm theory appearing in this version of correspondence is also interesting for a variety of reasons introduced by aharony bergman and maldacena it is closely related to another quantum field theory called chern simons theory latter theory was popularized by witten in late 1980s because of its applications to knot theory witten 1989 in addition abjm theory serves as a semi realistic simplified model for solving problems that arise in condensed matter physics phenomenology overview right thumb alt visualization of a complex mathematical surface with many convolutions and self intersections a cross section of a calabi yau manifold in addition to being an idea of considerable theoretical interest m theory provides a framework for constructing models of real world physics that combine general relativity with standard model of particle physics phenomenology is branch of theoretical physics in which physicists construct realistic models of nature from more abstract theoretical ideas string phenomenology is part of string theory that attempts to construct realistic models of particle physics based on string and m theory dine 2000 typically such models are based on idea of compactification starting with ten or eleven dimensional spacetime of string or m theory physicists postulate a shape for extra dimensions by choosing this shape appropriately they can construct models roughly similar to standard model of particle physics together with additional undiscovered particles candelas et al 1985 usually supersymmetric partners to analogues of known particles one popular way of deriving realistic physics from string theory is to start with heterotic theory in ten dimensions and assume that six extra dimensions of spacetime are shaped like a six dimensional calabi yau manifold this is a special kind of geometric object named after mathematicians eugenio calabi and shing tung yau yau and nadis 2010 p ix calabi yau manifolds offer many ways of extracting realistic physics from string theory other similar methods can be used to construct models with physics resembling to some extent that of our four dimensional world based on m theory yau and nadis 2010 pp 147 150 partly because of theoretical and mathematical difficulties and partly because of extremely high energies beyond what is technologically possible for foreseeable future needed to test these theories experimentally there is so far no experimental evidence that would unambiguously point to any of these models being a correct fundamental description of nature this has led some in community to criticize these approaches to unification and question value of continued research on these problems woit 2006 compactification on manifolds in one approach to m theory phenomenology theorists assume that seven extra dimensions of m theory are shaped like a manifold this is a special kind of seven dimensional shape constructed by mathematician dominic joyce of university of oxford yau and nadis 2010 p 149 these manifolds are still poorly understood mathematically and this fact has made it difficult for physicists to fully develop this approach to phenomenology yau and nadis 2010 p 150 for example physicists and mathematicians often assume that space has a mathematical property called smoothness but this property cannot be assumed in case of a manifold if one wishes to recover physics of our four dimensional world another problem is that manifolds are not complex manifolds so theorists are unable to use tools from branch of mathematics known as complex analysis finally there are many open questions about existence uniqueness and other mathematical properties of manifolds and mathematicians lack a systematic way of searching for these manifolds heterotic m theory because of difficulties with manifolds most attempts to construct realistic theories of physics based on m theory have taken a more indirect approach to compactifying eleven dimensional spacetime one approach pioneered by witten horava burt and others is known as heterotic m theory in this approach one imagines that one of eleven dimensions of m theory is shaped like a circle if this circle is very small then spacetime becomes effectively ten dimensional one then assumes that six of ten dimensions form a calabi yau manifold if this calabi yau manifold is also taken to be small one is left with a theory in four dimensions heterotic m theory has been used to construct models of brane cosmology in which observable universe is thought to exist on a brane in a higher dimensional ambient space it has also spawned alternative theories of early universe that do not rely on theory of cosmic inflation references notes
