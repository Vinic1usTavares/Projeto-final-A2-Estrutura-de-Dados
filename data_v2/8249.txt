reached number 1 in 28 countries album was released by virgin records outside of north america where it was released by mca third part of bat trilogy bat out of hell iii monster is loose was released in 2006 like first album of trilogy bat out of hell ii was a commercial success it sold over 14 million copies worldwide history in midst of success of bat out of hell desperate for a follow up management and record company put pressure on steinman to stop touring in order to write a follow up provisionally titled renegade angel in a 1981 bbc rock hour special interview jim steinman recalls writing process i started writing what i felt was bat out of hell part 2 definitely like godfather part i and part 2 that s how i saw it i wanted to do a continuation and i wanted to do an album that went even further and that was more extreme if possible which a lot of people felt wasn t possible but i just wanted to see if i could make a record that was even more heroic because that s what i thought of it bat out of hell to me was ultimately very heroic though it was funny and i wanted to do one that to me would be even more heroic and more epic and a little more operatic and passionate in a 1993 promotional interview for album steinman reasserts continuation of bat world i didn t call it bat out of hell ii just to identify with first record it really does feel like an extension of that it was a chance to go back to that world and explore it deeper it always seemed incomplete because i conceived it like a film and what would you do without die hard 2 meat loaf himself was more succinct he told an interview at time we called it bat out of hell ii cos that would help it sell steinman rejoined meat loaf and band for a live performance in toronto ontario canada in 1978 with intention of going through songs for bat ii after show however someone broke into their dressing rooms during show and stole several possessions including new lyric book then meat loaf lost his voice and was unable to record renegade angel steinman says he sounded literally like little girl in exorcist like a dragon trying to sing it was a horrifying sound steinman kept writing music to bat out of hell part 2 my sequel not being able to bear for people not to hear those songs steinman recorded album retitled bad for good as a solo project although rory dodd contributed lead vocals on some songs four songs from bad for good were included on bat out of hell ii rock and roll dreams come through out of frying pan love and death and an american guitar retitled wasted youth and lost boys and golden girls in 1989 steinman formed all female vocal group pandora s box album original sin was a commercial flop but featured two songs which would also appear on bat ii good girls go to heaven and it just won t quit however according to meat loaf one of them was written for him saying that jim put it just won t quit on original sin without telling me i could have strangled him by time meat loaf set about finally recording bat ii in early 90s industry s enthusiasm for project had waned according to artist s then manager tommy manzi in an interview with hitquarters that project was considered a joke as far as industry was concerned and manzi s management company left bank were laughed at for attempting to revive fortunes of a well established act rather than focus on next hip band production after a series of financial and legal disputes during 1980s steinman and meat loaf met at singer s house in connecticut at christmas 1989 or 1990 and sang bat out of hell on piano steinman says that working together again seemed like cool thing to do steinman gave meat loaf half songs for album but refused to give him any more until he changed managers singer was being managed by walter and george gilbert who meat loaf credits as being honest guys but under steinman s influence thinks would be incapable of dealing with record companies on bat ii on steinman s recommendation he hired allen kovac recording of album lasted from 1991 to 1993 first at ocean way recording in los angeles california then at power station in new york city new york many of performers from original album returned for sequel roy bittan performed keyboard and piano on most tracks with todd rundgren ellen foley rory dodd and kasim sulton returning to provide background vocals meat loaf and musicians are credited as co arrangers and bittan and long term steinman collaborator steven rinkoff are credited as associate producers album was mixed by david thoener with exception of final track which was mixed by rinkoff according to meat loaf he and steinman only had one big fight throughout album s production which occurred during mixing of life is a lemon production took a long time see above mainly because of length of songs singer says jim s songs may be miniature operas but they re always too long for radio steinman fought with kovac over edit of i d do anything for love with manager advising that radio stations were unlikely to play anything over five minutes long steinman had secured a contract with meat loaf s recording label mca for lorraine crosby a club singer from north east england whom he was managing while visiting company s recording studios on sunset boulevard crosby was asked to provide guide vocals for meat loaf who was recording i d do anything for love crosby recalls i went and sang it twice and i never thought anything more of it until six months later when i got a phone call saying would you mind if we used your vocals cher melissa etheridge and bonnie tyler had been considered for role however as crosby had recorded her part as guide vocals she did not receive any royalties from song compositions album opens with i d do anything for love but i won t do that a marathon twelve minute opus which was edited for single release in some countries track begins with a guitar played to sound like a revving motorcycle a reference to todd rundgren s contribution in middle of bat out of hell each verse comprises two things that he would do for love followed by one thing that he would not do it is that latter parts of each chorus that is that of title however some people misunderstand lyrics claiming that singer never identifies what that is that he is unwilling to do a confusion that steinman predicted during production song combines stadium rock and ballad for much of its twelve minutes however near end of song a female vocalist is introduced credited in liner notes as mrs loud this part was sung by lorraine crosby rundgren points out that themes of songs were darker second track life is a lemon and i want my money back demonstrates this pessimism several things are identified as defective including love sex gods childhood and future allmusic labels it a stomping rocker that wraps serious feelings in a cryptically witty metaphor despite pessimism both allmusic and meat loaf point out that it is a funny song third track rock and roll dreams come through is a prayer to rock music celebrating how it is always there to help you through troubled times one of its lyrics is you re never alone cause you can put on phones and let drummer tell your heart what to do fourth track also has dark overtones it just won t quit steinman explains is about fact that there are some things you never shake off that s love i guess produced directed by mark wightwick out of frying pan and into fire is a more upbeat song album s sixth track objects in rear view mirror may appear closer than they are is a three part narrative that uses pathetic fallacy where seasons summer winter and spring reflect atmosphere of events being described drawing its inspiration from singer s often tragic childhood lyrics portray a man who has overcome tragedies in his life yet still feels haunted by their memory steinman says that it was hardest song to write and get across it s a very passionate song it s really i think maybe most passionate one on record i mean i m really proud of it because that s really one that goes over top in sense that it s got images it has religious imagery of resurrection it s got images of fertility and rebirth it has really very good sexual images images of cars which i always like track quotes lyrics from bat out of hell s paradise by dashboard light it was long ago and it was far away as does next track wasted youth a spoken word fantasy monologue a remixed version of love and death and an american guitar from steinman s bad for good album 1977 song s opening line i remember every little thing as if it happened only yesterday i was barely seventeen opens this track also but instead of being barely dressed protagonist once killed a boy with a fender guitar influenced by doors steinman wanted to write a piece where rhythm wasn t coming from drums so much as voice rhythm of spoken voice and heartbeat behind it according to steinman good girls go to heaven bad girls go everywhere is a teenage prayer lost boys and golden girls is steinman s interpretation of story of peter pan composer says that peter pan has always been about my favorite story and i ve always looked at it from perspective that it s a great rock and roll myth because it s about when you get right down to it it s about a gang of lost boys who never grow up who are going to be young forever and that s about as perfect an image for rock n roll as i can think of cover and booklet cover art was illustrated by sci fi fantasy artist michael whelan following style of richard corben s cover for bat out of hell it features biker from first cover flying on his motorcycle towards a giant bat perched on top of new york city s chrysler building to which an angel is bound echoing gravestones of first cover partially destroyed skyscrapers inhabit lava landscape also like first album it features a songs by jim steinman credit although smaller and located at bottom of cover as well as providing thematic consistency with original repetition of iconography also acted as a vital marketing tool marketing of album was documented in an episode of 1995 bbc television programme music biz executives at virgin records thought that this was important to attract target audience who they believed no longer spent much time in record shops they felt that similarities to design of first album including meat loaf s name in gothic typography would entice consumers of 1977 album to purchase this section from this episode about marketing of bat out of hell ii and filming of this music video has been as part of bbc learning zone s media studies strand booklet contains all of lyrics to songs each accompanied by a small whelan illustration which were used as respective single covers there is a suggestion to

singles at same time until manic street preachers in 2001 rock and roll dreams come through reached 13 on billboard hot 100 and 11 on uk singles chart third single from album objects in rear view mirror may appear closer than they are did less well when it was released in 1994 reaching 38 on billboard hot 100 and 26 in united kingdom life is a lemon peaked at 17 on billboard mainstream rock tracks chart in united states michael bay directed three music videos from album i d do anything for love is based on beauty and beast and phantom of opera rock and roll dreams come through features a

weeks meat loaf won a grammy award for best solo rock vocal performance for i d do anything for love and received two brit awards nominations best international male and best selling single despite its huge commercial success critical reception was mixed specialist music press were generally positive q magazine proclaimed truly this is genuine follow up to most over top rock album of all time like most critics q referred to excesses of steinman s style citing length of songs q says that objects running for 10 minutes and 12 seconds is not necessary unlike original where epic loud songs were offset by softness of stuff like two out of three ain t bad even ballads are roman orgies of sound and fury this they say means album s probable theme crushing effect growing up has on teenage dreams seems to get lost among thud and blunder however overall q is positive concluding with sentiment that ultimately back into hell may not trash its predecessor but as a mad crunching stadium rock album it s probably best thing of its kind you ll hear this year looking at how steinman s old fashioned teen dream rock n roll fantasies fits in with music culture of 1993 kerrang suggests that it wouldn t appeal to nirvana and metallica fans but there s an older generation of rockers out there who will quite properly worship this album their four star review declares that it is a work of genius a ready made rock classic and arguably last word in rock operas in tip sheet jonathan king labelled it a glorious splendid album celebrating meat loaf s operatically gorgeous voice and steinman s superb songs arrangements and production you ll be blown away better still you ll catch yourself openly laughing out loud at times with delight you know what to expect yet it s constantly better fresher and brighter than you hope if they had a mercury music prize for american albums this would win it hands down in a 1999 documentary celebrating original album meat loaf says that bat out of hell polarizes people some hate it and some worship it bombast did not meet some critics approval as with first album rolling stone gave album a mixed review they call it harmless low octane operatic drivel with insufferably long steinman compositions with equally long names non specialist publications gave most negative reviews fort worth star telegram also referred to length of songs in which steinman vomits up 75 minutes of endlessly repeated choruses newspaper branded it worst pop album of 1993 des moines register thought that album was wallowing in excess so gratuitous as to make michael bolton by comparison seem a master of understatement mountains of banshee like wailing guitars thunderous drums herniated vocals profoundly stupid lyrics this isn t pandering to lowest common denominator it s lowering lowest common denominator like original retrospective reviews have been appreciative allmusic appreciates bombast and pseudo operatic splendor of jim steinman s grandly cinematic songs responding to concerns about length and overstatement they reply that s precisely point of this album and is also why it works so well no other rock n roller besides meat loaf could pull off humor and theatricality of back into hell and make it seem real in that sense it s a worthy successor to original track listing other versions 1993 special limited edition alongside original version a two disc special edition was released containing a foldout poster and a bonus disc containing three live tracks which can also be found as b sides to i d do anything for love but i won t do

june 25 2002 first disc contains remastered original album while second contains several radio edits and remixes it was presented as a foldout double disc set in a slipcase with an extensive booklet with liner notes and rare photographs allmusic suggest that although album deserves attention extra disc of material is not worth time of anyone outside of fanatics it doesn t really offer any revelations curiosities or an interesting listen for anybody else and it may not be that interesting to those collectors either 2006 2cd collector s edition in 2006 a three disc collector s edition
