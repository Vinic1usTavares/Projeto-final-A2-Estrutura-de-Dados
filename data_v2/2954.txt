troika s 32 member team began development of bloodlines in november 2001 as an indirect sequel to previous year s vampire masquerade redemption troika used valve corporation s source game engine then in development which was being used for valve s own half life 2 game s production was turbulent as design s scope exceeded available resources and team were left without a producer for nearly a year until activision appointed david mullich to role where he found designs and levels unfinished or abandoned after three years in development with no end in sight and running over budget activision set a strict deadline for completion and bloodlines was released incomplete in november 2004 released in competition with half life 2 and several other titles bloodlines sold fewer than 80 000 copies during its initial release which was considered a poor performance it divided critics at time although they praised game s writing and scale of choice they criticized its technical flaws it was troika games last production before its failure in early 2005 when it was unable to secure additional projects game has a cult following as a rarely replicated example of gameplay and narrative and contemporary reception recognises it as a flawed masterpiece since its original release in 2004 bloodlines received post release support from fans supplying unofficial fixes and re adding unused content a sequel vampire masquerade bloodlines 2 is scheduled for release in 2020 gameplay bloodlines is an action role playing video game optionally presented from first or third person perspective before game begins players create a male or female vampire character by selecting a vampire clan and configuring available points in three areas attributes abilities and disciplines vampiric powers or by answering questions which create a character for player player can select one of seven vampire clans powerful brujah decadent insane malkavian aristocratic ventrue monstrously deformed nosferatu blood magic wielding tremere or animalistic gangrel player builds their character by spending acquired points to increase their ratings in three areas points spent on attributes and abilities combine to determine a player s success or effectiveness in performing tasks such as using firearms brawling and lock picking for example determining how accurate or how far player can shoot or if they can hack a computer attributes are represented by physical strength dexterity and stamina social charisma manipulation and appearance and mental perception intelligence and wits abilities are talents such as brawling and dodging skills such as firearms and melee and knowledges such as computers and investigation player is initially assigned points to spend in three areas with amount they can spend determined by clan for example brujah can spend most points on physical and skill attributes during character creation each upgrade costs one point upgrade cost increases as game progresses each ability can be raised from zero to five and it is impossible to accrue enough experience points to complete every skill allowing player to specialize or balance their character experience points are gained by completing quests finding items or unlocking secret paths rather than killing enemies and are used to increase or unlock character s statistics and abilities game features a main story and optional side quests that can be completed at any time player is able to move between available areas at will to revisit locations characters or merchants player s clan affects their skills and powers although attractive toreadors receive bonuses for seduction and persuasion opening additional dialog options they are physically weak nosferatu are forced to travel in shadows or through sewers to avoid alerting humans but receive bonuses to their intelligence and computer skills which enables access to more information malkavians have separate dialog options reflecting their inherent insanity upgrading some skills provides additional dialog options attractive and charismatic characters seduce to get their way aggressive characters threaten and others persuade their targets to cooperate

an instant kill weapons provide unique instant kill animations player can block attacks manually or automatically by leaving their character idle they can use stealth in missions by sneaking past guards and security cameras picking locks and hacking computers to locate alternative routes each clan has specific disciplines which can be used in combat and to create approaches to quests although some powers overlap clans no two clans share same three disciplines more physical vampires can enhance themselves to become fast and lethal killers or summon spirit allies to attack their foes others can mentally dominate their targets to force their cooperation or render themselves invisible to hide from detection and others can boil their opponent s blood from afar some disciplines such as which boosts perception highlighting other characters auras through obstacles and blood buff which temporarily upgrades strength dexterity stamina and are common to all vampires several abilities can be active at same time blood is a primary currency in bloodlines used to activate disciplines and abilities it is drained with each use and can be replenished by drinking from rats visiting blood banks or drinking from humans by attacking or seducing them player can feed on enemies during combat drinking from innocents for too long can kill them costing a character humanity points players are penalized for using certain vampiric abilities in front of witnesses exposing their existence loses masquerade points although additional masquerade points can be earned from quests and other actions violating masquerade five times draws ire of vampire hunters and loses game player has humanity points representing vampire s humanity some actions cost humanity points a low humanity score alters available dialog options to become more aggressive and increases chance of entering a frenzied state and embarking on a killing spree when vampire s blood is low this frenzy can also be triggered by a large amount of damage like masquerade points losing all humanity points ends game with vampire becoming a mindless beast some areas known as elysium prevent use of disciplines or weapons players can

fate farewell vampire development conception thumb alt three middle aged men stand together facing camera and smiling troika games co founders jason anderson l tim cain m and leonard boyarsky development of vampire masquerade bloodlines began at troika games in november 2001 developers wanted to put a role playing game in a first person setting believing that genre had become stale troika approached publisher activision with its idea activision suggested using vampire masquerade license used a year earlier in nihilistic software s vampire masquerade redemption which had experienced sufficient success to merit a sequel instead of developing a sequel to redemption development team researched white wolf property including game s rules and its storylines troika was a small game studio with five developers and a total staff of thirty two including lead writer brian mitsoda who joined team less than a year after development began although some preliminary designs and levels were completed much of work was abandoned or redeveloped troika wanted to make a 3d game but was uncertain whether to build a new game engine or license an existing one and whether to use first or third person at that time source game engine was being built by valve corporation valve employee scott lynch approached troika about using engine and it was first external team to use it troika chose source for its facial animation and lip synching system since it wanted players to speak to characters face to face since engine was in development with bloodlines and valve s own half life 2 troika was working with unfamiliar code and tools forcing it to write its own code to compensate for unfinished engine and with only a single source for technical support troika developed a lighting system to create distinctive moody illumination for nighttime setting a particle system for special effects accompanying vampire disciplines and a cloth system for clothing flow source lacked its later artificial intelligence ai coding and troika s code worked poorly with source engine writing many of central plot elements existed before designer brian mitsoda s involvement prince anarchs being upset aspects of gehenna storyline and jack and sarcophagus as a major subplot designers broadly tied overarching story into each hub and level each designer controlled their assigned section of game and working with a small team enabled quick decision making and ease in keeping plot elements consistent mitsoda became primary writer for many of characters and their quests dialog and side content in game such as emails which helped retain a consistent narrative he was given freedom with respect to script with no restrictions on language or content and could rewrite characters when he thought his initial draft weak although story was developed by troika it is inspired by white wolf s time of judgment novels about a vampire apocalypse bloodlines story was accepted as canonical by white wolf with game serving as a prequel to time of judgment and including characters from white wolf game such as jack discussing character design mitsoda said he tried to disguise need for characters who simply point a player in an appropriate direction you need a character to pose a problem or give out a quest or be a barrier of some kind i don t like to make character outright say i need you to do x then i ll give you y it makes character into an automated quest kiosk i like characters to come off like people actually do they don t say hi when strangers come knocking they say who hell are you or they re expecting you and know more than they let on or they don t care i don t like my characters to be standing around as if their lives begin when character starts talking to them and end when player leaves single purpose characters needed a distinctive personality trait to quickly establish them with player rather than serving as a disposable item while major characters had to reflect player s progression and actions through game mitsoda wrote characters by thinking about who each character was assigning them motivations determining why they were where they were what they thought about player and what they wanted from them in accordance with a suggestion by fellow writer chad moore malkavian player character has a dialog script distinct from that of other eight clans mitsoda said it was one of simpler aspects of development cycle he wrote malkavian script last with time running out on development and overwork and lack of sleep contributed to what mitsoda considered an unhealthy state of mind ideal for writing insane dialog he wanted to highlight their madness without making it comical since story is set during camarilla s takeover of los angeles team simplified plot by only allowing player to belong to one of la based clans design thumb upright left alt double image of blonde female vampire bloodlines underwent many modifications during its three year development above original character model of jeanette in a hollywood club below final model in a santa monica club troika co founder jason anderson s research on vampire masquerade source material and fansites found that character interaction and involvement in vampire societies not statistics and powers was game s main attraction troika tried to remain true to pen and paper role playing game hoping not to alienate game s fans but rules designed for multiple players did not translate well to single player computer game design team attempted to discover which elements could work equally well in pen and paper and computer games although much of character system and attributes translated not all attributes such as knowledge of law made sense in computer game of 30 pen and paper abilities 15 reached final design another difficult area was feats although common feats worked well with a random chance of success or failure uncommon ones would appear to fail more often to avoid this randomization was replaced by a degree of difficulty in accomplishing feat although pen and paper falling damage is random computer game bases damage on distance of fall team s biggest challenge was adapting disciplines pen and paper version may require a little blood that requires a long time to use or have no blood cost and can be used at will upgraded disciplines had additional requirements considered too confusing for a computer game troika attempted to equalize disciplines keeping effect intact and normalizing cost so a first level power requires one blood point a second level two points and so on to balance clans aristocratic ventrue were only allowed to feed on noble blood though this was changed to allow them to feed on lower class humans receiving less blood during character creation game had an optional character biography with unique positive and negative characteristics increasing one ability while limiting another this was removed from released game activision felt that there was insufficient test time and removing it was a more stable option team s previous experience was with turn based combat games and it struggled to develop a real time combat system affected by customizable attributes and abilities that provided feedback to player on how those statistics were affecting battle it initially found that by adhering too closely to white wolf source material rules for guns where effectiveness of a shot is determined in a contest between player s skill and opponent s defense firearms seemed broken player would not hit where they aimed troika found it difficult to mesh available factors in a real time setting melee combat had to deal with a variety of melee weapons and animations and adjust for melee on melee and melee on ranged combat troika used first person perspective to immerse player in setting interacting face to face with characters and seeing their facial reactions to player it chose to follow a single character to aid immersion creating isolation of a vampire unable to trust any other character this aided story and compensated for technical issues of allowing multiple player characters choice is a significant aspect of game requiring a non linear design to accommodate customized characters level design began with a list of factors such as disciplines stealth and feats each area had to be viable for a shooting character sufficient ammunition a discipline focused character sufficient blood sources to keep powers fueled and a melee specialist to reach enemies without being killed with stealth options and option combinations level design began with a focus on stealth taking into consideration positioning of guards and character s potential stealth capability at that point in game then direct combat heavy and dialog paths were added amusement arcade area was to feature playable versions of activision arcade games such as pitfall though idea was abandoned due to time constraints director leonard boyarsky considered animation system important in team s choice of source engine integrated tool allowed troika to customize facial animations expressions gestures and lip synching eliminating need to explain what a character was doing every non player character required a voiceover which helped troika define its characters more quickly engine had a physics system permitting new features such as monsters hurling corpses at player or dying characters realistically crumbling into pieces instead of requiring pre built animations although troika had ignored first person engines due to technical limitations such as a low polygon count and limited texture memory as technology improved it thought it could create a real time action game without sacrificing immersion and story of a role playing game describing choice of developing a game based on existing white wolf property over creating their own boyarsky said that although an original property lacked constraints of an existing one downside was that it had not been tested and could be rejected by its potential audience an existing property was proven troika tried to stay as close as possible to white wolf rules while reducing number of abilities and disciplines to those relevant to bloodlines gameplay later development thumb upright alt a middle aged man facing camera and smiling video game producer david mullich was assigned to team over a year after development had begun activision introduced game in may 2003 but in october valve experienced a security breach in which hackers stole source code for half life 2 breach required new security implementations for engine delaying both games release of bloodlines was postponed until early 2005 until may 2004 troika and activision said that game would feature a multiplayer component and modes including a team of vampires against a team of vampire hunters with ability to upgrade characters between each round team was left without a producer by activision for over a year before david mullich was assigned to project with no producer oversight mullich found game s design incomplete game levels created and abandoned and several technical issues including problems with code for proposed multiplayer option source multiplayer code was in its infancy increasing its development time and idea was abandoned in addition to problems with source engine designers found that game s scope exceeded their resources bloodlines has several styles of gameplay requiring different interfaces animations and artificial intelligence for stealth and melee combat and first or third person capability compared to contemporary first person shooters with 10 to 20 animated character models bloodlines had over 150 characters with 3 000 unique animations in addition to boss characters with their own styles of movement designers underestimated length of time required to develop and improve these systems game s scope suffered from content not being removed when necessary other components would be endlessly refined without being finalized preventing developers from focusing on other parts of game system all content additionally required approval by white wolf and activision after three years in development game was progressing slowly and it was unknown when it would be finished activision set a series of deadlines for project s development to ensure troika would have sufficient time to effectively test game though these milestones were repeatedly extended and bloodlines eventually ran over budget in 2003 activision intervened ordering that game be ready for release in next few months and even advancing more money to troika to complete its work on temple of elemental evil for atari freeing troika team to work on bloodlines exclusively activision eventually issued an ultimatum that project be finished within months on september 15 2004 troika delivered a version of bloodlines on required date due to its scale game underwent three weeks of testing activision decided that game was suitable for release but was contractually bound to withhold bloodlines until after debut of half life 2 in november 2004 troika convinced activision to use delay to fund further development additional budget was not enough to pay all of troika s staff and some employees worked unpaid to complete project this version underwent another three weeks of testing to become final release code game was still unfinished when activision forced its release bloodlines creative director jason anderson blamed activision saying that publisher took game from troika without providing enough time to test and polish it conversely boyarsky defended activision for supporting troika as project exceeded its budget and schedule during nearly four years of development anderson estimated that team worked overtime for all but two months music game s original score was composed and produced by rik schaffer troika licensed many songs for game and posters for real bands are featured on walls of game s clubs soundtrack was released as a limited edition cd to customers who pre ordered game through best buy it features nine tracks by artists including daniel ash chiasm tiamat darling violetta genitorturers and lacuna coil bloodlines performed by al jourgensen and ministry was composed and performed specifically for game licensed tracks were chosen by activision without input from troika song angel by massive attack was used as a placeholder on game s menu screen troika was unable to obtain rights to use song in finished game and tasked schaffer with creating something similar release thumb left alt three young women dressed as sexy vampires models as some of game s clans during a promotion for game at e3 2003 vampire masquerade bloodlines was released on november 16 2004 in competition with half life 2 metal gear solid 3 snake eater halo 2 and several other titles valve s contract for troika s use of source engine guaranteed that bloodlines could not be released before half life 2 and could not be introduced to public until after announcement of half life 2 over eighteen months after development began in february 2004 game was scheduled for release in spring 2005 partially to avoid competing with half life 2 and competitive christmas period before activision moved date to november 2004 activision obtained model erin layne to play jeanette in promotional material for game layne worked with bloodlines artist tim bradstreet for a day to provide poses chosen by activision to represent jeanette in game s posters clothing and other items despite generally favorable reviews bloodlines initial release sold 72 000 copies and earned approximately 3 4 million in sales below troika s other games arcanum of steamworks and magick obscura 234 000 units 8 8 million and temple of elemental evil 128 000 units 5 2 million in comparison bloodlines release competitor half life 2 had sold 6 5 million copies by 2008 bloodlines relative failure contributed to demise of troika games shortly after its debut most of development staff were laid off remaining staff tried to patch bloodlines and develop game concepts to secure funding to keep troika in business troika unable to obtain further funding from activision or other publishers released its employees in two waves first in november 2004 followed by remaining staff in december except for its three founders anderson boyarsky and tim cain some employees worked without pay to fix game when company closed in february 2005 it had secured no other game development deals that month boyarsky confirmed that troika had not been working on a patch for game since most of its staff were gone since december 2004 in a 2006 interview anderson said that although troika games library had been critically well received consistent technical issues had marred perception of company s games contributing to troika s difficulty in obtaining new projects in 2013 mitsoda said that bloodlines was released at worst possible time most people didn t even know we were out fans and troika developers are always going to wonder what game could have been like with another six months in a 2017 interview boyarsky echoed mitsoda s sentiments saying that a further three to six months of development time could have allowed troika to address many technical flaws but he was unsure that they could have resolved larger issues he said i feel second half of game isn t as good as first i feel like we devolved into relying too much on combat at end boyarsky noted that it was impossible to know if fixes would have made bloodlines more successful or if it would have remained a niche product he said it might have been too early for people to appreciate it but we ll never know game fared better following its release on valve s steam digital distribution service in march 2007 where as of 2015 it has sold 492 000 copies unofficial patches have been created by game s fans to address bloodlines technical problems and restore missing and incomplete content after experiencing problems with first versions of an unofficial patch created by dan upright analytical chemist werner spahl continued patching game from version 1 2 with permission and instructions game community tested spahl s patches providing reports on bugs and spelling errors although game s complexity meant that repairing one aspect often broke another as work on patches progressed spahl began restoring removed and incomplete content in game files adding quests items weapons and characters with fan help to provide voice acting models and reinstating whole levels spahl contacted former troika staff for insight into their intentions for cut content a library area for example was restored after mitsoda told spahl only that it was somehow connected to a main character and a sabbat boss and was meant to look like real world los angeles library a fan traveled to real library to gather notes on its layout and co developed in game area with spahl schaffer also provided spahl with unreleased scores from game changes altered original game so much that spahl was criticized by some of game s fans this resulted in two patch versions a basic version fixing game s technical issues and a plus version with additional content as of 2016 game has over 10 years of post release support with release of version 9 x of patch which are also included in version of game sold on gog com distribution service boyarsky voiced his support for unofficial patches saying they ve found stuff that we hoped people would find about game in terms of different paths you can take and how it played differently for every class boyarsky said that while he would have preferred that game was more successful at launch that people were still playing and modifying it made troika s efforts feel more worthwhile reception vampire masquerade bloodlines received a mixed response with reviewers praising its writing and presentation and criticizing its technical problems aggregating review website metacritic provides a score of 80 out of 100 based on 61 reviews game has been called a flawed masterpiece by critics

technical problems should be remembered according to game may not be polished and may end with a sigh instead of a shout but for its ambition alone it deserves stream after stream of compliments

described bloodlines as deus ex with vampires ign appreciated bloodlines rewarding exploration outside main story and new york times and gamespy praised its wonderfully imaginative missions reviewers

more social skills than combat abilities gamespy said that it had never seen a role playing game so affected by player actions with everything from clan choice and character build to actions in missions influencing future options and dialog its writing was consistently praised by reviewers narrative was considered deep successfully using white wolf s vampire masquerade content eurogamer said

exploitative and were explored honestly and intelligently by a knowledgeable writer game s characters were praised for their memorable developed personalities with most major characters possessing their own backstory and presented as living people instead of ciphers its ending had a mixed response with some reviewers appreciating their ability to choose one of game s four endings adding an incentive to replay game and others considering ending anti climactic gamespot and gamespy called dialog sharply written with many memorable lines eurogamer noted that characters frequent use of vulgar language worked written as real people such language fit their character rather than giving game an adult veneer website appreciated breadth of dialog options allowing player greater control of how to play their character pc zone opined that quantity of well written dialog did not guarantee quality many player choices seemed to have little effect on a conversation s outcome and best response was often most obvious voice acting was repeatedly praised for actors quality and amount of voice work due to many dialog options much of bloodlines criticism focused on technical problems when it was released undermining game experience or making it unplayable several reviewers noted errors which closed game and typographical errors in on screen text others cited frequent sometimes lengthy load times encountered while moving between hubs and entering or exiting buildings and areas gamespot called game s artificial intelligence poor often causing enemies to rush at an armed player fire at them from too great a distance to be effective or become immobilized while waiting for player s next attack ign noted that stealth broke ai allowing traps to be triggered and leaving assailants standing still unable to locate a hidden player gamespy said that source engine was bloodlines greatest weakness although rpg aspects were game s strong suit features of source engine such as first person shooting were where it stumbled combat was also criticized reviewers called it poor clumsy and unsatisfactory complaining that bloodlines favors melee combat firearms were weak unwieldy and slow even for characters specializing in guns pc zone however called first person shooting entertaining and challenging although melee combat was criticized as sluggish and difficult due to enemy attacks interrupting player s reviewers considered it overpowered according to gamespot a boss character was killed with melee weapons on a first attempt after repeated failure to do so with a gun new york times found unavoidable combat in last part of game to be so difficult that they had to cheat to succeed stealth was criticized with ign noting that even with low stealth skill it was possible to sneak around many enemies and feed from a guard without alerting another guard next to them gamespot opined that some of best missions were stealth based as combat was more straightforward accolades in 2004 ign named bloodlines best pc rpg of that year and gamespy called ocean house hotel quest level of year in 2005 computer gaming world called it role playing game of 2004 saying that it offered a deep balanced character creation system a truckload of interesting quests a good story and great npcs to interact with computer games magazine nominated bloodlines for its 2004 best writing award
