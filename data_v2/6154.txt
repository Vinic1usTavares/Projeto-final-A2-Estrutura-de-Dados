pownall wrote a letter to william pitt requesting leave to return to england because i might be of some service there biographer john schutz speculates that underlying reason for pownall s request were related to frustration with his exclusion from major military actions of later war years and possibly his desire to acquire a more significant post such as a governor generalship of conquered new france historian bernard bailyn is of opinion that pownall s divisive dislike and distrust of shirley supporters like thomas hutchinson and ensuing local political infighting contributed to request as did his difficult relationships with military commanders bailyn p 44 whatever reason board of trade engaged in a reshuffling of colonial positions after king george ii died and pownall was given

him as supportive of american liberty although he feared that britain was losing control of its colonies he wrote that americans were entitled to same rights of representative government as their fellow subjects in england scotland and wales at same time he insisted that military protection that colonists received from britain created equally extensive obligations to help pay for some of cost
