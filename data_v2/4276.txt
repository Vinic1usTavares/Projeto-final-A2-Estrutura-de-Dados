while erzherzog ferdinand max and erzherzog friedrich were commissioned in 1907 three erzherzog karl class battleships were considered relatively modern by time they were commissioned however small docking space and budget restraints resulted in class being fairly compact nevertheless they were well designed and properly protected erzherzog karl class were last and largest pre dreadnoughts built by austrian navy they were named after members of austrian royal family despite these qualities erzherzog karl class battleships were inferior to more modern dreadnought type battleships with their all big gun armament and turbine propulsion as a result they only played a limited role during world war i at beginning of war members of erzherzog karl class formed iii division of austrian hungarian

could move ship along at a speed of on trials erzherzog karls engines managed to produce a knot more speed than was originally planned armament as with that was planned to be built 13 years later erzherzog karl class carried a primary armament made by skoda works on each ship there were four 40 caliber guns in two twin turrets on centerline these guns were an austro hungarian replica of 24 cm 40 9 4 krupp c 94 which was used on habsburgs guns could be depressed to 5deg and elevated to 30deg arc of fire of guns was 300deg or 150deg in each direction each gun required a crew of twenty men at maximum elevation gun could fire a shell they could fire three to four armor piercing shells per minute at a muzzle velocity of each of guns weighed at least their secondary armament consisted of twelve 42 caliber guns also made by skoda mounted in eight single casemates on either wing of ship and two single midships turrets on either wing of ship they could be depressed to 3deg and elevated to 20deg they could fire a armor piercing shell at maximum elevation with a muzzle velocity of gun weighed 12 1 tons and could fire three rounds per minute ships had a tertiary armament for protection against torpedo boats in form of 45 caliber gun too manufactured by skoda they could be depressed to 10deg and elevated to 20 and had an arc of fire of 360deg meaning that they could fire at any target within their range of fire guns could fire about ten to fifteen rounds per minute at their maximum elevation guns could fire a high explosive charge at a muzzle velocity of anti aircraft and airship protection was covered by four vickers anti aircraft guns on ship they could be depressed to 5deg and elevated to 80deg they had an arc of fire of 360deg which meant that they also could engage any target within their range manually operated by only one crewman they could fire a shell at maximum elevation with a muzzle velocity of designed in 1910 each of guns weighed after 1916 17
