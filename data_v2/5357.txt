a dart sac love darts are made in sexually mature animals only and are used as part of sequence of events during courtship before actual mating takes place darts are quite large compared to size of animal in case of semi slug genus parmarion length of a dart can be up to one fifth that of semi slug s foot process of using love darts in snails is a form of sexual selection tales of two snails sexual selection and sexual conflict in lymnaea and helix aspersa oxford journals prior to copulation each of two snails or slugs attempts to shoot one or more darts into other snail or slug there is no organ to receive dart this action is more analogous to a stabbing or to being shot with an arrow or dart does not fly through air to reach its target however instead it is fired as a contact shot love dart is not a stylet in other words this is not an accessory organ for sperm transfer exchange of sperm between both of two land snails is a completely separate part of mating progression nevertheless recent research shows that use of dart can strongly favor reproductive outcome for snail that is able to lodge a dart in its partner this is because mucus on dart introduces a hormone like substance that allows far more of its sperm to survive love darts also known as shooting darts or just as darts are shaped in many distinctive ways which vary considerably between species what all shapes of love darts have in common is their harpoon like or needle like ability to pierce thumb 250px courting cornu aspersum snails in ireland one on right has a fired love dart embedded in its

love dart s dart sac bursa telae d love penis mating begins with a courting ritual for example in land snails of genus helix including escargot helix pomatia and common garden snail helix aspersa also known as cornu aspersum and cantareus aspersus copulation is preceded by an elaborate tactile courtship two snails circle around each other for up to six hours touching with their tentacles and biting lips and area of genital pore which shows some preliminary signs of eversion of penis as snails approach mating hydraulic pressure builds up in blood sinus surrounding organ housing dart each snail manoeuvres to get its genital pore in best position close to other snail s body then when body of one snail touches other snail s genital pore it triggers firing of dart darting can sometimes be so forceful that dart ends up buried in internal organs reproductive behaviour 2008 in encyclopaedia britannica retrieved 3 october 2008 from encyclopaedia britannica online it can also happen that a

entirely and is protruding on other side after both snails have fired their darts snails copulate and exchange sperm a snail does not have a dart to fire very first time it mates because first mating is necessary to trigger process of dart formation once a snail has mated it fires a dart before some but not all subsequent matings a snail often mates without having a dart to use mating and

either fail to penetrate skin or miss target altogether are snails love darts source of cupid lore mcgill tribune 13 february 2002 snails have only very simple visual systems and cannot see well enough to use vision to help aim darts function although existence and use of love darts in snails has been known for at least several centuries until recently actual function of love darts was not properly understood it was long assumed that darts had some sort of stimulating function and served to make copulation more likely it was also suggested that darts might be a gift of calcium these theories have proved to be incorrect recent research has led to a new understanding of function of love darts in which love dart is used by male component to manipulate female component s sperm collection increasing paternity a closer look into behavior of cornu aspersum shows that it is not mechanical action of dart that increases paternity in sperm donors but instead mucus that coats dart mucus carries an allohormone that is transferred into recipient snail s hemolymph when dart is stabbed this allohormone female component of reproductive system in receiving individual bursa sperm digestion organ is closed off and copulatory canal leading to sperm storage is opened this reconfiguration allows more sperm to access sperm storage area and fertilize eggs rather than being digested ultimately this increases shooter s paternity morphology of darts love dart also known as a gypsobelum is often made of calcium carbonate which is secreted by a specialized organ within reproductive system of several families of air breathing snails and slugs mainly in terrestrial pulmonate gastropod mollusks within clade stylommatophora darts can range in size from about long in larger snail species down to about in smallest snails that have darts typically most darts are less than long but they are substantial compared with size of animal thumb 220px right simplified diagram of

of all families mentioned in this article follows taxonomy of gastropoda by bouchet 2005 there is a complex hermaphroditic reproductive system in pulmonate snails those snails that have a lung rather than a gill or gills their reproductive system is completely internal except for active protrusion eversion of penis for copulation outer opening of reproductive system is called genital pore it is positioned on right hand side very close to head of animal this opening is virtually invisible however unless it is actively in use left thumb upright drawing of a transverse section of dart sac also known as bursa telae of helix pomatia during process of creating a new love dart love dart is created and stored before use in a highly muscular internal anatomical structure known as stylophore or dart sac also known as bursa telae exact positioning of stylophore varies but it is in vicinity of penis and vagina where these two structures open into atrium a common area right inside genital pore opening of stylophore leads directly into atrium in certain species in families vitrinidae parmacellidae helminthoglyptidae bradybaenidae urocyclidae ariophantidae and dyakiidae opening of stylophore can instead lead to penis as is case in some species of a subfamily of sagdidae gastrodontidae and onchidiidae alternatively it can lead to vagina as in case in some species of a subfamily of a subfamily of philomycidae other species within bradybaenidae and also in hygromiidae helicidae and dyakiidae only two families have darts present in every species bradybaenidae and in dyakiidae in all other families there is reduction or loss of dart making ability in some of species cf many species have only one dart sac however other species have several snails in family bradybaenidae have more than one dart sac and some species of hygromiidae and have four dart sacs some urocyclidae have up to 70 darts occurrence within pulmonate snails and slugs all pulmonate land snails are hermaphrodites and have a complete and rather elaborate set of both male and female reproductive organs see simplified anatomical diagram above but majority of pulmonate land snails have no love darts and no dart

of love darts because of presence of darts in many superfamilies of stylommatophora it seems likely that love darts appeared during early evolution of pulmonata and that ancestors of stylommatophora

others are bladed or vaned in some cases blades on sides of dart are bifurcated or divided into two parts some darts are shaped like a needle or a thorn others have a tip like an arrowhead or look

like structures in other gastropod groups toxoglossans marine gastropods in predatory superfamily known as toxoglossans meaning poison tongue use a poison dart or harpoon which is a single modified radula tooth which is created inside mouth of snail and which is primarily made of chitin these snails are carnivorous hunters harpoon is used in predation when snail is close to its prey it extends its proboscis a considerable distance then it fires its harpoon and injects a toxin into prey for most species of toxoglossans prey is marine worms but in case of some larger cone snails prey is small
