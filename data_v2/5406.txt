decided to form a company to be known as albany zouave cadets to drill and contest honors with chicago cadets not dreaming of great rebellion which was soon to follow sic during american civil war more than 50 zouave units existed in union army alone with additional zouave forces raised by confederate states however units inspired by chicago zouaves later found zouave uniform impractical in combat conditions with colorful chasseur trousers making easy targets of their wearers during american civil war zouave units soon switched to more conventional uniforms though in post war era zouave
