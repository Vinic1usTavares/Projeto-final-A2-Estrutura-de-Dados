george washington february 22 1732 december 14 1799 commanded continental army in american revolutionary war 1775 1783 after serving as president of united states 1789 to 1797 he briefly was in charge of a new army in 1798 washington despite his youth played a major role in frontier wars against french and indians in 1750s and 1760s he played leading military role in american revolution when war broke out with battles of lexington and concord in april 1775 congress appointed him first commander in chief of new continental army on june 14 task he took on was enormous balancing regional demands competition among his subordinates morale among rank and file attempts by congress to manage army s affairs too closely requests by state governors for support and an endless need for resources with which to feed clothe equip arm and move troops he was not usually in command of many state militia units in early years of war washington was often in middle of action first directing siege of boston to its successful conclusion but then losing new york city and almost losing new jersey before winning surprising and decisive victories at trenton and princeton at end of 1776 campaign season at end of year in both 1775 and 1776 he had to deal with expiring enlistments since congress had only authorized army s existence for single years with 1777 establishment of a more permanent army structure and introduction of three year enlistments washington built a reliable stable of experienced troops although hard currency and supplies of all types were difficult to come by in 1777 washington was again defeated in defense of philadelphia but sent critical support to horatio gates that made defeat of burgoyne at saratoga possible following a difficult winter at valley forge and entry of france into war in 1778 washington followed british army as it withdrew from philadelphia back to new york and fought an ultimately inconclusive battle at monmouth court house in new jersey washington s activities from late 1778 to 1780 were more diplomatic and organizational as his army remained outside new york watching sir henry clinton s army that occupied city washington strategized with french on how best to cooperate in actions against british leading to ultimately unsuccessful attempts to dislodge british from newport rhode island and savannah georgia his attention was also drawn to frontier war which prompted 1779 continental army expedition of john sullivan into upstate new york when general clinton sent turncoat general benedict arnold to raid in virginia washington began to detach elements of his army to face growing threat there arrival of lord cornwallis in virginia after campaigning in south presented washington with an opportunity to strike a decisive blow washington s army and french army moved south to face cornwallis and a cooperative french navy under admiral de grasse successfully disrupted british attempts to control of chesapeake bay completing entrapment of cornwallis who surrendered after siege of yorktown in october 1781 although yorktown marked end of significant hostilities in north america british still occupied new york and other cities so washington had to maintain army in face of a bankrupt congress and troops that were at times mutinous over conditions and pay army was formally disbanded after peace in 1783 and washington resigned his commission as commander in chief on december 23 1783 military experience born into a well to do virginia family near fredericksburg in washington was schooled locally until age of 15 early death

to boycott british goods until acts were repealed freeman and harwell pp 174 176 parliament repealed townshend acts in 1770 and for washington at least crisis had passed however washington regarded

input with state appointments filling lower ranks results of his general staff were mixed as some of his favorites never mastered art of command such as john sullivan eventually he found capable officers such as nathanael greene daniel morgan henry knox chief of artillery and alexander hamilton chief of staff american officers never equaled their opponents in tactics and maneuver and they

resistance to crown serving as representative man of revolution his long term strategy was to maintain an army in field at all times and eventually this strategy worked his enormous personal and political stature and his political skills kept congress army french militias and states all pointed toward a common goal furthermore he permanently established principle of civilian supremacy in military affairs by voluntarily resigning his commission and disbanding his army when war was won rather than declaring himself monarch he also helped to overcome distrust of a standing army by his constant reiteration that well disciplined professional soldiers counted for twice as much as poorly trained and led militias lengel general george washington 2005 pp 365 71 intelligence george

of agents on both intelligence and counterintelligence missions he was adept at deception operations and tradecraft and was a skilled propagandist he also practiced sound operational security see

chernow washington a life 2010 pp 379 86 as an intelligence manager washington insisted that terms of an agent s employment and his instructions be precise and in writing he emphasized his desire for receiving written rather than verbal reports he demanded repeatedly that intelligence reports be expedited reminding his officers of those bits of intelligence he had received which had become because of delay in getting them to him he also recognized need for developing many different sources so that their reports could be cross checked and so that compromise of one source would not cut off flow

military bearing of a military leader and was known as a strong patriot he was also popular in his home province there was no other serious competition for post although washington did nothing to actively pursue appointment massachusetts delegate john adams nominated washington believing that appointing a southerner to lead what was then primarily an army of northerners would help unite

adjutant brigadier general horatio gates and major general charles lee both of whom had significant experience serving in british army lengel p 94 109 111 when inventory returns exposed a dangerous shortage of gunpowder washington asked for new sources british arsenals were raided including some in west indies and some manufacturing was attempted a barely adequate supply about 2 5 million pounds was obtained by end of 1776 mostly from france in search of heavy weapons he sent henry knox on an expedition to fort ticonderoga to retrieve cannons that had been captured there mccullough p 84 he resisted repeated calls from congress to launch attacks against british in boston calling war councils that supported decisions against such action mccullough pp 53 86 before continental navy was established in november 1775 he without congressional authorization began arming a secret navy to prey on poorly protected british transports and supply ships nelson p 86 when congress authorized an invasion of quebec believing that province s people would also rise against british military control washington reluctantly went along with it ferling 2010 p 94 even authorizing benedict arnold to lead a force from cambridge to quebec city through wilderness of present day maine lengel p 113 as siege dragged on matter of expiring enlistments became a matter of serious concern lengel p 114 washington tried to convince congress that enlistments longer than one year were necessary to build an effective fighting force but he was rebuffed in this effort 1776 establishment of continental

destination washington rushed most of army there schecter pp 67 90 defeated at new york city washington s success in boston was not repeated in new york congress insisted that he defend it and recognizing city s importance as a naval base and gateway to hudson river washington delegated task of fortifying new york to charles lee in february 1776 lengel p 179 faltering military campaign in quebec also led to calls for additional troops there and washington detached six regiments northward under john sullivan in april johnston p 63 wider theaters of war had also introduced regional frictions into army somewhat surprised that regional differences would be a problem on august 1 he read a speech to army in which he threatened to punish any officers or soldiers so lost to virtue and a love of their country that might exacerbate regional differences flexner 1968 p 93 mixing of forces from different regions also brought more widespread camp diseases especially dysentery and smallpox washington had to deal with his first major command controversy while in new york which was partially a product of regional friction new england troops serving in northern new york under general philip schuyler a scion of an old patroon family of new york objected to his aristocratic style and their congressional representatives lobbied washington to replace schuyler with general gates washington tried to resolve issue by giving gates command of forces in quebec but collapse of quebec expedition brought renewed complaints flexner 1968 p 99 despite gates experience washington personally preferred schuyler to avoid a potentially messy situation general washington gave schuyler overall command of northern department but assigned gates as second in command with combat authority episode exposed washington to gates desire for advancement possibly at his expense and to latter s influence in congress flexner 1968 p 100 general howe s army reinforced by thousands of additional troops from europe and a fleet under command of his brother admiral richard howe began arriving entrance of new york harbor at narrows in early july and made an unopposed landing on staten island fischer p 34 without intelligence about howe s intentions washington was forced to divide his still poorly trained forces principally between manhattan and long island fischer pp 83 89 howes

general george washington and his representatives refused to accept them ketchum pp 103 104 thumb left washington leads retreat from long island in august british finally launched their campaign to capture new york city they first landed on long island in force and flanked washington s forward positions in battle of long island general howe refused to act on a significant tactical advantage that could have resulted in capture of remaining continental troops on long island but he chose instead to besiege fortified positions to which they had retreated fischer pp 89 102 although washington has been criticized by many historians for sending additional troops to reinforce redoubts on long island it was clear to both washington and howes that americans had successfully blocked east river against major shipping by sinking ships in channel and that he was consequently not risking entrapment of additional men flexner 1968 p 113 in face of a siege he seemed certain to lose washington then decided to withdraw in what some historians call one of his greatest military feats he executed a nighttime withdrawal from long island across east river to manhattan to save those troops and materiel howe brothers then paused to consolidate their position and admiral engaged in a fruitless peace conference with congressional representatives on september 11 four days later british landed on manhattan a bombardment from river scattering inexperienced militia into a panicked retreat and forcing washington to retreat further fischer pp 102 107 after washington stopped british advance up manhattan at harlem heights on september 16 howe again made a flanking maneuver landing troops at pell s point in a bid to cut off washington s avenue of retreat to defend against this move washington withdrew most of his army to white plains where after a short battle on october 28 he retreated further north this isolated remaining continental army troops in upper manhattan so howe returned to manhattan and captured fort washington in mid november taking almost 3 000 prisoners four days later fort lee across hudson river from fort washington was also taken washington brought much of his army across hudson into new jersey but was immediately forced to retreat by aggressive british advance fischer pp 107 125 during campaign a general lack of organization shortages of supplies fatigue sickness and above all lack of confidence in american leadership resulted in a melting away of untrained regulars and frightened militia washington grumbled honor of making a brave defense does not seem to be sufficient stimulus when success is very doubtful and falling into enemy s hands probable fischer p 101 washington was fortunate that general howe was more focused on gaining control of new york than on destroying washington s army gruber p 133 howe s overly rigid adherence to his plans meant that he was unable to capitalize on opportunities that arose during campaign for a decisive action against washington billias p 55 counterattack in new jersey thumb right 200px washington crossing delaware by emanuel leutze 1851 after loss of new york washington s army was in two pieces one

spirits were low popular support was wavering and congress had abandoned philadelphia fearing a british attack fischer pp 138 142 washington ordered general gates to bring troops from fort ticonderoga and also ordered general lee s troops which he had left north of new york city to join him fischer p 150 lee whose relationship with washington was at times difficult made excuses and only traveled as far as morristown new jersey when lee strayed too far from his army on december 12 his exposed position was betrayed by loyalists and a british company led by lieutenant colonel banastre tarleton surrounded inn where he was staying and took him prisoner lee s command was taken over by john sullivan who finished marching army to washington s camp across river from trenton schecter pp 262 266 capture of lee resulted an important point in negotiations between sides concerning treatment of prisoners since lee had previously served in british army he was treated as a deserter and threatened with military punishments appropriate to that charge even though he and lee did not get on well washington threatened to treat captured british officers in same manner lee and other high profile prisoners were treated lengel p 289 this resulted in an improvement in lee s captivity and he was eventually exchanged for richard prescott in 1778 leckie p 471 despite loss of troops due to desertion and expiring enlistments washington was heartened by a rise in militia enlistments in new jersey and pennsylvania fischer pp 196 200 these militia companies were active in circumscribing furthest outposts of british limiting their ability to scout and forage ketchum pp 228 230 although washington did not coordinate this resistance he took advantage of it to organize an attack on an outpost of hessians in trenton fischer p 201 on night of december 25 26 1776 washington led his forces across delaware river and surprised hessian garrison capturing 1 000 men ketchum pp 250 275 thumb left

than 6 000 men and marched most of them against a position washington had taken south of trenton leaving a garrison of 1 200 at princeton cornwallis then attacked washington s position on january 2 1777 and was three times repulsed before darkness set in fischer pp 209 307 during night washington evacuated position masking his army s movements by instructing camp guards to maintain appearance of a much larger force ketchum p 294 washington then circled around cornwallis s position with intention of attacking princeton garrison schecter p 267 hugh mercer leading american advance guard encountered british soldiers from princeton under command of charles mawhood british troops engaged mercer and in ensuing battle mercer was mortally wounded washington sent reinforcements under general john cadwalader which were successful in driving mawhood and british from princeton with many of them fleeing to cornwallis in trenton british lost more than one quarter of their force in battle and american morale rose with victory schecter p 268 these unexpected victories drove british back to new york city area and gave a dramatic boost to revolutionary morale leckie pp 333 335 during winter washington based in winter quarters at morristown loosely coordinated a low level militia war against british positions in new jersey combining actions of new jersey and pennsylvania militia companies with careful use of continental army resources to harry and harass british and german troops quartered in new jersey fischer pp 354 382 washington s mixed performance in 1776 campaigns had not led to significant criticism in congress before fleeing philadelphia for baltimore in december congress granted washington powers that have ever since been described as dictatorial ketchum p 211 successes in new jersey nearly deified washington in eyes of some congressmen and body became much more deferential to him as a result ferling 2010 p 126 john adams complained of

renewed delivery of french supplies leckie p 335 philadelphia and valley forge early maneuvers in may 1777 uncertain whether general howe would move north toward albany or south toward philadelphia washington moved his army to middlebrook encampment in new jersey s watchung mountains when howe then moved his army southwest from new brunswick washington correctly interpreted this as a move to draw him out of his strong position and refused to move only after howe apparently retreated back toward shore did washington follow but howe s attempt to separate him from his mountain defenses was foiled in battle of short hills in late june leckie pp 344 346 howe who had already decided to campaign against philadelphia then withdrew from new jersey embarked much of his army on ships in late july and sailed away leaving washington mystified as to his destination leckie p 346 thumb left general william howe washington s difficulty in discerning howe s motives was due to presence of a british army moving south from quebec toward fort ticonderoga under command of general john burgoyne howe s departure was in part prompted by successful capture of fort by burgoyne in early july ferling 2010 p 128 although there had been an expectation on burgoyne s part that howe would support his campaign to gain control of hudson howe was to disappoint burgoyne with disastrous consequences to british leckie p 377 when washington learned of abandonment of ticonderoga which he had been told by general anthony wayne can never be carried without much loss of blood furneaux p 58 he was shocked concerned that howe was heading up hudson he ordered arnold leckie p 387 along with daniel morgan and his corps of riflemen north to assist general gates with defense of hudson ellis p 105 washington had had some difficulty with general arnold in spring congress had adopted a per state scheme for promotion of general officers which resulted in promotion of several officers to major general ahead of other officers with more experience or seniority combined with commissioning of foreign officers to high ranks this had led to resignation of john stark arnold who had distinguished himself in canadian campaign had also threatened to resign randall 1990 pp 331 p 386 washington wrote to congress on behalf of arnold and other officers who were disgruntled by this promotion scheme stating that two or three other very good officers might be lost because of it washington had also laid seeds for conflict between arnold and gates when he gave arnold command of forces in rhode island in late 1776 because of this move gates came to view arnold as a competitor for advancement and previously positive relationship between gates and arnold cooled martin p 307 however arnold put aside his complaints when news of ticonderoga s fall arrived and agreed to serve congress at urging of its diplomatic representatives in europe had also issued military commissions to a number of european soldiers of fortune in early 1777 two of those recommended by silas deane marquis de lafayette and thomas conway would prove to be important in washington s activities leckie p 2010 p 149 lafayette just twenty years old was at first told that deane had exceeded his authority in offering him a major general s commission but offered to volunteer in army at his own expense leckie pp 342 343 washington and lafayette took an instant liking to one another when they met and lafayette became one of washington s most trusted generals and confidants lengel p xxix conway on other hand did not think highly of washington s leadership and proved to be a source of trouble in 1777 campaign season and its aftermath lengel pp xxii xxv fall of philadelphia when washington learned that howe s fleet was sailing north in chesapeake bay he hurried his army south of philadelphia to defend city against howe s threat leckie p 348 general howe turned washington s flank at battle of brandywine on september 11 1777 and marched unopposed into philadelphia on september 26 after some further maneuvers washington s failure to defend capital brought on a storm of criticism from congress which fled city for york and from other army officers in part to silence his critics washington planned an elaborate assault on an exposed british base in germantown leckie pp 356 p 253 october 4 battle of germantown failed in part due to complexity of assault and inexperience of militia forces employed in it over 400 of washington s men were captured including colonel george mathews and entire 9th

received adulation of congress lengel p 277 while this was taking place washington presided from a distance over loss of control of delaware river to british and marched his army to its winter quarters at valley forge in december lengel pp 263 267 washington chose valley forge over recommendations that he camp either closer or further from philadelphia because it was close enough to monitor british army movements and protected rich farmlands to west from enemy s foraging expeditions leckie p 434 valley forge washington s army stayed at valley forge for next six months leckie pp 435 469 over winter 2 500 men out of 10 000 died from disease and exposure army s difficulties were exacerbated by a number of factors including a quartermaster s department that had been badly mismanaged by one of washington s political opponents thomas mifflin and preference of farmers and merchants to sell their goods to british for hard currency instead of nearly worthless continental currency fleming pp 89 91 profiteers also sought to benefit at army s expense charging it 1 000 times what they charged civilians for same goods congress authorized washington to seize supplies needed for army but he was reluctant to use such authority since it smacked of tyranny war was supposedly being fought over leckie p 435 during winter he introduced a full scale training program supervised by baron von steuben a veteran of prussian general staff despite hardships army suffered this program was a remarkable success and washington s army emerged in spring of 1778 a much more disciplined force leckie pp 438 444 washington himself had to face discontent at his leadership from a variety of sources his loss of philadelphia prompted some members of congress to discuss removing him from command chernow p 316 they were prodded along by washington s detractors in military who included generals gates mifflin and conway chernow p 320 gates in particular was viewed by conway and congressmen benjamin rush and richard henry lee as a desirable replacement for washington fleming pp 93 97 p 450 although there is no evidence of a formal conspiracy episode is known as conway cabal because scale of discontent within army was exposed by a critical letter from conway to gates some of whose contents were relayed to washington leckie pp 445 449 washington exposed criticisms to congress and his supporters within congress and army rallied to support him chernow pp 317 320 gates eventually apologized for his role in affair and conway resigned fleming p p 451 washington s position and authority were not seriously challenged again biographer ron chernow points out that washington s handling of episode demonstrated that he was a consummate political who maintained his temper and dignity while his opponents schemed french entry into war victory at saratoga and to some extent washington s near success at germantown were influential in convincing france to enter war openly as an american ally french entry into war changed its dynamics for british were no longer sure of command of seas and had to worry about an invasion of their home islands and other colonial territories across globe british now under command of general sir henry clinton evacuated philadelphia in 1778 and returned to new york city with washington attacking them along way at battle of monmouth this was last major battle in north prior to battle washington gave command of advance forces to charles lee who had been exchanged earlier in year lee despite firm instructions from washington refused lafayette s suggestion to launch an organized attack on british rear and then retreated when british turned to face him when washington arrived at head of main army he and lee had an angry exchange of words and
