charge steve fossett s family for 687 000 expense of search for fossett kieckhefer later played that early report down when he told tahoe daily tribune that nevada did not intend to demand an involuntary payment from fossett s widow but that such a payment would be voluntary we are going to request that they help offset some of these expenses considering scope of search overall cost as well as our ongoing budget difficulties hotelier barron hilton from whose ranch fossett had departed on day he went missing had previously volunteered 200 000 to help pay for search costs in his later comments to tahoe daily tribune kieckhefer denied outright that a bill for family was being prepared and he said it will probably be in form of a letter which kieckhefer indicated would include a financial outline of steps taken by state associated costs and a mention of state s ongoing budget difficulties days prior to this announcement state emergency management director frank siracusa noted that there is no precedent where government will go after people for costs just because they have money to pay for it you get lost and we look for you it is a service your taxpayer dollars pay for

to review costs incurred by state in searching for fossett but added we are doing an audit but not because we are critical of anybody or suspect something was done wrong chairman morse arberry queried siracusa as to why since they lacked funds had state not billed fossett family for its search costs to which siracusa did not directly respond in his later interview with las vegas review journal he stated that his comments to committee may have given false impression that he had hired an auditor for purpose of later challenging state s financial burden incurred on its behalf by national guard during search operation upon interview regarding reports that state would seek payment arberry was recorded as stating that he was glad to hear steps were being taken to try to recoup some of costs
