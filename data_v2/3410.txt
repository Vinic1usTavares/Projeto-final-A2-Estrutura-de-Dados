delrina was a canadian software company which was founded in 1988 and was subsequently acquired by american software firm symantec in 1995 company sold electronic form products including perform and formflow but was best known for its winfax software package which enabled computers equipped with fax modems to transmit copies of documents to standalone fax machines or other similarly equipped computers delrina also produced a set of screensavers including one that resulted in a well publicized lawsuit for copyright and trademark infringement berkeley systems inc v delrina case set a precedent in american law whereby satiric commercial software products are not subject to same first amendment exemptions as parodic cartoons or literature it also sold online communications software with its wincomm product and produced a web browser called cyberjack firm was sold to symantec in 1995 after company was acquired by symantec various divisions were sold off and several of delrina s former executives went on to found venture capital firms corporate history delrina was founded in toronto in 1988 by zimbabwean expatriate bert amato south african expatriates mark skapinker and dennis bennie and american lou ryan delrina was bennie s third major entrepreneurial start up after co founding mission electronics a high end home entertainment equipment producer and aviva software which became ingram micro canada delrina s business strategy was to establish technical and market leadership in niche markets which it accomplished with its electronic form and pc based fax software a year before firm was incorporated amato and skapinker had quit their jobs to start work on an electronic forms product which would eventually become perform both would later meet with bennie who was then co founder and ceo of ingram micro canada before becoming ceo of carolian systems international a firm that made business software for hewlett packard bennie facilitated an initial seed investment of 1 5 million cad to finance a new start up company delrina to develop this idea in return carolian received 51 of delrina s shares dennis bennie would become chairman and ceo mark skapinker president and bert amato cto of newly formed delrina technology inc delrina s initial corporate headquarters was located in a small office on mount pleasant st in toronto a sales office was set up in san jose california which became its worldwide sales center run by co founder lou ryan from its toronto headquarters company expanded by establishing branch offices in kirkland washington washington dc and lexington massachusetts other offices were later established in united kingdom france and germany origins of perform delrina s initial product offering was an electronic forms application called perform amato and skapinker came up with idea for product while working as consultants that what their clients wanted was a way to fill in forms electronically rather than an easier way to create paper based forms from a computer there was significant and long term uptake of electronic forms products within governmental agencies both in canada and united states latter spurred on in particular by requirements of paperwork reduction act to reduce total amount of paperwork handled by united states government one of firm s early major software deals included a multi year agreement to sell perform to u s navy in 1990 soon after software was installed on compaq laptops that accompanied u s troops during first gulf war where it was used to requisition everything from coca cola to privies other significant volume sales went to 3m and rockwell international what helped set apart delrina s electronic forms from its competitors in product reviews included its easy to use interface its extensive development tools and its comparatively low price it also scored highly when it came to workflow and routing functions as well as security features in early 1991 infoworld selected perform pro as its product of year in electronic forms category and pc world magazine gave product it s best buy designation perform proved to be successful in its niche effectively capturing retail market by 1993 in early 1990s delrina made deals with value added resellers like ncr and ge information services who had staff to customize product to needs of corporate customers looking to move away from paper based forms forms products sold well and annual revenues for firm grew steadily 1989 annual revenues in canadian dollars were 5 630 393 in 1990 they were 8 759 623 and by 1991 they were 11 894 474 struggle for profitability despite growing revenues company struggled to make a profit heavy expenditures primarily marketing along with research and development costs drove firm s losses from 500 000 from 1989 to 1 5 million by end of following fiscal year for fiscal 1991 it posted a net loss of 1 7 million needing an infusion of funds in april 1991 bennie managed to raise 7 7 million in a private placement firm subsequently sought to find ways to more widely distribute its electronic form software with bennie saying in may 1992 that we ve barely scratched surface of our market in early 1992 word leaked to press on a possible merger between wordstar international inc and soon after both firms made public fact that they had signed a letter of intent on a merger deal however just over a month later word came out that merger talks had fallen through at time cited to differences over complex legal accounting and management issues wordstar whose share of word processing market had by that time fallen to 5 from a high of 80 was seeking delrina s advanced technologies while delrina was hoping to utilize other firm s established global sales network despite failure of merger talks bennie said soon after that we re still convinced that a larger sales force would give us kind of marketing clout we need i still believe that it s possible for us to become a global operation not long after wordstar merged with spinnaker software corporation and softkey software products inc to form softkey international delrina subsequently signed deals with wallace computer services and ncr corporation in an effort to gain greater sales distribution of its products development of winfax in a deliberate attempt to diversify business company chose to move into fax software market with its winfax product software developer tony davis another south african expatriate who had moved to canada was initially hired as a consultant to work on forms line of products in late 1980s soon afterwards becoming part of that team in his spare time he developed a prototype of what would become first winfax product with agreement that delrina would be its publisher in 1990 delrina devoted a relatively small space to this new product at that year s comdex a computer trade show under a sign that said simply send a fax from your pc it garnered most attention of any delrina product being demonstrated at that show this interest convinced founding partners of commercial viability of product tony davis went on to sell his product idea to delrina and stayed on as its lead software architect and designer initial version of winfax only worked on fax modems containing a specific chipset and was only capable of sending faxes it could not receive them this was remedied with launch of winfax pro 2 0 product during summer of 1991 one of key factors that differentiated this version of winfax from other fax software packages of time was deliberate attempt to make program compatible with all fax modems prior to introduction of winfax pro 2 0 competitors concentrated primarily on building software that would only work with a single brand of fax modem hardware at same time that it launched its winfax pro 2 0 product delrina also announced an oem version of same product designed to be bundled with new fax modems within a few months eight modem manufacturers had agreed to bundle this oem version called winfax lite of program along with their own product by summer of following year this number had grown to 50 oem partnerships with various fax modem and computer system manufacturers to bundle lite version of delrina s winfax software with their own products by february 1993 this number had grown to over 100 oem partnerships bundling lite version of winfax proved to be lucrative for delrina whenever a person used program for first time and submitted their registration information by fax to company delrina would subsequently mail user an upgrade offer for pro version this sales technique proved to be very effective and firm ended up making most of its sales from these upgrades in order to reach apple computer users in this marketplace delrina acquired solutions inc and their software for macintosh platform in december 1991 which would become delrina fax pro a version of program was also designed for use in dos dosfax pro which was launched in june 1992 initially looking for ways to further improve its electronic forms software in november 1991 delrina had attempted to buy two associated firms that produced optical character recognition ocr software with intention of incorporating ocr functionality into its forms products acquisition deal fell through though by fall 1992 delrina had made a deal with caere corporation to include its ocr software within its products this functionality was incorporated into winfax pro 3 0 in late 1992 and subsequently in formflow despite agreement with caere subsequent version of winfax used xerox s ocr engine instead based on strong sales of winfax by october 1992 delrina posted its first profitable quarter in three years at same time firm also announced its intention to acquire other software firms that sold into consumer software market acquisition of amaze inc in october 1992 delrina acquired amaze inc based out of kirkland washington firm created daily planner software providing time management features while providing some humour by featuring licensed cartoon strips like cathy bloom county b c and far side firm became a wholly owned subsidiary of delrina in a deal which also paid down amaze s 3 million u s debt and placed two of firm s directors on delrina s board these two individuals were rowland hanson former vp corporate communications for microsoft and george clut berkeley systems inc v delrina thumb alt opus penguin using a shotgun to successfully blast a flying top loading toaster a scene from revamped censored toaster module issued after court case one of delrina s screensaver products was based on licensed bloom county characters opus penguin and bill cat initial opus n bill screensaver launched in 1993 landed company in court as its death toasters module depicted opus taking shots at a number of flying toasters a well known emblem in berkeley system s flying toasters module from their after dark screensaver berkeley systems sued for copyright and trademark infringement following court case of berkeley systems inc v delrina was fought by delrina on basis that a software based parody should fall under same first amendment protection offered to press a preliminary injunction was filed against delrina in september 1993 which halted sale of product and subsequently forced a recall of it through court case drew political satirist mark russell to speak in defense of delrina who argued in favour of screensaver as a valid parody while estate of composer irving berlin sided with berkeley michael understanding digital libraries p 300 morgan kaufmann 1 924 5 commenting on case involving his characters cartoonist berkeley breathed said if david letterman can depict nbc peacock wearing men s boxer shorts then delrina should be able to plug a flying toaster with hot lead judge eugene lynch found in favour of berkeley citing that a commercial software product was not subject to same exemptions as parodist literature and that toasters were too similar in design total cost of court case and recalled product was roughly 150 000 u s in court case it was also cited that design for winged toasters was not original and that berkeley systems design was itself derived from jefferson airplane album thirty seconds over winterland which also used flying toasters adorned with wings berkeley argued that firm was unaware of previous artwork until 1991 and that album cover s toasters had clocks in addition to their wings jefferson airplane later sued berkeley systems in turn for use of same flying toaster emblem rock group lost case as they did not trademark album cover at time of publication court decision was interpreted by writer l ray patterson as an erosion of first amendment rights over increasing protection provided to copyright holders while delrina lost court case publicity it generated was substantial with coverage in over a thousand newspapers across north america resulting in consumers turning out in droves to buy offending program before it could be recalled delrina subsequently removed wings from toasters and replaced them with propellers in order to avoid trademark infringement module was also renamed from death toasters to censored toaster module thanks to publicity from court case sales of this new version ended up being triple what had been expected updated modules for this particular screensaver were sold for next couple of years josef who managed firm s publicity during this period later commented we had feeling that we might get sued actually we prayed to get sued because by suing us number one player in marketplace opened up door anyone can create an interesting product spend 10 million and create awareness of it but it s another thing to create a product and spend one tenth that amount and create twice as much awareness this division of firm at its height only represented less than 15 of company s total revenues winfax increasing sales of winfax product lead to significant growth in revenues for firm by 1992 its sales had climbed to 19 208 420 and more than doubling next year to 48 583 932 product soon overtook that of initial forms product in terms of revenues and within a few years of its launch winfax would account for 80 of company s revenues by 1994 firm had sold more than 3 million copies of winfax and it regularly featured in top 10 lists of software applications sold during this period rapid growth in sales of this product was unexpected with bennie quoted in an interview from late 1993 as saying success of winfax really caught us by surprise with success of winfax product company grew rapidly by early 1993 number of employees had grown to 250 and by end of year to 350 increasing success of winfax product consequently led to significant strains on firm to handle increasing volume of calls to its technical support department as each of over 300 modems on market at time had their own nuances in how they implemented fax data standard delrina spent roughly 800 000 in an improved telephone infrastructure in an attempt to get wait times to under five minutes in december 1993 delrina hired 40 additional people to help alleviate growing number of calls to firm for technical support by end of 1994 situation had improved to point where noted industry commentator robert x put delrina in his shortlist of firms providing exceptional product support in order to further enhance appeal of its new flagship product in 1993 firm established a communication services division designed to tap into commercial market firm started making deals with major telecommunication companies such as bellsouth and mci inc in preparation for services firm was about to offer in november of that year division launched its fax broadcast service fax broadcast service allowed subscribers to upload a single fax and a recipient list to delrina systems at delrina would then send out fax to recipients on that list to a maximum of 500 fax numbers a subsequent fax mailbox feature which enabled subscribers to remotely access both fax and voice messages from a single phone number was initially held up following a dispute with alphanet telecom for rights to technology this dispute was resolved by june 1994 though with both sides publicly disputing story of other and with alphanet receiving an undisclosed sum in compensation by late 1994 firm was considered one of fastest growing software companies in north america and employed over 500 people most located at its offices in toronto firm s financial situation improved greatly and by february 1995 delrina was reported to have captured almost three quarters of fax software market was debt free and had 40 million in bank firm was shipping 200 000 units of winfax a month and had an installed base of four million users cost of doing business had also improved as firm s cost of sales was now 25 of net sales down from 30 previous fiscal year improving firm s gross profits impact of windows 95 in november 1992 skapinker met bill gates at a microsoft sponsored dinner where he asked whether there were any plans to include any fax functionality in their forthcoming operating system which could become windows 95 gates replied that there were plans to include base level fax capability in next version of windows and suggested that skapinker get in touch with his development staff in order to produce a value added product for it firm decided to work on a suite of applications designed to be an enhancement on what was to be available in windows 95 in response to a question about windows 95 bennie responded by saying we are quite convinced that on top of windows 95 we can build four different applications and will encompass fax data telephony or digital voice and internet access this would later become commsuite 95 product in 1994 firm acquired audiofile a company that specialized in computer based voice technology company created a product called talkworks which enabled users to use certain fax modems as a voice mail client seeing a growing business in online communications utilities delrina licensed hilgraeve s terminal emulator system in 1993 and used it as basis for initial version of its wincomm online communications software initial version of product was originally bundled with winfax as part of delrina communications suite but in march 1994 was issued as a standalone product it was a relative to market which was then dominated at time by s series of communications software delrina tried to expand aggressively into this market space first by acquiring canadian online bulletin board service crs online and then using it as a distribution channel for free versions of its wincomm lite and dos based products in march 1995 when internet was opened to commercial interests in mid 1990s delrina started to expand in this nascent market space with their cyberjack 7 0 product launched in december 1995 created by a development team based in south africa it included a web browser usenet news reader ftp client irc and integration with microsoft exchange email program program used an interesting variant of now common bookmark using a guidebook to store information for various internet addresses commsuite 95 shipped later that same month bundling winfax pro 7 0 along with wincomm pro 7 0 talkworks and cyberjack suite of internet components with release of windows 95 in august 1995 delrina was now competing directly against microsoft in fax electronic communications marketplace as windows 95 included a basic faxing application as an accessory along with a licensed version of hilgraeve s communication package which was also used as basis for delrina s own wincomm program while these applications offered only rudimentary fax and online communication services in comparison to mature delrina products microsoft was perceived as a potentially serious future competitor in communications market space release of initial version of microsoft s internet explorer in late 1995 as a free product effectively killed off early emerging market for non free browsers creating a market where delrina s cyberjack browser could not hope to compete acquisition by symantec and aftermath in late spring of 1995 delrina chairman dennis bennie met with symantec ceo gordon eubanks to discuss possibility of merging two firms in september 1995 delrina s founders who owned a controlling interest in firm sold firm to symantec in a stock deal worth 415 million us deal was first announced on july 6 of that year with shareholders from both firms approving merger on november 20 merger was completed on november 22 1995 and delrina officially became part of symantec deal made merged company fifth largest american software firm at time firm became delrina group within symantec which brought under its control other communication software products that belonged to parent firm such as bennie joined board of symantec and was also appointed an executive vice president at its height company employed more than 700 people worldwide majority based in canada symantec was following a general trend of large american firms buying smaller canadian software companies other contemporaneous examples include softimage and zoom it being bought by microsoft and alias being bought by silicon graphics parts of company were subsequently sold off such as sale of delrina s electronic forms division to jetform in september 1996 jetform which later changed its name to was in turn bought by adobe systems adobe officially discontinued electronic forms products in 2004 creative wonders bought rights to echo lake multimedia product which was re shaped as an introductory program on multimedia and re released as family album creator though market for fax software would shrink significantly as use of email became more pervasive winfax brought in significant revenue for symantec a year after merger sales of fax software accounted for 10 of symantec s revenues post delrina delrina was a catalyst for entrepreneurial talent and greatness as many of principals and employees of delrina went on to find new successful ventures with investments from skapinker and amato and bennie as lead director davis went on to form which developed an early internet push content product this firm and its technology were sold just over a year after its inception to a nasdaq listed software company davis remained president and bennie was brought on as director skapinker and davis then went on to found brightspark a software venture capital

niche market and immersive 3d environment used for creating multimedia presentations has so far fallen by wayside in favour of more traditional user interfaces symantec ended support for its final winfax pro product in june 2006 delrina is best remembered by its former employees as an incubator for ideas and for providing industry experience to many people who would go on to work at subsequent

under windows 3 1 and subsequent windows operating systems perform pro 3 0 included integration with delrina s own winfax software and included a range of automation tools as perform captured retail market it became apparent that there was a need for electronics forms delivery and processing at workgroup and enterprise levels in 1994 delrina formflow was released which was designed to meet this need one of key features of formflow 1 1 was forms integration with email and its filler module was available for dos windows and unix winfax thumb alt delrina winfax 3 about dialog with pictures of

with modem manufacturers such as u s robotics and supra that bundled simple versions of product called winfax lite that offered basic functionality those wanting more robust features were encouraged to upgrade to pro version and were offered significant discounts over standalone retail version all of this rapidly established winfax as de facto fax software by 1994 almost one hundred companies

branded version of winfax was winfax pro 7 0 which shipped in late 1995 subsequent version 8 0 being a symantec product there was no intervening version 5 0 or 6 0 and jump to version 7 0 was purely a marketing decision based on keeping up with suite of products in microsoft office which were then at same number it also reflected development effort required to develop first full 32 bit application
