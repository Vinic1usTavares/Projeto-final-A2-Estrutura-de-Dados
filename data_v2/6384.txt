landing on long island in territory of new guinea was part of huon peninsula campaign a series of operations that made up operation cartwheel general douglas macarthur s campaign to encircle major japanese base at rabaul located at northern end of vitiaz strait long island was an important staging point for japanese barges moving between rabaul and wewak until 26 december 1943 when a force of 220 australian and american soldiers landed on island it was not occupied by japanese at time and there was no fighting at time it represented furthest allied advance into japanese held territory it was developed into a radar station background geography long island lies at northern end of vitiaz strait it is roughly circular in shape and about in diameter with an area of about there are two prominent peaks mount reamur in north and cerisy peak in south most of interior is taken up by lake wisdom which is above sea level inside lake is an active volcanic cone offshore there is a north westerly current there were two settlements bok in south east and malala in north east population of island was about 250 all native island had once supported a larger population but it had been wiped out by a volcanic eruption 1660 plinian eruption was third largest volcanic eruption recorded in last 2 000 years it was more powerful than 1883 eruption of krakatoa and buried long island under of

japanese forces huon peninsula campaign started well with victories in landing at lae and landing at nadzab but faltered in face of inclement weather unfavourable terrain and tenacious and aggressive japanese opposition both on land and in air initiative passed to lieutenant general hatazo adachi s japanese xviii army which launched a series of counter attacks in battle of finschhafen allied air ground and naval forces set out to cut japanese supply line which was by barges moving along coast between madang and fortification point long island was an important staging point for japanese barges moving between rabaul and madang in allied hands it could be a useful site for a radar station and observation post and could provide radar coverage for upcoming landing at saidor on 22 december 1943 commander of alamo force lieutenant general walter krueger issued his field order no 8 directing 2nd engineer special brigade to seize long island operation was codenamed and was undertaken concurrently to landings around cape gloucester on new britain preliminaries a party of coastwatchers consisting of three australians from allied intelligence bureau aib and four natives were landed on long island by a pt boat on 6 october 1943 their role was to watch for and report on aircraft coming from madang at time of their arrival there were at least two japanese parties on island but in november they reported that japanese had left mission commander major leonard kaplan flew to finschhafen on 22 december with two amphibian scouts at 18 00 following day they boarded a pt boat that took them to long island they landed on island at 23 45 guided by lights set up by aib reassured that there were no japanese on island kaplan re embarked and returned to finschhafen leaving two amphibian scouts behind to reconnoitre island and to set up lights to guide landing craft during landing meanwhile on 22 december participating elements of 2nd engineer special brigade set out from oro bay for finschhafen from whence assault would be staged a detachment of 3 officers and 32 men from boat battalion of 592nd engineer boat and shore regiment ebsr manned three lcvps and five lcms one lcvp acted as a navigation boat remaining two with one officer and eight other ranks would remain on long island with garrison assault troops were 150 men from company d shore battalion 592nd ebsr at finschhafen they met up with australians of no 338 radar station raaf who would man radar installation on long island this unit had flown in from jacksons and wards airfields around port moresby in 11 transport aircraft it was commanded by pilot officer alan lum to help establish radar station they were accompanied by some technical experts from no 41 wing raaf all told there were 35 raaf personnel bringing assault force to a total of 220 men a planned rehearsal on 24 december was scrubbed due to an air raid alert krueger supervised drafting of final landing plan a final briefing was given at 08 30 on 25 december and all boats were loaded and equipment stowed by 12 00 men then sat down to their christmas dinner of roast turkey equipment included two 37 mm guns four 60 mm mortars four bazookas a canvas water tank a bulldozer two jeeps a jeep trailer with a water tank and two 50 caliber machine guns landing lcms and lcvps set out on voyage from finschhafen at 14 15 and made its way along coast in broad daylight without being engaged by japanese aircraft or vessels three pt boats carrying 90 men of company d who would make up first wave set out from finschhafen at 18 00 being faster they overtook landing craft during night they arrived off malala at 23 45 a quarter of an hour late but this was of no consequence as there was no preliminary air or naval bombardment owing to there being no japanese present men transferred from pt boats to six rubber boats this was not easily accomplished since there had been no rehearsal they were unaccustomed to craft guided by lights amphibian scouts had set up ashore rubber boats set out at 00 20 surf conditions were rough and two boats capsized but neither men nor equipment were lost entire first wave was safely ashore by 02 00 on 26 december second wave landing craft arrived off island at 05 20 eighty minutes late beach grade was found to be steep resulting in a surf force waited until daylight before two lcms unsuccessfully attempted to beach they broached soaking radar equipment in salt water a search was then made for a more suitable beach and one was found south of cape reamur some of equipment were unloaded by 13 00 and navigation boat lcvp and five lcms set sail for finschhafen radar equipment was moved inland and covered by tarpaulins following night rains caused lake wisdom to overflow and equipment was subjected to a torrent of fresh water outcome on 27 december 1943 radar equipment was moved to a hilltop on east coast two generators were towed on sleds radar station personnel had considerable difficulty keeping equipment operational in hot wet and humid climate and there were numerous failures wet season had begun by end of december and equipment was affected two replacement power supplies and a replacement transmitter and receiver for radar unit arrived on 27 january 1944 by april 1944 allies had advanced along coast to madang and main japanese air threat was coming from wewak no 338 radar station was therefore ordered to move to point on west coast this took a week to accomplish a flying fox was used to bring equipment back down to sea level station was operational again at 19 00 on 11 april 1944 it finally ceased operation on 28 january 1945 garrison was for a time most advanced allied position in theatre and brigadier general william f commander of 2nd engineer special brigade of which 592nd ebsr was part was surprised when its capture was officially announced in december 1943 rumours were rife among garrison that japanese might attempt to recapture island and eliminate radar station no attempt was made japanese accepted loss of their staging point engineers built defences camp sites and facilities for radar station an airstrip for light piper cub aircraft long and wide was built in five days resupply came from finschhafen in lcms and occasional pt boat on 17 february 1944 592nd ebsr group departed long island in an lcvp and seven lcms of boat battalion krueger praised 592nd ebsr group who by a display of aggressiveness and superior seamanship accomplished its mission in face of unusual odds notes references category 1943 in papua new
