standard class 6 otherwise known as clan class was a class of 4 6 2 pacific tender steam locomotive designed by robert riddles for use by british railways ten locomotives were constructed between 1951 and 1952 with a further 15 planned for construction however due to acute steel shortages in britain order was continually postponed until it was finally cancelled on publication of 1955 modernisation plan for re equipment of british railways clan class was based upon britannia class design incorporating a smaller boiler and various weight saving measures to increase route availability of a pacific type locomotive for its intended area of operations west of scotland clan class received a mixed reception from crews with those regularly operating locomotives giving favourable reports as regards performance however trials in other areas of british railways network returned negative feedback a common complaint being that difficulty in steaming locomotive made it hard to adhere to timetables reports exist that suggest a degree of disappointment with these locomotives was attributable to their being allocated to class 7 work where they were only a class 6 in reality a problem put down to their very similar appearance to br standard class 7 some of clan class locomotives took their names from highland railway clan class which was being withdrawn from service at time indicating further their intended area of operations class was ultimately deemed a failure by british railways and last was withdrawn in 1966 none survived into preservation although a project to build next locomotive in line number 72010 hengist is progressing assembly of frames has commenced at seal sheffield background under initial scheme for creation of a series of british railways standard locomotives larger passenger and mixed traffic types were intended to be of 4 6 2 pacific wheel arrangement main advantage of which was that it could be fitted with a wide firebox capable of burning a range of coal

availability to fulfil all remaining requirements this had been amply demonstrated by oliver bulleid chief mechanical engineer of southern railway who had developed a lighter version of his large 3 cylinder merchant navy class in 1945 h a v bulleid oliver bulleid s son advocated that resultant light pacifics had almost 90 route availability on southern railway network bulleid h a v bulleid of southern p 68 advantages of such a locomotive for use on some of heavily restricted main lines in scotland such as dumfries to stranraer line had been further demonstrated by remarkable performance of light pacific number yeovil on ex highland railway line to inverness during british railways 1948 locomotive exchange trials during these trials locomotive showed that a light pacific had potential to revolutionise timetable over this difficult trunk route as general policy of railway executive was to eliminate as far as possible perceived complication of multi cylinder locomotives an equivalent 2 cylinder pacific was produced by mounting a smaller and lighter boiler on standard 7mt chassis haresnape brian loco profile no 12 br britannias p 271 design details thumb no 72005 clan macgregor at chester general 29 august 1964 arrangement consisted of a modified standard class 7 boiler with smaller steel cylinders and other modifications to save weight and hence increase route availability wider firebox designed for use with cheaper imported coal was also utilised to spread its weight evenly over axles whilst standard smokebox completed boiler which at 225 lbf in2 was rated at a lower working pressure than that of britannias a single chimney was incorporated into design although this was to create problems later on due to its small diameter which reduced choke area that allowed fierce exhaust blast to escape reducing overall efficiency of locomotive similarities with britannias rested with frames tenders and running gear allowing easy standardisation of parts common with other classes design was fitted with a standard set of two walschaerts valve gear systems and all members of class were equipped with 4 200 gallon br 1 tenders following experience of occasional cracks appearing in frame plates near spring brackets had second batch of class 6 standard pacifics been built chassis would have been rearranged to be similar to that used on solitary class 8 pacific this would have resulted in locomotive riding on three cast steel combined frame stretcher spring brackets carrying 10 front most spring brackets and lengthened spring brackets behind rear driven axle

a smaller version of britannias that a batch of 10 was rushed through construction before teething problems had been ironed out at british railways testing station at rugby clarke david riddles class

first of class no 72000 clan buchanan was treated to a special ceremony at glasgow central station on 15 january 1952 at which lord provost unveiled its nameplates five of these names had previously been used on highland railway locomotives first five of planned second batch of 15 locomotives were intended for use on br s southern region these were allocated names hengist horsa canute wildfire and firebrand which had all been previously used on locomotives in southern england following ten were to be allocated to scotland and were allocated further clan names all of which were new operational details clan class had a mixed reception when first introduced to british railways locomotive crews because there were only 10 locomotives in a class that was mostly confined to north west of railway network this was due to fact low number of class members prevented effective training of locomotive crews throughout nationalised network and a degree of partisanship amongst crews towards newer locomotives further ensured this entire class was also based predominantly at two depots throughout their working lives these being glasgow polmadie and carlisle kingmoor compounding their restricted circulation however factors such as these meant that they spent most of their short careers out of limelight that britannias had resulting in a relatively camera shy class of locomotive crews that used them on regular duties displayed their liking for locomotives and as such could produce good work however predominant number of crews who were unfamiliar with clans found them difficult to handle leading to an undeservedly bad reputation poor steaming characteristics of class had been result of rushed production which was another factor that led to bad reputation of clan class farr keith clans highland and lowland pp 722 723 furthermore they suffered from complaints regarding a lack of pulling power although this can be attributed to indifferent handling and firing techniques which certainly did not help situation however had modernisation plan been delayed and correct amount of investment made for undertaking relevant modifications such as streamlining of steam passages and increased diameter blastpipe in a double chimney layout clans would have been free steaming workhorses worthy of complementing britannias farr keith clans highland and lowland p 718 without modification they were still capable machines when handled properly as various feats testifying this included regular ascents of shap and beattock with 14 carriages without assistance of a banking locomotive other arduous duties that class frequently undertook were regular turns on settle to carlisle route which has some of steepest gradients and harshest working conditions of any british mainline midland region was always short of top link motive power and clan class proved to be a very welcome addition to fleet engines also performed on glasgow crewe manchester and liverpool

highland and lowland pp 719 720 in august 1958 number 72009 was tested on eastern region being based at stratford mpd though a preference for britannias meant that this sojourn was short lived lasting only a month locomotive was utilised on services from london liverpool street to norwich clacton and harwich experimental use of clan class on liverpool street clacton service p 218 at first they were mistakenly allocated class 7 duties in which clans although capable were not able to keep to their allotted timings this was part of trials for west highland line services mentioned earlier but locomotive was rejected for such duties on grounds that they were no better than a good b1 result of these trials was that as both standard class 7 and 8 locomotives were moved north in 1961 after dieselisation started in earnest clans were downgraded to secondary work maintenance was initially undertaken at crewe works but responsibility was transferred to cowlairs works in spring of 1958 barnes robin salute to scottish standard part 1 pp 235 241 more varied work was allocated to them as their reliability improved including working portions of thames clyde express and queen of scots pullman they also deputised for many failed diesel locomotives that plagued network at time and were extensively used on freight workings most scottish and midland region crews that used them regularly took to class and found that if used properly running times were kept with ease these crews rated them most sure footed of any pacifics available on midland region though other crews who tested them claimed that clans were prone to slipping though this was case with most pacific designs barnes robin salute to scottish standard part 2 pp 288 290 despite various successes of clans class was generally regarded as a failure even with overall performance being just short of riddles aims barnes robin salute to scottish standard part 1 pp 236 237 however premise of all british railways

part 2 p 290 proposed second batch and withdrawal prior to publishing of modernisation plan advocating change over to diesel traction there was a proposal to construct a second batch of clan class which was accepted as crewe works order lot 242 this authorised construction of a further batch of fifteen clans that included modifications to original design originally scheduled for 1952 with frames constructed for 72010 hengist acute steel shortages meant that order was continually rescheduled until publication of british railways modernisation plan finally halted project initial name allocations for new batch would seem to suggest several operating kent coast trains hauling golden arrow and other expresses so that some of this batch would have been allocated to southern region clans for southern trains illustrated p 406 first locomotives to be withdrawn from service were polmadie locos 72000 en masse in december 1962 where after being moved first to glasgow parkhead and stored they were eventually moved to darlington for scrapping in 1964 of kingmoor allocation first number 72005 was withdrawn in april 1965 whilst final loco was 72008 on 21 may 1966 from carlisle kingmoor shed when no 72008 clan macleod was finally scrapped in august 1966 it rendered class extinct though this locomotive served british railways for only fourteen years and three months it was
