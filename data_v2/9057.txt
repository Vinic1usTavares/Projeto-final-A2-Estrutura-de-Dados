of little assistance to me nevertheless when collingwood moved to hms royal sovereign in october 1805 as second in command of fleet under lord nelson blockading franco spanish fleet in cadiz he brought rotheram with him james vol 4 p 18 nelson was aware of personal conflict between men and invited both collingwood and rotheram to dinner in a partially successful effort to reconcile them trafalgar thumb 150px right admiral collingwood rotheram s commander at trafalgar who considered his subordinate stupid at battle of trafalgar on 21 october 1805 royal sovereign was first ship in collingwood s division to breach enemy lines and collingwood and rotheram appear to have reconciled some of their differences as they cooperated well in handling ship collingwood even called to his captain rotheram what would nelson give to be here nelson s hms victory being several minutes behind royal sovereign in engaging enemy rotheram was also noted during action for refusing to remove his full dress uniform and large cocked hat apparel which was not only impractical in a naval engagement but which also marked him as a target for enemy snipers royal sovereign s main opponent was large spanish first rate santa ana with whom she was engaged for several minutes at start of action without support during this time royal sovereign was at one point engaged with five different enemy ships and suffered heavy damage and casualties during engagement finally subduing 112 gun santa ana after a duel lasting several hours both ships were left unmanageable at end of engagement royal sovereign

conduct towards his ship s junior officers and chaplain rotheram remained in service but was never again employed at sea collingwood summed situation up in a letter to his sister stating though i think him a stupid man i was in hope he might have gone on in ship i put him in which i believe was only chance he had of being in a ship although his career was over rotheram continued to request sea service and honours from admiralty becoming increasingly irate and intemperate in his demands at reorganising of knightly orders in 1815 a number of senior naval officers were given knighthoods but rotheram was only made a companion of order of bath a step below knighthood he retired to bildeston in suffolk and from there continued to request appointments finally being made one of captains of
