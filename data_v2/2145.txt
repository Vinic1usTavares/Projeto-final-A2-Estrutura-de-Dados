oak sank he suggested that dail ask german consul general to send a submarine to retrieve it aftermath british at time it was not known which submarine had sunk irish oak survivors knew only that it was not u 650 higgins page 9 in house of commons sir william davidson called for a formal protest because irish oak had not warned convoy and douglas lloyd savory called for an end of coal exports to ireland no official action was taken ireland was exporting food to britain at time also paul emrys evans revealed that convoy knew about u boat british stance was that as it already knew of presence of both irish oak and u 607 there was no need for irish oak to have warned convoy irish during world war i south arklow guillemot operated by commissioners of irish lights had given warning of a u boat in consequence on 28 march 1917 uc 65 surfaced ordered crew into their lifeboat and sank guillemot against this background sinking of irish oak became a hotly debated issue irish government s stance was that irish oak had not warned allied convoy of a u boat presence as stated by eamon de valera in dail and by irish shipping limited de valera went on to say that it was no business of irish ships to give any information to anyone a rumour to contrary was picked up by irish labour party james everett asked was information given to british convoy that a submarine was sighted night before discussion in dail during run up to general election focused on possibility that a warning had been transmitted and demands were made to know nationality of captain a british subject bill norton would taoiseach state nationality of master of ship eamon de valera i do not know it james hickey i think taoiseach should take a deep interest in finding out nationality of captains of our ships william davin is taoiseach aware that a recommendation was submitted that irish nationals should get preference for these ships norton hickey and davin were labour party members luke duffy secretary of labour party said that government was guilty of duplicity and near belligerency behind a facade of neutrality they had placed foreign nationals on bridge of irish ships forde page 59 party issued an advertisement condemning criminal conduct of fianna fail government in sending brave men to their doom on irish oak responding to allegations that irish oak had acted in such a way as to endanger her neutral status irish shipping limited stated whether any information had been conveyed to a british convoy that a submarine had been sighted company states in most explicit manner that there is no foundation whatever for suggestion contained in question no such message was sent sean fianna fail party placed a counter advertisement in irish times titled licence to sink saying that labour party sought to justify sinking of irish oak but for these ships many of our people might have been hungry would have been idle if our people were hungry and idle they would be more ready to listen to their pernicious doctrines after election william davin complained of unfounded allegations and slanderous and libellous statements made against members of this sic labour party had audacity to charge members of this party during recent election campaign with having condoned sinking of irish oak could anything be more scandalous or more untrue although labour increased its representation and de valera s fianna fail party lost seats in general election eamon de valera remained in power with support of farmers party gray page 206 american it was not known at time which submarine had sunk irish oak only that it was not u 650 irish shipping limited was negotiating a lease of ss wolverine from united states u s state department intervened asking why ireland had not protested to germany for

without lights second lieutenant excused sinking by saying that irish oak was obviously a q ship he alleged that she was sailing at night without lights zigzagging and travelling at fourteen knots although she appeared capable of barely half that speed flag officer u boats said it ought not to have happened but could be attributed to an understandable mistake by an eager captain precise observance of irish neutrality and of all flag officer u boats strict orders in this connection is duty of all u boat captains and is in most immediate and pressing interests of german reich u 607 was sunk while in convoy with two other u boats in bay of biscay on 13 july 1943 by a sunderland flying boat of 228 squadron royal air force assisted by a halifax of 58 squadron oberleutnant jeschonnek
