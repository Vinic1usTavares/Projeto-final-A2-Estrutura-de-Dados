smaller seated figure inside an artificial cavern a standing figure and a reclining figure these are considered to be some of best examples of ancient sinhalese sculpting and carving arts and have made gal vihara most visited monument at polonnaruwa images of uttararama follow a different style from images of previous anuradhapura period and show some significant differences identity of standing image is subject to a certain amount of dispute among historians and archaeologists some of whom argue that it depicts monk ananda rather than buddha each of images have been carved in a way that uses a maximum possible area of rock and their heights seem to have been decided based on height of rock itself each statue appears to have had its own image house as indicated by remains of brick walls at site uttararama was where parakramabahu i held a congregation of monks to purify buddhist priesthood and later drew up a code of conduct for them this code of conduct has been recorded in an inscription on same rock face containing images of buddha uttararama gal vihara or rock monastery so named after large rock face where four images of buddha were carved was originally named

mentions that parakramabahu i had his workmen build three caves in rock after finishing temple vijjadhara guha cave of spirits of knowledge patima lena cave of sitting image and patima guha cave of sleeping image and turnour 1996 p 259 although they are described as caves only vijjadhara guha is a cave while others were image houses similar to and lankathilaka with their walls connected to rock face these walls which were evidently decorated with frescoes siriweera 2004 p 290 have since been destroyed and only their bases now remain by time parakramabahu i ascended to throne buddhist priesthood in country was divided into three fraternities vihara and he held a congregation of monks to reconcile three fraternities and purified order by expelling corrupt monks with help of elders of each fraternity he later drew up a code of conduct for buddhist monks and recorded this in an inscription at uttararama siriweera 2004 p 251 area in front of images which now resembles a terrace is believed to be location of assembly hall where this congregation was held inscription recording code has been carved on flat polished rock face between vijjadhara guha and standing image uttararama was abandoned during fall of kingdom of polonnaruwa it had functioned as an educational establishment from its inception to its abandonment being a centre of buddhist education in country siriweera 2004 p 243 images thumb seated image which depicts dhyana mudra shows signs of mahayana influence main feature of gal vihara is four images of buddha that have been carved on a single large granite rock face considered to be among best examples of rock carving and sculpting arts of ancient sinhalese amarasinghe 1998 p 89 rock has been cut almost deep to create a rock face to accommodate statues siriweera 2004 p 287 and is only example in country where a natural rock has been excavated to this extent for such a purpose basnayake 1986 p 72 images position temple alongside some of most significant monuments which survive from ancient kingdoms of sri lanka and make it most celebrated and visited temple in polonnaruwa three of images are quite large smallest of them is more than tall and largest is more than long however fourth image is just over and located inside an artificial cavern carved into rock a seated image is on left side of rock and to right is a cavern and another seated image further to right are a standing image and then a reclining image unlike other statues of same period such as one found in lankathilaka image house they are all well preserved and therefore provide a good indication about less well preserved examples prematilleke and karunaratne 2004 p 20 size of each image seems to have been decided based on height of rock at that point so that maximum possible area could be used for it according to archaeologist senarath paranavithana images were evidently coated in gold in their early years style of images differs somewhat from that of statues from earlier anuradhapura period most notable changes are broader forehead in gal vihara images robe is carved with two parallel lines rather than single line seen in anuradhapura period influenced by amaravati school of art sarachchandra 1977 p 125 seated image large seated image is tall and depicts dhyana mudra sarachchandra 1977 p 124 seat was carved in shape of a lotus flower its base decorated with carvings of flowers and lions statue sits on a carved throne decorated with makara images with four small images of buddha identical to larger image carved inside small chambers this is an unusual feature in ancient sinhalese sculpture and is presumably result of mahayana influence amarasinghe 1998 p 90 vidyhadhara guha thumb upright vidyhadhara guha a small statue only in height but similar in appearance to its larger neighbour is located inside artificial cave named vidyhadhara guha cave was created by carving into rock leaving four square shafted stone columns at sides of wide and high opening basnayake 1986 p 73 base of lotus shaped seat of buddha image here is also decorated with designs of lions a throne and a parasol are carved behind it more elaborate in design than larger image amarasinghe 1998 p 92 a prabhamandala or halo is carved behind head of statue which rests between two four armed deities according to archaeologist h c p bell god on right is brahma and god on left is vishnu walls of cave were once decorated with frescoes traces of which remain in two corners at back of cave standing image thumb left upright standing image depicts an unusual mudra standing image is focus of much discussion among historians and archaeologists since there is a general belief that it is not a statue of buddha image is tall and stands on a low pedestal shaped like a lotus it leans back in a relaxed manner its arms folded across its chest statue s face carries a sorrowful expression and reclining image which depicts buddha s parinirvana lies next to it which has led some to believe that it is monk ananda who is lamenting buddha s demise at his deathbed remains of walls however indicate that two images were once in separate chambers rather than next to each other paranavithana believes that statue is of buddha which depicts para dukkha mudra or sorrow for sorrow of others however this is a rarely used gesture in sinhalese sculpture and is seen at only a few locations in country amarasinghe 1998 p 93 another possibility is that image shows buddha during his second week after enlightenment prematilleke and karunaratne 2004 p 21 which he spent gazing at bodhi tree in gratitude for providing him shelter image is not mentioned in which only mentions other three while this may be an indication that it is not an image of buddha it is also possible that it may have been made at an earlier period than others reclining image thumb reclining image which depicts buddha s parinirvana is largest in gal vihara at in length reclining image is largest statue in gal vihara and also one of largest sculptures in southeast asia kleiner 2008 p 174 it depicts parinirvana of buddha who is lying on his right side with right arm supporting head on a bolster while left arm lies along body and thigh palm of right hand and soles of feet have a single lotus flower carved on them basnayake 1986 p 75 charles a former commissioner of archaeological department of sri lanka has stated that bolster upon which buddha rests his head has been so well carved that it looks like a cotton stuffed pillow rather than one carved from rock amarasinghe 1998 p 94 upper foot left foot of image is slightly withdrawn to indicate that image depicts that buddha has attained parinirvana and is not merely lying down aves 2003 p 289 unlike other images reclining image does not have a decorated pedestal and lies on levelled bare rock on wall behind image several sockets have been carved into rock as well as remains of two stone columns suggesting that its now
