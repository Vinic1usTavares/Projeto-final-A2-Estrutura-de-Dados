right a benihana christmas was directed by harold ramis a benihana christmas was written by jennifer celotta and directed by harold ramis ramis would return to direct third season episodes safety training and beach games as well as sixth season episode delivery pt ii episode was shot in a real benihana restaurant during filming john krasinski threw a shrimp across table at rainn wilson it bounced off dwight s glasses and landed in glass of water from which he was about to drink according to actor ed helms it was a one in a million shot that pretty much shut down set for five or 10 minutes of applause ultimately however ramis decided not to use footage because it looked so improbable as to be unbelievable actresses who played women that andy and michael bring back to office were different from actresses who played waitresses in benihana restaurant according to show s prop master this was because andy and michael failed to pick up original waitresses and settled for less attractive ones however at paley fest 2007 greg daniels admitted that women they cast were too good looking which led to joke failing since original script specifically called for andy and michael s dates to be unattractive reception a benihana christmas was first broadcast on december 14 2006 in united states according to estimates by nielsen media research s episode was watched by an estimated
