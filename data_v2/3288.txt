thumb 300px location of o c lands indicated in orange in western oregon o c land acreage by county county total o c acres ha includes 59 914 acres designated as coos bay wagon road lands includes 14 633 acres designated as coos bay wagon road lands oregon and california railroad revested lands commonly known as o c lands are approximately of land located in eighteen counties of western oregon originally granted to oregon california railroad to build a railroad between portland oregon and san francisco california land was to united states government by act of congress in 1916 and is currently managed by united states bureau of land management since 1916 18 counties where o c lands are located have received payments from united states government at 50 share of timber revenue on those lands later as compensation for loss of timber and tax revenue decreased government added federal revenues governments of several of counties have come to depend upon o c land revenue as an important source of income for schools and county services most recent source of income from lands an extension of secure rural schools and community self determination act of 2000 was last renewed in 2013 but at vastly reduced spending levels leaving some counties scrambling to find new sources of funding in late 2013 united states house of representatives was considering a bill that would resume funding and increase timber harvests to provide additional income to counties origin as part of u s government s desire to foster settlement and economic development in western states in july 1866 congress passed oregon and california railroad act this act made of land available for any company that built a railroad from portland oregon to san francisco land was to be distributed by state of oregon in land grants for each mile of track completed two companies both of which named themselves oregon central railroad began a competition to build railroad one on west side of willamette river and one on east side two lines would eventually merge and reorganize as oregon and california railroad in 1869 congress changed how grants were to be distributed requiring railroads to sell land along line to settlers in parcels at 2 50 per acre land was distributed in a checkerboard pattern with sections laid out for on either side of rail corridor with government retaining alternate sections for future growth thumb left logging in oregon 1910 by 1872 railroad had extended from portland to roseburg along way it created growth in willamette valley towns such as canby aurora and harrisburg which emerged as freight and passenger stations and provided a commercial lifeline to part of river valley above harrisburg where steamships were rarely able to travel as railroad made its way into umpqua valley new townsites such as drain oakland and yoncalla were laid out land fraud perhaps most significant aspect of railroad was that it provided access to oregon s vast forests for large scale logging operations but despite large number of grants it was difficult to sell to actual settlers because much of land was not only heavily forested chiefly in douglas fir and western hemlock but rugged and remote moreover railroads soon realized that land was much more valuable if sold in larger plots to developers and timber companies as a result some individuals posed as settlers to purchase land at 2 50 per acre rate and then promptly deeded them back to railroad which amassed smaller plots into larger ones and resold them at a higher price to timber interests a scheme to circumvent settler grants altogether soon emerged a railroad official hired a surveyor and logger named stephen a douglas to round up people from portland saloons and then take them to land office where they would register for an o c parcel as a settler and then promptly resell to railroad for bundling with other plots and resale to highest bidder typically as much as 40 an acre in 1904 an investigation by oregonian uncovered scandal by which time it had grown to such a magnitude that paper reported that more than 75 of land sales had violated federal law between 1904 and 1910 nearly a hundred people were indicted in connection with fraud including u s senator john h mitchell u s representatives john n williamson and binger hermann and u s attorney john hall revestiture of lands thumb left bureau of land management now manages timber on more than 2 million acres of land in oregon that formerly belonged to o c land fraud trials reached their conclusion attention also turned to southern pacific railroad which had acquired o c in 1887 not only had company violated terms of grant agreement but in 1903 declared it was terminating land sales in violation of grant agreement either as a hedge against future increases in land values or to retain timber profits for itself a series of lawsuits between state of oregon united states government and railroads ensued another lawsuit was brought by portland attorney and future u s representative walter lafferty on behalf of 18 western oregon counties which sued to claim revenue from timber sales on o c lands cases worked their way up to united states supreme court which ruled in 1915 in oregon california r co v united states that despite violation of grant terms railroad had been built and railroad company should be compensated in 1916 congress passed chamberlain ferris act which revested remaining 2 800 000 acres of land to united states government and compensated railroad at 2 50 per acre from an account oregon and california land grant fund funded by timber sales from land oregon counties affected by revestiture of land were also to be compensated from fund chamberlain ferris act did not ease financial trouble faced by many of o c counties very little timber revenue was actually generated from land and many counties now had large percentages of their land owned by federal government denying them a source of property tax revenue as these problems compounded into 1920s 18 counties organized association of o c counties to give itself a voice in washington d c one of its cofounders douglas county district attorney and future u s senator guy cordon began lobbying oregon s congressional delegation for relief in 1926 a bill introduced by oregon senator robert n stanfield which became known as stanfield act was passed this law provided that u s government pay counties in lieu of property taxes they would have received if land were privately owned but since u s government was to be reimbursed from timber revenues and since timber revenue remained low very few payments were actually made to counties and congress began to work on new legislation o c act thumb right sign indicating o c lands near 1937 congress again sought to ensure federal funding for 18 o c counties oregon and california revested lands sustained yield management act of 1937 commonly referred as o c act directed united states department of interior to harvest timber from o c lands as well as coos bay wagon road lands on a sustained yield basis legislation returned 50 percent of timber sales receipts to counties and 25 percent to u s treasury to reimburse federal government for payments made to counties prior to establishment of act law specifically provided that lands be managed including reforestation and protection of watershed to ensure a permanent source of timber and therefore revenue to counties under o c act department of interior under its general land office and later succeeded by bureau of land management managed more than 44 billion board feet of standing inventory in 1937 into more than 60 billion board feet by mid 1990s and harvested more than 44 billion board feet over that time period in 1951 u s treasury had been fully reimbursed and 25 percent of revenue that had previously gone to treasury now reverted to counties in 1953 counties opted to divert that money to maintenance of land and roads reforestation as well as recreational facilities and other improvements a 1970 gao report contained an estimate that from its implementation through 1969 counties had received a total of 300 million as a result of act authors of report also estimated that most counties received more from government payments than they would have if land had been held privately o c act achieved what previous legislation had failed to do provide a stable revenue to counties this revenue became a vital part of budgets of o c counties paying for county provided services such as law enforcement and corrections and health and social services with this funding seemingly guaranteed counties kept other taxes much lower than other counties in state increasing their dependence on timber payments for example property tax in curry county is 60 cents per 1 000 of assessed value far below state average of 2 81 per 1000 decline in timber revenue and revised congressional action in 1989 annual timber harvest revenue on federal forest land nationwide peaked at 1 5 billion following that year impact of overharvesting and increased environmental concerns began to negatively impact timber sales on o c lands in 1994 federal northwest forest plan was implemented designed to guide forest management of federal lands while protecting old growth forest habitat for endangered species such as northern spotted owl plan restricted land available for timber harvest by 1998 revenue on federal forest lands fell to a third of peak 1989 revenue with areas in northwest particularly hard hit to offset effects of loss of timber revenue in 1993 president bill clinton proposed a 10 year program of payments set at 85 percent of average o c act payments from 1986 to 1990 and declining 3 percent annually these spotted owl or safety net payments were passed by congress as part of omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993 with payments set to expire in 2003 work began in 1999 to seek an extension to payments o c counties joined with other rural counties including 15 of oregon s other 18 counties that also faced falling timber revenues to lobby congress for another solution in 2000 congress passed secure rural schools and community self determination act which authorizes western counties including o c counties to receive federal payments to compensate for loss of timber revenue until 2006 payments to o c counties which included o c revenue as well as revenue on forest service land averaged about 250 million per year from 2000 to 2006 act was extended for one year in 2007 and in 2008 a four year extension was included in emergency economic stabilization act of 2008 that phased out program by 2012 extension expired on september 30 2011 and final payment of just over 40 million was delivered to o c counties in early 2012 in late 2011 oregon senators ron wyden and jeff merkley proposed legislation to extend payments for another five years move was backed by governor john kitzhaber and entire oregon congressional delegation republican and democratic members of oregon s congressional delegation also proposed setting aside some of federal land in oregon as public trusts in which half would be designated for harvest to provide revenue for counties and half designated as a conservation area president barack obama s proposed 2013 united states federal budget included 294 million to extend program for fiscal year 2013 with a plan to continue payments for four more years with amount declining 10 each year in march 2012 u s senate added an amendment to surface transportation bill that authorized a one year extension to secure rural schools and community self determination act oregon counties would have received a total of 102 million from legislation in 2012 to be divided among all 33 counties that currently receive payments in 2008 oregon received 250 million from program full transportation bill including amendment passed senate by a 74 22 vote but u s house of representatives refused to vote on senate bill instead passing a three month extension to current transportation bill that did not contain a county payments extension in july 2012 secure rural schools act renewal amendment was included in transportation bill approved by congress and signed by president this was widely expected to be last renewal of program but in september 2013 congress passed another one year extension to program though again at reduced levels future of o c counties with future revenue uncertain several oregon counties now face a severe financial crisis to pay for county services including law enforcement social services justice and corrections systems election services and road maintenance among others with county services required by state law and bankruptcy not permitted counties have considered merging to save costs and explored new sources of revenue one of hardest hit counties curry county introduced a ballot measure to add a 3 sales tax to pay for county services oregon is one of only five states in united states with no county or state sales tax and tax has been voted down regularly by voters whenever it has been proposed though some areas assess a gas tax and two cities in tourist areas ashland and assess a local tax on prepared food in josephine county after a proposed property tax increase to pay for law enforcement was defeated in may 2012 sheriff s office reduced its staff by 2 3 and released inmates from county jail to reduce spending lane county released 96 prisoners from its prisons and laid off 40 law enforcement personnel to cut costs in 2012 oregon legislative assembly passed a law to allow o c counties to use timber funds previously reserved for road maintenance to pay for law enforcement patrols in late 2013 house passed a forest management bill co sponsored by oregon representatives peter greg walden and kurt schrader that would include increased timber harvests on o c lands along with resumption of some secure rural schools funding president obama has indicated he is likely to veto bill references category blm administered lands in
