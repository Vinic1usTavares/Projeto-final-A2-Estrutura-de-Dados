konig class was a group of four battleships built for german kaiserliche marine on eve of world war i class was composed of and most powerful warships of german high seas fleet at outbreak of war in 1914 class operated as a unit throughout world war i v division of iii battle squadron ships took part in a number of fleet operations during war including battle of jutland where they acted as vanguard of german line they survived war and were interned at scapa flow in november 1918 all four ships were scuttled on 21 june 1919 when rear admiral ludwig von reuter ordered sinking of entire high seas fleet three remain on seafloor there was raised towed off and broken up for scrap konigs were an improvement over preceding one of primary changes being in disposition of main gun battery kaiser class ships mounted ten 30 5 cm 12 in sk l 50 guns in five twin turrets one turret was mounted fore two aft in a superfiring arrangement and other two as wing turrets in a zig zag echelon configuration amidships for konig class use of main gun wing turrets was abandoned instead a second turret was moved forward and placed in a superfiring arrangement and a single rear facing turret was mounted centerline amidships with a traverse allowing for broadsides but not forward fire two superfiring aft turrets remained this allowed for a wider angle of fire on broadside as all 10 guns could fire in a large arc it did however reduce ship s forward fire capabilities from six guns with only limited traverse on two wing turrets to four guns with full traverse design konig class battleships were authorized under second amendment to naval law which had been passed in 1908 as a response to revolution in naval technology created with launch of british in 1906 dreadnoughts were significantly larger and correspondingly more expensive than old pre dreadnought battleships as a result funds that had been appropriated for navy in 1906 were going to be used up before they were scheduled to be replenished in 1911 along with additional funding secured in 1908 bill service life of all large warships was to be reduced from 25 years to 20 years this was done in an effort to force reichstag to allocate more funds for additional ships in his effort to force reichstag to pass bill admiral alfred von tirpitz threatened to resign from his post as state secretary for navy as a result of von tirpitz s ultimatum bill was passed in march 1908 by a large margin reduction in service life necessitated replacement of coastal defense ships of and classes as well as s in terms of first amendment to naval law of 1906 von tirpitz had requested but failed to secure funding for new battleships they had now been approved by reichstag naval law also increased naval budget by an additional 1billion marks after four s had been replaced by four and six siegfried class ships had been replaced by helgoland and kaiser classes next vessels to be replaced were old brandenburg class battleships konig

were long at waterline and 175 4 m long overall with a beam of a forward draft of and a rear draft of konigs were designed to displace normally but at full combat load they displaced hulls were constructed with transverse and longitudinal steel frames over which outer hull plates were riveted ships hulls each contained 18 watertight compartments each equipped with a double bottom that ran for 88 of length of hull german naval historian erich groner in his book german warships 1815 1945 said german navy considered ships to be very good sea boats they suffered a slight loss of speed in a swell and with rudder hard over ships lost up to 66 speed and heeled over 8 degrees battleships had a transverse metacentric height of 2 59 m konig grosser kurfurst markgraf and kronprinz each had a standard crew of 41 officers and 1095 enlisted men konig flagship of iii squadron had an additional crew of 14 officers and another 68 sailors ships carried several smaller boats including one picket boat three barges two launches two yawls and two dinghies propulsion it was originally intended that konig class battleships would be powered by two sets of turbines on outer shafts while center shaft would have utilized a man 6 cylinder 2 stroke diesel engine producing 12 000 shp at 150 rpm development of diesel was protracted however and it was later decided that diesel would be installed only in grosser kurfurst and markgraf ultimately diesel was never installed in any of konig class battleships they were instead equipped with three sets of parsons konig and kronprinz aeg vulcan grosser kurfurst or bergmann markgraf turbines driving 3 8 m wide three bladed screws steam was supplied by three oil fired and 12 coal fired schulz thornycroft boilers operating at up to 16 atmospheres of pressure power plant was rated at on trials ships produced between designed top speed was ships had a designed range of at a cruising speed of 12 knots which decreased to 4 000 nautical miles at 18 knots maximum bunkerage was 3 000 tons of coal and 600 tons of oil each ship had two rudders electrical power was supplied by four turbo generators and a pair of diesel generators total electrical output was 2 040 kilowatts at 225 volts armament thumb upright rear turrets of grosser kurfurst alt gun turrets of a battleship a gray zeppelin flies overhead konigs were armed with a main battery of ten sk l 50 guns in five twin turrets two turrets were mounted forward of main superstructure in a superfiring pair third was placed on centerline between two funnels amidships and fourth and fifth turrets were also arranged in a superfiring pair aft of rear conning tower each gun turret had a working chamber beneath it that was connected to a revolving ammunition hoist leading down to magazine below it turrets were electrically controlled though guns were elevated hydraulically in an effort to reduce possibility of a fire everything in turret was constructed of steel centerline arrangement was an improvement over preceding as all ten guns could fire on a wide arc on broadside and four guns could fire directly ahead as opposed to only two on kaisers guns were supplied with 900 rounds or 90 shells per gun 30 5 cm gun had a rate of fire of between 2 3 405 5 kilogram 894 pound armor piercing shells per minute and was expected to fire 200 shells before replacement was necessary guns were also capable of firing 405 9 kg 894 8 lb high explosive shells both types of shells were loaded with two propellant charges an rp c 12 main charge in a brass cartridge that weighed 91 kg 201 lb and an rp c 12 fore charge in a silk bag that weighed 34 5 kg 76 lb this provided a muzzle velocity of 855 meters per second 2 805 ft s turrets on konig class battleships initially allowed elevation up to 13 5 degrees this enabled a maximum range of 16 200 m 17 700 yd after modifications elevation was increased to 16 degrees which correspondingly increased range of guns to 20 400 m 22 300 yd secondary armament consisted of fourteen sk l 45 quick firing guns each mounted in mpl c 06 11 casemates in side of top deck these guns were intended for defense against torpedo boats and were supplied with a total of 2 240 shells these guns could engage targets out to 13 500 m and after improvements in 1915 their range was extended to 16 800 m guns had a sustained rate of fire of 5to per minute shells were 45 3 kg 99 8 lb and were loaded with a 13 7 kg 31 2 lb rpc 12 propellant charge in a brass cartridge this provided a muzzle velocity of 835 meters per second 2 740 ft s service life was estimated at approximately 1 400 shells fired before guns would need to be replaced konigs also carried six sk l 45 quick firing guns mounted in casemates six guns were located on either side of forward conning tower and were all directed forward these guns were supplied with a total of 3 200 rounds or 200 shells per gun and could fire at a rate of 15 shells per minute high explosive shells fired by these guns weighed 10 kg 22 05 lb and were loaded with a 3 kg 6 6 lb rpc 12 propellant charge these guns had a life expectancy of around 7 000 rounds these were later removed and replaced with four 8 8 cm sk l 45 anti aircraft guns which were mounted on either side of rear conning tower as was customary for capital ships of dreadnought era ships were armed with five submerged torpedo tubes one was mounted in bow other four were placed on broadside two on each side of ship tubes were supplied with 16 torpedoes torpedoes were g7 type they were 7 02 m 23 ft long and were armed with a 195 kg 430 lb explosive warhead at 37 knots torpedoes had a range of 4 000 m 4 370 yd at 27 knots range more than doubled to 9 300 m 10 170 yards armor konig class ships were protected with krupp cemented steel armor as was standard for german warships of period they had an armor belt that was thick in central citadel of ship where most important parts of ship were located this included ammunition magazines and machinery spaces belt was reduced in less critical areas to forward and aft bow and stern were not protected by armor at all a thick torpedo bulkhead ran length of hull several meters behind main belt main armored deck was thick in most places though thickness of sections that covered more important areas of ship was increased to forward conning tower was protected with heavy armor sides were thick and roof was thick rear conning tower was less well armored its sides were only thick and roof was covered with of armor plate main battery gun turrets were also heavily armored turret sides were 300 mm thick and roofs were thick casemated 15 cm guns had worth of armor plating in casemates guns themselves had thick shields to protect their crews from shell splinters construction name ship

ship of class she was built at ag vulcan shipyard in hamburg under construction number 4 she too was laid down in 1911 she was launched on 5may 1913 and was commissioned before konig on 30 july 1914 was built at ag weser dockyard in bremen under construction number 186 she was laid down in 1911 launched on 4june 1913 and commissioned on 1october 1914 shortly after outbreak of world war i final

class battleships in 1915 or 1916 raid on scarborough hartlepool and whitby first major operation of war in which konig class ships participated was raid on scarborough hartlepool and whitby on 15 16 december 1914 raid was primarily conducted by battlecruisers of i scouting group konig class ships along with and kaiser classes steamed in distant support of franz von hipper s battlecruisers friedrich von ingenohl commander of high seas fleet decided to take up station approximately in center of north sea about 130 miles east of scarborough royal navy which had recently received german code books captured from beached cruiser was aware that an operation was taking place but uncertain as to where germans would strike therefore admiralty ordered david beatty s 1st battlecruiser squadron six battleships of 2nd battle squadron and a number of cruisers and destroyers to attempt to intercept german battlecruisers however beatty s task force nearly ran headlong into entire high seas fleet at 6 20 beatty s destroyer screen came into contact with german torpedo boat this began a confused two hour long battle between british destroyers and german cruiser and destroyer screen frequently at very close range at time of first encounter konig class battleships were less than 10 miles away from six british dreadnoughts this was well within firing range but in darkness neither british nor german admiral were aware of composition of their opponents fleets admiral ingenohl loathe to disobey kaiser s order to not risk battlefleet without his express approval concluded that his forces were engaging screen of entire grand fleet and so 10 minutes after first contact he ordered a turn to port to a south east course continued attacks delayed turn but by 6 42 it had been carried out for about 40 minutes two fleets were steaming on a parallel course at 7 20 ingenohl ordered a further turn to port which put his ships on a course for german waters bombardment of yarmouth and lowestoft konig class ships took part in another raid on english coast again as support for german battlecruiser force in i scouting group battlecruisers left jade estuary at 10 55 on 24 april 1916 and rest of high seas fleet followed at 13 40 battlecruiser struck a mine while en route to target and had to withdraw other battlecruisers bombarded town of lowestoft largely without incident but during approach to yarmouth they encountered british cruisers of harwich force a short artillery duel ensued before harwich force withdrew reports of british submarines in area prompted retreat of i scouting group at this point admiral reinhard scheer who had been warned of sortie of grand fleet from its base in scapa flow also withdrew to safer german waters battle of jutland thumb painting of a konig class ship under fire at jutland by claus bergen four ships took part in fleet sortie that resulted in battle of jutland on 31 may 1 june 1916 operation again sought to draw out and isolate a portion of grand fleet and destroy it before main british fleet could retaliate konig grosser kurfurst markgraf and kronprinz made up v division of iii battle squadron and they were vanguard of fleet iii battle squadron was first of three battleship units directly astern were kaiser class battleships of vi division iii battle squadron astern of kaiser class ships were helgoland and nassau classes of i battle squadron in rear guard were elderly pre dreadnoughts of ii battle squadron shortly before 16 00 cet battlecruisers of i scouting group encountered british 1st battlecruiser squadron under command of david beatty opposing ships began an artillery duel that saw destruction of shortly after 17 00 and less than a half an hour later by this time german battlecruisers were steaming south in order to draw british ships towards main body of high seas fleet at 17 30 konig leading german battleship spotted both iscouting group and 1st battlecruiser squadron approaching german battlecruisers were steaming down to starboard while british ships steamed to port at 17 45 scheer ordered a two point turn to port to bring his ships closer to british battlecruisers and a minute later at 17 46 order to open fire was given thumb left a konig class battleship firing her main guns at jutland by claus bergen konig grosser kurfurst and markgraf were first to reach effective gunnery range they engaged battlecruisers and respectively at a range of 21 000 yards konigs first salvos fell short of her target and so she shifted her fire to nearest british ship tiger simultaneously leading konig class battleships began firing on destroyers and two destroyers closed in on german line and having endured a hail of gunfire maneuvered into a good firing position each ship launched two torpedoes apiece at konig and grosser kurfurst though all four weapons missed in return a secondary battery shell from one of battleships hit nestor and wrecked her engine room ship along with destroyer was crippled and lying directly in path of advancing german line both destroyers were sunk but german torpedo boats stopped to pick up survivors at around 18 00 four konigs shifted their fire to approaching s of 5th battle squadron though firing lasted only a short time before range widened too far shortly after 19 00 german cruiser had become disabled by a shell from rear admiral behncke in konig attempted to maneuver his ships in order to cover stricken cruiser simultaneously british iii and iv light cruiser squadrons began a torpedo attack on german line while advancing to torpedo range they smothered wiesbaden with fire from their main guns konigs fired heavily on british cruisers but even sustained fire from germans main guns failed to drive off british cruisers in ensuing melee british armored cruiser was struck by several heavy caliber shells from german dreadnoughts one salvo penetrated ship s ammunition magazines and in a massive explosion destroyed cruiser by time german fleet returned to jade estuary nassau class battleships and and helgoland class battleships and took up guard duties in outer roadstead kaiser class battleships and took up defensive positions outside wilhelmshaven locks four konig class ships along with other capital ships those that were still in fighting condition had their fuel and ammunition stocks replenished in inner harbor fleet advance of 18 19 august during fleet advance on 18 19 august i scouting group was to bombard coastal town of sunderland in an attempt to draw out and destroy beatty s battlecruisers as and were only two remaining german battlecruisers still in fighting condition in group three dreadnoughts were assigned to unit for operation markgraf grosser kurfurst and newly commissioned admiral scheer and rest of high seas fleet with 15 dreadnoughts of its own would trail behind and provide cover british were aware of german plans and sortied grand fleet to meet them by 14 35 scheer had been warned of grand fleet s approach and unwilling to engage whole of grand fleet just 11 weeks after decidedly close call at jutland turned his forces around and retreated to german ports operation albion in early september 1917 following german conquest of russian port of riga german navy decided to expunge russian naval forces that still held gulf of riga to this end admiralstab navy high command planned an operation to seize baltic islands of osel particularly russian gun batteries on sworbe peninsula on 18 september order was issued for a joint army navy operation to capture osel and moon islands primary naval component was to comprise flagship moltke along with iii battle squadron of high seas fleet v division included four konigs and was by this time augmented with new battleship bayern vi division consisted of five kaiser class battleships along with nine light cruisers three torpedo boat flotillas and dozens of mine warfare ships entire force numbered some 300 ships and were supported by over 100 aircraft and six zeppelins invasion force amounted to approximately 24 600 officers and enlisted men opposing germans were old russian pre dreadnoughts and armored cruisers bayan admiral makarov and diana 26 destroyers and several torpedo boats and gunboats garrison on osel numbered some 14 000 men thumb left recognition drawing of konig underway operation began on 12 october when moltke bayern and konigs began firing on russian shore batteries at tagga bay simultaneously kaisers engaged batteries on sworbe peninsula objective was to secure channel between moon and dago islands which would block only escape route of russian ships in gulf both grosser kurfurst and bayern struck mines while maneuvering into their bombardment positions damage to former was minimal but bayern was severely wounded ship had to be withdrawn to kiel for repairs on 16 october it was decided to detach a portion of invasion flotilla to clear russian naval forces in moon sound these included two russian pre dreadnoughts to this end konig and kronprinz along with cruisers and and a number of smaller vessels were sent to engage russian battleships they arrived by morning of 17 october but a deep russian minefield kept ships temporarily at bay a rude surprise came to germans when they discovered that 30 5 cm guns of russian battleships out ranged their own 30 5 cm guns russian ships managed to keep distance wide enough to prevent german battleships from being able to return fire while still firing effectively on german ships at several points germans had to take evasive maneuvers to avoid russian shells however by 10 00 minesweepers had cleared a path through minefield and konig and kronprinz dashed into bay two big dreadnoughts engaged russian battleships konig dueled with slava and kronprinz fired on both slava and cruiser bayan russian vessels were hit dozens of times until at 10 30 russian naval commander admiral bakhirev ordered their withdrawal slava had taken too much damage and was unable to make good her escape instead she was scuttled and her crew was evacuated on a destroyer by 20 october naval operations were effectively over russian ships had been destroyed or forced to withdraw and german army held their objectives however on 29 october markgraf struck a mine during german withdrawal from gulf of riga fate thumb location of german vessels

1918 majority of high seas fleet under command of rear admiral ludwig von reuter was interned in british naval base at scapa flow fleet remained in captivity during negotiations that ultimately produced versailles treaty it became apparent to reuter that british intended to seize german ships on 21 june which was deadline for germany to have signed peace treaty unaware that deadline had been extended to 23rd reuter ordered his ships be sunk on morning of 21 june british fleet left scapa flow to conduct training maneuvers at 11 20 reuter transmitted order to his ships of four ships kronprinz was first to sink she slipped beneath waters of scapa flow at 13 15 grosser kurfurst followed 15 minutes later at 13 30 konig sank at approximately 14 00 but markgraf did not sink until 16 45 she was one of last capital ships to be successfully scuttled only battlecruiser sank afterwards at 17 00 grosser kurfurst was eventually raised on 29 april 1938 ship was towed to rosyth where she was broken up for scrap metal other three ships remain on sea floor and were sold to britain in 1962 notes footnotes citations references online sources category battleship classes category world war
