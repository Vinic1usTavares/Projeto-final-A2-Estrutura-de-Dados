upper table rock and lower table rock are two prominent volcanic plateaus located just north of rogue river in jackson county oregon u s created by an andesitic lava flow approximately seven million years ago and shaped by erosion they now stand about above surrounding rogue valley table rocks are jointly owned nature conservancy is responsible for while bureau of land management is responsible for native americans have inhabited table rocks area for at least 15 000 years before european american settlement starting in mid 19th century during a gold rush settlers forced takelma tribe away from table rocks and into reservations surrounding area was quickly developed table rock post office was established in 1872 an airstrip was built atop lower table rock in 1948 and a very high frequency omni directional range vor aviation tower was constructed on upper table rock in 1960s table rocks were not protected until 1970s rocks are home to over 70 species of animals and 340 species of plants which includes over 200 species of wildflowers vernal pools atop plateaus fill during rainy season in winter and spring because andesite is impermeable dwarf woolly meadowfoam a species of wildflower grows around these pools and is endemic to rocks pools are also one of only a few places where federally threatened species of fairy shrimp branchinecta lynchi can be found to protect these and other threatened species bureau of land management has listed rocks as an area of critical environmental concern since 1984 table rocks are one of most popular hiking locations in rogue valley with over 45 000 visitors annually two trails lower table rock trail and upper table rock trail were cut across plateaus slopes in early 1980s by youth conservation corps boy scouts and oregon department of forestry this effort was coordinated by john ifft a forester for medford office of blm plateaus are named for their relatively flat tops upper and lower refer to their location along rogue river not their height upper table rock above sea level at its highest point is located upstream while lower table rock is farther downstream with an elevation of geology and climate thumb lower table rock across rogue valley from roxy ann peak alt vegetation in foreground with a flat area scattered with buildings farther away plateau is far away with mountains by horizon starting approximately 40 million years ago in middle eocene a braided river system called ancestral rogue river flowed through region where rogue valley is now carved for about 2 1 million years river deposited what is now known as payne cliffs formation by laying down a thin conglomerate followed by sandstone and siltstone between 10 and 20 million years ago uplift that created nearby klamath mountains caused an incision that formed rogue river valley vertical erosion or downcutting of rogue river continues to keep pace with recent uplift with about of erosion occurring in past seven million years approximately seven million years ago in upper miocene a long trachyandesitic lava flow that likely came from olson mountain near present day lost creek lake flowed down ancestral rogue river and its tributaries and spread throughout valley this lava formed a hard cap over payne cliffs formation at lost creek lake lava attained its maximum thickness of and thinned to about to north of medford thumb left andesite lava cap since olson eruption rogue river has eroded 90 percent of solidified lava though andesite prevented much erosion to caps of table rocks andesite capped cliffs eroded from side as softer sedimentary units of payne cliffs formation gave way this erosion created expansive talus fields which surround plateaus on all sides creating slopes capable of supporting abundant plant and animal life upper and lower table rock both stand above valley floor and just over above sea level there are approximately of level ground on lower table rock and on upper table rock table rocks offer an example of inverted relief in which previous topographic lows are filled with a resistant rock and become new topographic highs after erosion of surrounding region each plateau is shaped roughly like a horseshoe because lava followed meanders of ancestral rogue river thumb upper table rock from denman wildlife area alt upper table rock from across a field of grass looking into central bowl it rises steeply from surrounding valley to its flat top two caves and two former gold mines are located at base of andesite cap on upper table rock caves were created by natural fractures in cap and gold mines were excavated by prospectors searching for gold in 19th century three are large enough to walk into with an average width of while one is a small pit dropping vertically into a pond of water human history humans have lived in table rock area for at least 15 000 years based on age of clovis points that were discovered nearby region surrounding table rocks was home to takelma people they gathered food such as acorns and seeds and caught salmon in nearby rogue river takelma also used deer hides for clothing see these interpretive signs 1 2 they had several names for rocks including di tani rock above little indian plums and possibly first use of names upper table rock and lower table rock is unknown however first recorded use was by mountain man james in 1845 see this interpretive sign thumb left upright airstrip on lower table rock alt a straight dirt path leading off into distance with brown weeds surrounding it some of first european americans to visit area were fur trappers led by peter skene ogden in 1827 in 1841 united states exploring expedition passed through rogue valley neither ogden nor expedition mentioned table rocks gold rush of early 1850s brought many emigrants to area and table rock city soon renamed jacksonville was established several miles south of rocks sudden increase of settlers created conflicts with rogue river indians these conflicts turned into warfare and several treaties were signed in an attempt to end hostilities in june 1851 soldiers of united states army led by major philip kearny attacked takelma near lower table rock but takelma were prepared one soldier died and three others were injured major kearny returned with volunteers from soon after accompanied by oregon territory delegate joseph lane hostilities resumed in 1853 culminating in battle of table rock which actually took place in evans creek drainage in september 1853 native americans signed a peace treaty with joseph lane and treaty with rogue river with joel palmer which resulted in their ceding of land in exchange for 60 000 15 000 of which was to be used to repay white settlers for losses sustained in hostilities and 5 000 of which was set aside to purchase agricultural implements and other improvements benefitting native americans takelma population underwent their first forced migration into table rock reservation located between upper table rock and nearby evans creek this reservation remained open for three years while inhabitants were moved to other reservations in january 1856 400 native americans were moved to grande ronde reservation to north most of rest were relocated to siletz reservation in may development of area commenced immediately and in 1872 table rock post office was established just south of upper table rock and east of lower table rock table rock school district was created in 1879 in 1895 post office s name was changed to and it was closed in 1906 telephones arrived in 1908 and table rock mutual telephone company was established school district was merged with central point s district in 1948 thumb lower table rock from kirtland road to south alt lower table rock from across a field similar to upper table rock it rises steeply to its very flat top in november 1948 john day a local cattle rancher and developer built a airstrip on surface of lower table rock to impress visiting celebrities from hollywood day funded residential lots near landmark with intent of marketing lots to celebrities who used grassy runway runway was closed in late 1980s but small airplanes still occasionally attempt to land on it thumb left located on upper table rock federal aviation administration has operated a tall very high frequency omnidirectional range vor aviation tower on upper table rock since 1960s tower s purpose is to broadcast precise coordinates to nearby aircraft to assist in navigation facility is closed to public due to threat to safety of occupants of aircraft however structure sustained 40 000 damage in 1997 when vandals unsuccessfully attempted to steal aluminum antennas from tall fiberglass shell on roof of building nature conservancy became concerned about in 1978 and launched its largest fundraising project to that date collecting over 500 000 they purchased of lower table rock creating lower table rock preserve projects include prescribed burning and invasive species removal in 1981 youth conservation corps constructed upper table rock trail a year later through efforts of john ifft lower table rock trail was constructed first were built by a central point boy scout troop and rest was built by oregon department of forestry in 1984 table rocks were designated an area of critical environmental concern by bureau of land management in may 2009 nature conservancy bought another of land on table rocks for 3 9 million ending private ownership of rocks ecological habitats thumb western fence lizard on lower table rock a western buttercup flower is blooming above it alt tan colored lizard in grass near a rock a 5 petaled yellow flower is directly above it four overlapping ecological regions have been identified on table rocks with considerable differences in variety of wildlife found in each from outermost base of rocks three regions consisting of oak savanna chaparral and mixed woodland surround relatively flat tops andesite cap is covered by fourth region mounded prairie this region formed when caps were slowly eroded by freezing and thawing of water that seeped into ground ice erosion which created layers of mounded soil vernal pools fill in from october to june in mounded prairie area due to andesite s pools support species of plants and animals over 340 species of plants grow on rocks including approximately 200 species of wildflowers some of most common wildflowers are western buttercups desert parsley bicolor lupine and california goldfields camas and death camas also grow on rocks camas produces an edible bulb while death camas is poisonous and was used by takelma as an anesthetic more than 70 species of animals are known to live on table rocks lizards such as western fence lizard southern alligator lizard and western skink have been seen in all four regions of table rocks western rattlesnakes and two species of garter snakes also live in all regions black tailed deer coyotes and bobcats are some of mammals that live on table rocks rocks are also home to western black legged ticks although they are mainly found in chaparral region many species of birds live on rocks table rocks experience a mediterranean climate average wind speed in area is less than and annual precipitation is approximately due to rain shadow created by klamath mountains it rarely snows in winter oak savanna thumb left buckbrush in bloom on lower table rock alt hemispherical clumps of small white flowers with yellowish centers oak savanna is a type of grassland with scattered oak trees found on lowest slopes of table rocks takelma tribe often set fires in oak savanna and chaparral regions to prevent brush overgrowth creating foraging areas for animals such as deer and elk it also prevented large wildfires oregon white oak and ponderosa pine are most common trees found in region buckbrush sticky manzanita pacific madrone mountain mahogany and pacific poison oak are also common snakes such as ringneck snake western yellow bellied racer striped and pacific gopher snake live in oak savanna region birds such as oak ash throated flycatcher white breasted nuthatch western bluebird violet green swallow acorn woodpecker black headed grosbeak and american kestrel have also been found in this region rocks are known to be northernmost place blue gray gnatcatchers inhabit gall wasps live in this area often creating galls in oak trees by injecting their larva into their leaves and branches chaparral chaparral is a type of shrubland receiving very little precipitation sclerophyllous plants such as manzanita and buckbrush grow in this area both relying on fire to reproduce rare s fritillary also grows in this region american black bears have been spotted in chaparral region usually in fall most common birds include titmice and acorn woodpecker blue gray gnatcatchers lesser goldfinches and anna s hummingbirds have also been seen mixed woodland mixed woodland region is a dense forest with many species of trees located near tops of plateaus forest canopy shades ground resulting in a cooler temperature canopy also reduces amount of water evaporation california black oak douglas fir pacific madrone incense cedar and other plants grow in mixed woodland shrubs such as oregon grape honeysuckle blue elderberry and pacific poison oak also grow here soil in this area is mostly loam rodents such as california ground squirrel western gray squirrel and dusky footed live in this region birds such as grosbeaks flycatchers western tanagers and lazuli buntings are common in area nine species of warblers three species of vireos and two species of thrushes can also be found pileated woodpecker has been spotted rarely in large pine trees mounded prairie and vernal pools thumb vernal pool and mounded prairie on lower table rock plateau mount mcloughlin can be seen in background mounded prairie region is located on top of plateaus characterized by many species grasses and wildflowers around vernal pools with mounds of soil created by erosion dwarf woolly meadowfoam a plant endemic to table rocks grows near these pools they bloom for about ten days in april when filled in winter and early spring pools are also a known habitat for vernal pool fairy shrimp branchinecta lynchi a threatened species two types of amphibians are found in mounded prairie region typically around vernal pools pacific tree frog lives in large numbers on rocks while tadpoles of rarer western toad can be seen between march and may mammals such as california voles heermann s kangaroo rats raccoons and long tailed weasels can also be found in this region western meadowlark and two species of sparrows are most common types of birds that are seen in area turkey vultures rock wren three species of hawks and other birds patrol cliffs on sides of plateaus trails thumb upper table rock trail alt gravel trail winding through thick vegetation table rocks offer one of most popular hiking locations in rogue valley with over 45 000 visitors annually over 4 600 people per year participate in guided hikes through table rock environmental education program hosted by bureau of land management and nature conservancy lower table rock features a walking trail which climbs approximately to top of plateau over a distance of it has eight interpretive panels along its length explaining history flora and fauna of region upper table rock also has a walking trail long ascending approximately trails are most popular with hikers between march and may when wildflowers are in bloom another peak occurs in september through october landmarks such as mount mcloughlin mount ashland roxy ann peak and pilot rock are visible on clear days from edge of rocks thumb left several large andesite columns separating from lower table rock alt several very tall columns of dark gray rock rising out of a forest youth conservation corps boy scouts and oregon department of forestry built trails leading to tops of table rocks in early 1980s around same time plateaus were being nominated as an area of critical environmental concern in june 1999 only two small trees were cut when shady cove contractor randy hodges rerouted a section of lower table rock trail to accommodate growing number of visitors project involved decommissioning old section expanding parking lot and installing of new trail measures to protect trail were implemented such as installing rock and a layer of shale gravel over clay in 2005 a program to build an interpretive trail began on lower table rock near trailhead prior to construction some persons with disabilities children or elderly may have been prevented from using either of table rocks due to steep terrain and narrow paths finished project involved making a section of trail accessible and adding a long section of new trail for general public use both trails lead to extensive views of surrounding areas but have inherent dangers as well thick andesite caps are heavily eroded leaving tall crumbling columns near their edges at least six people have fallen from table rocks since 2006 including a man from central point who tumbled through a rock shaft on lower table rock to his death in may 2007 and was not found for over nineteen months another man from murray utah fell from lower table rock and
