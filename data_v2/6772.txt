teesside energy from waste plant also known as teesside power station or haverton hill incinerator is a municipal waste incinerator and waste to energy power station which provides 29 2 megawatts mw of electricity for national grid by burning 390 000 tonnes of household and commercial waste a year it is located on river tees at haverton hill east of billingham in north east england operated by sita uk since its conception plant replaced portrack incinerator and opened in 1998 station is one of most modern incinerators operating in england it is noted for its innovative operation in 2009 an extension was completed at station with construction of an extra furnace line and a rail head this increased capacities of plant from 19 2 mw and 250 000 tonnes of waste per year to its current levels plant initially burned only waste from teesside but this was extended to include northumberland with 2009 extension a second plant north east energy recovery centre neerc has planning permission to be built on land adjacent to current plant if built this will extend plant s catchment to include waste from south tyne and wear history replacement for portrack between 1975 and 1996 portrack incinerator on river tees burned 200 000 tonnes of teesside s waste every year generating 20 megawatts of electricity in doing so in november 1996 plant was closed down after it failed to meet emission regulations it was then demolished in stages between 1998 and 2000 following closure of portrack plant a new facility to burn teesside s refuse was constructed teesside energy from waste plant was opened in may 1998 as a collaboration between sita uk station s operator and local authorities of stockton on tees middlesbrough hartlepool and redcar cleveland third incineration line in december 2006 sita uk signed a 28 year private finance initiative contract worth ps70 million with northumberland county council to provide them with waste management services and to reduce county s reliance upon landfill this included construction of an extra incineration line at teesside plant civil construction of extension began in april 2007 with heavy erection beginning that november von roll was general contractor for entire extension in may 2009 third line which cost ps70 million to build was brought into operation it was officially opened on 8 october 2009 by former mp hilary armstrong sita uk chief executive david palmer jones and northumberland county councillor jeff reid at various times between 60 and 100 people were employed in building third line and an additional 20 full time jobs were created for its operation once open built on time and within budget extension surpassed expectations in its first year of operation a year after opening of third line only a fifth of amount of waste that was being sent to landfill in northumberland prior to its opening was still being sent there design and specification plant is a large metal clad building metal is finished in colour grey accented in solent blue and petra red plant s clean clear lines and colours are said to contrast favourably with nearby industrial buildings until 2009 station had two operating furnace lines which together were capable of burning a total of 250 000 tonnes of waste per year and generated 20 mw of electricity however in may 2009 a third line was brought into operation plant currently burns 360 000 tonnes of waste a year and generates 29 2 mw of electricity this is enough electricity to power 60 000 homes original plant uses babcock wilcox volund boilers to provide steam for a single ansaldo turbo generator rated at 19 2 mw third line uses a von roll inova reciprocating grate to burn waste and generates electricity using a single von roll inova three pass steam generator rated at 10 mw operations station operates constantly burning municipal household waste from local councils of stockton on tees hartlepool middlesbrough redcar cleveland north tyneside and northumberland when there is a shortfall in household waste non hazardous industrial and commercial waste are used to make up capacity station burns only residual waste which is material left over after recycling incinerator operates 24 hours a day seven days a week waste is delivered to station by road using up to 100 waste collection vehicles up to 2 800 tonnes of waste a week or as much as 1 000 tonnes of waste a day can be delivered at plant a rail head was also built on railway sidings adjacent to site in 2009 this allows for waste to be delivered to plant by rail rather than just by road this is more sustainable as it reduces amount of traffic on local roads in december 2011 it was announced that rail head would be used to receive up 500 000 tonnes of residual waste per year from merseyside via a rail waste transfer facility at knowsley industrial park kirkby in a contract worth ps400 million waste arriving at plant is checked in and weighed before being delivered to plant s reception hall large reception hall allows vehicles to dump their waste safely air for combustion of waste later in plant is drawn from reception hall so that odour and dust doesn t pollute building s surroundings from hall waste is tipped into a large concrete bunker here feedstock is by a crane operator who mixes and removes unsuitable waste a grab crane then manoeuvers waste from bunker to hoppers that feed furnace this crane is operated from a control room this room also monitors equipment in plant combustion gases and maximises efficiency of plant from hoppers waste falls onto furnace charging chute and from there onto incinerating grate here it is burned at a temperature in excess of 1 200 degc this heat is then converted into super heated steam through plant s boilers this in turn powers steam turbines much in same way as a conventional thermal power station electricity is generated at 11 kilovolts after exiting turbines steam is condensed back to water for original two incinerating lines use river water from tees as a cooling medium whereas in third line water is condensed through air cooled condenser cooled water is treated and reused in boilers gases from furnace are cleaned using selective non catalytic reduction spray absorbers and active carbon injection these processes remove nitrogen oxides acidic gasses dioxins and heavy metals from plants emissions remaining gases are passed through fine fabric bag filters to remove any particles before it is released from chimney each incineration line has its own independent stack in chimney and flue gases are continuously monitored before being released this information is relayed to control room remaining fly ash from filters contains particles from incineration lime from spray absorbers salt and carbon dust and so is stored in a sealed silo until it is taken from site for disposal incinerator bottom ash left on incineration grate after burning is moved by conveyor to a bunker whilst on conveyor a magnet removes ferrous metal from ash for recycling remaining ash is then used as an aggregate in construction industry a recycling centre operates next to plant which opened in december 2001 in 2006 a composting facility was opened environmental impact waste to energy plants are strictly monitored and plant has achieved various iso external certificates plant is seen to be at forefront of sustainable energy production and waste disposal plant not only reduces amount of waste sent to landfill but displaces burning of depleting fossil fuels and makes significant contributions to meeting north east region s waste recovery and recycling targets future north east energy recovery centre thumb right a rendition of planned second plant in 2008 it was announced sita had plans to build another efw plant adjacent to current one named north east energy recovery centre neerc sita uk began consulting key partners stakeholders and local residents on these plans in april 2008 before submitting a formal planning application that summer permission for plant s construction was granted on 15 october 2008 on 17 september 2010 it was announced that sita had signed a contract with south tyne and wear waste management partnership for their waste to be burned at neerc once plant was completed construction is expected to begin in early 2011 in time for a 2013 completion date neerc is expected to be capable of handling up to 190 000 tonnes of waste per year this waste will be burned to generate electricity for national grid and to provide heat for local industries in form of steam neerc will have two processing lines capable of generating 21 mw of electricity enough to provide for 37 500 homes this means that over two facilities 640 000 tonnes of waste will be burned annually and over 50 mw of electricity generated this would make teesside largest operational efw centre in uk outside london plant will be a mirror image of current one and will create 160 jobs 25 in south tyne and wear 100 in construction of plant and rest once plant is operational in august 2010 sita teamed up with uk to build another waste to energy facility in teesside region wilton 11 on wilton international complex is to burn a further 400 000 tonnes of waste in region whilst generating 35 mw of electricity plant is expected to be operational by 2015 references category power stations in
