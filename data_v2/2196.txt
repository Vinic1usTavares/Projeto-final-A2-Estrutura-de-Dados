typhoon irma known in philippines as typhoon daling affected philippines in late june 1985 typhoon irma originated from a monsoon trough situated near guam in western pacific ocean it slowly developed with insufficient organization delaying classification as a tropical cyclone by june 24 organization improved as system encountered favorable conditions aloft and disturbance attained tropical storm intensity next day moving west irma gradually deepened and on june 28 it was believed to have attained typhoon intensity on morning of june 27 irma was upgraded into a typhoon after passing northeast of philippines typhoon irma attained its peak intensity on june 29 accelerating to north and then northeast irma steadily weakened as it encountered significantly less favorable conditions typhoon made landfall in central japan on june 30 irma weakened below typhoon intensity next day and later on july 1 irma transition into an extratropical cyclone remnants of cyclone were tracked until july 7 when it merged with an extratropical low south of kamchatka peninsula although irma stayed offshore philippines moisture associated with storm inundated areas already affected by typhoon hal earlier in week capital city of manila was 60 flooded resulting in evacuation of 40 000 six drownings were reported in nearby suburb of quezon city where 1 000 families were evacuated citywide eight people were killed in olongapo city seven people were buried because of a landslide overall more than 500 000 people were directly affected by typhoon throughout country a total of 253 homes were destroyed with 1 854 others partially damaged nationwide 65 people were killed due to typhoon and damage totaled 16 million 1985 usd across japan irma brought widespread flooded that resulted in 1 475 mudslides which damaged 625 residencies storm left 650 000 customers without power in chiba prefecture seven people were injured in capital city of tokyo 119 trees were toppled 40 homes were flooded 20 flights

19 people were killed and 49 others were injured a total of 811 dwellings were destroyed and 10 000 others were damage throughout country storm inflicted 545 million in damage meteorological history during mid june 1985 monsoon trough in western pacific retreated eastward to near guam spawning several areas of low pressure at 00 00 utc on june 17 a tropical disturbance embedded within monsoon trough was detected by meteorologists on weather satellite imagery about southwest of island of ponape although disturbance s surface circulation was initially ill defined interaction with an upper level low ull to southeast of guam associated with a broader tropical upper tropospheric trough tutt enhanced development and thus low was slow to develop moving west northwest south of a ridge disturbance passed south southeast of truk atoll early on june 18 following an increase of thunderstorm activity associated with disturbance in both coverage and organization jtwc issued a tropical cyclone formation alert tcfa for system at noon same day during next three days disturbance maintained vigorous but poorly organized convection data from a hurricane hunter aircraft on june 19 failed to locate a surface circulation that afternoon tcfa was re issued on afternoon of june 20 hurricane hunters finally founded a closed circulation but outflow from nearby typhoon hal inhibited further development early on june 22 tcfa was cancelled because of a decrease in thunderstorm activity by june 24 however vertical wind shear had begun to relax coinciding with an expansion of storm s southwesterly outflow channel several hours later japan meteorological agency jma started tracking cyclone after an increase in thunderstorm activity tcfa was re issued for fifth and final time on evening of june 24 based on a rapid improvement in system s convective structure and dvorak classifications of tropical storm intensity jtwc upgraded system to tropical storm irma early on june 25 shortly thereafter a hurricane hunter aircraft measured winds of and a minimum barometric pressure of though these winds were displaced roughly to west of center based on this jma followed suit and declared system a tropical cyclone at 06 00 utc on june 25 at around same time philippine atmospheric geophysical and astronomical services administration pagasa started to follow storm and assigned it with local name daling at midday on june 25 jma upgraded irma to severe tropical storm intensity initially jtwc predicted irma to follow hal along monsoon trough into south china sea before curving around a subtropical ridge irma slowly deepened and according to jma system attained a secondary peak intensity of late on june 25 however by june 26 jtwc revised its forecast and instead expected storm to take a more northerly trek on june 27 irma s forward speed slowed as it approached edge of subtropical ridge situated along 130th meridian east while intensifying that morning both jtwc and jma estimated that irma attained typhoon intensity this upgraded was primarily based on data from ship reports continuing to intensify irma moved northward however by june 28 jma indicated that irma leveled off in intensity at 00 00 utc on june 29 jtwc estimated a peak intensity of six hours later jma increased intensity of typhoon to its maximum intensity at this time agency also assessed pressure of storm at shortly after its peak typhoon irma began to accelerate towards northeast in direction of central japan in response to westerlies irma quickly weakened and on evening of june 29 jma decreased intensity of irma to tracking just east of ryukyu islands irma began to acquire extratropical characteristics a hurricane hunter flight on june 30 suggested that that typhoon was encountering cooler and drier air although storm maintained a eye that evening typhoon made landfall on honshu at 00 00 utc on july 1 jma downgraded irma into a severe tropical storm six hours later cyclone completed its extratropical transition near tokyo jtwc issued its final warning on system jma continued monitor system as it passed northeast of kuril islands on july 7 jma ceased tracking system as it had merged with an extratropical low south of kamchatka peninsula preparations and impact prior to arrival of irma storm signals were issued for much of luzon including samar and catanduanes although system remained offshore taiwan it came close enough to require storm signals even though typhoon irma passed well east to philippines over of rain fell over parts of luzon these rains resulted in major flooding irma was also second storm to directly affect nation within a week following typhoon hal capital city of manila sustained flooding along low lying areas which stranded motorists a total of 60 of city was flooded forcing evacuation of 40 000 persons six drownings occurred in suburb of quezon city where 1 000 families were evacuated 700 to churches and 300 to schools
