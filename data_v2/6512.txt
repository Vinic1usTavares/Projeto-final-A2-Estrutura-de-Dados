action of 6 april 1809 was a small naval battle fought between french frigate and several british frigates principally as part of blockade of brest france during napoleonic wars during wars a central part of british strategy was to isolate french ports from international trade in an attempt to both restrict french imports of food and military supplies and simultaneously to damage french economy to achieve this british warships maintained a constant vigil off french coastline attacking ships that attempted to enter or leave french ports despite threat that their ships faced communication and transfer of supplies between france and her colonies was vital to french war effort and french navy made constant attempts to evade patrolling british squadrons in late 1808 a significant french squadron was deployed to isle de france now mauritius to disrupt british trade in indian ocean this force required reinforcement and supply from france and periodic attempts were made to reach isolated convoy with new frigates first of which was niemen niemen was a new and fast ship carrying 40 guns and a large quantity of much needed naval supplies however in order to leave her home port of brest it was necessary to avoid contact with british frigates that constantly watched entrance to harbour in search of enemy movement in april 1809 these ships were hms amethyst and loosely supported by other patrolling ships and tasked specifically with capture of niemen acting on intelligence passed on by admiralty when niemen emerged on 5 april she was immediately spotted and chased amethyst retained contact throughout night and brought french ship to action on morning of 6 april ensuing battle was fiercely contested and both ships suffered severe damage and heavy casualties while outcome of battle was still undecided a second british frigate arrived outnumbered french captain saw no alternative and surrendered his ship late arrival of arethusa under captain robert mends who claimed victory for himself sparked a furious argument that developed into a lasting animosity between mends and captain michael seymour of amethyst failure of niemen to reach isle de france also had serious repercussions for french squadron there with naval supplies severely limited their ability to operate at sea for long periods of time was hampered and by late 1810 few of their vessels were still seaworthy background during napoleonic wars as with french revolutionary wars that preceded them british royal navy enjoyed almost complete dominance at sea by 1809 their superiority was so entrenched that few french ships even left port because to do so meant breaking through a system of blockading warships off every major french harbour gardiner p 17 biggest port in france at time was brest in brittany and thus it was there that greatest concentration of british warships off french coast was concentrated main squadron was formed from large ships of line often dubbed offshore squadron due to their position up to a hundred miles from coast to avoid risks posed by rocky biscay shore this was complemented by inshore squadron formed primarily from frigates and brigs which was tasked with watching myriad entry points to brest and other biscay ports these frigates often sailed independently or in small squadrons maintaining contact with each other and with offshore squadron via signals and despatch boats gardiner p 34 despite their inferiority at sea both in numbers and experience frigates of french navy were still required to leave port regularly on raiding missions against british commerce and to convoy supplies and reinforcements to overseas regions of french empire these colonies formed bases for french commerce raiders and in 1808 a determined effort was made to develop a raiding squadron on french indian ocean territories of isle de france and ile bonaparte these ships led by commodore jacques hamelin required regular resupply from france as they were unable to repair damage and replenish ammunition and food from reserves on indian ocean islands alone in early 1809 therefore it was decided to reinforce and resupply squadron by despatching newly built frigate from brest under captain jean dupotet woodman p 282 in january 1809 john tremayne rodd captain of frigate then part of inshore squadron obtained information that niemen was preparing to sail from brest rodd passed this information to admiralty who took immediate steps to intercept french ship wareham p 186 for this purpose they selected captains michael seymour of and frederick lewis maitland of hms emerald these captains had extensive experience serving with inshore squadron off brest and seymour who had lost an arm at glorious first of june was much in favour for his recent capture of french frigate at action of 10 november 1808 seymour sir michael oxford dictionary of national biography j k laughton subscription required retrieved 24 january 2009 seymour and maitland during their patrols in 1808 that led to capture of thetis had entered into a verbal agreement that any prize money they earned would be shared equally over both crews this agreement continued on their new commission which was jealously guarded from other captains when seymour discovered hunting in same area in march he was furious and ordered her away wareham p 187 battle on 3 april 1809 niemen laden with provisions and naval stores for isle de france sailed from brest passing through rocky passages that sheltered port during night and thus avoiding discovery by regular inshore squadron steering westwards dupotet made good time travelling nearly over next two days with intention of escaping british patrols in bay of biscay and reaching open atlantic at 11 00 on 5 april however dupotet spotted two sails to northwest assuming them to be british dupotet turned southwards in hope of outrunning them sails which belonged to amethyst and emerald immediately gave chase throughout day three ships sailed southward amethyst slightly gaining on niemen but leaving emerald far behind maitland s ship disappearing from view at 19 20 as darkness fell james p 157 dupotet attempted to throw off pursuit during night by turning westwards once more but seymour anticipated this manoeuvre and turned his ship westwards as well discovering niemen only a few miles ahead at 21 40 clowes p 433 rapidly gaining on french ship seymour began firing his bow chasers small guns situated in bows of frigate in an attempt to damage her rigging so that he could bring his broadsides to bear dupotet responded with his stern chasers but by 01 00 on 6 april it was clear that amethyst was going to catch french frigate pursuit had been exhausting since first sighting british ships niemen had travelled over and was just from spanish coast when she was caught at 01 15 amethyst opened fire niemen immediately responding and turning to northeast in an attempt to shake off british ship seymour followed his opponent and at 01 45 was again close enough to engage frigates firing upon one another from close range for over an hour james p 158 at 02 45 amethyst was able to pull across bows of niemen inflicting a devastating raking fire on french ship which caused terrible damage niemen surged forward into amethyst but collision caused little damage and at 03 00 amethyst again raked her opponent this time from east clowes p 434 frigates were so close that shot from amethyst started fires among niemens hammock netting placed along decks to deter boarding actions at 03 15 niemens and main topmast collapsed and another fire broke out in main top but amethyst was also severely damaged and at 03 30 her mainmast fell onto deck from a combination of shot damage and stress in high winds niemens mainmast also collapsed a few minutes later both frigates had stopped firing at 03 25 as confusion on their decks was brought under control although niemen was very badly damaged amethyst was almost uncontrollable and despite seymour s best efforts he was unable to close with niemen to ensure her surrender dupotet meanwhile was overseeing hasty repairs in hope of getting away before amethyst could recover at 03 45 however a new ship emerged from darkness soon revealed to be british frigate hms arethusa clowes p 435 arethusa was deployed as part of force blockading ports of northern spain and her commander captain robert mends was a successful officer who had been commended just two weeks earlier for raiding french held port of lekeitio james p 156 mends immediately pulled alongside niemen and dupotet fired a single shot each at amethyst and arethusa shot at amethyst missed its target but one at arethusa struck ship and threw up splinters mends was struck on forehead and badly wounded only man to be hit both amethyst and arethusa then opened fire niemen surrendering immediately mends sir robert oxford dictionary of national biography j k laughton subscription required retrieved 24 january 2009 aftermath aside from captain mends on arethusa casualties were severe on both sides amethyst had eight killed and 37 wounded from a crew of 222 while french ship lost 47 killed and 73 wounded from a crew of 339 recriminations among british officers began within minutes of french surrender mends took possession of niemen and sent a note to seymour informing him that he had seized valuable french nautical charts and french captain s personal stores note also requested that seymour send back arethusa s surgeon who had gone aboard amethyst to assist with wounded so that mends could be ready to leave without notice wareham p 186 seymour who was still effecting hasty repairs and dealing with his casualties responded angrily forcing mends to back down and return stores seymour was also annoyed by mends late arrival which meant that arethusa was entitled to half prize money from captured frigate without having done any of fighting repairs were completed on 7 april and amethyst and niemen limped back to plymouth arriving on 13 april wareham p 191 on arrival in britain seymour was celebrated and rewarded with a baronetcy for his second victory in less than six months while all of his officers were promoted niemen was purchased into navy for sum of ps29 979 2 10d which was split between government crew and a number of other parties share that went to captors came under dispute mends had no intention of abiding by seymour s agreement with maitland and refused to allow emerald to share in prize money wareham p 188 seymour and maitland took mends to court and ensuing legal battle lasted years mends deliberately exaggerating his role in capture of niemen in public although privately admitting that victory was entirely seymour s seymour and mends became bitter enemies and their animosity continued throughout their lives although both remained in navy and had successful careers forty years later battle was among actions recognised by a clasp attached to naval general service medal awarded upon application to all british participants still living in 1847 in france action was infamous for a despatch supposedly sent by dupotet and subsequently printed in edited form in newspaper le moniteur universel report which was later used by mends in his dispute with seymour claimed that niemen had not only been largely undamaged before arethusa s arrival but that seymour had actually surrendered to french captain before mends arrived this story almost totally invented was widely believed in france at time effect on mauritius campaign of defeat of niemen was not immediately apparent hamelin s squadron remaining a menace to british shipping well into 1810 however in aftermath of destructive battle of grand port french although victors were unable to repair their ships due to lack of naval stores and their effectiveness declined until they were unable to resist invasion of isle de france in november 1810 woodman p 291 this inability was directly related to failure of all but one of french frigates sent to reinforce and resupply island to reach it others either captured or driven back en
