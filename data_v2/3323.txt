drosera anglica commonly known as english sundew or great sundew is a carnivorous plant species belonging to sundew family droseraceae it is a temperate species with a generally circumboreal range although it does occur as far south as japan southern europe and island of kauai in hawaii where it grows as a subtropical sundew it is thought to originate from an amphidiploid hybrid of d rotundifolia and d linearis meaning that a sterile hybrid between these two species doubled its chromosomes to produce fertile progeny which stabilized into current d anglica morphology thumb left 150px a large d anglica plant with hand for scale drosera anglica is a perennial herb which forms an upright stemless rosette of generally linear spatulate leaves as is typical for sundews laminae are densely covered with stalked mucilaginous glands each tipped with a clear droplet of a viscous fluid used for trapping insects lamina which is long is held semi erect by a long petiole bringing total leaf size to 30 95 mm plants are green coloring red in bright light in all populations except those in kaua i d anglica forms winter resting buds called hibernacula these consist of a knot of tightly curled leaves at ground level which unfurl in spring at end of dormancy period root system is weak and penetrates only a few centimeters serving mainly as an anchor and for water absorption nitrogen is in short supply in bogs and trapping and digesting insects provides an alternate source drosera anglica flowers in summer sending up peduncles long bearing several white flowers which open individually like other sundews flowers have five sepals petals and stamens petals for this species are 8 12 mm long and flowers have branched 2 lobed styles odorless nectar less flowers do not rely on insect pollinators for pollination rather setting seed well through self pollination black ovoid seed forms in a dehiscent capsule and is 1 to mm long carnivory d anglica with a leaf bent around a fly thumb 210px right a d anglica leaf bent around a trapped fly like all sundews d anglica uses stalked mucilaginous glands called tentacles which cover its laminae to attract trap and digest small arthropods usually insects these are attracted by a sugary scent exuded by glands and upon alighting on plant adhere to sticky drops of mucilage although most of its prey consists of small insects such as flies bulkier insects with large wings are also caught small butterflies damselflies and even dragonflies can become immobilized by plant s sticky mucilage plant s initial response to contact with prey consists of movement in response to touch tentacle movement with tentacles bending toward prey and center of leaf to maximize contact d anglica is also capable of further movement being able to bend actual leaf blade around prey to further digestion process tentacle movement can occur in a matter of minutes whereas leaf takes hours or days to bend when something gets caught tentacles touching prey exude additional mucilage to mire down prey which eventually dies of exhaustion or is asphyxiated as mucilage clogs its tracheae once prey has been digested and resulting nutrient solution has been absorbed by plant leaf unfurls leaving only prey s exoskeleton behind habitat thumb left 200px d anglica growing on a quaking bog in wallowa mountains of oregon drosera anglica grows in open non forested habitat with wet often calcium rich soils these include bogs marl fens quaking bogs cobble shores and other calcareous habitats this tolerance of calcium is relatively rare in rest of genus d anglica is often associated with various sphagnum mosses and many times grows in a soil substrate that is entirely composed of living dead or decomposed sphagnum sphagnum wicks moisture to surface while simultaneously it what soil nutrients are not seeped away by constant moisture are often used up by sphagnum or made unavailable by low soil ph since nutrient availability is low competition from other plants is diminished allowing carnivorous english sundew to flourish distribution thumb right 300px world distribution of d anglica drosera anglica is one of most widely distributed sundews in world it is generally circumboreal meaning that it is found at high latitudes around globe in a few areas however it is found farther south particularly in japan southern europe hawaiian island of kauai and california plants from hawaii where it is known as are generally smaller than normal and do not experience a winter dormancy period its natural habitat includes 12 u s states including alaska and 11 canadian provinces and territories altitudinal range is from 5 m to at least 2000 m special origins all north american drosera species except for d anglica have a chromosome count of 2n 20 in 1955 wood noted that d anglica had a chromosome count of 2n 40 and hypothesized that it was of hybrid amphidiploid origin since leaf morphology of d anglica is an intermediary between that of d rotundifolia and d linearis and two occur sympatrically in several locations wood conjectured that d anglica likely originated from a hybrid between these two all north american drosera species produce sterile hybrids natural hybrid d rotundifolia x d linearis conventionally but incorrectly referred to as drosera is also sterile but is morphologically similar to modern d anglica errors in meiosis during ovule and pollen production however can result in a chromosome doubling which can allow for viable seed to be produced resulting plants known as would be fertile woods noted that this appeared to be an ongoing process with d anglica speciating from d rotundifolia x d linearis through in multiple locations question remains as to why d anglica is so widespread whereas range of d linearis is limited to great lakes region of north america greater adaptability of d anglica to varied habitat conditions could be a major factor botanical history drosera anglica was first described by william hudson in 1778 it has frequently been confused with other circumpolar long leaf drosera d intermedia this confusion was fueled by resurfacing of an older name d longifolia described by carl linnaeus in 1753 which was regarded as being too ambiguous in description and had been applied to specimens of both d anglica and d intermedia herbarium specimens were also a mix of two species these points led martin cheek to propose d longifolia for rejection as a species name in 1998 proposal was accepted and taxon listed as rejected in 1999 hybrids several naturally occurring hybrids involving d anglica exist these include d anglica x capillaris d x d anglica x filiformis d x d anglica x linearis d anglica x intermedia d x d anglica x spatulata d x nagamoto d linearis x anglica d x d rotundifolia x anglica d x obovata these are all sterile in addition several man made hybrids have been made gallery references external links jepson manual
