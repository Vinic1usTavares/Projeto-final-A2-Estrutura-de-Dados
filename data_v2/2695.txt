saying i have heard from wise men that when moon of turan rises up it will be harmed by sun of iranians sun was always imagined as male and in some banners a figure of a male replaces symbol of sun in others a male figure accompanies sun similarly lion too has always had a close association with iranian kingship garments and throne decorations of achaemenid kings were embroidered with lion motifs

dialects word for king shah is pronounced as sher homonymous with word for lion islamic turkish and mongol influences also stressed symbolic association of lion and royalty earliest evidence for use of a lion on a standard comes from shahnameh which noted that feudal house of presumably a family of parthian or sassanid times adopted a golden lion for its devices islamic turkic mongolic roots islamic turkic and mongol traditions stressed symbolic association of lion and royalty in lion and sun motif these cultures reaffirmed charismatic power of sun and mongols re introduced veneration of sun especially sunrise lion is probably represented more frequently and diversely than any other animal in most forms lion has no apotropaic meaning and was merely decorative however it sometimes has an astrological or symbolic meaning one of popular forms of lion is explicitly heraldic form including in persian coat of arms lion and sun animal in coat of arms of mamluk baybars and perhaps also in

mojtaba and saeed nafisi s vast amount of literary and archaeological evidence show that ancient zodiacal sign of sun in house of leo become a popular emblematic figure in 12th century cf zodiacal origin above koprulu suggests that lion and sun on turkic and mongolic flags and coins of these times are merely astrological signs and do not exemplify royalty lion and sun symbol first appears in 12th century most notably on coinage of kaykhusraw ii who was sultan of seljuk sultanate of rum from 1237 to 1246 these were probably to exemplify ruler s power notion that sun of symbol symbolized georgian wife of king is a myth for on one issue sun rests on back of two lions rampant with their tails interlaced and on some issues sun appears as a male bust other chief occurrences of 12th to

and on a 12th or 13th century bronze ewer now in palace museum in latter a rayed nimbus enclosing three female faces rests on a lion whose tail ends in a winged monster use of lion and sun symbol in a flag is first attested in a miniature painting illustrating a copy of shahnameh shams al din an epic on mongol conquest dated 1423 painting depicts several horsemen approaching walled city of nishapur one of horsemen carries a banner that bears a lion passant with a rising sun on its back pole is tipped with a crescent moon by time of safavids 1501 1722 and subsequent unification of iran as a single state lion and sun had become a familiar sign appearing on copper coins on banners and on works of art lion and sun motif was also used on banners of mughals of india notably those of shah jahan safavid dynasty right thumb 250px flag of iran carried by persian delegation during mohammad reza beg s entrance in versailles august 1715 in safavid times lion and sun stood for two pillars of society state and religion it is clear that although various and banners were employed by safavids during their rule especially earlier safavid kings by time of shah abbas lion and sun symbol had become one of most popular emblems of persia according to najmabadi safavid interpretation of this symbol was based on a combination of mytho histories and tales such as shahnameh stories of prophets and other islamic sources for safavids shah had two roles king and holy man this double meaning was associated with genealogy of iranian kings two males were key people in this paternity jamshid mythical founder of an ancient persian kingdom and ali shi te first imam jamshid was affiliated with sun and ali was affiliated with lion faqar shahbazi suggest that association may originally have been based on a learned interpretation of shahnameh s references to sun of iran and moon of turanians cf roman i e byzantine king as moon of west in iranian background section since ottoman sultans new sovereigns of rum had adopted moon crescent as their dynastic and ultimately national emblem safavids of persia needed to have a their own dynastic and national emblem therefore safavids chose lion and sun motif besides jamshid sun had two other important meanings for safavids sense of time was organized around solar system which was distinct from arab islamic lunar system astrological meaning and sense of cosmos was mediated through that through zodiac sun was linked to leo which was most auspicious house of sun therefore for safavids sign of lion and sun condensed double meaning of shah king and holy man jamshid and ali through auspicious zodiac sign of sun in house of leo and brought cosmic earthy pair king and imam together in seeking safavi interpretation of lion and sun motif shahbazi suggests that safavids had reinterpreted lion as symbolizing imam ali and sun as typifying glory of religion a substitute for ancient farr e din they reintroduced ancient concept of god given glory farr reinterpreted as light in islamic iran and prophet and ali had been credited with possession of a divine light of lights nur al anwar of leadership which was represented as a blazing halo they attributed such qualities to ali and sought king s genealogy through shia fourth imam s mother to royal sassanian house and zand dynasties royal seal of nadir shah in 1746 was lion and sun motif in this seal sun bears word al arabic earth of god two swords of karim khan zand have gold inlaid inscriptions which refer to celestial lion pointing to astrological relationship to zodiac sign of leo another record of this motif is lion and sun symbol on a tombstone of a zand soldier qajar and pahlavi dynasties islamic iranian interpretation earliest known qajar lion and sun symbol is on coinage of mohammad shah qajar minted in 1796 on occasion of shah s coronation coin bears name of new king underneath sun and ali first shi ite imam underneath lion s belly both names are invoked and this coin suggest that this motif still stands for king sun and religion lion and of sovereignty in qajar period emblem can be found on jewish marriage certificates and shi ite mourning of muharram banners nationalistic interpretation thumb 300px russo persian war 1804 1813 persian troops bearing lion and sun flag during reign of second qajar shah fat h ali shah qajar we observe beginning of a shift in political culture from safavi concept of rule islamic component of ruler was de emphasized if not completely abounded this shift coincides with first archaeological surveys of europeans in iran and re introduction of past glorious pre islamic history of iran to iranians fat h ali shah tried to affiliate his sovereignty with glorious years of pre islamic iran literary evidence and documents from his time suggest that sun in lion and sun motif was symbol of king and a metaphor of jamshid referring to rostam mythical hero of iran in shahnameh and fact that lion was symbol of rostam lion received a nationalistic interpretation lion was symbol of heroes of iran who are ready to protect country against enemies fat h ali shah addresses meanings of signs in two of his poems fat h ali shah turki shah universe enlightening jamshid lord of country iran universe adoring sun also iran of lions sun shah of iran it s for this that lion and sun is marked on banner of dara it was also during this time that he had sun throne constructed which is imperial throne of persia thumb 100px imperial order of lion and sun in 19th century european visitors at qajar court attributed lion and sun to remote antiquity which prompted mohammad shah qajar to give it a nationalistic interpretation in a decree published in 1846 it is stated that for each sovereign state an emblem is established and for august state of persia too order of lion and sun has been in use an ensign which is nearly three thousand years old indeed dating from before age of zoroaster and reason for its currency may have been as follows in religion of zoroaster sun is considered revealer of all things and of universe hence they venerated it this is followed by an astrological rationale for having selecting selected sun in house of leo as emblem of august state of persia decree then claims that use of order of lion and sun had existed in pre islamic zoroastrian iran until worship of sun was abolished by muslims suggests that in this decree native political considerations and anachronistic historical facts are mixed with curious astrological arguments at time lion and sun symbol stood state monarchy and nation of iran associated all with a pre islamic history order of lion and sun imperial order of lion and sun was instituted by fat h ali shah of qajar dynasty in 1808 to honour foreign officials later extended to persians who had rendered distinguished services to persia substantial changes in motif another change under second and third qajar king was of motif at this time lion was an african lion which had a longer mane and bigger body compared to persian lion yahya zoka suggests that this modification was influenced by contact with europeans according to shahbazi zu l faqar and lion decorated iranian flags at time it seems that towards end of fath ali shah s reign two logos were combined and lion representing ali was given ali s saber zu l faqar according to najmabadi occasionally we come across lion and sun with a sword in lion s paw and with a crown during this period mohammad shah s decree in 1836 states that lion must stand bear a saber to make it explicitly stands for military prowess of state crown was also added as a symbol of royalty rather than for any particular qajar monarch decree states that emblem is at once national royal and state emblem of iran in this period lion was depicted as more masculine and sun was female before this time sun could be male or female and lion was represented as a swordless friendly and subdued seated animal crown over lion and sun configuration consolidated association of symbol with monarchy sun lost its importance as icon of kingship and kiani crown became primary symbol of qajar monarchy under nasir al din shah logos varied from seated swordless lions to standing and sword bearing lions in february 1873 decree for order of aftab nishan i was issued by nasi al din shah after persian constitutional revolution in fifth amendment to constitution of 1906 lion and sun motif in flag of iran was described as a passant lion that holds a saber in its paw and with sun in its background a decree dated september 4 1910 specified exact details of logo including lion s tail like an italic s position and size of lion his paw sword and sun najmabadi observes a parallel symbolism on wall hangings produced between lion sun and reza khan motherland after reza khan s successful coup coy sun is protected by lion and is hero who should protect motherland under reza shah sun s female facial features were removed and sun was portrayed more realistically and merely with rays in military contexts pahlavi crown was added to motif pahlavis adopted lion and sun emblem from but they replaced qajar crown with pahlavi crown pahlavis reintroduced persian symbolism to motif as is discussed in persian traditions lion had been symbol of kingship and symbol of rustam s heroism in shahnameh many historical meanings of emblem while provide a solid ground for its power as national emblem of iran have also provided rich ground for competing symbols of iranian identity one important campaign to abolish emblem was initiated by mojtaba in 1929 in a report prepared at request of iranian embassy in london he insisted that lion and sun is turkic in origin he recommended that government replaces it with derafsh e kaviani one cannot attributed a national historical story to lion and sun emblem for it has no connection to ancient pre islamic history there is no evidence that iranians designed or created it we might as well get rid of this remnant of turkish people and adopt flag that symbolizes our mythical grandeur that is derafsh e kaviani his suggestion was ignored symbol was challenged during world war i while hasan was publishing derafsh e kaviani newspaper in berlin in his newspaper he argued that lion and sun is neither iranian in origin nor very ancient as people assume he insisted that lion and sun should be replaced by more iranian symbol of derafsh e kaviani after 1979 revolution 130px right thumb iranian diaspora use lion and sun emblem on iranian flags lion and sun
