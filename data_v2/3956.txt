four quartets is a set of four poems written by t s eliot that were published over a six year period first poem burnt norton was published with a collection of his early works 1936 s collected poems 1909 1935 after a few years eliot composed other three poems east coker dry salvages and little gidding which were written during world war ii and air raids on great britain they were first published as a series by faber and faber in great britain between 1940 and 1942 towards end of eliot s poetic career east coker in september 1940 burnt norton in february 1941 dry salvages in september 1941 and little gidding in 1942 poems were not collected until eliot s new york publisher printed them together in 1943 four quartets are four interlinked meditations with common theme being man s relationship with time universe and divine in describing his understanding of divine within poems eliot blends his anglo catholicism with mystical philosophical and poetic works from both eastern and western religious and cultural traditions with references to bhagavad gita and pre socratics as well as st john of cross and julian of norwich although many critics find four quartets to be eliot s last great work some of eliot s contemporary critics including george orwell were dissatisfied with eliot s overt religiosity orwell believed this was not a worthy topic to write about and a failing compared to his earlier work later critics disagreed with orwell s claims about poems and argued instead that religious themes made poem stronger overall reviews of poem within great britain were favourable while reviews in united states were split between those who liked eliot s later style and others who felt he had abandoned positive aspects of his earlier poetry background while working on his play murder in cathedral eliot came up with idea for a poem that was structured similarly to waste land ackroyd 1984 p 228 resulting poem burnt norton named after a manor house was published in eliot s 1936 edition of collected poems 1909 1935 grant 1997 p 37 eliot decided to create another poem similar to burnt norton but with a different location in mind this second poem east coker was finished and published by easter 1940 ackroyd 1984 pp 254 255 eliot visited east coker in 1937 and his ashes now repose there at st michael s church as eliot was finishing his second poem world war ii began to disrupt his life and he spent more time lecturing across great britain and helping out during war when he could it was during this time that eliot began working on dry salvages third poem which was put together near end of 1940 pinion 1986 p 48 this poem was published in february 1941 and eliot immediately began to plot out his fourth poem little gidding eliot s health declined and he stayed in shamley green to recuperate his illness and war disrupted his ability to write and he became dissatisfied with each draft he believed that problem with poem was with himself and that he had started poem too soon and written it too quickly by september 1941 he stopped writing and focused on his lecturing it was not until september 1942 that eliot finished last poem and it was finally published ackroyd 1984 pp 262 266 while writing east coker eliot thought of creating a quartet of poems that would reflect idea of four elements and loosely four seasons ackroyd 1984 p 262 as first four parts of waste land have each been associated with one of four classical elements so has each of constituent poems of four quartets air bn earth ec water ds and fire lg however there is little support for poems matching with individual seasons pinion 1986 p 219 eliot described what he meant by quartet in a 3 september 1942 letter to john hayward these poems are all in a particular set form which i have elaborated and word quartet does seem to me to start people on right track for understanding them sonata in any case is too musical it suggests to me notion of making a poem by weaving in together three or four superficially unrelated themes poem being degree of success in making a new whole out of them gardner 1978 qtd p 26 four poems comprising four quartets were first published together as a collection in new york in 1943 and then london in 1944 kirk 2008 p 239 original title was supposed to be kensington quartets after his time in kensington kirk 2008 p 266 poems were kept as a separate entity in united states until they were collected in 1952 as eliot s complete poems and plays and in united kingdom until 1963 as part of eliot s complete poems 1909 62 delay in collecting four quartets with rest of eliot s poetry separated them from his other work even though they were result of a development from his earlier poems moody 2006 p 143 world war ii outbreak of world war ii in 1939 pushed eliot further into belief that there was something worth defending in society and that germany had to be stopped there is little mention of war in eliot s writing except in a few pieces like defence of islands war became central to little gidding as eliot added in aspects of his own experience while serving as a watchman at faber building during london blitz four quartets were favoured as giving hope during war and also for a later religious revival movement bergonzi 1972 pp 150 154 by little gidding wwii is not just present time but connected also to english civil war bergonzi 1972 pp 172 poems each poem has five sections later poems connect to earlier sections with little gidding synthesising themes of earlier poems within its sections ackroyd 1984 p 270 within eliot s own poetry five sections connect to waste land this allowed eliot to structure his larger poems which he had difficulty with bergonzi 1972 p 164 according to c k stead structure is based on stead 1969 p 171 movement of time in which brief moments of eternity are caught worldly experience leading to dissatisfaction purgation in world divesting soul of love of created things a lyric prayer for or affirmation of need of intercession problem of attaining artistic wholeness which becomes an analogue for and merges into problem of achieving spiritual health these points can be applied to structure of waste land though there is not necessarily a fulfilment of these but merely a longing or discussion of them bergonzi 1972 p 165 burnt norton poem begins with two epigraphs taken from fragments of heraclitus first may be translated though wisdom is common many live as if they have wisdom of their own second way upward and way downward is one and same concept and origin of burnt norton is connected to eliot s play murder in cathedral ackroyd 1984 pp 228 230 poem discusses idea of time and concept that only present moment really matters because past cannot be changed and future is unknown kirk 2008 pp 246 247 in part i this meditative poem begins with narrator trying to focus on present moment while walking through a garden focusing on images and sounds like bird roses clouds and an empty pool in part ii narrator s meditation leads him her to reach still point in which he doesn t try to get anywhere or to experience place and or time instead experiencing a grace of sense in part iii meditation experience becomes darker as night comes on and by part iv it is night and time and bell have buried day in part v narrator reaches a contemplative end to his her meditation initially contemplating arts words and music as they relate to time narrator focuses particularly on poet s art of manipulating words which strain crack and sometimes break under burden of time under tension slip slide perish decay with imprecision and will not stay in place will not stay still by comparison narrator concludes that love is itself only cause and end of movement timeless and for this reason this spiritual experience of love is form of consciousness that most interests narrator presumably more than creative act of writing poetry east coker eliot started writing east coker in 1939 and modelled poem after burnt norton as a way to focus his thoughts poem served as a sort of opposite to popular idea that waste land served as an expression of disillusionment after world war i though eliot never accepted this interpretation poem focuses on life death and continuity between two humans are seen as disorderly and science is viewed as unable to save mankind from its flaws instead science and reason lead mankind to warfare and humanity needs to become humble in order to escape cycle of destruction to be saved people must recognize christ as their savior as well as their need for redemption kirk 2008 pp 250 252 dry salvages eliot began writing dry salvages at end of 1940 during air raids on london and managed to finish poem quickly poem included many personal images connecting to eliot s childhood and emphasised image of water and sailing as a metaphor for humanity according to poem there is a connection to all of mankind within each man if we just accept drifting upon sea then we will end up broken upon rocks we are restrained by time but annunciation gave mankind hope that it will be able to escape this hope is not part of present what we must do is understand patterns found within past in order to see that there is meaning to be found this meaning allows one to experience eternity through moments of revelation kirk 2008 pp 254 255 little gidding little gidding was started after dry salvages but was delayed because of eliot s declining health and his dissatisfaction with early drafts of poem eliot was unable to finish poem until september 1942 ackroyd 1984 pp 263 266 like three previous poems of four quartets central theme is time and humanity s place within it each generation is seemingly united and poem describes a unification within western civilisation when discussing world war ii poem states that humanity is given a choice between bombing of london or holy spirit god s love allows mankind to redeem themselves and escape living hell through purgation by fire he drew affirmative coda all shall be well from medieval mystic julian of norwich end of poem describes how eliot has attempted to help world as a poet and he parallels his work in language with working on soul or working on society kirk 2008 pp 260 263 motifs eliot believed that even if a poem can mean different things to each reader absolute meaning of poem needs to be discovered central meaning of four quartets is to connect to european literary tradition in addition to its christian themes ackroyd 1984 p 271 it also seeks to unite with european literature to form a unity especially in eliot s creation of a familiar compound ghost who is supposed to connect to those like stephane mallarme edgar allan poe jonathan swift and william butler yeats time time is viewed as and problematic whereas eternity is beautiful and true living under time s influence is a problem within burnt norton section 3 people trapped in time are similar to those stuck in between life and death in inferno canto three bergonzi 1972 pp 166 7 when eliot deals with past in dry salvages he emphasises its importance to combat influence of evolution as encouraging people to forget past and care only about present and future present is capable of always reminding one of past these moments also rely on idea of krishna in bhagavad gita that death can come at any moment and that divine will is more important than considering future pinion 1986 p 227 jesuit critic william f lynch who believed that salvation happens within time and not outside of it explained what eliot was attempting to do in four quartets when he wrote it is hard to say no to impression if i may use a mixture of my own symbols and his that christian imagination is finally limited to element of fire to day of pentecost to descent of holy ghost upon disciples revelation of eternity and time is of an intersection it seems not unseemly to suppose that eliot s imagination and is this not a theology is alive with points of intersection and of descent bergonzi 1972 qtd p 168 he continued with a focus on how time operated within poem he seems to place our faith our hope and our love not in flux of time but in points of time i am sure his mind is interested in line and time of christ whose spirit is his total flux but i am not so sure about his imagination is it or is it not an imagination which is saved from time s nausea or terror by points of intersection there seems little doubt that eliot is attracted above all by image and goal of immobility and that in everything he seeks for approximations to this goal in human order lynch went on to point out that this understanding of time includes asian influences bergonzi qtd 1972 pp 168 169 throughout poems end becomes beginning and things constantly repeat gordon 2000 p 341 this use of circular time is similar to way dante uses time in his divine comedy little gidding ends with a rose garden image that is same as garden beginning burnt norton repetition of time affects memory and how one can travel through their own past to find permanency and divine memory within poem is similar to how st augustine discussed it in that memory allows one to understand words and life only way to discover eternity is through memory understanding past and transcending beyond time likewise in augustinian view that eliot shares timeless words are connected to christ as logos and how christ calls upon mankind to join him in salvation manganiello 1989 pp 115 119 music title four quartets connects to music which appears also in eliot s poems preludes rhapsody on a windy night and a song for simeon along with a 1942 lecture called music of poetry some critics have suggested that there were various classical works that eliot focused on while writing pieces in particular within literary criticism there is an emphasis on beethoven serving as a model some have disputed this claim however lyndall gordon s biography of t s eliot establishes that eliot had beethoven in mind while writing them purpose of quartet was to have multiple themes that intertwined with each other each section as in musical image would be distinct even though they share same performance east coker and dry salvages are written in such a way as to make poems continuous and create a double quartet moody 2006 pp 143 144 eliot focused on sounds or auditory imagination as he called it he doesn t always keep to this device especially when he is more concerned with thematic development he did fix many of these passages in revision ackroyd 1984 pp 265 266 dante and christianity critics have compared eliot to yeats yeats believed that we live in a cyclical world saying if it be true that god is a circle whose centre is everywhere saint goes to centre poet and artist to ring where everything comes round again manganiello 1989 p 150 eliot believed that such a system is stuck within time eliot was influenced by yeats s reading of dante this appears in eliot s ash wednesday by changing yeats s desire for absolution away from a humanistic approach manganiello 1989 pp 150 152 when eliot wrote about personal topics he tended to use dante as a reference point he also relied on dante s imagery idea of refining fire in four quartets and in waste land comes from purgatorio and celestial rose and fire imagery of paradiso makes its way into series bergonzi 1972 pp 171 173 if love song of j alfred prufrock gerontion waste land and hollow men are eliot s inferno ash wednesday seems to be purgatorio and four quartets seems to be paradiso four quartets abandons time as per dante s conception of and allows for opposites to co exist together as such people are able to experience god directly as long as they know that they cannot fully understand or comprehend him eliot tries to create a new system according to denis donoghue in which he is able to describe a christianity that is not restricted by previous views that have fallen out of favour in modern society or contradicted by science eliot reasoned that he is not supposed to preach a theological system as a poet but expose reader to ideas of religion as eliot stated in 1947 if we learn to read poetry properly poet never persuades us to believe anything and what we learn from dante or bhagavad gita or any other religious poetry is what it feels like to believe that religion kirk 2008 qtd pp 241 243 according to russell kirk nor is it possible to appreciate eliot whether or not one agrees with him if one comes to four quartets with ideological blinders ideology it must be remembered is attempt to supplant religious dogmas by political and dogmas if one s first premise is that religion must be a snare and a delusion for instance then it follows that eliot becomes an enemy to be assaulted rather than a pilgrim whose journal one may admire even if one does not believe in goal of that quest kirk 2008 p 244 krishna eliot s poetry is filled with religious images beyond those common to christianity four quartets brings in hindu stories with a particular emphasis on bhagavad gita of mahabharata pinion 1986 pp 226 227 eliot went so far as to mark where he alludes to hindu stories in his editions of mahabharata by including a page added which compared battle scenes with dry salvages gordon 2000 p 85 critical responses reviews were favourable for each poem completed set received divided reviews in united states while it was received overall favourably by british american critics liked poetry but many did not appreciate religious content of work or that eliot abandoned philosophical aspects of his earlier poetry british response was connected to eliot s nationalistic spirit and work was received as a series of poems intended to help nation during difficult times ackroyd 1984 pp 262 269 santwana haldar went so far as to assert that four quartets has been universally appreciated as crown of eliot s achievement in religious poetry one that appeals to all including those who do not share orthodox christian creed haldar 2005 p 94 george orwell believed just opposite he argued it is clear that something has departed some kind of current has been switched off later verse does not contain earlier even if it is claimed as an improvement upon it he does not really feel his faith but merely assents to it for complex reasons it does not in itself give him any fresh literary impulse kirk 2008 qtd p 240 years later russell kirk wrote i cannot agree with orwell that eliot gave no more than a melancholy assent to doctrines now quite unbelievable over past quarter of a century most serious critics whether or not they find christian faith impossible have found in quartets greatest twentieth century achievements in poetry of philosophy and religion kirk 2008 p 240 like orwell stead also noticed a difference between four quartets and eliot s earlier poetry but he disagreed with orwell s conclusion four quartets is an attempt to bring into a more exact balance will and creative imagination it attempts to harness creative imagination which in all eliot s earlier poetry ran its own course edited but not consciously directed achievement is of a high order but best qualities of four quartets are inevitably different from those of waste land stead 1969 p 176 early american reviewers were divided on discussing theological aspects of four quartets f r leavis in scrutiny summer 1942 analysed first three poems and discussed how verse makes its explorations into concrete realities of experience below conceptual currency instead of their christian themes grant 1997 qtd p 44 muriel in theology march 1943 did opposite of f r leavis and emphasised how eliot captured christian experience in general and how it relates to literature d w harding in spring 1943 issue of scrutiny discussed pentecostal image but would not discuss how it would relate to eliot s christianity although he appreciated eliot s work paul goodman believed that despair found within poem meant that eliot could not be a christian poet john fletcher felt that eliot s understanding of salvation could not help real world whereas louis believed that not everyone would understand poems grant 1997 pp 44 46 many critics have emphasised importance of religious themes in poem vincent stated that four quartets presuppose certain values as necessary for their very structure as poems yet devote that structure to questioning their meaning and relevance whole work is in fact most authentic example i know in modern poetry of a satisfying religio poetic meditation we sense throughout it is not merely a building up of an intricate poetic form on foundation of experiences already over and done with but a constant energy an ever present activity of thinking and feeling kirk 2008 qtd pp 240 241 in his analysis of approaches regarding apocalypse and religious in british poetry m h abrams claimed even after a quarter century t s eliot s four quartets has not lost its status as a strikingly modern poem its evolving meditations however merely play complex variations upon design and motifs of romantic representation of poets educational progress abrams 1973 p 319 late 20th century and early 21st century critics continued religious emphasis craig raine pointed out undeniably four quartets has its faults for instance elementary tautology of anxious worried women in section i of dry salvages but passages documenting in undeniable detail moment in and out of time are most successful attempts at mystical in poetry since wordsworth s spots of time in prelude themselves a of mystical raine 2006 p 113 michael bell argued for universality within poems religious dimension and claimed that poems were genuinely of their time in that while speaking of religious faith they did not assume it in reader bell 1997 p 124 john cooper in regard to poem s place within historical context of world war ii described aspects of series appeal four quartets spoke about spirit in midst of this new crisis and not surprisingly there were many readers who would not only allow poem to carry them with it but who also hungered for it cooper 2008 p 23 in a more secular appreciation one of eliot s biographers critic peter ackroyd has stated that most striking characteristic of four quartets is way in which these sequences are very carefully structured they echo and re echo each other and one sequence in each poem as it were echoes its companion sequence in next poem four quartets are poems about a nation and about a culture which is very severely under threat and in a sense you could describe four quartets as a poem of memory but not memory of one individual but memory of a whole civilization t s eliot voices and visions
