right thumb 250px cover page to sheet music oh how i hate to get up in morning is a song written by irving berlin in 1918 that gives a comic perspective on military life berlin composed song as an expression of protest against indignities of army routine shortly after being drafted into united states army in 1918 song soon made rounds of camp and became popular with other soldiers partly because hatred of reveille was universal commanding officer of camp upton in eastern long island took an interest in berlin s talents and assigned him to write and produce a fundraising benefit to raise funds for a new visitors center at base show was entitled yip yip yaphank after camp upton locale in yaphank new york although berlin initially wrote oh how i hate to get up in morning without commercial intent it eventually appeared in three different broadway shows including ziegfeld follies of 1918 and film this is army more than any other irving berlin song it became one most associated with berlin as a performer background irving berlin was born in russian empire in 1888 either in or tyumen and had moved with his family to new york city in 1893 he acquired united states citizenship in early 1918 with expectation that his medical history would exempt him from his final year of draft eligibility so it came as an unpleasant surprise that within months berlin was drafted and serving as a private at camp upton at a salary of 30 a month far below his usual earnings although as a civilian he employed a private valet as an army private he was compelled to perform unskilled labor in support of camp operations there were a lot of things about army life i didn t like said berlin and thing i didn t like most of all was reveille during world war i berlin was drafted into united states army s 152nd depot brigade shortly after he became a naturalized united states citizen in 1918 by time he entered service war was in its final months and prospects for victory were steadily improving he was assigned to a camp on eastern long island that was mainly an interim station for infantry troops headed overseas composition incident that inspired berlin to write oh how i hate to get up in morning was an occasion when a colonel wanted a group of buglers to play george m cohan s over there buglers were unable to comply because it exceeded range of their instruments so oblivious officer ordered them to practice cohan s song he wrote it as a thin little sergeant berlin s civilian work schedule had been that of a hardworking night owl generally writing material until two or three in morning his efforts to adjust to military life and become a good soldier included springing out of bed obediently each morning which earned him resentment of fellow soldiers because he concealed his hatred of reveille too well and appeared eager to wake up in mornings so during an era when popular songs about war praised its heroism berlin instead gave voice to subversive impulses shared by ordinary soldiers lyrics begin with a mundane recounting of a newly recruited soldier s camp life and progress to hyperbole as he describes a series of increasingly absurd plans to escape from morning reveille someday i m going to murder bugler someday they re going to find him dead i ll amputate his reveille and step upon it heavily and spend rest of my life in bed berlin would later describe song as a protest written from heart out absolutely without slightest thought that it would ever earn a cent he wrote song before any plans for a larger production were underway and it soon gained popularity around camp production camp s commanding officer major general j franklin bell called berlin into his office and asked showman to raise funds for a new community house to lodge families of service members who visited camp projected expense of project was 35 000 at first berlin called in favors from civilian colleagues to visit and put on local performances to boost morale but news of a navy fundraising show on broadway called boom boom inspired berlin to request permission to write and stage a full broadway production of their own songwriter not only obtained permission for show but also received general bell s personal permission to return to berlin s normal creative working schedule and a special exemption from reveille civilian musician harry ruby joined berlin in camp to transcribe and arrange music and collaborate on show parodies berlin s song inspired a dozen parodies an uncredited parody was recounted in new york times oh how i hate to go into mess hall oh how i long for foods at home for it isn t hard to guess why they call meals a mess you ve got to eat beans you ve got to eat beans you ve got to eat beans in army performances song was performed in soldier revues including 1918 s yip yip yaphank and ziegfeld follies of 1918 as well as in 113 broadway performances of this is army in 1942 jack haley sang oh how i hate to get up in

yaphank and ziegfeld follies of 1918 yip yip yaphank opened on august 19 and berlin made his entrance late in show being dragged from a pup tent by two other soldiers as he pretended to be asleep on his feet to sing oh how i hate to get up in morning song was a centerpiece of show both it and berlin s performance received favorable reviews according to reviewers berlin s voice was thin but his timing was perfect and he presented a hilarious stage persona 24 years later new york times declared yip an immediate hit cite news title sergeant berlin re enlists last first s j date 1942 05 17 work new york times show was extended twice and exceeded its fundraising goal of 35 000 estimates of proceeds range from 83 000 to over 158 000 but planned visitor center was never built because war ended shortly afterward and berlin was never informed what happened to money berlin received no financial benefit beyond his ordinary sergeant s pay but he was well compensated in publicity he was recognized as a broadway star wherever he went after he returned to civilian life along with acclaim however he also received a death threat and a kidnapping threat which he took seriously enough to purchase a bulletproof limousine and hire a bodyguard chauffeur this is army berlin also performed oh how i hate to get up in morning in 1942 stage play this is army which ran for 113 performances on broadway and was adapted as a warner brothers musical following year it was declared modern version of yip yip yaphank and contained all new music except for two or three songs twenty five years after original show he was still dark haired and wiry but his face was strained more importantly his voice which had never been strong was weakened from months of recent stage touring number was filmed in late afternoon when he expected his voice to be at its best but an internal studio memo still reported irving berlin is no singer berlin wrote about filming in an april 10 1943 letter today they finished shooting my portion of picture and i am certainly glad it s over with all i do is sing hate to get up in morning as i did in show but camera is a severe judge and i am afraid even with great amount of care and fuss they can t improve what fates decreed to be a homely face as for my voice i made a recording when record was first played on set one of electricians who didn t know whose voice it was said if guy who wrote that song could hear record he would turn over in his grave which gives you a fair idea however i am hoping it won t be too bad in may 1988 tonight show band honored irving berlin s one hundredth birthday by playing oh how i hate to get up in morning as part of a medley in tribute to songwriter at close of a show in 2016 june and earlier song was used in ads by
