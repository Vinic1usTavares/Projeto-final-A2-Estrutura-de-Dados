action of 7 may 1794 was a minor naval action fought between a british ship of line and a french frigate early in french revolutionary wars french navy sought to disrupt british trade by intercepting and capturing merchant ships with roving frigates a strategy countered by protecting british convoys with heavier warships particularly in european waters on 5 may 1794 british escorts of a convoy from cork sighted two french ships approaching and gave chase ships a frigate and a corvette outmatched by their opponents separated and convoy escorts did likewise each following one of raiders on a separate course by evening one of french ships had successfully escaped but other was still under pursuit captain charles linois of atalante attempting a number of tactics to drive off his opponent but without success eventually after a chase lasting nearly two days french ship came within range of much larger british 74 gun third rate hms swiftsure and despite a brave defence was soon forced to surrender after suffering more than 40 casualties although he had surrendered his ship linois was widely praised for his actions in defending his ship against such heavy odds linois would later receive extensive criticism for his lack of aggressiveness at battle of pulo auro when a fleet of east indiamen would bluff him into breaking off his attack in aftermath of engagement a french battle squadron that formed part of developing atlantic campaign of may 1794 pursued both ships for rest of day their quarry eventually escaped after dark atalante was later taken into royal navy as hms espion background outbreak of war between britain and france in spring of 1793 came at a time of differing fortunes for navies of two countries royal navy had been at a state of heightened readiness since 1792 in preparation for conflict while french navy had still not recovered from upheavals of french revolution which had resulted in collapse of naval hierarchy and a dearth of experienced officers and seamen woodman p 19 french naval strategy early in war was to send squadrons and light vessels to operate along british trade routes in order to disrupt british mercantile operations this resulted in britain forming its merchant ships into convoys for mutual protection escorted by warships while in european waters to defend against roving attacks by french ships woodman p 8 by spring of 1794 france was in turmoil following failure of harvest which threatened country with starvation in order to secure food supplies france turned to its american colonies and united states which assembled a large grain convoy in hampton roads mostert p 132 to ensure security of this convoy french navy dispatched most of its atlantic fleet to sea during may 1794 operating in a series of large squadrons independent cruisers and one major fleet under villaret de joyeuse mostert p 133 on 5 may two french ships operating independently 36 gun frigate atalante under captain charles linois and corvette levrette spied a british convoy sailing south west three days out from cork and closed to investigate woodman p 41 pursuit convoy that linois had sighted was under protection of two ships of line swiftsure under captain charles boyles and 64 gun hms st albans under captain james vashon clowes p 484 at 17 45 with french frigates closing from west and aware that they could not defend whole convoy without immediate direct action boyles turned swiftsure and st albans towards newcomers hoisting their colours and swiftsure firing three shots in direction of larger ship atalante together british ships hugely outweighed and outmatched french vessels and as soon as linois realised his mistake he gave orders for his ships to turn and make all sail to escape pursuit raising french tricolour and firing his stern chasers guns fitted in rear of ship at his pursuers james p 204 french ships immediately separated st albans then followed levrette while swiftsure concentrated on atalante throughout rest of evening two chases continued then after darkness fell levrette was able to outrun and escape from st albans swiftsure however remained in touch with atalante so that by 04 00 on 6 may french frigate was approximately ahead of ship of line to northwest with wind direction to north northeast for entire following day linois could not escape boyles pursuit and at 17 30 swiftsure was close enough to open fire again using bow chasers for an hour and a half until atalante once more pulled out of range during evening french frigate was able to keep in front of swiftsure but at midnight linois switched his course to south hoping that darkness would cloak manoeuvre and that would be able to escape boyles james p 205 at 02 00 it became clear that linois s ploy had failed and that swiftsure was still following atalante more importantly manoeuvre had severely slowed frigate although linois hauled closer to wind boyles was able to come within range at 02 30 firing his starboard guns into smaller ship although his crew were exhausted by extended chase linois returned fire warships exchanging shot at long range and frigate suffering far more serious damage during brief engagement clowes p 485 by 03 25 linois was forced to surrender his ship s rigging in tatters and casualties mounting among his crew woodman p 42 boyles then provided a prize crew to frigate and took most of surviving french crew aboard his own ship as prisoners of war casualties on french ship were heavy with ten killed and 32 wounded from 274 men aboard compared to a single man lost on swiftsure which had also suffered some damage to its rigging aftermath boyles was not long able to enjoy his victory undisturbed at 10 00 on 7 may shortly after removal of french prisoners had been completed sails were spotted on horizon these were rapidly identified as three french ships of line that were making all haste to intercept and capture swiftsure and atalante these ships were part of a squadron under contre admiral joseph marie nielly that had sailed from rochefort day before in search of american grain convoy shortly due in european waters issuing rapid orders boyles instructed atalante s prize crew to separate their ship from swiftsure in order to force french to split their forces frigate and ship of line fleeing on different courses atalante soon outran pursuit and escaped into atlantic prize crew even managing to replace damaged main topsail in midst of chase with assistance of french prisoners on board swiftsure was slower but boyles was still able to increase distance between his vessel and french during day finally losing sight of his pursuers at 22 00 both ships arrived safely at cork on 17 may rear admiral robert kingsmill informing admiralty of action by letter atalante subsequently served royal navy as a 36 gun frigate under name hms espion as there was already a ship named hms atalanta in service for his lengthy and brave resistance linois was highly praised particularly by historian william james who wrote in 1827 that linois endeavours were highly meritorious and considered that in an engagement against a british frigate atalante if conquered at all would have been dearly purchased shortly after his arrival in britain linois was exchanged and returned to france notes footnotes citations bibliography references category conflicts
