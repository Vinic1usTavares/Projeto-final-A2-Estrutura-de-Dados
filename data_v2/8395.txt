1915 singapore mutiny also known as 1915 sepoy mutiny or mutiny of 5th light infantry was a mutiny involving up to half of a regiment of 850 sepoys indian soldiers against british in singapore during first world war linked with 1915 ghadar conspiracy mutiny on 15 february 1915 lasted nearly seven days it resulted in deaths of eight british officers and soldiers two malay officers and one soldier 14 british civilians five chinese and malay civilians and one german internee before it was finally quelled by british forces and allied naval detachments reasons for outbreak are complex and remain open to debate background 5th light infantry 5th light infantry was a long established regiment in indian army dating from 1803 and had a good military record it was initially known as 2nd battalion 21st bengal native infantry and was re designated as 42nd bengal native light infantry in 1843 after indian mutiny also known as indian rebellion of 1857 surviving bengal regiments were renumbered in 1861 and consequently 42nd became 5th bengal native light infantry following army reforms word native was dropped regiment simply became known as 5th light infantry regiment was well known for several battle honours which included arakan afghanistan and kandahar 1842 1842 kabul and and 1857 it also fought in second afghan war of 1879 80 and third burmese war of 1885 87 which led to british annexation of burma and its tributary shan states immediately prior to world war one regiment was employed in garrison duties in india on 10 october 1914 5th light infantry was stationed in when it was posted to singapore to replace king s own yorkshire light infantry which had been ordered to france unusually for 1914 15 5th light infantry was an entirely muslim unit mainly comprising muslims of rajput origin and pathans commanded by british and indian officers upon arrival in singapore 5th light infantry was based in alexandra barracks disunity and discontent in regiment even before its departure from india 5th light infantry suffered from weak senior leadership and discord amongst its british officers see details of court of inquiry report below to compound problem sepoys themselves were divided into two major cliques one was led by subedar major khan mohamed khan and subedar wahid ali and other consisted of subedar dunde khan plus khan and abdul ali khan according to court of inquiry discipline was compromised by this division and any particular policy innovation or other measure taken within regiment was likely to be opposed by one faction or other sepoys were also reportedly unable to adjust and adapt to living conditions in their new environment while in india sepoys had a constant supply of goat meat and milk but because it was difficult to receive a constant supply of goat in singapore they had to make do with a substitute chicken and very little milk sepoys resorted to buying their own meat and milk to make up for insufficient amounts they received and use of dollar versus rupee irked them further court of inquiry report as well as contemporary accounts of mutiny saw it to be essentially an isolated affair resulting from internal problems arising within a single poorly led unit on overseas service possibility of german or turkish involvement was closely examined but otherwise wider political and social implications were generally ignored mutiny on 27 january 1915 colonel martin announced that 5th light infantry was to be transferred to hong kong for further garrison duties replacing another indian regiment however rumours were circulated among sepoys that they might instead be sent to europe or to turkey to fight against their muslim co religionists three indian officers subedar dunde khan jemedar christi khan and jemedar ali khan were later to be identified by a court of enquiry as key conspirators in matter when final order to sail to hong kong aboard nile arrived in february 1915 they and other ringleaders among sepoys decided that it was time to rebel on morning of 15 february general officer commanding singapore addressed a farewell parade of regiment complimenting sepoys on their excellent turnout and referring to their departure next day without mentioning hong kong as destination at 3 30 pm on afternoon of same day four rajput companies of eight companies making up 5th light mason pages 426 427 a matter of honour mutinied mostly pathan sepoys of remaining four companies did not join mutiny but scattered in confusion two british officers of regiment were killed as they attempted to restore order mutineers divided themselves into three groups a party of 100 went to obtain ammunition from tanglin barracks where 309 germans including crew members from german light cruiser sms emden had been interned by british mutineers fired on camp guards and officers without warning killing ten british guards three johore troops present in camp and one german internee amongst dead were second

personnel in camp hospital including one who managed to escape under heavy fire to raise alarm mutineers tried to persuade germans to join them but many of latter were shaken by sudden violence and reluctant to do so some german sailors and reservists wanted to join with mutineers but majority adopted a neutral stance refusing to accept rifles from indians thirty five germans escaped but rest remained in barracks as it was middle of chinese new year most of chinese volunteers corps were on leave leaving singapore almost defenceless against mutiny british government was caught unprepared and other mutineers went on a killing spree at keppel harbour and pasir panjang killing 18 european and local civilians martial law was imposed and every available man from hms cadmus went ashore to join with british malay and chinese volunteer units and small number of british regular troops forming part of garrison british vice admiral sir martyn jerram sent a radio message requesting help from any allied warships nearby a group of mutineers laid siege to bungalow of commanding officer of 5th light infantry lieutenant colonel e v martin which effectively blocked route into singapore town martin and a detachment of hastily mobilised malay states volunteer rifles held out through night of 15th under sporadic fire loyal sepoys who tried to join them were ordered to go to a safe place to prevent them from being confused in dark with mutineers with daylight defenders were successful in retaking regimental barracks at cost of one killed and five wounded mutineers scattered and despite sniper fire general population stayed calm while volunteers sailors and marines fought sporadic skirmishes with mutineers malay states guides attached to 5th light infantry at alexandra barracks were a detachment of 97 indian officers and men of malay states guides msg mule battery raised in 1896 for internal garrisoning of federated malay states regiment was recruited from sikhs pathans and

mutineers approached their lines msg artillery pieces were abandoned but not brought into action by mutineers seven men of msg were subsequently arrested in outram road singapore while they were carrying rifles which had been fired they were court martialed and sentenced to a year in prison reported killing of british women among civilian fatalities during mutiny were thirteen british men one british woman mrs g b her death was later assumed by british authorities to have possibly been unintended two chinese women one chinese man and two malay men fact that only one british woman was killed was often ignored in reports that followed mutiny for instance in a long letter detailing her experience during mutiny a british woman who was an eyewitness to incident misleadingly wrote in to times that sepoys had deliberately shot at every european man or woman they saw and that 21 english men and women were buried yesterday 26 march 1915 sir evelyn ellis a member of legislative council in singapore and of official court of enquiry that investigated mutiny publicly described revolt as part of a scheme for murder of women and children more than 15 years later in 1932 a journalist in penang george wrote that during mutiny sepoys had knifed and shot white men and women indiscriminately as recently as 1989 cm erroneously wrote that during mutiny sepoys roaming streets were killing any europeans they encountered final suppression on 17 february french cruiser montcalm followed by russian auxiliary cruiser orel and japanese warships otowa and tsushima arrived seventy five japanese sailors twenty two russians and 190 french marines were landed to round up mutineers who had taken refuge in jungle to north of singapore they were joined in this operation by sixty soldiers of 36th sikhs who were passing through singapore plus singaporean police british sailors and malay states volunteer rifles lacking strong leadership mutiny had started to lose direction a large number of mutineers surrendered immediately and rest scattered in small groups into jungles many tried to cross strait of johore but were quickly rounded up by sultan of johore s army while local media spoke of serious battles there were in fact only minor skirmishes between allied landing parties and now demoralized mutineers by evening of 17 february 432 mutineers had been captured on 20 february companies of 1st 4th battalion king s shropshire light infantry territorials arrived from rangoon to relieve sailors and marines they succeeded in quickly rounding up last of mutineers russian role and reservations news of mutiny reached russian consul general in singapore n a rospopov on morning of 16 february 1915 through a russian citizen who was a patient at a charity hospital in singapore as offices were closed for chinese new year and town in a state of siege rospopov had difficulty finding formal and conclusive information about mutiny through official sources it was only a day later on 17 february that russians having been advised by their japanese allies dispatched orel to assist british in putting down mutiny it was only on 18 february that rospopov eventually received a telegram from ministry of foreign affairs and another from commander of russian pacific squadron admiral schulz ru instructing orel to depart quickly for singapore from penang and to exercise extreme caution and military preparedness en route orel brought with it 40 men 2 machine guns and a doctor within 15 minutes of its arrival russians were preparing for military action at end of railway line in northern part of singapore to intercept any fleeing mutineers russians were successful in capturing an estimated 180 mutineers russians had also engaged in heavy gun battle with mutineers on night of 25 february as a result of incident published works on 1915 mutiny described that russians among all allies had closest encounter with near disaster avoided besides military involvement orel also temporarily provided shelter for some of residents who had evacuated town rospopov reported on 21 february that orel had to unexpectedly take in 42 women and 15 children abroad as a fire had broken out on board their other ship although russians were quick to come to aid of british anglo russian relationship was fraught with an underlying sense of distrust rooted in a long standing history of competition just decades before mutiny of 1915 russia and britain were already locked in imperialist rivalry spurred by last tsar s asiatic mission and his visit to south east asia as part of his world tour of 1891 russian government appointed its first ethnic russian consul v to singapore as early as 1890 russian presence in southeast asia during last quarter of 19th century was meant not only to safeguard its economic and strategic position in china but also to carefully observe designs and advances of its imperialist rivals in region foremost among them being british empire anglo russian relationship took a turn for worse during latter half of 19th century when both britain and russia were locked in competition for afghanistan and persia as well as when britain halted russian advancement into balkans and turkey britain s alignment with japan as ally worsened anglo russian relationship with outbreak of russo japanese war of 1904 05 this history of suspicion and rivalry explains why rospopov sent a secret telegram on 21 february expressing his reservations at placing orel and its accompanying men and guns under command of british military in singapore eventually french admiral was able to assuage fears of rospopov and assured him that russian aid at this point would serve as a good means to strengthen anglo russian relation when mutiny was finally quelled russian captain reportedly remarked to british governor to singapore that russian assistance in suppressing mutiny would unite two countries better than any treaty japanese role and reservations on 16 february 1915 third squadron of japanese navy received a telegram from military attache araki jiro via ma kung in formosa straits main base of squadron requesting japanese help otowa and tsushima were sent immediately for singapore although help was sent and well received by british navy in singapore japanese navy was hesitant about doing so initially commanding officer of third squadron rear admiral tsuchiya had apparently expressed his displeasure in dispatching help as he believed that being a signatory of anglo japanese alliance japan should not interfere in internal affairs of another country without attaching collateral conditions also tsuchiya had recalled how a british ship once anchored at refused to help put down a taiwanese revolt on japan seeing that tsuchiya had no choice but to follow orders from japanese government and naval headquarters tsuchiya secretly advised his land force not to kill or wound any sepoy intentionally but to simply encourage them to surrender as former had no enmity with latter according to general staff of british military headquarters in reality japanese did not do much and it was found desirable to disband them as early as possible however from point of view of japanese politicians japan s entry into mutiny was also a form of projecting japanese power and strength in region inquiry and public executions thumb left public executions of convicted sepoy mutineers at outram road singapore on 23 february 1915 a court of inquiry was held at first meeting in confidence but then in public sessions it prepared a 450 page report dated 15 may 1915 although extensive discord amongst both officers and men of 5th light infantry was identified cause of mutiny was not conclusively established focus of report was on possible external german influences plus internal regimental causes of mutiny more than 205 sepoys were tried by court martial and 47 were publicly executed including kassim mansoor most soldiers killed were muslims from hisar district and rohtak district of current haryana state of india nur alam shah was not put on trial although he was exposed as an active indian nationalist with links to ghadar instead he was detained and deported as british did not want to stir up trouble among their muslim subjects sixty four mutineers were transported for life and 73 were given terms of imprisonment ranging from 7 to 20 years public executions by firing squad took place at outram prison and were witnessed by an estimated 15 000 people straits times reported remnants of 5th light infantry numbering 588 sepoys plus seven british and indian officers left singapore on 3 july 1915 to see active service in cameroons and german east africa they were not accompanied by colonel martin who was heavily criticised by a court of inquiry and then retired from army in 1922 5th light infantry was disbanded much same fate befell malay states guides they were sent to kelantan in malaya to quell tok s uprising at pasir puteh in april 1915 afterwards guides were sent to fight in africa and were disbanded in 1919 causes ineffectiveness of commanding officer specifically military grievances that led to mutiny of 5th light infantry centred on personality of commanding officer at time lieutenant colonel e v martin he had been promoted from major in regiment but previous colonel had reported that he was unpopular with his fellow officers and that he inspired little respect among men his appointment led to disunity amongst british officers which was reflected by division among indian officers over promotion to commissioned rank of a colour havildar issues which might under ordinary circumstances have been of limited impact were aggregated by disruptive external influences of ghadar party propaganda noted above and entry of turkey into war according to court of inquiry prime cause of this lamentable episode was responsibility of colonel martin described as a loner for whom officers had little respect martin s primary fault was that he was too trusting to point of naivety while he cared for welfare of his men and saw that their living conditions were improved he was described as being too much of a solder s friend to point that other british officers found that this attitude and work ethic of martin s severely undermined their authority over sepoys over time that served to erode respect that british officers and even sepoys had for him colonel egerton at india office commented that british officers serving under colonel martin were comparable to sheep without a shepherd avoiding and avoided by martin whom they should have looked to for guidance sepoys were accused of deftly noticing this discontent and disunity among their british officers and then taking advantage of it to mutiny role of pan islamism within less than a week of mutiny a court of inquiry was set up to investigate and collect evidence for trial for mutineers although court of inquiry was meant to take place behind closed doors as accordance with standard military procedures proceeding was held in public instead according to harper and miller this was to give public impression that mutineers were being tried for mutiny and shooting with intent to kill and not as alleged for refusal to go to turkey although court of inquiry was clearly trying to downplay link between turkey and mutiny with declassification of new documents and evidence another perception has emerged in explaining cause of mutiny and that is role of pan islamism contrary to official british colonial authorities mutiny was not an isolated case of a purely local affair but was instead part of a wider anti british and pro muslim battle when turkey decided to join in war on side of central powers germany austria hungary and italy ottoman sultan mehmed v 1844 1918 declared a jihad against allied powers britain france and russia and issued a fatwa calling on muslims all around world to throw their lot with caliphate this move had a huge impact on muslims throughout world as ottoman sultan was revered as caliph of islam and long considered by indian muslims as final bulwark of muslim power following collapse of moghul empire in india overnight muslims serving under british army such as sepoys faced an existential dilemma and their loyalty being torn between their ummah community brotherhood and their british colonial superiors for muslim sepoys in 5th light infantry interaction with kasim mansur who was an indian muslim merchant in singapore served to fuel this sense of divided loyalties further kasim mansur together with a local imam nur alam shah would often host members of 5th light infantry at mansur s home and it was then that duo persuaded muslim sepoys to adhere to fatwa issued by ottoman sultan and to turn their guns against their british commanding officers and contribute towards war against these kafirs who were battling their muslim brothers who were defending caliphate in west it was within this context that plan was hatched for mutiny global connection it is difficult to pin point any one reason as being main cause or catalyst of mutiny however a recent perspective has emerged of role of global connections mutiny has revealed permeable nature of colonial boundaries and way that external influences were able to reach colonies in southeast asia sepoys of 5th light infantry were constantly being bombarded with information about what was happening outside of singapore as news of fatwa issued by ottoman sultan spread an anti british movement spearheaded by ghadar party was also disseminating special pamphlets in a variety of languages which were reaching through secret channels into hands of sepoys acrimonious slogans against british only fuelled anti colonial sentiment among sepoys some of slogans were wicked english and their allies are now attacking islam but german emperor and sultan of turkey have sworn to liberate asia from tyranny now is time to rise only your strength and religious zeal are required sepoys were clearly being bombarded with a lot of anti british sentiments while being stationed on small island of singapore talk was also abuzz throughout singapore of komagata maru incident in which canadian authorities refused to allow a ship with 376 indian passengers to land and forced them to stay aboard for 2 months in difficult conditions on its way back to india while ship docked in singapore governor general of singapore remarked that though ship had no communication with land yet it left a bad effect on indian troops stationed there clearly information was reaching sepoys through a wide range of channels many originating as far as north america britain ottoman empire and india much of this information was obtained locally but even so it was being mediated through a host of international and external actors including a wide array of indians from across subcontinent british officers and arab and malay coreligionists aftermath thumb 1915 singapore mutiny memorial tablet at entrance of victoria memorial hall singapore setting up of special branch unit and other related initiatives 1915 mutiny was a watershed event in way that british viewed security in their malayan colonies more importance than ever was placed on political intelligence espionage and surveillance of potential subversives following mutiny a political intelligence bureau was established in singapore under direct command and control of major general dudley howard general officer commanding goc singapore this eventually paved way for formation of criminal intelligence department special branch was set up in 1919 other institutions were also formed with purpose of providing feedback and monitoring activities on ground to enhance protection of its crown colony further from internal skirmishes and attacks in august 1915 legislative council passed reserve force and civil guard ordinance this was first act passed in a british colony which imposed compulsory military service on all male subjects between ages 15 to 55 who were not in armed forces volunteers or police additionally a reserve force in volunteer corps was created for fit men over age 40 from slew of new initiatives enforced it was clear that british had taken debacle of mutiny as a serious lesson to learn from and to prevent from happening again in literature currently there are only two fictional works in english that deal with subject of singapore mutiny first is isobel mountain s novel a maiden in malaya written shortly after mutiny in 1919 other is rogue raider tale of captain lauterbach and singapore mutiny written in 2006 both stories deal with very different narratives in mountain s novel plot revolves around romantic story between protagonist elizabeth tain and peter fenton a rubber planter author however projects mutineers in a standard imperial or colonialist interpretation with mutineers being painted in wholly unattractive colours with no redeeming qualities while hinting at their lustful nature mountain s representation of sepoys can be considered an echo of colonial reportage of rogue sepoys barley however took on a humorous tone and revolved around adventures of captain julius lauterbach of german imperial navy once again humorous nature of book underplays and potentially undermines actual set of events
