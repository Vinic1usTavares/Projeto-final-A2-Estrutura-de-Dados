final computer graphics project in computer graphics lab and was completed in three days to positive class reception a webpage for game was then started and someone suggested he release game s source code patry felt that made sense due to tux being mascot for open source linux and continued to work on game before publicly uploading it to sourceforge for linux under free gnu general public license on february 28 2000 hoping others would join in on developing it this early version featured a very basic gameplay that consisted of tux sliding down a hill of snow ice rock and trees for tux to avoid along way to write game patry tended to use free premade content such as textures borrowed from websites rather than original content made from scratch in december 1999 patry fine arts students rick knowles and mark riddell and computer graphics students patrick eric hall and rob kroeger announced foundation of company sunspire studios to develop a video game project patry stated game would have a massively multiplayer and a persistent universe with real time strategy and first person shooter components since their ideas were limited by that time s 3d engines they embarked on creating their own which according to patry would make quake 3 and unreal engine look tame in comparison fine arts undergraduate classmate roger fernandez was chosen as artist project was eventually abandoned due to it being a massive undertaking and in august 2000 knowles suggested company resume working on tux racer which became their first official project continued development of free version was swift numerous elements such as herrings jumping and a soundtrack as well as graphical improvements were added in just three weeks porting game from linux to windows was easy as it used cross platform tools such as opengl and simple layer a major update including those improvements version 0 60 was freely uploaded to sourceforge for both linux and windows on october 2 2000 a minor patch for that release
