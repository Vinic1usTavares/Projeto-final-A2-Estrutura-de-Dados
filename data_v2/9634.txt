government according to watsuki when he found that kawakami maintained a duty to his dead comrades he decided to create title character since watsuki s debut work contained a tall black haired man in showy armor he wanted to make a character completely opposite to debut character new character ended up coming out like a girl according to watsuki he used no real motif when creating kenshin and placed a cross shaped scar on his face not knowing what else to do watsuki enjoys drawing kenshin due to how he tends to sacrifice himself for others while writing series once he thought kenshin should think more about his future since he is more connected to his past he also stated he would like to be as kenshin but he does not believe their lives style match during development of series pilot chapter rurouni meiji swordsman romantic story watsuki and his editor argued over kenshin s speech patterns settling for a one for final version of first romantic story watsuki adjusted dialogue in his view he made kenshin sound more as i prefer him now nevertheless kenshin was concerned about how kenshin s manner abruptly changed when facing his opponent watsuki added kenshin s trademark as a placeholder to be an expression of english speech huh watsuki notes that he was surprised at how well it caught on and how much he ended up having kenshin use sound during series watsuki also planned to make kenshin more 30 years old his editor commented that it was strange that main character of a manga for teenagers to be of such an age so he instead made him 28 years old watsuki based most of kenshin s abilities on a real swordsman of tokugawa period named who was skilled in acrobatic techniques however one of kenshin s moves where he stops an enemy s flamethrower by rotating his sword received multiple complaints with watsuki admitting move as somewhat out of place and not really organic to his world watsuki nobuhiro secret life of characters 9 oniwabanshu rurouni kenshin volume 3 viz media 46 by early publication of rurouni kenshin watsuki was unsure whether or not kenshin and kamiya kaoru would become lovers in future chapters sagara sanosuke was created to be kenshin s best friend who would punch him order to make him retain his composure however watsuki did not think idea worked as much as possibly during his fight against shishio makoto s army kenshin is given a new sword with a sheath made of wood though it is more difficult to draw watsuki decided to redesign sword to make it look like first one kenshin had in series for final fight between kenshin and shishio watsuki admitted he expressed more joy in drawing shishio than kenshin during this arc and mostly final fight between kenshin and shishio s fight watsuki kept listening to song in blue sky from video game virtual on song s title was used in final chapter of kyoto arc additionally final shot of kenshin returning to kaoru s dojo was inspired by final shot of rurouni kenshin anime s first opening theme by judy and mary in next and final arc of manga story took a darker tone as most of characters believed kaoru was killed by yukishiro enishi which made kenshin question his own way of living and escape to a village of wanderers watsuki did not enjoy angst in kenshin so his friend myojin yahiko took place as series protagonist until kenshin recovered in order to make kenshin recover watsuki introduced tomoe s father who is simply referred as geezer who assists him in finding an answer to atone for his sins watsuki nobuhiro secret life of characters 48 geezer rurouni kenshin

shot but due to difficulties in drawing explosions kujinarami made with his weapons fight ended with kenshin cutting kujinarami s weapon in this arc s climax watsuki kept listening to song hurry go round by late musician hide which felt it suited relationship between enishi as well as kenshin but in his darker persona author also commented he would like to have given both kenshin and enishi s characters a bigger contrast a reader also asked watsuki whether kenshin could defeat his rival saito hajime since they never got a final duel watsuki responded saying two are equally matched but result might depend whether or not kenshin had something to protect at end of series kenshin appears with short hair initially watsuki had planned to make his hair shorter before end however he found this to be similar to character multi in to heart additionally himura kenji was introduced in finale as son of kenshin and kaoru even though character was cliche watsuki felt that kenji had to appear when live action of manga was made watsuki had several ideas about kenshin s mind about his early appearances in series this resulted in manga reboot rurouni kenshin restoration where kenshin s characterization was expanded by author who thought in retrospective about what he could add to him although there were some changes to cast watsuki wanted them to be subtle such as kenshin wearing a scarf he also wrote a prequel chapter to original series which helped readers to understand why kenshin would stay in kaoru s dojo in first rurouni kenshin kanzenban published in japan in july 2006 watsuki included a draft page featuring a redesign of kenshin s character to make his x shaped scar more notable watsuki made it long enough to cross his nose kenshin s hair is tied in two tails which are flowing to make him look younger and shorter and less androgynous watsuki also added a to kenshin s sword to make it easier to draw by simplifying its structure while also emphasizing strength kenshin s hitokiri look was also redesigned slightly by making his clothes more worn and giving him yukishiro tomoe s neck scarf actors watsuki received letters from fans describing megumi ogata s audiobook voice as a good fit for kenshin watsuki said that he imagined kenshin s voice to be more neutral fact that audiobook voice actors especially ogata and tomokazu seki who portrayed sanosuke did not voice their corresponding roles in anime disappointed watsuki in anime adaptation of rurouni kenshin watsuki s designs were combined with voice talents of voice actress mayo suzukaze she said that she started feeling like kenshin after years of work as his voice but says that providing voice for his character was one of her best experiences in producing english dub version of series media blasters considered following suit with mona marshall considered a finalist to voice kenshin richard hayworth was eventually selected for role giving kenshin s character a more masculine voice in english adaptation marshall was also selected to voice younger kenshin during flashback scenes clark cheng media blasters dub script writer said that localizing kenshin s unusual speech was a difficult process his use of de gozaru and oro were not only character trademarks that indicated his state of mind but important elements to story however neither is directly translatable into english and in end company chose to replace de gozaru with that i did that i am or that i do kenshin s signature oro was replaced with to simulate a funny sound that had no real meaning daryl surat of otaku

multiple fighting scenes nevertheless satoh said he enjoyed kenshin s lines due to impact they have on most characters most notably his enemies due to kyoto films showing a darker characterization of kenshin as he struggles against different strong rivals satoh also said his work became more challenging still he found it interesting a scene that satoh enjoyed was kenshin s fight against cho due to fact kenshin is forced to attack his enemy even though he does not know his weapon is deadly which goes against his morals as a result satoh briefly showed kenshin s hitokiri side for a brief moment actor said he discussed this scene with director who pleased with result kenshin s strongest technique amakakeru ryu no hirameki was satoh s favorite move as he likes its meaning while kenshin shouts
