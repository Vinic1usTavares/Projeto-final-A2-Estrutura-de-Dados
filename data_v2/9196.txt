out of hyperspace in middle of deep space with 24 hours of power left after an asuran attack adrift was a visual effects milestone for series it introduced several cast changes for season including departure of carson beckett paul mcgillion and elizabeth weir torri higginson and inclusion of samantha carter amanda tapping to main cast before its release an incomplete version of episode was leaked on internet after its release adrift started season with a drop in ratings since last season finale episode earned series emmy and visual effects society award nominations and was generally well received plot with weir torri higginson incapacitated sheppard joe flanigan is forced to take command of atlantis mckay david hewlett determines that power conduits are damaged preventing atlantis from completing its jump to planet m12 578 while teams are sent to patch them up shield starts to collapse resulting in deaths of one team mckay later decides to collapse shield to cover central tower in order to conserve power and give zelenka david time to patch up conduits however city approaches an asteroid belt and only way to go through without using up power is for sheppard to lead a fleet of puddle jumpers and clear a path although inexperienced pilots succeed but impacts from stragglers damage control crystals and they have to fix it before jumping again in midway station colonel carter amanda tapping and bill lee bill dow are contacted by apollo informing them atlantis did not arrive carter and lee eventually decide to find city by using apollo to perform small jumps along city s path and augment their sensors to increase chance of finding atlantis dr keller jewel staite exhausts her medical expertise to save weir and asks mckay to nanites weir was infected with in real world against sheppard s orders mckay goes ahead with it in space suits sheppard and zelenka reach controls and repair them but in process zelenka is injured by a micro asteroid by then atlantis has lost too much power to jump again furthermore sheppard learns mckay has disobeyed his order and angrily tells him to deactivate nanites weir having apparently fully recovered regains consciousness when she learns nanites are keeping her alive she warns teyla rachel luttrell that saving her this way is a bad idea mckay apologises to sheppard and they continue working in end mckay decides to use an experimental jumper with a hyperdrive he worked on since tao of rodney and use it to steal a zero point module from asuran homeworld production adrift first surfaced on february 2007 before airing of first strike by march it was confirmed to be first of a two part opening for fourth season along with lifeline and would be similar in style to progeny and real world producers kept trying to find new ways to out do efforts of previous seasons which they described was different to them since they introduced more of a balance between team based and character based episodes after completion of first strike producers thought it was biggest episode they have ever done and wondered how fourth season would top that during writing stages martin gero wanted episode to tee up with last episode of season and hence wanted episode to become part of a story arc for entire season gero also wanted episode to have no down time for characters like previous season premieres after zelenka gets injured a scene where a puddle jumper was originally meant to pick them both up however having a jumper set nearby in an atlantis set would not be practical enough and was cut he also wrote to have sheppard in an state while forced to take command of atlantis scene where mckay and zelenka converse and finish each other s sentences were parallel to arguing between gero and wood while working together on set he considered scene between teyla and weir to be cliffhanger but was changed to following scene as gero felt that would be better cliffhanger similar to one for return part 1 thumb 200px amanda tapping joins main cast for season four episode and season itself has introduced amanda tapping as samantha carter for her first of 14 episode appearance after finishing her appearances on all ten seasons of sister series stargate sg 1 carter would replace elizabeth weir as leader of atlantis expedition after episode however carter would only have a supporting role as opposed to a lead role on sg 1 episode would also give audience an opportunity to really get to know dr jennifer keller staite gero was reluctant to accept an updated opening title sequence which mentioned departure of weir and introduction of carter which would give casual viewers a tip while filming scene where keller and her team perform a decompressive craniectomy on weir an actual brain surgeon performed same procedure on a head model live from ten feet away and directed cast on what to do while following surgeon staite was nervous about doing scene after filming was completed surgeon s voice was removed from final cut during sequence where city travels through a clearing in asteroid field producers wanted scene where atlantis gets hit by odd asteroid as authentic as possible so in control room not only cameras but screens and tables on set were shaken slightly as well episode was one of most expensive in series at time with two visual effects milestones for series during one of sequences visual effects team switched from stock explosions on 2d to 3d versions producers wished to exceed minute long horizon sequence in previous episode scene where doors close while shield is collapsing was merely stock footage from hot zone with cgi of shield added on when producers conceived idea for space jump between sheppard and zelenka they thought it would be cool as well as thinking that they were possibly too apprehensive however sequence was pulled off and paul mullie described jump as one of best visual effects we have ever done scene were one team dies from collapsing shield however was not performed as well as producers hoped reception before episode originally aired a near complete version was leaked onto internet after it aired in united states adrift earned a 1 2 household nielsen rating representing 1 7 million viewers 896 000 from ages 18 to 49 and 962 000 from 25 to 54 demographic episode decreased viewership by six percent from average ratings from back half of third season and dropped from a 1 5 household rating from third season premiere no man s land reasoning may be fact that several well known series aired on same time slot however according to live 3 day rating ratings boosted to 1 4 in united kingdom adrift received 527 000 viewers placing atlantis number six in top ten broadcasts for sky one for that week tory ireland mell of ign thought season premiere performed well without stargate sg 1 and liked episode s visual effects sequences and action but was critical about lack of s presence after his injury in last episode giving adrift a descent rating of 7 0 out of 10 critical myth rated episode 8 out of 10 praising direction writers took with episode sheppard being rather forced to be command of city with incapacitation of weir as well as comparing characters chance to prove their mettle through extreme adversity to siege part 2 joe flanigan who plays john sheppard described this and following episode as fun to do and praised idea of atlantis being marooned in space and wished arc would last seven or eight episodes adrift was nominated for two awards in 2008 visual effects team submitted
