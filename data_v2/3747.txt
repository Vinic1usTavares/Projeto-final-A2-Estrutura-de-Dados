capitulation of saldanha bay was surrender in 1796 to british royal navy of a dutch expeditionary force sent to recapture dutch cape colony in 1794 early in french revolutionary wars army of french republic overran dutch republic which then became a french client state batavian republic great britain was concerned by threat dutch cape colony in southern africa posed to its trade routes to british india it therefore sent an expeditionary force that landed at simon s town in june 1795 and forced surrender of colony in a short campaign british commander vice admiral sir george elphinstone then reinforced garrison and stationed a naval squadron at cape to protect british conquest batavian government not yet aware of capture of cape colony but worried by rumors of loss of this and other colonies of dutch east india company which was about to be nationalized by batavian republic because it was virtually bankrupt in november 1795 decided to send an expeditionary force to dutch east indies by way of cape and if necessary recapture colony this force comprised three ships of line and six smaller vessels all under command of rear admiral engelbertus lucas security regarding plans was weak and british knew of operation before lucas had sailed british warned elphinstone who further reinforced cape lucas s journey took nearly six months with his squadron suffering shortages of drinking water leading to a near mutinous state among his crews on its arrival at cape batavian squadron anchored in saldanha bay to take on fresh water before deciding to abandon operation and sail to french base at ile de france in western indian ocean on 15 august 1796 elphinstone s larger fleet discovered lucas s force and trapped it in bay aware that resistance would be futile and with his crews in open revolt lucas surrendered unconditionally ships of captured batavian force were taken into royal navy joining squadron at cape elphinstone was later made baron keith in recognition of his achievements batavian operation did however force cancellation of a planned british invasion of ile de france lucas faced a court martial on his return to netherlands but died before it began main responsibility for debacle was laid at his feet but his death forestalled a conviction for dereliction of duty all other officers were acquitted cape colony was not attacked again before end of war in 1802 when treaty of amiens returned it to batavian republic background in winter of 1794 army of french republic overran dutch republic dutch opponents of stadtholder william v known as patriots as opposed to adherents of stadtholder who were known as many of whom had returned with french forces from exile in france proclaimed batavian republic after batavian revolution in january 1795 this event alarmed government of great britain erstwhile allies of dutch republic in war of first coalition as dutch empire controlled a number of strategically important colonies in east indies key to controlling european access to region was dutch cape colony on tip of southern africa a naval force based there could dominate trade routes between europe and east indies in particular economically vital links between britain and british india to ensure that cape colony did not become a french naval base secretary of state for war henry dundas ordered a large expeditionary force to sail for cape in march 1795 force comprised two squadrons and 500 troops all under overall control of vice admiral sir george elphinstone more substantial reinforcements followed arriving on 10 june in false bay elphinstone then conducted two months of fruitless negotiations with government at cape led by abraham josias sluysken on 7 august with negotiations stalled elphinstone ordered an attack on dutch positions at dutch defenders withdrew but elphinstone s forces were low on food and ammunition and not numerous enough to launch a major attack on cape town on 14 september arrival of british reinforcements under general clarke convinced sluysken to surrender colony elphinstone turned his attention to planning operations against dutch east indies and french island base of ile de france he sailed for madras in his flagship to take command of east indies station but maintained a strong garrison and naval presence at cape under sir james henry craig and commodore john blankett much of his squadron subsequently dispersed on operations across indian ocean while elphinstone was consolidating his position batavian government determined in november 1795 to send an expedition to inspect its new colonies in dutch east indies as previous owner dutch east india company was about to be nationalized in march 1796 expedition was to call at cape opn its way if that colony had been captured an attempt at recapture could be made but only if this was feasible expedition did not carry a large number of troops or boats to land them if colony was in enemy hands expedition was to bypass cape and sail directly for ile de france a squadron was prepared under command of rear admiral engelbertus lucas who had sailed to east indies once in 1786 but otherwise had no experience of long expeditionary campaigns his force comprised three 66 gun ships of line dordrecht tromp and revolutie and six smaller warships after calling at cape lucas was to continue his expedition in order to reinforce dutch east indies lucas s voyage lucas s expeditionary force sailed from texel on 23 february 1796 together with another squadron destined for dutch west indies under vice admiral adriaan intending to pass through north sea and around scotland before entering atlantic and turning south unspecified french support for operation had been promised by national convention but did not materialise british north sea fleet was actively blockading texel and 16 gun brig sighted batavian force putting to sea espiegle shadowed lucas throughout day sending a message to admiral adam duncan at great yarmouth on 26 february a small british squadron led by captain henry trollope in detached from cruising division of rear admiral thomas pringle and encountered batavians weaker british making off as lucas formed a line of battle having successfully evaded pursuit lucas followed his planned route arriving at las palmas on gran canaria on 13 april journey had not been unobserved a small british warship 20 gun under captain charles brisbane had sighted batavian force near madeira while mozelle was escorting two merchant ships to barbados leaving merchant ships to make their way unescorted mozelle followed lucas for several days and then sailed south with all haste to bring a warning to cape despite noticing mozelle lucas decided not to attack her after spending no less than 34 days taking on water and supplies at las palmas lucas on 26 may sailed to praia on cape verde before continuing south on 29 may in direction of brazilian coast hoping to profit from favourable trade winds and currents in fact due to persistent calms in doldrums squadron only reached a position off brazilian shore on 27 june delay led lucas to decide not to take in more water but to sail directly to cape batavian expeditionary force did not encounter another vessel during this time and thus had no information regarding british dispositions when it eventually reached south african coast on 26 july after a council of war aboard dordrecht lucas decided not to reconnoitre table bay and on 6 august squadron anchored in saldanha bay british agents had observed lucas s preparations in netherlands and reported them in january more than a month before expedition sailed british admiralty sent frigate to cape with a warning carysfort arrived at cape in april but vague accounts of lucas s mission had reached elphinstone even earlier appearing at madras in march less than a month after lucas s departure from texel sailing from madras on 23 march elphinstone reached cape on 23 may where he received detailed reports of size and status of batavian force heading for cape admiralty had already responded to threat by diverting substantial resources to cape in addition to elphinstone and blankett s forces a convoy of transports led by captain william essington arrived on 28 may and a small squadron under pringle followed on 28 july joined that day by mozelle with most detailed reports to date of lucas s movements subsequent reinforcements arrived from squadron based in india so that by august there were seven ships of line and seven smaller vessels under elphinstone s command and garrison of cape stood at 9 400 british troops saldanha bay elphinstone was concerned that batavian force might not be sailing for cape at all in may a powerful french frigate squadron under contre amiral pierre cesar charles de sercey had sailed past cape without stopping observed by hms sphynx which it chased back to simon s town if batavian force was sailing for east indies it might bypass cape altogether elphinstone therefore decided to take his fleet out to sea to search for batavians on 6 august elphinstone sailed southwest from false bay in search of lucas but a fierce storm caught british inflicting damage on ships including loss of mainmast on monarch and flooding on fleet returned to simon s bay in a battered state on 12 august to learn on arrival that lucas s force lay at anchor to north following day a storm swept bay most of elphinstone s ships were damaged both and grounded and dragged anchors and was almost wrecked lucas had arrived off cape on 26 july with no knowledge of elphinstone s dispositions he had more pressing concerns it had been several months since his ships had sighted land and his supplies of drinking water were running dangerously low a significant proportion of his crews were suffering from scurvy and he had decided to send these men to an encampment ashore to facilitate their recovery lucas even ordered that sails on his ships be removed for repairs rendering his ships temporarily immobile on 9 august lucas was warned by a servant of a dutch inhabitant of cape that a superior english force was present and that dutch population would not assist an attack on british he was strongly advised to sail away lucas on hearing this instead sailed deeper into bay sir james craig sent cavalry to saldanha bay to harry batavian shore parties and organised withdrawal of local population and livestock to prevent their capture he followed with a larger force under his own command lucas held a council of war with his senior officers debating whether an attack on cape town was practical or whether they should abandon operation by 16 august decision had been made to sail for ile de france but lucas delayed unwilling to leave his sick men ashore as batavian force prepared to sail on 16 august elphinstone s fleet appeared off bay led by scouting frigate crescent he sent a letter to lucas demanding that lucas surrender which demand lucas refused ascertaining strength of batavian force in evening of 16 august elphinstone led his fleet into bay in line of battle and brought line to anchor at close gunshot range to lucas s ships trapped between coast and british lucas immediately raised a flag of truce he then sent an officer to negotiate terms with elphinstone elphinstone granted a delay to enable lucas to consult his captains but demanded assurances that batavian ships would not be damaged lucas gave his word of honor that this would not be done council of war then decided that a capitulation on terms should be sought one of terms proposed was that batavian officers would be allowed to go home on two of batavian frigates designated as cartel ships elphinstone rejected these proposals but offered to release officers eventually if they gave their parole by 23 00 hopelessly outnumbered and with his crews in open rebellion lucas agreed to terms that dictated an almost unconditional surrender of batavian force this

elphinstone returned to britain in october 1796 his flagship monarch passed right through french fleet of expedition d irlande during a snow storm anchoring in a disabled state at on 25 december following his return he was made baron keith for his capture and retention of cape colony most of sailors and soldiers in dutch force were germans and nearly all entered british service either with royal navy or east india company lucas and dutch officers later returned to europe in cartel one of captured ships hms dordrecht became notorious following year when crew mutinied at saint helena in imitation of spithead and nore mutinies in britain only intervention of captain charles brisbane who threw a noose around ringleader s neck and threatened death if disobedience was repeated succeeded in intimidating rebellious seamen in batavian republic lucas s surrender caused popular outrage on admiral s return he faced a court martial by a hoge high naval court impaneled by national assembly of batavian republic on 19 may 1797 lucas died on 21 june a few days before trial was to start and court therefore decided on 26 june to charge prosecutor jacobus with holding an inquiry in which all witnesses were deposed on basis of this report court decided on 14 december to lay main responsibility for surrender with lucas and to acquit other officers historians have held lucas blameless for refusing to fight elphinstone s force which was far superior in both ships and men elphinstone s ships carried more than twice as many men as batavian expedition even before british troops ashore are taken into account lucas could only muster 1 972 men compared with 4 291 under elphinstone s command expedition has however been criticised for its lack of preparedness while it is true that promised french support failed to appear batavian troops were insufficient in number to seriously threaten british garrison as parkinson noted what could be point of landing a few hundred men on a shore bristling with english bayonets an unintended effect of campaign however was to forestall a british invasion of ile de france which elphinstone had postponed to prepare for lucas s arrival and which was ultimately cancelled entirely there were no further attacks on cape colony during war treaty of amiens in 1802 returned cape colony and all other captured dutch colonies except ceylon to batavian republic peace was short lived and early in napoleonic wars british prepared another expeditionary force in 1806 british again seized cape colony following dutch defeat at battle of cape colony
