different designs conceived by game freak s character development team and finalized by ken sugimori for first generation of pocket monsters games red and green which were localized outside japan as pokemon red and blue originally called casey and foodin in japanese nintendo decided to give various pokemon species clever and descriptive names related to their appearance or features when translating game for western audiences as a means to make characters more relatable to american children abra and kadabra were initially intended to be named hocus and pocus which were also original names in pokemon red and green beta version for american audiences but were instead changed to abra and kadabra based on famous incantation along with alakazam alakazam s japanese name foodin was inspired by a rough translation of harry houdini s last name abra kadabra and alakazam are bipedal pokemon characterized by their humanoid body structure and somewhat fox like appearance they look like they are wearing armor as they have two shaped pieces on their shoulders and a fauld like piece around their chest abra kadabra and alakazam have three fingers on each hand and three toes on each

state these waves can trigger headaches in nearby people and can cause machines to malfunction once it evolves into alakazam it has mastered every type and form of psychic ability and its brain

progressed calling abra cute they described kadabra as having a bit of that personality and alakazam as being a distinctly grim foreboding character at same time they cited them as one of most versatile groups of characters in franchise ign also listed alakazam and to a lesser extent kadabra as one of best psychic types alongside mew mewtwo and they commented that alakazam was good for down to earth players who don t want to use like mew or mewtwo they further described alakazam as arguably single most popular non legendary psychic type in any of current games and as a brilliant yet brittle brainiac boys life named abra one of five coolest pokemon from pokemon firered and leafgreen at fourth st petersburg times also praised characters describing their names as clever ign called

was voted as 20th best pokemon where staff commented on evolution line stating they not only loved clever naming system but creatures designs and abilities as well they further stated that abra has always been a bit of a pain to raise and evolve but end result an alakazam is well worth it in my book controversy some fundamentalist christian groups have targeted kadabra as representing anti christian aspects of franchise in palm beach florida pastor eugene walton distributed pamphlets that described symbol on its head as a pentagram even though kadabra simply has a red five pointed star on its head different than a pentagram and claimed symbol on its chest was representative of nazi germany s waffen ss in book it s a dark world roger boehm argued that due to its psychic status and symbols on its body of latter kadabra represented occult further arguing that etymology of its name tied directly to them in november 2000 it was reported that uri geller an israeli psychic magician who claims to bend spoons with his mind sued nintendo over pokemon kadabra due to its japanese name which he claimed was an unauthorized appropriation of his identity geller learned of similarity after fans of both himself and pokemon noted a resemblance to character s japanese name behavior and face and presented him with cards of character to autograph after he had finished taping a television special in japan he further claimed that star on kadabra s forehead and lightning patterns on its abdomen were symbols popular with waffen ss and that through character nintendo had turned him into an evil occult pokemon character nintendo countered by stating there was no connection between two and that they had not named any of pokemon after actual people to knowledge of their staff in 2008 pokemon anime director and storyboard artist masamitsu hidaka confirmed in an interview that kadabra would not be used on a pokemon trading card until an agreement was reached on case
