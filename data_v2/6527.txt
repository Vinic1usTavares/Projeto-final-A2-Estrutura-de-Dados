time developing tony s character than any other character on show episode introduced tony sawicki a trans man and another clone played by maslany character was first imagined by manson and fawcett during development of show s first season they thought that introducing a transgender clone character would be very tied to themes of our show about identity and would fit well with previous season s themes of gender and sexuality when they approached maslany with idea at end of first season she told them that she had already thought about playing a transgender character herself it took show s creators longer than with any other character to develop and refine tony s personality and wardrobe entire process taking six months in preparation for part maslany researched and met with transgender people and grew out her underarm hair for six weeks although she eventually had to shave her underarms to attend an awards ceremony before episode was filmed new character was kept secret from most of crew until scripts for episode were distributed and show s hair and makeup department trialled different looks for tony on maslany s days off and weekends so that other members of crew would not see her in tony s costume tony s final look was created by stephen lynch sandy and debra hanson in show s makeup hair and wardrobe departments respectively manson fawcett and maslany sought advice from glaad on how to best go about introducing a transgender character in response to perception that tony s introduction had created a minefield of sexual politics fawcett said that that had not been writers intention rather their aim was to just throw this character in there and treat them like a normal human being like we would anyone else on show unlike most other episodes scenes which featured multiple clones were filmed using traditional locked off cameras rather than time consuming technodolly camera set up episode featured longest continuous shot filmed in orphan black where a scene between felix tony and sarah was filmed in one take it took almost three days to film 15 second sequence of scott drilling into kira s tooth involving three rented cameras and a prop tooth that was painted red inside and filled with white dust to achieve desired effect when drilled into scene in which cosima and delphine use a to get high was mostly improvised by maslany and brochu instead of inhaling actual helium pitch of their voices was altered in post production a stunt double was used for second to last scene wherein cosima falls to ground after vomiting blood episode features cosima and her lab assistant scott playing board game runewars fawcett who describes himself as a massive board game fan contacted game s creators at fantasy flight games for permission to use runewars in show and employed one of his friends as a consultant for episode as a consultant his friend set up board for scene taught involved actors how to play game checked for accuracy of gameplay and dialogue about game and had a non speaking cameo appearance in scene as one of board game players manson chose to incorporate h g wells science fiction novel island of doctor moreau which ethan duncan reads to kira into episode since he felt that novel s themes run so deep in our show book cover featured in episode was designed by show s art department episode s title variable and full of perturbation is

mixed reviews from critics mark rozeman writing for paste gave episode a rating of 6 9 out of 10 and despite enjoying several storylines described introduction of tony as perhaps biggest misstep in show s brief history he felt that kiss between tony and felix was an example of taboo pushing gimmickry and summarised episode as strange experimental tangent slant magazine critic matt brennan found episode jumbled and strange but felt that introduction of tony was a delightful twist he said that cosima s storyline taking place at dyad institute felt dry and utilitarian as though writers realized they better get their shit together in time to wrap things up a v club caroline framke gave episode a c grade and criticised chaotic script aggressively flashy direction and failed attempts to integrate wildly different subplots she admired attempt to shin e a light on a population that s often invisible in media landscape by introducing a transgender character but thought that tony s character was underdeveloped and more like a prop than a character similarly adam w kepler of new york times felt that tony was a cliche of trans men absolutely nothing viewers haven t seen before whose characterisation was overly simplistic although chris jancelewicz of huffington post found tony s character dull he wrote in response to maslany s portrayal of him gift wrap that golden globe hollywood foreign press there are no other best tv actress contenders this year he praised touching scenes shared by cosima with delphine and scott and entertaining and twisted bonding between alison and donnie ign s eric goldman felt that introducing tony was a big leap for show but that it paid off largely due to maslany s performance and enjoyed storylines featuring alison cosima and rachel vlada gelman wrote for tvline that maslany s performance as tony in variable and full of perturbation was proof that there isn t anything tatiana maslany can t do conversely rob hunter of film school rejects felt that her portrayal of tony provided proof that maslany is human after all and capable of failure references external links variable and full of perturbation at bbc america category 2014
