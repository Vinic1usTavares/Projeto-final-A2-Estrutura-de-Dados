quite surreal i still think kylie s people were trying to call jamelia and they just got wrong number it d be much more funny if that is how it actually happened recording of body language took place during summer of 2003 in london england dublin ireland and marbella spain musical styles and lyrical content inspired by music from 1980s body language deviates from minogue s usual disco influenced dance pop style evident on albums like light years 2000 and fever 2001 and instead explores genres like synthpop electroclash club and r b in comparison to her previous work body language is a slower burning record and begins with song slow a minimal and simple track which serves as a primary example of synthpop styled production of album adrien begrand from popmatters compared it to more more more opening track of fever saying in contrast to pulsating hi hat driven dance beat of fever s more more more body language gets off to a more understated start other synthpop songs on album include still standing and promises which make use of buzzing low synth lines driving beats and chord flourishes that sound straight out of 1984 former track also displays influences of nu disco and club music many songs on body language are influenced by r b and hip hop music two genres minogue newly experimented with on album red blooded woman blends 1980s sound with an almost garage like beat and contains a boy boy hook and la la la bridge critics felt its production was similar to that by american hip hop and r b producer timbaland elements of funk are also present and are notably clear on

quiet storm influenced chocolate and obsession minogue s vocal delivery on album is mostly seductive and breathy in tone such as in songs like slow and chocolate although track obsession features raspy vocals critics noted references and similarities to 1980s pop music throughout album adrien begrand from popmatters found hook of sweet music similar to those in songs by prince and inxs still standing was described by helen pidd from guardian as a magnificent blend of prince s kiss and peter gabriel s sledgehammer red blooded woman contains a reference to british band dead or alive s 1985 song you spin me round like a record in line you got me spinning round round round round like a record title of i feel for you is same as 1979 1984 song by prince and chaka khan although it is not a cover of song secret take you home directly refers to urban contemporary band lisa lisa and cult jam s 1984 song i wonder if i take you home both in its title and refrain line of song in which minogue sings don t confuse emotions with pleasure principle also refers to american recording artist janet jackson s 1987 song pleasure principle thumb left minogue performing chocolate during showgirl homecoming tour 2006 lyrically body language touches upon themes like enjoyment flirting sex and partying like it s 1987 all over again in an interview with vh1 minogue was asked why lyrics on album sound more personal than they might have been a few years ago and she responded by saying some of that could be just chance i wrote lyrics that were intensely personal to me on an album a few years ago maybe people know me better now and therefore if a songwriter pitches me a song they might tailor it to fit me i get lyrics of a tune and interpret them my way although lyrics of slow seem like an invitation to dance floor minogue revealed that it s about how time and space have a different meaning when you meet someone you really like in sweet music minogue sings about magic of modern singer producer partnership in lines like i think we re on to something your taste it mirrors mine so hot and in moment and let s make this demo right song also makes use of double entendre in some lines similarly chocolate is packed with saccharine innuendo secret take you home contains various metaphors that compare flirting and sex to car racing ballads like obsession deal with issues of loss and

more mainstream post millennium work and praised it for being cohesive he also complimented minogue s willingness to try something new even if it s within confines of dance pop is what s made her an international sensation 15 years running rob sheffield from rolling stone favoured sensual nature of album calling it fantastic and that at thirty five she s ten times hotter than she was ten years

thing or two spin review of album commented that minogue wears 80s well and praised dance oriented songs on track list although they criticised ballads and pointed out that at times minogue s vocals are so over processed that they barely seem to exist at all on other hand andy battaglia from a v club opined that ballads work and concluded that body language shows minogue as a surprisingly impressive presence in spurts but she sounds better with her pleasure engine revving at full purr commercial performance thumbnail left minogue performing red blooded woman during her 2009 north
