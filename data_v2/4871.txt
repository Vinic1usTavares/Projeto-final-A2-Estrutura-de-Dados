66th infantry division was an infantry division of british army which was active between september 1939 and june 1940 during second world war in march 1939 after re emergence of germany as a european power and its occupation of czechoslovakia british army increased number of divisions within territorial army by duplicating existing units 66th infantry division was formed in september 1939 as a second line duplicate of 42nd east lancashire infantry division division s battalions were all raised in lancashire and cumbria area it was intended that division would remain in united kingdom to complete training and preparation before being deployed to france within twelve months of war breaking out instead division spent majority of its existence guarding vulnerable points in united kingdom by may 1940 division had been assigned to initial plan to defend country against any potential german invasion as a result of rapid german victory on mainland europe in 1940 division was not deployed overseas once british army returned from france it implemented experience gained from campaign this involved break up of several divisions including 66th division in order to bring others up to full strength background throughout 1930s tensions built between germany and united kingdom and its allies during late 1937 and 1938 german demands for annexation of sudetenland in czechoslovakia led to an international crisis to avoid war british prime minister neville chamberlain met with german chancellor adolf hitler in september and came to munich agreement which accepted that germans would annexe sudetenland chamberlain had intended agreement to lead to further peaceful resolutions to differences but relations between both countries soon deteriorated on 15 march 1939 germany breached terms of agreement by invading and occupying remainder of czech state on 29 march british secretary of state for war leslie hore belisha announced plans to increase part time territorial army ta from 130 000 men to 340 000 and double number of divisions plan was for existing ta divisions referred to as first line to recruit over their establishments aided by an increase in pay for territorials removal of restrictions on promotion which had hindered recruiting construction of better quality barracks and an increase in supper rations units would then form a new division referred to as second line from cadres this process was dubbed duplicating 66th infantry division was to be created as a second line formation a duplicate of first line 42nd east lancashire infantry division despite intention for army to grow programme was complicated by a lack of central guidance on expansion and duplication process and issues regarding lack of facilities equipment and instructors it had been envisioned by war office that duplicating process and recruiting required numbers of men would take no more than six months in april limited conscription was introduced at that time 34 500 men all aged 20 were conscripted into regular army initially to be trained for six months before being deployed to second line units process varied widely between ta divisions and was complicated by a lack of central guidance as well as lack of facilities equipment and instructors some were ready in weeks while others had made little progress by time second world war began history formation and home defence on 17 july 1939 embryo of division was formed major general arthur william purser formally brigadier royal artillery for eastern command was assigned as general officer commanding goc same month 42nd division created 197th infantry brigade as a second line duplicate of 125th infantry brigade 198th infantry brigade as a second line duplicate of 126th infantry brigade and 199th infantry brigade as a second line duplicate of 127th infantry brigade and however embryonic division and its brigades were administered by 42nd division until 66th divisional headquarters was formed on 27 september 1939 located in lancaster at this point brigades were transferred to 66th division which in turn was assigned to western command 197th brigade comprised 2 5th and 2 6th battalions lancashire fusiliers and 5th battalion east lancashire regiment 198th brigade comprised 6th and 7th battalions border regiment as well as 8th irish battalion king s regiment liverpool 198th brigade comprised 2 8th battalion lancashire fusiliers and 6th and 7th battalions manchester regiment due to lack of official guidance newly formed units were at liberty to choose numbers styles and titles division adopted number of their first world war counterpart 66th 2nd east lancashire division and their divisional insignia while insignia was adopted it was never actually worn by men of division government and military envisioned that ta divisions each be deployed intact to reinforce regular army formations in france as equipment became available with all 26 ta divisions deployed by end of first year of war this was a lofty goal for 66th infantry division for example at start of war 6th battalion border regiment had no small arms men of battalion were billeted in their own homes and attended their local drill hall for start of their training training was further impeded by a large portion of division s manpower being assigned to guarding strategically important locations known as vulnerable points these included railway bridges royal ordnance factories and royal air force bases in november division was placed under control of northern command on 10 january due to ill health purser stepped down from his role as goc he was replaced on same day by major general alan cunningham who had previously commanded 5th anti aircraft division in october 1939 commander in chief home forces general walter kirke was tasked with drawing up a defensive plan to defend united kingdom from a german invasion which was codenamed julius caesar divisions assigned to this defensive plan were constantly changing and by may 1940 included 66th division division replaced 49th west riding infantry division in northern command s part of this plan and as a result moved from positions around manchester into yorkshire division s role was to launch an immediate attack on german parachutists or failing that to cordon off and immobilise any german invasion effort until relieved by forces capable of launching a counter attack to defeat germans on 9 april following german invasion of norway second line infantry divisions in united kingdom were requested to each form an independent infantry company consisting of 289 volunteers who would be deployed to norway 66th division formed no 10 independent company however company was not deployed to norway following conclusion of campaign no 10 independent company was based in scotland and did not return to division in may 1940 divisional artillery was equipped with only seven first world war howitzers against a war establishment of seventy two modern 25 pounder field guns historian david john newbold described all forces under kirke s command in may including 66th as having been severely weakened by departures overseas spread very thinly and largely semi trained relatively immobile and lacking in all types of heavy equipment especially artillery and anti tank guns in particular division relied heavily on civilian transport it had prior to moving to yorkshire conducted little training move it was hoped would rectify this situation shortly after transferring division began platoon and company size training exercises disbandment as a result of battle of france and dunkirk evacuation division did not leave britain as soon as british troops returned from france british army began implementing lessons learnt from campaign this involved decision to abandon two brigade motor division concept and for basic infantry division to be based around three brigades four second line ta infantry divisions were to broken up to reinforce depleted formations and aid in transforming army s five motor divisions into infantry divisions as a result 66th infantry division was chosen to be disbanded which occurred on 23 june when its units were dispersed specifically 197th infantry brigade along with 257 field company royal engineers re and 110th field regiment royal artillery ra was transferred to 59th staffordshire motor division to finalise its re organisation into an infantry division these units as part of 59th staffordshire infantry division would go on to fight in battle of normandy 198th infantry brigade became an independent formation that was initially attached to 1st london division before being assigned to 54th east anglian infantry division at end of 1940 and remained in united kingdom during war 199th infantry brigade along with 109th field regiment ra was transferred to 55th west lancashire motor division to finalise its re organisation into an infantry division these units as part of 55th west
