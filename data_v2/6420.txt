jurisdiction and at its fullest may involve quashing an action or decision and ordering that it be redone or remade a mandatory order is an order of high court commanding a public authority to perform a public duty while a prohibiting order operates to prevent illegal action by an authority from occurring in first place a quashing order most commonly sought prerogative order has effect of invalidating an ultra vires decision made by an authority obtaining a mandatory prohibiting or quashing order is a two stage process as an applicant must be granted leave by court to apply for order

acted in breach of administrative law rules is established an order for review of detention directs someone holding a person in detention to produce detainee before high court so that legality of detention can be established power of court to require that this be done is specifically mentioned in article 9 2 of constitution of singapore while other prerogative orders may only be applied for with court s permission an order for review of detention may be applied for without prior permission from court a declaration is a pronouncement by a court stating legal position between parties to an

which individuals can apply for when challenging administrative actions and decisions and failures to take action and make decisions where exercise of statutory or other discretionary power by public authorities contravenes constitution or is unlawful under administrative law various remedies may be available when a judicial review action is taken judicial review means by which high court controls exercise of legislative and executive power is part of court s supervisory jurisdiction basis of this jurisdiction was affirmed by court of appeal in ng chye huey v public prosecutor 2007 as inherent

orders ancient remedies of certiorari mandamus prohibition and habeas corpus were originally only available to british crown and thus termed prerogative writs that is writs that could be issued at prerogative of sovereign see also writs not directed sometimes called prerogative writs because they are supposed to issue on part of king such as writs of mandamus prohibition habeas corpus

to propriety by end of 16th century they could theoretically be sought by any aggrieved citizen in 1938 writs were abolished in united kingdom and replaced by prerogative orders with essentially same

cannot have legal proceedings taken against him or her for doing so roc o 53 r 6 1 since it is responsibility of high court to determine legality of a decision rather than its merits it will not order

for any sum of money thumb hall in southwark london now occupied by theatre peckham in a 1983 case queen s bench division of high court held that refusal of southwark london borough council to permit a national front by election candidate to use hall while contrary to a declaration that candidate had a legal right to do so did not amount to a contempt of court a declaration is only as effective as willingness of a public body to abide by court s statement of law in it as it is not a contempt of court to ignore a declaration a declaration pronounces upon existence or non existence of a legal state of affairs it does not have any coercive force as it does not contain any order which can be enforced against defendant construction pte ltd v attorney general 1995 2 s l r r 282 at 294 para 28

people act of people act 1949 12 13 14 geo 6 c 68 uk to permit webster to use hall local council refused to do so as it did not agree with webster s political views court made a declaration that webster was legally entitled to use hall at a certain time for purpose of his election campaign on assumption that local council would obey it nonetheless local council still refused to allow webster use of hall it was held that a declaration is not a coercive order of court and accordingly refusal to comply with it is not contempt webster pp 706 and 708 there is some authority to effect that a court will not generally grant a declaration if it considers issue at hand to be an academic question or one that is entirely hypothetical for instance in vince v chief constable of dorset police 1992 proceedings against chief constable of dorset police were brought by plaintiffs on behalf of members of police federation of england and wales to among other things enable chief constables throughout country to know where they stood on a question of law with respect to police and criminal evidence act 1984 police and criminal evidence act 1984 1984 c 60 uk namely whether it was unlawful to appoint an acting sergeant as a custody officer under section 36 3 of act affirming decision of judge below a majority of court of appeal declined to make a declaration on matter it took view that since there was no evidence that any chief constable had ever appointed an acting sergeant as a custody officer issue was academic or hypothetical vince p 426 however at least in uk there are signs that courts may be moving towards showing more flexibility in granting advisory declarations in r v secretary of state for home department ex parte salem 1999 salem a citizen of libya was granted temporary admission to uk to pursue an asylum claim one month later home office recorded in an internal file that salem s asylum claim had been refused but did not communicate decision to him salem only found out when his income support ceased and benefits agency told him that they had been informed that he had been refused asylum subsequently salem unsuccessfully sought leave to apply for judicial review of home secretary s decision to notify department of social security that his asylum claim had been rejected he then obtained leave to appeal matter to house of lords but was then granted refugee status before house of lords salem argued that his appeal should still be heard as question of law in his case was one of general public importance court held that it had discretion to hear an appeal which concerns an issue involving a public authority as to a question of public law even where there is no longer any live issue which would affect rights and duties of parties themselves however court cautioned that this discretion has to be exercised with circumspection and entertained only where there was a good public interest reason to do so ex parte salem pp 456 458 it is not yet known whether singapore high court will adopt a similar approach singapore courts have also yet to directly address issue of standing required to apply for a declaration in an administrative law case in

for legal right to be vested in parties re s p 22 cited in karaha bodas pp 124 125 para 22 one of reasons it came to this conclusion was that re s is regarded by some scholars cited in karaha bodas p 125 para 24 as more consistent with rule 40 20 of civil procedure rules civil procedure rules 1998 s i 1998 no 3132 l 17 as amended by civil procedure amendment rules 2001 s i 2001 no 256 l 7 r 13

other proceedings shall be open to objection on ground that a merely declaratory judgment or order is sought thereby and court may make binding declarations of right whether or not any consequential relief is or could be claimed emphasis added karaha bodas pp 125 126 paras 24 25 hence court concluded that its jurisdiction to make declarations is confined to declaring contested legal rights of

judicial review reference to judicial review proceedings in definition of civil proceedings was added to gpa s 2 2 by s 6 and para 8 of 1st sch change was not specifically explained in parliament
