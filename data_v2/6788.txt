tucana is a constellation of stars in southern sky named after toucan a south american bird it is one of twelve constellations conceived in late sixteenth century by petrus plancius from observations of pieter dirkszoon keyser and frederick de houtman tucana first appeared on a celestial globe published in 1598 in amsterdam by plancius and jodocus hondius and was depicted in johann bayer s star atlas uranometria of 1603 french explorer and astronomer nicolas louis de lacaille gave its stars bayer designations in 1756 constellations tucana grus phoenix and pavo are collectively known as southern birds tucana is not a prominent constellation as all of its stars are third magnitude or fainter brightest is alpha tucanae with an apparent visual magnitude of 2 87 beta tucanae is a star system with six member stars while kappa is a quadruple system five star systems have been found to have exoplanets to date constellation contains 47 tucanae one of brightest globular clusters in sky and most of small magellanic cloud history southern birds as seen in johann bayer s uranometria tucana as toucan is in middle thumb left tucana is one of twelve constellations established by dutch astronomer petrus plancius from observations of southern sky by dutch explorers pieter dirkszoon keyser and frederick de houtman who had sailed on first dutch trading expedition known as eerste schipvaart to east indies it first appeared on a celestial globe published in 1598 in amsterdam by plancius with jodocus hondius first depiction of this constellation in a celestial atlas was in german cartographer johann bayer s uranometria of 1603 both plancius and bayer depict it as a toucan de houtman included it in his southern star catalogue same year under dutch name den op indies lang indian magpie named lang in indies by this meaning a particular bird with a long beak a hornbill a bird native to east indies a 1603 celestial globe by willem blaeu depicts it with a casque it was interpreted on chinese charts as chuy beak bird and in england as pye while johannes kepler and giovanni battista riccioli termed it anser americanus american goose and caesius as pica indica tucana and nearby constellations phoenix grus and pavo are collectively called southern birds characteristics irregular in shape tucana is bordered by hydrus to east grus and phoenix to north indus to west and octans to south covering 295 square degrees it ranks 48th of 88 constellations in size recommended three letter abbreviation for constellation as adopted by international astronomical union in 1922 is tuc official constellation boundaries as set by eugene delporte in 1930 are defined by a polygon of 10 segments in equatorial coordinate system right ascension coordinates of these borders lie between and while declination coordinates are between 56 31deg and 75 35deg as one of deep southern constellations it remains below horizon at latitudes north of 30th parallel in northern hemisphere and is circumpolar at latitudes south of 50th parallel in southern hemisphere features stars left thumb sidekick or star of show although he depicted tucana on his chart bayer did not assign its stars bayer designations french explorer and astronomer nicolas louis de lacaille labelled them alpha to rho in 1756 but omitted omicron and xi and labelled a pair of stars close together lambda tucanae and a group of three stars beta tucanae in 1879 american astronomer benjamin gould designated a star xi tucanae this had not been given a designation by lacaille who had recognized it as nebulous and it is now known as globular cluster 47 tucanae mu tucanae was dropped by francis baily who felt star was too faint to warrant a designation and kappa s two components came to be known as and layout of brighter stars of tucana has been likened to a kite within constellation s boundaries are around 80 stars brighter than an apparent magnitude of 7 at an apparent magnitude of 2 86 alpha tucanae is brightest star in constellation and marks toucan s head it is an orange subgiant of spectral type around 199 light years distant from solar system a cool star with a surface temperature of 4300 k it is 424 times as luminous as sun and 37 times its diameter it is 2 5 to 3 times as massive alpha tucanae is a spectroscopic binary which means that two stars have not been individually resolved using a telescope but presence of companion has been inferred from measuring changes in spectrum of primary orbital period of binary system is 7 days 11 5 years nothing is known about companion two degrees southeast of alpha is red hued nu tucanae of spectral type m4iii and lying around 290 light years distant it is classified as a semiregular variable star and its brightness varies from magnitude 4 75 to 4 93 described by richard hinckley allen as bluish gamma tucanae is a yellow white sequence star of spectral type and an apparent magnitude of 4 00 located around 75 light years from earth it also marks toucan s beak beta delta and kappa are multiple star systems containing six two and four stars respectively located near tail of toucan beta tucanae s two brightest components and beta2 are separated by an angle of 27 arcseconds and have apparent magnitudes of 4 4 and 4 5 respectively they can be separated in small telescopes a third star tucanae is separated by 10 arcminutes from two and able to be seen as a separate star with unaided eye each star is itself a binary star making six in total lying in southwestern corner of constellation around 251 light years away from earth delta tucanae consists of a blue white primary contrasting with a yellowish companion delta tucanae a is a main sequence star of spectral type b9 5v and an apparent magnitude of 4 49 companion has an apparent magnitude of 9 3 kappa tucanae system shines with a combined apparent magnitude of 4 25 and is located around 68 light years from solar system brighter component is a yellowish star known as kappa tucanae a with an apparent magnitude of 5 33 and spectral type while fainter lies 5 arcseconds to northwest known as kappa tucanae b it has an apparent magnitude of 7 58 and spectral type five arcminutes to northwest is a fainter star of apparent magnitude 7 24 actually a pair of orange main sequence stars of spectral types and k3v which can be seen individually as stars one arcsecond apart with a telescope such as a with high power thumb right most of small magellanic cloud lies within tucana lambda tucanae is an optical double that is name is given to two stars lambda1 and lambda2 which appear close together from our viewpoint but are in fact far apart in space lambda1 is itself a binary star with two components a yellow white star of spectral type v and an apparent magnitude of 6 22 and a yellow main sequence star of spectral type and an apparent magnitude of 7 28 system is 186 light years distant lambda2 is an orange subgiant of spectral type k2iii that is expanding and cooling and has left main sequence of apparent magnitude 5 46 it is approximately 220 light years distant from earth epsilon tucanae traditionally marks toucan s left leg a b type subgiant it has a spectral type and an apparent magnitude of 4 49 it is approximately 373 light years from earth it is around four times as massive as our sun theta tucanae is a white a type star around 423 light years distant from earth which is actually a close binary system main star is classified as a delta scuti variable a class of short period six hours at most pulsating stars that have been used as standard candles and as subjects to study asteroseismology it is around double sun s mass having siphoned off one whole solar mass from its companion now a hydrogen depleted dwarf star of around only 0 2 solar masses system shines with a combined light that varies between magnitudes 6 06 to 6 15 every 70 to 80 minutes zeta tucanae is a yellow white main sequence star of spectral type f9 5v and an apparent magnitude of 4 20 located 28 light years away from solar system despite having a slightly lower mass this star is more luminous than sun composition and mass of this star are very similar to sun with a slightly lower mass and an estimated age of three billion years solar like qualities make it a target of interest for investigating possible existence of a life bearing planet it appears to have a debris disk orbiting it at a minimum radius of 2 3 astronomical units as of 2009 no planet has been discovered in orbit around this star five star systems have been found to have planets four of which have been discovered by high accuracy radial velocity planet searcher harps in chile hd is a star with around 83 of sun s mass located 72 light years away with a super earth planet with an orbital

cluster 47 tucana globular cluster 47 tuc credit eso second brightest globular cluster in sky after omega centauri 47 tucanae ngc 104 lies just west of small magellanic cloud only 14 700 light years distant from earth it is thought to be around 12 billion years old mostly composed of old yellow stars it does possess a contingent of blue stragglers hot stars that are hypothesized to form from binary star mergers 47 tucanae has an apparent magnitude of 3 9 meaning that it is visible to naked eye it is a shapley class iii cluster which means that it has a clearly defined nucleus near to 47 tucana on sky and often seen in wide field photographs showing it are two much more distant globular clusters associated with smc ngc 121 10 arcminutes away from bigger cluster s edge and lindsay 8 ngc 362 is another globular cluster in tucana with an apparent magnitude of 6 4 27 700 light years from earth like neighboring 47 tucanae ngc 362 is a shapley class iii cluster and among brightest globular clusters in sky unusually for a globular cluster its orbit takes it very close to center of milky way approximately 3 000 light years it was discovered in 1820s by james dunlop its stars become visible at magnification through a telescope thumb globular cluster ngc 121 located at southern end of tucana small magellanic cloud is a dwarf galaxy that is one of nearest neighbors to milky way galaxy at a distance of 210 000 light years though it probably formed as a disk shape tidal forces from milky way have distorted it along with large magellanic cloud it lies within magellanic stream a cloud of gas that connects two galaxies ngc 346 is a star forming region located in small magellanic cloud it has an apparent magnitude of 10 3 within it lies triple star system hd each of its members among most luminous stars known left thumb open star cluster ngc 299 is located within small magellanic cloud tucana dwarf galaxy which was discovered in 1990 is a dwarf spheroidal galaxy of type that is an isolated member of local group it is located from solar system and around from barycentre of local group second most remote of all member galaxies after sagittarius dwarf irregular galaxy barred spiral galaxy ngc is located 3 degrees northwest of delta tucanae and was initially mistaken for a planetary nebula in 1998 part of constellation was subject of a two week observation program by hubble space telescope which resulted in hubble deep field south potential area to be covered needed to be at poles of telescope s orbit for continuous observing with final choice resting
