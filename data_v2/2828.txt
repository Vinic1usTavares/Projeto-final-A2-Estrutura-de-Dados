metacritic which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications album received an average score of 60 based on 42 reviews in new york times jon pareles wrote that jay z was trying to transition from his pop sensibilities but had not yet found a reliable alternative on magna carta holy grail where his raps were often mismatched with rigidly produced tracks allmusic s andy kellman believed record was hastily produced and despite occasionally impressive lyrics jay z s pop culture references sounded reflexive spin magazine s jordan sargent said songs sounded at once overly elaborate and unfinished along with similar but less momentous themes in comparison to watch throne jesse cataldo from slant magazine deemed it a self important album marred by shallow name dropping while accusing jay z of becoming disinterested creatively because of his increased success evan rytlewski of a v club felt rapper had exhausted end of his rags to riches narrative and was unable to reinvent himself beyond gloating superficially about his riches daily telegraphs helen brown found his boastful references heavy handed and album unchallenging albeit enjoyable for lazy listener greg kot wrote in chicago tribune viewed that apart from well written moments on oceans jay z blue and nickel dimes most of album was inconsequential in a generally positive review randall roberts from los angeles times was impressed by production s energy and samples even though he thought album was not as intellectual or adventurous as its title suggests uncut wrote that it mostly succeeded as an attempt by jay z to balance his great wealth tough history and news responsibility while retaining his grit nme critic louis pattison said it lacked a radical presence such as kanye west to complement jay z s mature ruminations but nonetheless showed him as a sagacious lyricist comparable with bruce springsteen or bob dylan in observer kitty empire believed that while diverse production would appeal to listeners at first rather than jay z s predictably umpteenth retelling of his rags to riches story topics become more interesting on subsequent listens because of his surprisingly concerned takes on fatherhood and charity robert christgau from msn music said he was won over after several listens by familial songs which he found amusing on a record that pits black man as artistic rebel versus black man as family stalwart accolades closing out year magna carta holy grail was met with many accolades and was named in multiple albums of year lists by major
