of france in june 1944 objective of campaign was to secure a lodgement on mainland of europe for further operations allies had to land sufficient forces to overcome initial opposition and build it up faster than germans could respond planning for this operation had begun in 1942 anglo canadian force 21st army group consisted of british second army and canadian first army between them they had six

british guards armoured division liberated brussels belgian capital on 3 september and 11th armoured division captured antwerp following day advance was much faster than expected and rapid increase in length of line of communications threw up logistical challenges that together with increased german resistance threatened to stall allied armies by mid september allies had liberated most of france and belgium success of 21st army group was in large part due to its logistics which provided operational commanders with enormous capacity and tremendous flexibility background thumb right women of auxiliary territorial service prepare for operation overlord at a royal army ordnance corps depot between world wars british army developed a doctrine based on using machinery as a substitute for manpower in this way it was hoped that mobility could be restored to battlefield and enormous casualties of great war could be avoided army embraced motor transport and mechanisation as a means of increasing tempo of operations wholesale mechanisation of infantry and artillery was ordered in 1934 and by 1938 british army had only 5 200 horses compared with 28 700 in eve of great war in 1914 in second world war army relied entirely on motor transport to move supplies between railheads and divisional depots france was occupied by germany in june 1940 following german victory in battle of france an important factor in defeat was failure of logistical system of british expeditionary force which responded too slowly to rapid german advance in aftermath prospect of a british army invading and liberating france was remote and british army concentrated on repelling rather than mounting a cross channel attack on 19 june 1940 chief of imperial general staff cigs general sir john dill ordered that all line of communications units not required for home defence be disbanded and no further units be raised in event of an invasion of uk home forces planned to rely on civilian resources for transportation communications and maintenance in march 1941 war cabinet decided that army had reached its maximum size henceforth although manpower ceiling was to be raised a little this meant that raising more logistical units required conversion of other units by this time home forces divisions had a divisional slice personnel of division plus supporting operational and logistical units at corps and army level of 25 000 but overseas operations required one of 36 500 to 39 000 german invasion of soviet union in june 1941 drew german forces away from west and japanese attack on pearl harbor in december 1941 while having immediate effect of diverting troops from war against germany brought united states into war with prospect of substantial resources over longer term this made realistic planning for an invasion of france possible a war office staff study in may 1942 for operation sledgehammer an assault on france in 1942 revealed that an expeditionary force of six divisions would require all logistical units in uk but not until 18 december 1942 was a final decision taken that a german invasion of uk in 1943 was highly unlikely and reorganisation of forces in uk for an invasion of france could begin operation sledgehammer was superseded by operation roundup a plan for an invasion of france in 1943 in january 1943 commander in chief home forces general sir bernard paget estimated that an expeditionary force of eleven british and five canadian divisions could be assembled by august 1943 but diversion of resources to mediterranean theatre meant that by august there were only enough logistical units to support five divisions and full force would not be assembled until april 1944 by november 1943 force earmarked for france had dropped to twelve british and canadian divisions but prime minister winston churchill felt that as americans were contributing fifteen divisions this should be matched three divisions were therefore withdrawn from mediterranean british army s administrative doctrine was honed in western desert campaign where lessons were learnt and administrative staffs and logistical units developed effective procedures through trial and error doctrine based on fighting in europe where there was a temperate climate and well developed road and rail infrastructure was set aside and new organisational and logistical structures such as field maintenance centre fmc were developed by 1944 skill of british army in field of logistics had been brought to a high state of efficiency and support from united states through lend lease made enormous quantities of materiel available mechanisation and overwhelming firepower demanded a great deal from army s logistical infrastructure fortunately british army had 200 years experience of fighting campaigns far from home planning a plan was for a cross channel invasion was drawn up by a staff led by designated chief of staff to supreme allied commander cossac and approved at quebec conference in august 1943 it was codenamed operation overlord cossac also inherited and developed plans for operation rankin a contingency plan for a sudden german collapse home forces headquarters

later as more hospitals were established on continent numbers were forecast based on war office tables known as evetts rates after major general john evetts assistant chief of general staff who devised them for planning purposes it was assumed that casualties on d day would be at an exceptionally high double intense rate in event this was not case a special feature was provision of survivor

and personnel by allocating priorities for available shipping once final plans for landing were drawn up all further alterations had to be implemented by buco movement control was responsible for movement of units to coastal areas and ports from which they would embark like buco it had separate staffs for american and british zones which operated independently there was also turnaround control organisation turco which controlled turnaround of shipping at ports of loading combined operations repair organisation which handled repairs to damaged ships and landing craft combined tugboat organisation managed a fleet of tugboats objective of campaign was to secure a lodgement on mainland of europe from which further operations could be conducted lodgement area had to be large enough

force to overcome initial opposition and build it up faster than germans could respond campaign plan involved a landing in normandy followed by an advance to south ports in brittany would be captured and allied armies would then turn east and cross seine river for administrative planning purposes it was assumed that breton and loire ports would be captured by d 40 and seine reached by d 90 montgomery did not expect that campaign would unfold according to plan and did not commit himself to a timetable whether operations will develop on these lines he noted on 8 may must of course depend

concept which had been used with success in mediterranean theatre was not part of british doctrine unlike divisions which incorporated logistics units a corps was a purely operational formation and not part of logistical plan doctrine called for use of pack trains railway trains which would deliver days supplies direct to a division these had worked well in great war but had been found to be impractical in middle east and were never seriously considered for overlord fma was only a few miles from no 2 army roadhead but xxx corps staff considered that it knew best given its combat experience in north african campaign and allied invasion of sicily other corps of second army followed suit and established their own fmas under fma scheme divisions drew maintenance from fma rather than roadhead fma allowed a corps to train newly arrived administrative units to control usage of ammunition by divisions and alleviate traffic congestion around bayeux british second army gave tacit support for practice issuing an order that fmas be called field maintenance centres fmcs original nomenclature in mediterranean henceforth second army stocked army roadhead and left fmcs to corps fmcs were manned using corps resources each had two dids a petrol depot a transport company and two rasc composite platoons drawn from corps troops composite companies where possible an mpfc was attached

battery once detected could expect of shells on average ammunition reserves varied from five days supply for 5 5 inch medium guns to 30 days supply for 17 pounder anti tank guns usage exceeded seventy rounds per gun per day allocation for 25 pounder guns by six rounds per gun per day and allocation of fifty rounds per gun per day for 5 5 inch guns by twelve per gun per day fears that crowded lodgement area would prove a tempting target for luftwaffe led to an of anti aircraft ammunition later shipments of anti aircraft ammunition were cancelled and other types of artillery ammunition were substituted requirement for tank and anti tank ammunition was also over estimated while it seemed to germans that british army had an unlimited supply of ammunition this was not case and a reason why heavy bombers were used to augment artillery in operation goodwood mulberry harbour thumb left mulberry b artificial harbour in september 1944 no major ports were expected to be captured in early stages of overlord except cherbourg this was expected to take three weeks and it was not large enough to meet allied needs until a major port could be captured maintenance would have to be over open beaches that were at mercy of weather two artificial mulberry harbours were planned mulberry a for american sector and mulberry b for british sector work commenced in 1942 and prototypes were tested in 1943 mulberry a was to have a capacity of per day and mulberry b of each would handle 1 200 vehicles daily and provide shelter for small craft mulberry breakwaters consisted of blockships concrete caissons known as phoenix breakwaters and floating breakwaters known as breakwaters their construction consumed tens of thousands of tons of steel and cost ps25 million each harbour had three piers a barge pier and an lst pier each with one roadway and a stores pier with two floating roadways when overlord plan was expanded in 1944 it was too late to enlarge mulberry harbours so additional small craft shelters known as gooseberries were provided one for each invasion beach british gooseberries were no 3 at arromanches on gold beach no 4 at courseulles on juno beach and no 5 at ouistreham on sword beach construction of mulberry b commenced near arromanches on gold beach on 9 june and coasters began discharging inside breakwaters on 11 june first coaster discharged over store pier roadway on 18 june a severe storm worst recorded in june in forty years swept over channel between 19 and 22 june storm halted discharge of personnel and supplies for 24 hours destroyed mulberry a and severely damaged mulberry b components of mulberry a were salvaged and used to repair and complete mulberry b phoenix caissons were filled with sand to give them greater stability second roadway to stores pier was opened on 6 july by this time sheltered area designed for 16 coasters was in use by seven liberty ships and 23 coasters it exceeded its designed daily capacity of averaging ships discharged over their sides into dukws and rhino ferries ten of eleven dukw companies worked mulberry b some 36 dukws were lost in first five days dukws were able to operate safely inside harbour every day except during storm due to it lst pier planned to service twenty lsts per day from 18 june was not opened until 20 july and lsts had to be dried out beached and left stranded at low tide while unloading continued royal navy misgivings about drying out store carrying lcts had been overcome during planning stages but it now became necessary to dry out lsts as well with considerable consequent damage that was beyond capacity of naval repair teams which slowed lst turnaround because of storm only of stores were landed by 29 june instead of planned main effect was a shortage of ammunition particularly for 25 pounders and 5 5 inch guns for which demand had been unexpectedly heavy a high priority was given to additional shipments with petrol oil and lubricant pol shipments cut to compensate on 20 june navy agreed to allow ammunition ships to enter mulberry b even though this was acknowledged to be very dangerous an additional arrived by 27 july averting a crisis minor ports

lines two ship to shore lines were in operation by 25 july and six tanker berths were in operation with pipelines connected to bulk petroleum storage terminal which had a capacity of of petrol and of aviation fuel port was opened to store ships on 12 june and to tankers on 24 june some of petrol was discharged by 31 july and a daily average of of stores were discharged until port was closed on 25 september cherbourg was captured by americans on 27 june but it was very badly damaged and was not opened to shipping until 16 july some of its daily capacity was allocated to british it contained only deep water berths in allied hands and was useful in reducing load on port en bessin railway line from cherbourg to caen commenced operation on 26 july using rolling stock captured near bayeux lack of deep water berths meant that a large proportion of supplies shipped went in coasters that could discharge at small ports rather than in large ocean going liberty ships it was hoped that cherbourg could handle large and awkward loads but it had been so badly damaged that it was not sufficiently rehabilitated to do so until late august in meantime they were shipped already loaded on transporters or unloaded from lighters by cranes at courseulles or port en bessin although manifests were flown across each day there was still trouble identifying cargo a commendable but misplaced desire to use all available cargo space often led to one type of stores overlaying another result was mixed loads of stores being unloaded into dukws with a slowing of their turnaround time if they had to deliver to two different inland dumps to reduce turnaround time and wear on dukw tyres which were in short supply transshipment areas were established where dukws could transfer their loads to ordinary lorries there were timber platforms with a mobile crane at one end dukws were loaded by depositing supplies on them over side of ships in a cargo net each dukw had been equipped with two of these in uk a control tower overlooking port area used a loud hailer to direct dukws to numbered platforms where a crane would remove load dukw would be given a replacement cargo net and head back out to ship platform was large enough to permit some sorting of stores they would be loaded onto lorries backed up to other side of platform either by hand or using roller runways because shipping plan was so detailed with everything carefully planned and scheduled in advance timely and frequent alterations could not be tolerated to make up for this a system of express coasters was provided which could carry a known tonnage of whatever was required on a given day these carried unexpected and unforeseen demands such as baling wire to help french farmers with their harvests british beaches were closed on 3 september 1944 by this time had been discharged through small ports over open beaches and through mulberry b this meant that 25 per cent of total tonnage had been landed through cherbourg and small ports 12 5 per cent through mulberry b and 62 5 per cent over beaches tonnage handled over beaches greatly exceeded expectations of planners but it is unlikely that invasion would have been launched in first place without reassurance provided by mulberry ordnance thumb left reme fitters prepare to install a new engine into a sherman tank in first four weeks stores were landed in landing

in first 48 hours as assault packs used in madagascar and operation torch had been found to be too heavy and bulky proportional to their nutritional value a new 24 hour ration pack was therefore devised for overlord two proposed ration packs were tested under field conditions in june 1943 and a new 24 hour ration was produced that combined merits of both resulting 24 hour ration pack was a ration that weighed and at could fit into standard british army mess tin war office then ordered 7 5 million of them with a delivery date of 31 march 1944 only by strenuous efforts was this achieved

supplemented by shipments of fresh meat fruit and vegetables hospital patients began to receive fresh bread on 13 june and it was in general issue by 5 august mixture of tea sugar and powdered milk in ration packs was widely disliked and advantage was taken of an order authorising issue of tea sugar and milk to troops engaged in heavy and arduous night work as a result a surprisingly large

expected but soon deteriorated under constant heavy military traffic potholes were filled in and bypasses constructed around villages with narrow streets that were suitable for one way traffic only some additional bridges were erected to remove bottlenecks a lack of timber was foreseen by planners and was earmarked for shipment this included 18 000 piles long and 47 000 pieces of squared timber five canadian and two british forestry companies were in normandy by end of july but only sizeable source of timber in lodgement area was cerisy forest where there was about of beech and oak as in

personnel branches of ghq second echelon were sent out arriving on 16 september provost six pow camps were placed at disposal of 21st army group each was staffed to cater for 200 officers and 2 000 other ranks first of these arrived on 7 june and was employed as a collection and transit centre next arrived on 11 june and established a pow camp near arromanches camps had been established in uk for up to 25 000 prisoners but only 12 153 were captured by 26 july most were german but there were also russians poles and other nationalities most were taken to uk but some were retained for labour duties pow escorts were provided by war office and were based at southampton they crossed to normandy on lsts collected prisoners and took them back to uk this procedure did not work as well as planned because prisoners were not always ready to move when required and lsts were unable to wait for them first cmp units to arrive landed on d day these were three divisional provost companies six beach provost companies and two corps provost companies which were used for traffic control during build up phase an additional company arrived with each division four provost companies four traffic control tc companies and a vulnerable points vp company for each army and seven provost seven tc and three vp companies for line of communications area vp companies were used to guard pows delays in getting provost units ashore allowed traffic congestion to occur on first two days but line of communications area was established faster than planned when traffic congestion became a problem one check point saw 18 836 vehicles pass it in a day roughly one every four seconds despite all efforts key towns like courseulles and soon became bottlenecks bypasses were built and strict movement control was instituted under this regime operational vehicles operated at night when volume of administrative traffic was lighter five movement control groups nos 6 17 18 19 and 20 were assigned to 21st army group they did not operate as units but were dispersed among different headquarters breakout and pursuit thumb left sherman tanks pass a column of churchill tanks as they advance towards

commanded by 21st army group hq this remained case until general dwight d eisenhower s supreme headquarters allied expeditionary force shaef opened at on 1 september rear headquarters of 21st army group joined advanced headquarters at vaucelles on 11 august falaise was captured on 16 august and three days later canadians and americans linked up closing falaise pocket on 26 august 21st army group issued orders for an advance to north to capture antwerp after a rapid advance swan british guards armoured division liberated brussels on 3 september and 11th armoured division captured antwerp following day as armies moved forward no 3 army roadhead was established for first canadian army at lisieux on 24 august and no 4 army roadhead for british second army near l aigle on 26 august this was soon so far behind advancing units that intermediate dumps known as cushions were established to which supplies required by corps were sited forward of roadhead in direction in which next roadhead would be established first of these no 1 cushion was established at falaise on 21 august to support first canadian army no 2 cushion was established near beauvais on 1 september and no 3 near doullens next day no 5 army roadhead was sited on road between dieppe and abbeville on 3 september no 6 army roadhead near brussels on 6 september and no 7 army roadhead near bethune on 15 september 21st army group headquarters moved to brussels on 23 september and shaef moved to versailles around same time each army roadhead had a crasc supply unit who controlled two bsds four dids and four mobile field bakeries and a crasc petrol installation who controlled five petrol depots about of packaged fuel in jerry cans was held at a roadhead in mid september 12 line of communications area became responsible for logistical activities south of seine while 11 line of communications area became responsible for those to north transport thumb british troops enjoy attention of french girls after bringing a food convoy to paris 29 august 1944 with establishment of no 6 army roadhead 21st army group line of communications was long with main depots still at rma and few stocks between them and fmcs a crucial decision was taken on 30 august to gamble on early capture of le havre dieppe and boulogne and slash receipts from per day to free transport which would have been used to clear beaches for moving supplies forward of rma vehicle maintenance was neglected but this presented few problems as most of vehicles were new an exception was 1 400 austin k5 three ton lorries along with all their replacement engines which were found to have faulty pistons and gave trouble additional general transport companies were shipped urgently from uk and some new companies were formed in normandy increasing number of companies for british second army from six to thirty nine war office agreed to loan another 12 general transport companies to 21st army group but only five had arrived by 26 september these were formed from anti aircraft command and mixed transport command a new headquarters called was created on 10 september and all road and railway transport was withdrawn from armies and assigned to it with mission of moving supplies from rma to army roadheads first canadian army converted a tank transporter trailer into a load carrier by welding on steel plank normally used for airfield construction to form a base and sides experiment was successful and modified tank transporters could carry of supplies of ammunition or of pol except on narrow roads british second army converted a whole company in this manner 21st army group initially had only two companies of tank transporters and these were required in uk until additional tank transporters arrived from united states another expedient was to issue 30 additional lorries to four general transport companies that had enough relief drivers to man them two 10 ton companies were equipped with surplus 5 ton trailers there were also eight dukw companies one of which was on loan to us army and was involved in working utah beach two other companies were retained as dukw companies and remaining five were re equipped with regular 3 ton lorries in addition to dukw company a 6 ton and a 3 ton general transport company were loaned to us army these two companies were returned to 21st army group on 4 september during advance from seine second army employed only six of its eight infantry divisions so transport of two could be used to help maintain other six thumb left british vehicles enter brussels on 4 september 1944 while railway lines in northern france and belgium had suffered damage this was much less than of lines south of seine commencing on 10 september trains were loaded in rma and supplies shipped to a railhead near beauvais where they were loaded onto lorries that took them across seine on other side they were loaded onto trains for final journey to no 6 army roadhead work began on a new bridge over seine at le manoir on 8 september and it was opened a fortnight later some bridges over somme were also down but were bypassed by a diversion at doullens a bridge at halle in belgium was repaired by belgian authorities provision had been made in overlord plans for supply by air apart from supplying polish 1st armoured division for a short time little use had been made of this with raf freight service accounting for less than per week in august demand doubled from per day in week ending 9 september of petrol and of supplies were delivered to airfields around amiens vitry en artois and douai following week of ammunition of pol and of supplies were delivered evere airport main airport at brussels was brought into use and was landed there over next five weeks after liberation of paris it had become apparent that germans had stripped capital of its food and other resources for themselves before their capitulation many parisians were desperate and allied soldiers even used their own meagre rations to help civil affairs of shaef therefore requested an urgent shipment of of food a supply earmarked for just this purpose had been set aside at bulford long before and on 27 august first were delivered by raf this convoy labelled pour paris entered a day later following which were delivered a day by british usaaf dakotas were flown in which also delivered 500 tons a day along with french civilians outside paris bringing in local resources within ten days food crisis in paris was overcome a minor crisis developed due to a shortage of jerry cans discipline regarding return of containers was lax during advance resulting in second army s path through france and belgium becoming strewn with discarded cans many of which were quickly appropriated by civilian population as advance continued time taken for cans to be returned lengthened and a severe shortage developed which took some time to overcome result was a depletion of stocks at depots and imposition of petrol rationing ports thumb rasc troops stacking ration boxes in harbour at dieppe on 14 october 1944 antwerp was captured on 3 september but it was unusable because scheldt estuary remained in german hands in meantime a port construction and repair company arrived on 12 september and began rehabilitation of port quays were cleared of obstructions and lock was repaired by december port was opened to coasters on 26 november and deep draught shipping on 28 november when royal navy completed minesweeping activity after crossing seine i corps had swung left to take le havre although saint valery en caux was captured on 2 september a full scale assault was required to take le havre on 10 september with support from royal navy and raf bomber command which dropped almost of bombs by time garrison surrendered on 12 september port was badly damaged unexpectedly port was allocated to american forces le treport and dieppe were captured by canadians on 1 september although port facilities were almost intact approaches were extensively mined and several days of minesweeping were required first coaster docked there on 7 september rail link from dieppe to amiens was ready to accept traffic day before by end of september it had a capacity of per day le treport became a satellite port of dieppe boulogne was captured on 22 september and calais on 29 september both were badly damaged and boulogne was not opened until 12 october ostend was captured on 9 september and in spite of extensive demolitions it was opened on 28 september salvage enormous quantities of salvage were left at falaise and hq of 197th infantry brigade was given responsibility for collecting it prisoners of war were used for labour depots for captured enemy stores were established at le royal for area south of seine and at amiens for north of seine top priority for collection was given to collecting jerry cans which were in short supply about 5 000 horses were captured which were given to french farmers by 26 september of salvage had been collected and turned over to ordnance depots prisoners only small numbers of prisoners mostly medical personnel who were used to care for wounded pows were retained for labour by 21st army group until august when hq line of communications was authorised to employ up to 40 000 of them by 24 august some 18 135 were being held and this climbed to 27 214 by 4 september thousands of prisoners were taken during rapid pursuit phase and efforts were made to reduce prisoner numbers shipping them to uk via arromanches and later dieppe numbers continued to increase and exceeded 50 000 at end of september by which time over 90 000 prisoners had been shipped to uk outcome by mid september allies had liberated most of france and belgium during first seven weeks advance had been much slower than anticipated and short lines of communication had provided an opportunity to accumulate reserves of supplies this had been followed by a breakout and pursuit in which advance had been much faster than contemplated and rapidity of advance and length of line of communications had thrown up severe logistical problems that together with increased german resistance threatened to stall allied armies success of 21st army group was in large part due to its logistics supply system developed by british army in desert had become standard procedure and staffs and units serving line of communications reached a high degree of efficiency in their own particular task support of army group over beaches and through artificial mulberry port constructed for purpose was a logistical feat so too was rapid advance across france and belgium which exploited success achieved in normandy this was made possible only by enormous capacity and tremendous flexibility of logistical system no army or navy eisenhower wrote was ever supported so generously or so well logistical performance of 21st army group even outstripped that of neighbouring us 12th army group as challenges facing 21st army group were not as great its lines of communications were shorter fewer divisions were involved and some of channel ports had been captured whereas breton ports intended to support americans except for saint malo had not montgomery remained confident that it was still possible to end war in 1944 but he was wrong notes references category operation
