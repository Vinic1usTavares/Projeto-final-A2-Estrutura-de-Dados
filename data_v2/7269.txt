uss iowa bb 4 was a pre dreadnought battleship built for united states navy in mid 1890s ship was a marked improvement over previous s correcting many of defects in design of those vessels among most important improvements were significantly better seaworthiness owing to her greater freeboard and a more efficient arrangement of armament iowa was designed to operate on high seas which had been impetus to increase freeboard she was armed with a battery of four guns in two twin gun turrets supported by a secondary battery of eight guns upon entering service in june 1897 iowa conducted training operations in atlantic ocean before moving to caribbean in early 1898 as tensions between united states and spain over cuba grew leading to spanish american war ship took part in bombardment of san juan puerto rico and then participated in blockade of cuba during war and after spanish cruiser squadron was found in santiago de cuba she patrolled off harbor to block their escape in battle of santiago de cuba on 3 july iowa assisted in destruction of three of four spanish cruisers after war iowa spent next several years conducting routine training exercises serving with pacific squadron from 1898 to 1902 south atlantic squadron until 1904 and north atlantic squadron until 1906 when latter two units were merged to form atlantic fleet iowa was modernized between 1908 and 1910 she thereafter served as a training ship for naval cadets from united states naval academy and for naval militia crews removed from service in 1913 and decommissioned in 1914 she was reactivated after united states entered world war i in april 1917 initially serving as a receiving ship and then as a training vessel and guard ship she was decommissioned again in 1919 renamed coast battleship no 4 and converted into a radio controlled target ship she was used in bombing experiments off virginia capes in 1921 before being sunk as part of fleet problem i off coast of panama in march 1923 by battleship design thumb left low freeboard design in early 1880s united states navy began to grapple with question of coastal defense united states at that time had a significant isolationist streak and naval strategy had historically been grounded in commerce raiding after building interim armored vessels and navy requested funding for additional ships in 1887 and one vessel was authorized for following year conflicting ideas about vessel that would be built delayed construction and led secretary of navy benjamin f tracy to convene a policy board in january 1890 tracy wanted to build sea going battleships that could project american naval power overseas though significant elements in navy and united states congress preferred shallow draft coastal defense ships board concluded that distance between europe and north america would hamper european naval attacks but power of british royal navy and possibility of future political developments warranted construction of a powerful american battle fleet policy board issued a call for a fleet that would consist of eight first class battleships ten slightly smaller second class battleships and five third class ships along with substantial numbers of lesser craft to support them fleet would be tasked with defending east coast of united states which required an operational range that could cover as far south as caribbean sea as board had determined that any hostile power would need to seize advance bases there to effectively operate against united states three vessels already authorized maine texas and what became armored cruiser fit in third category so larger and more powerful vessels would have to be built to meet board s recommendations congress dismayed by board s conclusions nevertheless approved funding for three of first class battleships in april 1890 which became s these were low freeboard vessels intended for local coastal defense they were badly overweight when completed and as a result suffered from serious problems including belt armor that was fully submerged when ships were fully loaded a tendency to ship excessive amounts of water and poor handling characteristics changes in control of congress in late 1890 led to delays for next ship to be authorized until 19 july 1892 when funds were allocated for a seagoing coastline battleship vessel was to be built with a displacement of around policy board had intended in its original plan that seagoing ship would trade armor for greater range but bureau of construction and repair responsible for design of vessel decided to reduce gun armament compared to indianas to free up displacement for greater fuel storage main battery of indiana class would be replaced with guns while some of secondary guns would be replaced with faster firing quick firing guns weight would also be saved by adoption of harvey armor which was significantly more effective than compound armor a thinner belt could thus be used to achieve same level of protection intention to use new ship for long range deployments required other changes in addition to increased coal storage since vessel would necessarily have to operate on high seas seaworthiness would have to be improved this required a greater freeboard so ship that was to become iowa was given a raised forecastle deck that extended from bow to amidships hull was lengthened and displaced more than indianas in addition heavy 8 inch gun turrets were moved closer together amidships which reduced amount of weight toward ends of ship also contributing to improved sea keeping arrangement also reduced blast interference between 8 inch and 12 inch guns general characteristics and machinery thumb left top and profile illustration of iowa design iowa had a length at waterline of and an overall length of her beam measured and she had an average draft of she had a metacentric height of and a righting arm of she displaced as designed and up to at full load steering was controlled with a single rudder while steaming at she could make a 180 degree turn in and at a speed of she could make turn in her hull featured a tumblehome shape only time an american battleship was designed that way she was fitted with a ram bow a customary feature of capital ships of period it had much greater freeboard than indianas providing her with significantly better sea keeping qualities she was completed with a single heavy military mast fitted with fighting tops which was placed atop forward conning tower a large derrick was placed abreast aft funnel to handle boats carried aboard she had a crew of 36 officers and 540 enlisted men ship was powered by a pair of 3 cylinder vertical triple expansion steam engines that each drove a screw propeller steam was provided by five coal burning fire tube boilers three were double ended boilers while other two were single ended versions boilers produced steam at they were ducted into a pair of very tall funnels these were adopted to improve draft to boilers like indiana class iowa was fitted for forced draft and she had mechanical hoists to remove ash from boiler rooms propulsion system was rated to produce for a top speed of though on speed trials she reached and a maximum speed of coal storage amounted to at a speed of 10 knots she could steam for armament thumb iowas forward main battery turret one of her secondary turrets is visible at right iowa was armed with a main battery of four 35 caliber guns mounted in two twin gun turrets that were mounted on centerline one forward and other aft of superstructure built up guns were mark ii type which were placed in elliptical mark iii turrets training gear was hydraulically operated but elevation was hand operated only gun mounts allowed elevation to 14 degrees and depression to 5 degrees to reload guns they had to be returned to 3 degrees elevation ammunition hoists that retrieved shells and propellant charges from magazines were also hydraulically operated guns fired an shell with a charge of brown powder muzzle velocity was and at muzzle shells could penetrate up to of mild steel at a range of their penetration capability fell to average rate of fire was one shot every five minutes though fresh well trained crews could achieve rates as fast as one shot every three minutes primary armament was supported by a secondary battery of eight 35 cal guns that were carried in four twin gun wing turrets two were placed on either side of ship abreast of funnels since 12 inch guns had a long reloading time 8 inch guns were incorporated to increase number of weapons that could defeat light armor 8 inch guns were mark iv version which had a rate of fire of one shot per minute they had a muzzle velocity of firing armor piercing shells they were initially supplied with brown powder charges but after advent of smokeless powder new smokeless charges were adopted that increased rate of fire by twenty seconds mounted in mark viii turrets with a range of elevation from 7 to 13 degrees reloading was fixed at 0 degrees six 40 cal quick firing guns rounded out secondary battery these were intended to use their high rate of fire coupled with high explosive shells to damage unarmored parts of enemy warships four of these were placed in individual casemates in forecastle deck two in sponsons in bow and other two located amidships remaining two guns were in open shielded mounts on aft superstructure superfiring over rear main battery turret they fired a high explosive shell at a muzzle velocity of for defense against torpedo boats ship carried a battery of twenty 6 pounder hotchkiss guns and four 1 pounder guns these guns were dispersed around ship in a variety of individual mounts including in fighting top of military mast superstructure and in sponsons in hull she also carried four m1895 colt browning machine guns chambered in lee navy as was standard practice for capital ships of era iowa carried four above water torpedo tubes in her hull two on each broadside these launched howell torpedo which had a range of and traveled at a speed of they carried a warhead armor iowa was protected with harvey armor which was fabricated with a new type of process that produced steel that was significantly stronger than traditional compound armor main armor belt was 14 in thick in central portion where it protected magazines and propulsion machinery spaces it extended from above waterline and below line and it extended for a length of of hull belt tapered to at lower edge at either end of belt angled bulkheads that were 12 in thick connected belt to barbettes for main battery turrets she had a thick armor deck that was level with top edge of belt on either end of belt deck sloped down on sides and was increased slightly to to provide bow and stern with a measure of protection against light guns above belt was a thinner strake of armor that was thick where it protected 4 inch guns and reduced to where it covered 57 mm and 37 mm guns iowas main battery turrets were protected with on sides and 2 in thick crowns rears of turrets were thick with greater weight being used balance turret their barbettes were also 15 in thick on exposed sides and reduced to where it was protected by belt secondary turrets had 8 in on outboard sides and on inboard sides where they were less vulnerable they also had 2 inch roofs their barbettes were 8 in thick her conning tower had thick sides service history thumb alt picture of large boat entering water iowa at her launching on 16 june 1897 keel for iowa was laid down on 5 august 1893 at william cramp sons shipyard in philadelphia her completed hull was launched on 28 march 1896 and after completing fitting out vessel was commissioned into service on 16 june 1897 captain william t sampson served as ship s first commanding officer iowa got underway to begin her shakedown cruise on 13 july steaming first to newport rhode island from 16 july to 11 august moving to provincetown massachusetts next day she next departed on 14 august for portland maine where she stayed from 16 to 23 august before sailing for bar harbor maine next day where she spent rest of month she then steamed south to virginia visiting hampton roads from 12 to 16 september newport news from 16 to 19 september a second stop at hampton roads from 16th to 19th and finally yorktown from 27 september to 4 october iowa then sailed back north for a second visit to provincetown that lasted from 12 to 14 october and then moved to boston staying there from 15 to 22 october she made one last port call in tompkinsville new york from 24 to 29 october before entering new york navy yard for repairs that lasted from 29 october to 5 january 1898 after emerging from dry dock iowa sailed for virginia alternating between hampton roads and newport news through mid january before departing for key west florida she then spent next month and a half cruising between key west and dry tortugas to west during this period maine exploded and sank in havana cuba accidental explosion was initially blamed on a deliberately detonated spanish naval mine sampson was appointed to serve as president of board of inquiry that was sent to investigate sinking so captain robley d evans took his place as iowas commander on 24 march ship remained in florida keys through 22 april by which time spanish american war had broken out spanish american war thumb left iowa seen from stern c 1898 on 22 april president william mckinley declared a blockade of western cuba and three days later congress declared war on spain retroactively effective as of 21 april sampson had by this time taken command of north atlantic squadron which iowa joined she took part in blockade operation from 22 april to 1 may before returning to key west to replenish fuel by that time sampson had been informed that a spanish squadron of four armored cruisers and three torpedo boats commanded by rear admiral pascual cervera y had crossed atlantic to attack blockade squadron he gathered his ships on 4 may to search for them sampson had at his disposal his flagship new york iowa and unprotected cruiser and these ships were soon reinforced by unprotected cruiser and monitors and and later armored cruiser americans searched harbor at puerto rico on 12 may but found no spanish warships and so bombarded port focusing their fire on castillo san felipe del morro an old coastal fortress iowa led american line of battle on several passes in front of fort and she was struck once by a spanish shell that wounded three men and inflicted minor splinter damage to ship during her last 12 inch salvo one of her forward guns inflicted blast damage to deck and parts of superstructure one man was killed aboard brooklyn and three more were wounded aboard other vessels but none of ships was seriously damaged by spanish fire american shelling was equally ineffective assuming that cervera was headed for havana sampson took his squadron there but while en route he learned that spanish had been coaling in saint thomas in danish west indies sampson instead decided to take his ships back to key west arriving there on 18 may while cervera reached santiago de cuba following day sampson detached iowa to reinforce flying squadron under commodore winfield scott schley which was conducting blockade of cuba she joined squadron off cienfuegos on 22 may flying squadron which by then consisted of iowa texas battleship new york brooklyn unprotected cruiser and several gunboats auxiliary cruisers and supporting vessels spent next week patrolling off coast of cuba searching for cervera s squadron on morning of 29 may lookouts aboard marblehead reported spotting spanish cruiser in roadstead outside santiago de cuba american squadron converged on port over next two days and prepared for action iowa coaled at sea on 30 may during this period schley made an initial attack on afternoon of 31 may he led line with his flagship massachusetts followed by protected cruiser and then iowa on a pass in front of cervera s ships opening fire at long range at 14 05 american shells fell short and they gradually shifted their fire but they failed to score any hits though evans noted that he believed they had inflicted splinter damage spanish return fire was similarly inaccurate and both sides had checked fire by 15 10 by which time american ships had broken off next day sampson arrived on scene and boarded new york to take command of blockade approach to santiago de cuba was guarded by coastal artillery and mines which prevented sampson s ships from breaking into inner harbor without taking serious damage but american squadron was too powerful for spanish to attempt to break out both sides spent next month in resulting stalemate americans preferred to wait until ground forces could attack port from land side and seize coastal batteries during this period iowa withdrew to guantanamo bay from 18 to 28 june which had been seized by american forces by that time she returned to bombard coastal fortifications on 1 and 2 july in company with indiana and battleship by early july american troops were beginning to approach hills outside santiago de cuba threatening coastal batteries that protected cervera s ships and prompting spanish command to order him to attempt a break out cervera did not believe he possessed a significant chance of success as his ships were in poor condition by that time and most of his ships crews were poorly trained he nevertheless complied with directive and sent a gunboat to surreptitiously clear a path in minefield on night of 2 july battle of santiago de cuba left thumb alt picture of large guns of uss iowa with smoke coming out iowas crewmen watch u s fleet s gunfire during battle of santiago de cuba at 08 45 on 3 july cervera sortied with his flag aboard cruiser followed by cristobal colon and and destroyers and iowa was in her blockade station steaming at about when her men were called from their quarters for morning inspection at 09 15 spaniards cleared roadstead at 09 35 luckily for spanish new york was out of position at time and massachusetts was replenishing her coal at guantanamo bay toward end of inspection aboard iowa lookouts aboard brooklyn spotted cervera approaching and fired one of her guns to warn other american ships which quickly ordered their crews to general quarters as spanish ships attempted to break out to west cervera charged at brooklyn with infanta maria teresa to delay american pursuit and give his other ships time to escape spanish coastal batteries also contributed their fire in first stage of battle but had little effect iowa brooklyn and texas opened fire at about 09 40 at a range of about iowa quickly got steam in her boilers up to increase speed to close with fleeing cruisers range fell steadily until she was just away from infanta maria theresa iowa fired a broadside at cruiser and then turned to port to cross t of vizcaya though spanish cruiser turned to avoid maneuver iowa nevertheless fired a broadside at a range of before turning to port and then back to starboard to come alongside cristobal colon two ships were about apart and iowas entire battery opened fire enveloping her in thick black smoke and hampering her gunners ability to spot targets cristobal colon and almirante oquendo engaged iowa and one of vessels struck her with what was estimated to be a shell it failed to explode but still tore a large hole in side of her hull a second shell from one of cruisers struck iowa and exploded causing relatively minor damage and starting a fire that was quickly put out several small shells struck her upper works including her bridge and funnels but damage inflicted was minimal by this point in battle heavy american gunfire had set infanta maria theresa on fire and fearing a magazine explosion ordered her run aground at 10 25 almirante captain issued similar instructions five minutes later as his ship too was burning badly vizcaya was also forced ashore shortly thereafter but her flag remained flying so iowa continued to bombard vessel until she hauled it down at 10 36 a sign of surrender meanwhile two spanish destroyers had also been badly damaged by american battleships indiana had nearly cut pluton in half with a 13 inch shell forcing her to run aground where she exploded and furor had been savaged by iowas and indianas secondary batteries leading her crew to surrender to gunboat cristobal colon managed to break away from american fleet for a time but she also ran aground later in day at around 11 00 iowa lowered five of her cutters to pick up crews of wrecked cruisers among men rescued was captain antonio eulate commander he attempted to surrender his sword to evans but he returned it to eulate in total iowa picked up 23 officers and 248 enlisted men of whom 32 were wounded her crew also recovered bodies of five men who were then buried with military honors in addition iowas boats also transferred men to other vessels in american fleet on 20 july four days after spanish garrison at santiago de cuba surrendered iowa suffered a boiler accident while she was patrolling off city manhole gasket on one of her boilers blew out sending boiling water out into boiler room crew set a board across a bucket and fireman 2nd class robert penn climbed across to shut off boiler risking being badly burned and he was later awarded medal of honor for his actions 1898 1904 thumb left iowa at naval review held to celebrate american victory iowa left cuban waters after spain surrendered in august arriving in new york on 20 august captain silas terry took command of ship on 24 september and on 12 october she departed for west coast of united states where she was to join pacific squadron next year passed uneventfully and iowa put into puget sound navy yard for an overhaul that began on 11 june 1899 she took part in training exercises off san diego california from 20 december to 15 january 1900 on first day of exercises iowa lost one of her howell torpedoes after practice warhead likely detached after it was launched in march 2012 a pair of dolphins that were part of navy s marine mammal program recovered torpedo which was missing practice warhead section recovered was later transferred to underwater archaeology branch for preservation torpedo is one of three howell torpedoes known to exist during period in san diego she received a pair of 3 inch field guns and four m1895 colt brownings that were chambered in 30 40 krag for use by landing parties ashore after training exercises iowa underwent a refit after which she resumed her peacetime routine of training exercises shooting practice and cruises in

completion as a result of 1922 washington naval treaty target ship thumb coast battleship no 4 on 22 march 1923 damaged by gunfire from with no further use for ship navy decided to convert coast battleship no 4 into a radio controlled target ship she was briefly struck from naval vessel register on 4 february 1920 before order was reversed six days later she was subsequently turned over to captain of battleship on 2 august coast battleship no 4 was converted for radio control in philadelphia with a wireless receiver that could control both steering and speed of ship as well as pumps to control boilers which were replaced with oil fired versions she was then moved from philadelphia to hampton roads under radio control departing on 17 august without any crew aboard her speed and course being directed from deck of ohio tests to determine effectiveness of control from ohio were conducted there through 10 september when navy was informed of their success in june 1921 navy and army conducted a series of bombing tests off virginia capes to evaluate effectiveness of aircraft against warships navy also sought to determine ability of internal compartmentalization to resist flooding from bomb attacks coast battleship no 4 was used as part of these experiments on 29 june as a moving target it took navy aircraft nearly two hours to locate her after being informed of her presence in a area she was then attacked with dummy bombs aircraft scored two hits out of eighty bombs dropped army refused to participate in attacks on iowa as general billy mitchell complained that attacking with simulated bombs had little merit ability of ship to maneuver significantly hindered aircrews ability to locate and attack vessel and navy called off further attempts with live munitions that army requested coast battleship no 4 was then laid up in philadelphia where she was reclassified as an unclassified miscellaneous auxiliary with hull number of ix 6 on 21 july she next went to sea in april 1922 for shooting practice off virginia capes with now serving as her control ship but exercises were cancelled and she returned to port ship was moved to pacific ocean via panama canal for shooting practice with new battleship as part of fleet problem i in february 1923 which was to simulate an attack on canal zone shawmut reprised her role as command ship first set of drills consisted of 5 inch fire from mississippis secondary battery at a range of around two further sets of practice shoots involved her 14 inch main guns at longer ranges second of these was conducted on 23 march and coast battleship no 4 was struck by three of projectiles which inflicted serious damage and sank her battleship fired a 21 gun salute as old battleship sank she was formally stricken from register on 27 march and her wreck was sold to marine salvors on 8 november footnotes references further reading external links naval historical center uss iowa battleship 4 1897 1923 later renamed
