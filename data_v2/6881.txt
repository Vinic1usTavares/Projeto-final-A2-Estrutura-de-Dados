forca bruta is seventh studio album by brazilian singer songwriter and guitarist jorge ben it was recorded with trio mocoto band and released by philips records in september 1970 during a time of political tension in dictatorial brazil its title comes from portuguese term meaning brute force album introduced an acoustic samba based music that was mellower moodier and less ornate than ben s preceding work its largely unrehearsed nighttime recording session found singer improvising with trio mocoto s groove oriented accompaniment while experimenting with unconventional rhythmic arrangements musical techniques and elements of soul funk and rock ben s lyrics explored themes of romantic passion melancholy sensuality and in a departure from carefree sensibility of past releases identity politics and elements of postmodernism a commercial and critical success forca bruta established ben as a leading artist in brazil s tropicalia movement and pioneered a unique sound later known as samba rock in 2007 rolling stone brasil named it 61st greatest brazilian music record that same year album was released for first time in united states by specialty label dusty groove america attracting further critical recognition background in 1969 jorge ben re signed to philips records after a four year leave from label due to creative differences and recorded his self titled sixth album it featured songs performed with trio mocoto as his backing band ben had met vocal percussion group while touring nightclub circuit in sao paulo in late 1960s band s members were fritz escovao who played cuica nereu gargalo tambourine and joao parahyba drums and percussion album was a commercial comeback for ben and its success created a busy schedule for all four musicians this hectic period for them led music critic john bush to believe it may have resulted in a relaxed recording of samba soul for forca bruta fellow critic tom hull said ben and trio mocoto chose to chill out at after party of jorge ben and capture sound of pleasant exhaustion recording and production thumb right ben center and trio mocoto in 1971 photo originally from correio da and later collected by

album they held one nighttime session without rehearsing most of songs beforehand according to parahyba this was intended to give listeners an impression of mood that developed as they played in studio during session ben first sang his vocal for a song before accompanying instrumentation was recorded he played acoustic guitar for instrumentals and specifically ten string viola caipira for songs aparecida and mulher brasileira he also repurposed a tuning fork a device traditionally used by musicians to maintain musical tuning among instruments singer instead stimulated it with his mouth to generate sounds that resembled a harmonica for their part trio mocoto attempted to develop a distinctive groove with a rhythm that would suit rock or ie ie ie feel of ben s guitar playing band played several percussion instruments including and bell plates for charles jr and other tracks parahyba used whistle of his sister s electric toy train as a horn instrument breaking it in process string and horn sections were recorded and included in final mix but went uncredited in album s packaging it credited c b d in rio de janeiro and scatena in sao paulo as recording locations for forca bruta which was named after portuguese for phrase brute force according to robert leaver of amoeba music s international records department one can see a sly irony in title considering heightened political tension in dictatorial brazil at time and gentle quality of ben s music for album musical style forca bruta has a pervasive sense of melancholy according to brazilian music scholar pedro alexandre sanches songs that do not demonstrate this quality in their lyrics do so with their melodies arrangements and ben s devilish guitar figures with oba la vem ela and domenica domingava cited by sanches as examples he identified each composition on album as either a samba samba lament or samba which in his opinion gave record an idiosyncratic sense of contrast greg caz a disc jockey specializing in brazilian music believed forca bruta possessed a melancholic mysterious quality that departed from carefree sensibility that had been singer s trademark he also observed a heightened progression in ben s idiosyncratic guitar playing music journalist jacob mckean found it subtle and stripped down when compared to ben s previous music with his guitar more prominently featured his vocals more intimate and a somewhat crunchy folksy tone established by opening songs oba la vem ela and ze canjica songs such as cuica driven o telefone tocou novamente and ze canjica featuring a drum cadence experimented with unconventional percussion arrangements resulting in rhythmic contrasts between trio mocoto and ben s instruments this rhythmic direction departed from his earlier music s innovative chacatum chacatum beat which had become popular and widely imitated by time of album while still samba based with hints of bossa nova forca bruta added understated funk and soul elements in form of horn and string arrangements horn riffs were arranged in style of sergio mendes on pulo pulo in style of stax records on o telefone tocou novamente and on title track which appropriated groove of 1968 archie bell song tighten up on mulher brasileira a string section was recorded playing swirling patterns around escovao s cuica while more uptempo rhythms of charles jr and pulo pulo were given contrast by more relaxed string melodies ben s singing provided further contrast and funk soul qualities to music along with his characteristic wails and croons he exhibited a newfound raspy texture in his typically languid and nasal vocal his singing also functioned as an additional element of rhythm to some songs according to peter margasak ben can be heard reinforcing rhythmic agility of his songs with pin point phrasing surprising leaps and a plaintive kind of moan on ze canjica and charles jr he improvised phrases such as and mama mama mama say as rhythmic accompaniment during otherwise instrumental sections of songs singer also implored name of comanche occasionally on album as parahyba explained it was a nickname given to him by ben who originally recorded it as a joke on charles jr a different explanation came in form of a lyric in ben s 1971 song comanche my mother calls me comanche themes women are central figures in ben s lyrics throughout album especially in mulher brasileira terezinha and domenica domingava domenica is a variation on domingas surname of his wife and muse maria his preoccupation with female characters led sanches to identify forca brutas predominant theme as ben s dionysian body referring to philosophical concept of a body that can submit to passionate chaos and suffering before overcoming itself several of songs deal with romantic disappointment in ze canjica narrator apologizes for being confused sad and moody while sending away a lover he feels he does not deserve o telefone tocou novamente expresses grief and pity over an angry lover ringing phone of narrator who leaves to meet only not to find her during song sanches observed a moment of catharsis by ben who raised his singing voice to an almost crying falsetto ben s lyrics also appropriated thematic devices from popular imagination verses of caipira influenced samba apareceu aparecida and pulo pulo were compared by sanches to songs from a traditional brazilian children s dance in apareceu aparecida which employs rolling stone idiom narrator rediscovers euphoric joy of living after his beloved has accepted him again this led sanches to conclude that ben sang of hedonism in a concentrated state some songs feature expressions of political values nationalistic mulher brasileira celebrates brazilian women regardless of their physical appearance and was cited by brazilian journalist gabriel de souza as an early example of ben s attempt to empower afro brazilian women through his music in caz s opinion lyrics on forca bruta reveal deeper concerns than were found in singer s previous recordings shown most notably by charles jr in which ben explores his identity as an artist and as a black man brazilian music academic rafael lemos believed it demonstrates ben s process of placing black heritage into modernity in aftermath of slavery in brazil and continued marginalization of black people there according to one translation of lyrics narrator proclaims thumb right charles jr explores black heritage in post slavery brazil o english black boy by jose de almeida junior shown above alt a pastel portrait of young black boy dressed in a white shirt charles jr and other songs also use elements of postmodernism such as self reference irony and surrealism as in lyrics of pulo pulo some of forca brutas characters and stories had appeared on ben s earlier work albeit in slightly different manifestations on his 1969 album charles was depicted as a heroic robin hood like figure of country sensually primitive domingas and teresa also from previous record were rendered here as more sophisticated domenica and irreverent terezinha respectively ben sang latter song in an exceptionally nasal voice interpreted by sanches as an ironic caricature of musica popular brasileira release and reception forca bruta was released by philips in september 1970 it was received favorably in veja magazine whose reviewer found it impressively rhythmic full of musical surprises and suspense and comparable to a comic book in way familiar fantasies and characters are reformulated in strange yet delightful directions commercially it was a top 10 chart success in brazil and produced hit singles o telefone tocou novamente and mulher brasileira its success established ben as an integral artist in brazil s tropicalia movement led by fellow musicians caetano veloso and gilberto gil following year on his next album negro e lindo ben delved further into black identity politics of charles jr while retaining melancholic musical quality of previous record forca brutas fusion of trio mocoto s groove and ben s more guitar proved to be a distinctive feature of what critics and musicians later called samba rock its soul and funk elements most prominent in title track helped earn album a respected reputation among soul enthusiasts and rare record collectors in an interview for guy oseary s on record 2004 music entrepreneur and record collector craig kallman named forca bruta among his 15 favorite albums recording artist beck also named it one of his favorite albums left thumb chicago headquarters and storefront of dusty groove america forca brutas first american distributor in 2007 album was re released by dusty groove america a specialty label in chicago that reissued rare funk jazz soul and brazilian music titles in partnership with universal music reissue marked first time album had seen release in united states dusty groove asked chicago reader critic peter margasak to write liner notes for release but he declined citing in part lack of american literature available on ben new york based retailer other music later named it fourth best reissue of 2007 and one of ben s deepest most emotional albums that same year forca bruta was ranked 61st on rolling stone list of 100 greatest brazilian albums in an accompanying essay journalist marcus preto called it singer s most melancholy album in a retrospective review for allmusic john bush regarded forca bruta as one of ben s best records and said it retained each musician s abilities over course of a wonderful acoustic groove that may have varied little but was all better for its agreeable evenness a reviewer for boston globe said ben s masterful performance of this music a fusion of bright samba and mellow soul still sounded original and essential nearly forty years after its recording recommended even for non it transcends language and era with an organic vibe and breezy spontaneity now magazines tim called it a samba soul heater while matthew hickey from turntable kitchen deemed it one of most textured and warmly melodic lps ever recorded and oba la vem ela among its loveliest tunes in impose magazine jacob mckean highlighted two opening tracks finding ze canjica particularly attractive and believed apareceu aparecida features album s most appealing hook he also found trio mocoto incomparable in their performance and album elegant and exquisite overall but added that ben s nasally singing on terezinha sounded unusual and string section was given slightly too much emphasis on mulher brasileira less enthusiastic about album was stylus magazines mike powell who said it has a kind of aesthetic gentility that characterizes brazilian music and polarizes its listeners powell added that while his may be silly forca bruta remains demure samba rock laced with sliding strings an agreeable samey atmosphere no strife on horizon according to peter shapiro it may be too dainty or not adventurous enough for some listeners lacking stylistically eclectic abandon of other tropicalia music but in his appraisal in wire he judged album to be something of a minor masterpiece of textural contrast and a stone cold classic of brazilian modernism representative of country s flair for weaving beguiling syncretic music from practically any cloth upon discovering ben s music in 2009 indie rock musician andrew bird wrote in a guest column for time that forca bruta is a classic of raw and soulful tropicalia and observed in ben s singing a pleading quality that projects a simultaneous sense of melancholy and delight segarra of for
