metis metis their heritage and aboriginal ancestry have often been absorbed and assimilated into their surrounding populations forced assimilation from late 18th century european canadians and canadian government encouraged assimilation of aboriginal culture into what was referred to as canadian culture these attempts reached a climax in late 19th and early 20th centuries with a series of initiatives that aimed at complete assimilation and subjugation of aboriginal peoples these policies which were made possible by legislation such as gradual civilization act and indian act focused on european ideals of christianity sedentary living agriculture and education missionary work directed at aboriginal people of canada had been ongoing since first missionaries arrived in 1600s generally from france some of which were martyred jesuit saints called canadian martyrs christianization as government policy became more systematic with indian act in 1876 which would bring new sanctions for those who did not convert to christianity for example new laws would prevent non christian aboriginal people from testifying or having their cases heard in court and ban alcohol consumption when indian act was amended in 1884 traditional religious and social practices such as potlatch would be banned and further amendments in 1920 would prevent status indians as defined in act from wearing traditional dress or performing traditional dances in an attempt to stop all non christian practices another focus of canadian government was to make aboriginal groups of canada sedentary as they thought that this would make them easier to assimilate in 19th century government began to support creation of model farming villages which were meant to encourage non sedentary aboriginal groups to settle in an area and begin to cultivate agriculture when most of these model farming villages failed government turned instead to creation of indian reserves with indian act of 1876 with creation of these reserves came many restricting laws such as further bans on all intoxicants restrictions on eligibility to vote in band elections decreased hunting and fishing areas and inability for status indians to visit other groups on their reservations through gradual civilization act in 1857 government would encourage indians i e first nations to enfranchise to remove all legal distinctions between indians and her majesty s other canadian subjects if an aboriginal chose to enfranchise it would strip them and their family of aboriginal title with idea that they would become less savage and more civilized thus become assimilated into canadian society however they were often still defined as non citizens by europeans and those few who did enfranchise were often met with disappointment thumb left st paul s indian industrial school manitoba 1901 final government strategy of assimilation made possible by indian act was canadian residential school system beginning in 1847 and lasting until 1996 canadian government in partnership with dominant christian churches ran 130 residential boarding schools across canada for aboriginal children who were forcibly taken from their homes while schools were said to educate they were plagued by under funding disease and abuse because of laws and policies that encouraged or required indigenous peoples to assimilate into a eurocentric society canada violated united nations genocide convention that canada signed in 1949 and passed through parliament in 1952 residential school system that removed aboriginal children from their homes has led
