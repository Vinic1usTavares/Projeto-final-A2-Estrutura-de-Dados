curtis and wilson pickett with whom he recorded a cover of beatles hey jude that went to number 23 on national charts duane began to put together a new band and invited bassist berry oakley to jam with new group pair had met in a jacksonville florida club some time earlier and became quick friends group had immediate chemistry and duane s vision for a different band one with two lead guitarists and two drummers began evolving meanwhile phil walden manager of late otis redding and several other r b acts was looking to expand into rock acts rick hall became frustrated with group s recording methods and offered tracks recorded and their contract to walden and jerry wexler of atlantic records who purchased them for 10 000 walden intended upcoming group to be centerpiece of his new atlantic distributed label capricorn after duo moved to jacksonville they began to put together large jam sessions dickey betts had played in oakley s previous band second coming and became group s second lead guitarist while butch trucks with whom duane and gregg had cut a demo less than a year prior fulfilled role of second drummer second coming s reese wynans played keyboards and duane oakley and betts all shared vocal duties unnamed group began to perform free shows in willow branch park in jacksonville with an ever changing rotating cast of musicians duane felt strongly his brother should be vocalist of new group which effectively eliminated wynans position as gregg also played keyboards gregg accepted invitation and entered rehearsal on march 26 1969 when group was rehearsing trouble no more by muddy waters although initially intimidated by musicians duane pressured his brother into singing his guts out four days later group made their debut at jacksonville armory although many names were suggested including beelzebub six piece eventually decided on allman brothers band group moved to macon georgia by may 1 where walden was establishing capricorn records band performed locally as well as eighty miles north in atlanta s piedmont park and practiced at newly minted capricorn nearly each day group forged a strong brotherhood spending countless hours rehearsing consuming psychedelic drugs and hanging out in rose hill cemetery where they would write songs their first performances outside south came on may 30 and 31 in boston opening for velvet underground in need of more material group remade old blues numbers like trouble no more and one way out in addition to improvised jams such as mountain jam gregg who had struggled to write in past became band s sole songwriter composing songs such as whipping post and black hearted woman much of material collected on allman brothers band was written between period of may to august 1969 and premiered live according to johanson group gauged crowd reaction to numbers and adjusted songs accordingly before we went into studio we had a very clear idea of what we were all trying to do musically and that it was unique totally different from anything else that anyone was playing said betts from earliest rehearsals we all had same mind set recording and production band set off from macon for new york city in august 1969 and faced setbacks along way such as their equipment truck breaking down in south carolina in addition they had arranged to work with cream producer tom dowd who was unavailable atlantic records house engineer adrian barber recorded sessions instead and was credited as producer recalled dowd i was supposed to have done first album with band up in new york but some way or other i got detoured jerry wexler made a deal to keep them in studio for three or four days when they were supposed to be with me band had no commercial success in mind having had troublesome experiences individually in past with producers and labels that pushed for radio hits band felt that with time they would develop a small devoted following and be strong enough to collect 3 4 000 dollars per night allman brothers band was recorded and mixed in two weeks and according to biographer alan paul virtually no outtakes exist from sessions band had performed their songs countless times in preceding months and had them down cold numerous artists including ray charles had recorded on studio s house hammond organ but gregg allman set up his own instead feeling unable to play on same instrument as charles a red light on recording board would go on when band began recording and it made gregg allman nervous in order to perform takes as needed he unscrewed light two week booking was initially designed for laying down basic tracks with overdubs following later but group ended up cutting entire record in six non consecutive days they first entered atlantic studios that sunday night august 3 to get sounds band laid down album s openers don t want you no more and it s not my cross to bear as well as dreams which band set aside dreams had previously been recorded as a demo at macon s new studios in april on august 5 band cut black hearted woman and trouble no more and group completed whipping post after another day off on august 7 it took entirety of that day s session to complete recording despite fact that they had performed number countless times next day band attempted to record statesboro blues which was song that influenced duane allman to begin slide playing unable to achieve same energy as it would performed live band scrapped recording and session for day every hungry woman was recorded on august 11 and their last day in studio on tuesday august 12 produced a final version of dreams johanson remembered process as only taking four days we went in there played our asses off and that was it we were done in four days and they spent rest of time mixing said johanson although butch trucks recalls entire ensemble as comfortable with studio recording another source claims that johanson betts and oakley were unfamiliar with studio recording but nevertheless not intimidated they were out of their element in new york by a chap with an english accent said dowd of barber he spoke of barber s direction as perhaps intimidating or push push shove shove do what guy says and let s get out of here dreams which later gained regard among band members as high point of record was only song in which group got stuck due to duane allman s displeasure with his guitar solo performance captured on record came when duane instructed other members to turn off all lights in studio after day s session and sat in a corner beside his amp and baffle allman played slide guitar which was not employed in previous attempts and improvised overdubbed performance bringing all of members to tears it was unbelievable recalled trucks it was just magic it s always been that greatest music we played was from out of nowhere that it wasn t practiced planned or discussed during their tenure in new york group made their debut over three non consecutive nights at s in manhattan a club that would eventually become regarded within ensemble as their second home gregg allman felt band had rushed through their debut recording and was later unhappy with his vocal sound on record they were recorded with regular old tape echo heartbreak hotel setting he recalled barber disagreed with this assessment and not wanting to cause any quarrels allman backed away composition songs on album were largely arranged after gregg allman joined band in jacksonville florida in march 1969 most of songs were devised from longer impromptu jam sessions group s style evolved from a mix of jazz country music blues and rock which was result of each individual member turning others onto their particular interests trucks introduced johanson to grateful dead and rolling stones johanson likewise introduced group to jazz musicians such as miles davis and john coltrane and betts did same with country music and chuck berry duane allman had previously listened to davis and coltrane before johanson s suggestion and his two favorite songs coltrane s version of my favorite things and miles davis all blues were basis for majority of band s modal jamming without a lot of chord changes album opens with an instrumental a cover of spencer davis don t want you no more which had previously been employed on set lists of second coming oakley and betts former band allman and betts guitars perform in unison on a five note melody while johanson concentrates on his hi hat and song includes an organ solo song contains two guitar solos with latter coming in behind first one for a darting buildup that sound s like something taken from brahms it segues into a lazy blues shuffle titled it s not my cross to bear which allman had written in los angeles for a former lover black hearted woman also penned on same subject follows and album returns to a blues based sound with a cover of trouble no more featuring duane s debut bottleneck guitar performance songs such as black hearted woman and every hungry woman were written about allman s experiences with a girl named stacy in los angeles among most changed were two songs that would become basis for two of allman brothers most famed epic concert numbers dreams and whipping post oakley played a huge role in band s arrangements changing numbers such as whipping post from a ballad structure to a more hard rocking song dreams developed from a jam in which band toyed with theme to film 2001 a space odyssey and has been referred to by johanson as coltrane s my favorite things with lyrics johanson s drum fills were pulled from jimmy cobb s performance on all blues he later commented that he did a lot of copying but only from best dreams begins with intricate subdued drums playing under a soft organ with only hint of guitars before gregg begins singing about disillusionment and broken dreams final song on record whipping post was written shortly after allman returned to jacksonville song came to him shortly before bed but he was unable to acquire a pencil and paper to write down his ideas as there was a child asleep in room and he could not turn on lights turning to his next best alternative he struck two kitchen matches one for light and one later blown out as a charcoal writing utensil and wrote down his lyrics on a bedside ironing board whipping post was similar in composition to dreams in its first incarnation with oakley later creating heavy bassline that starts off track duane and betts take quick solos before track builds to an anguished climax leading to gregg allman s solo voice singing song s refrain good lord i feel like i m dyin allman had no idea intro was written in 11 4 time i just saw it as three sets of three and then two to jump on next three sets with until his brother pointed it out for him my brother told me i guess day i wrote it he said that s good man i didn t know you understood 11 4 of course i said something intelligent like what s 11 4 duane just said okay dumbass i ll try to draw it up on paper for you gregg allman s lyrical contributions to band s debut album have been called remarkably mature lyrical conceptions for such a young man expertly executed in a minimalist almost haiku style allman s inspiration came from his time in los angeles as a part of hour glass getting fucked by different land sharks in business experiencing great frustration among fierce competition traditional blues songs were likewise regarded as songs that were so good they couldn t be left off album on writing of record allman wrote in his memoir my cross to bear i wrote most of that whole first record in that one week i had total peace of mind l a and all its changes didn t even cross my mind i felt like i was starting all over which i was most of songs on album were written at rose hill cemetery artwork thumb gatefold album sleeve features band posing nude in a brook cover for album was taken by photographer stephen paley paley had gotten to know duane allman during photo shoots for atlantic paley stayed for about a week in macon with band partying with group they approached any areas about town that appeared photogenic such as fields old houses railroad tracks and cemetery front album cover photo was taken at entrance of college house now owned by mercer university next door at 315 college street back cover photo of album was taken at bond tomb at rose hill cemetery located at 1091 riverside drive in macon gatefold cover of vinyl lp features band posing nude in a brook shot was original manager phil walden s idea and brook was on his brother alan s property alan later recalled inner sleeve photo was taken in round oak georgia down behind my log cabin there which is also back of otis redding s big o ranch rolling stone editor jann wenner was present with boz scaggs whom he was producing at time they brought bubbles to cover themselves up but bubbles were washed away by stream trucks had sliced his leg open earlier that day requiring thirteen stitches and was unable to get in water he is standing behind oakley in shot walden suggested band take a few shots standing full frontal band was reluctant but he assured them they would never see light of day at their first performance at fillmore east that december trucks discovered full frontal shots were printed in a broadsheet alternative newspaper paley later said of cover shoot i never liked a band more i was one of them it was like being a rock star i hung out with a lot of rock stars but no one ever did that to same extent there was just an ease to whole thing they really were kindest most fun band i ever worked with release and reception allman brothers band was released in november 1969 through atco and capricorn records atco was a subsidiary label of atlantic records and walden had not even created a logo for capricorn records instead lp featured an atco label with a barely noticeable line reading capricorn records series record received a poor commercial response selling fewer than 35 000 copies upon initial release executives suggested to walden that he relocate band to new york or los angeles to acclimate them to industry they wanted us to act like a rock band and we just told them to fuck themselves remembered trucks for their part members of band remained optimistic electing to stay in south everyone told us we d fall by wayside down there said gregg allman but collaboration between band and capricorn records transformed macon from this sleepy little town into a very hip wild and crazy place filled with bikers and rockers band played shows along east coast in december 1969 attempting to kick start record onto billboard top 200 pop albums chart in january band performed at electric factory in philadelphia and fillmore west in san francisco before debuting at whisky a go go in los angeles representing first engagement there since their days in hour glass on third day of their whisky residency album logged at number 188 on top 200 enough to prove that abb was more than a regional outfit capricorn issued black hearted woman as album s single edited down to nearly two minutes shorter in an effort to place on top 40 radio despite ed och s rave review in billboard single failed to register on pop radio rather than employing standard cover shot for advertising campaign marketing rather emphasized nude group shot alongside a quote from och s billboard review describing group as a bad bunch of electric southern longhairs rolling stone lester bangs called album consistently subtle and honest and moving describing band as a white group who ve transcended their schooling to produce a volatile blues rock sound of pure energy inspiration and love a retrospective review from bruce eder at allmusic stated it might be best debut album ever delivered by an american blues band a bold powerful hard edged soulful essay in electric blues with a native southern ambience track listing all songs written
