colton point state park is a pennsylvania state park in tioga county pennsylvania in united states it is on west side of pine creek gorge also known as grand canyon of pennsylvania which is deep and nearly across at this location park extends from creek in bottom of gorge up to rim and across part of plateau to west colton point state park is known for its views of pine creek gorge and offers opportunities for picnicking hiking fishing and hunting whitewater boating and camping colton point is surrounded by tioga state forest and its sister park leonard harrison state park on east rim park is on a state forest road in shippen township south of u s route 6 pine creek flows through park and has carved gorge through five major rock formations from devonian and carboniferous periods native americans once used pine creek path along creek path was later used by lumbermen and then became course of a railroad from 1883 to 1988 since 1996 pine creek rail trail has followed creek through gorge pine creek gorge was named a national natural landmark in 1968 and is also protected as a pennsylvania state natural area and important bird area while pine creek is a pennsylvania scenic and wild river gorge is home to many species of plants and animals some of which have been reintroduced to area park is named for henry colton a williamsport lumberman who cut timber there starting in 1879 although pine creek gorge was clearcut in 19th and early 20th centuries it is now covered by second growth forest thanks in part to conservation efforts of civilian conservation corps ccc in 1930s ccc built facilities at colton point before and shortly after park s 1936 opening most of ccc built facilities remain in use and have led to park s listing as a historic district on national register of historic places since a successful publicity campaign in 1936 park and gorge have been a popular tourist destination attracting hundreds of thousands of visitors each year colton point state park was chosen by pennsylvania department of conservation and natural resources dcnr bureau of parks for its 25 must see pennsylvania state parks list which praised its spectacular vistas and a

susquehannocks they were a matriarchal society that lived in stockaded villages of large long houses and occasionally inhabited mountains surrounding pine creek gorge their numbers were greatly reduced by disease and warfare with five nations of iroquois and by 1675 they had died out moved away or been assimilated into other tribes after this lands of west branch susquehanna river valley were under nominal control of iroquois iroquois lived in long houses primarily in what is now new york and had a strong confederacy which gave them power beyond their numbers they and other tribes used pine creek path through gorge traveling between a path on genesee river in modern new york in north and great shamokin path along west branch susquehanna river in south seneca tribe of iroquois

quaker colonists in 1682 up to 90 percent of what is now pennsylvania was covered with woods more than of eastern white pine eastern hemlock and a mix of hardwoods forests near three original counties philadelphia bucks and chester were first to be harvested as early settlers used readily available timber and cleared land for agriculture by time of american revolution logging had reached interior and mountainous regions and became a leading industry in pennsylvania trees furnished fuel to heat homes tannin for state s many tanneries and wood for construction furniture and barrel making large areas of forest were harvested by colliers to fire iron furnaces rifle stocks and shingles were made from pennsylvania timber as were a wide variety of household utensils and first conestoga wagons thumb left pine creek lumber drive with arks for kitchen and dining left sleeping center and horses right railroad is on shore behind by early 19th century demand for lumber reached pine creek gorge where surrounding mountainsides were covered with eastern white pine in diameter and or more tall eastern hemlock in circumference and huge hardwoods each of these virgin forests produced of white pine and of hemlock and hardwoods for comparison same area of forest today produces a total of only on average according to steven e owlett environmental lawyer and author shipbuilders considered pine from pine creek best timber in world for making fine ship masts so it was first lumber to be harvested on a large scale original title to land that became colton point state park was sold to wilhelm wilkins company in 1792 pine creek was declared a public highway by pennsylvania general assembly on march 16 1798 and rafts of spars were floated down creek to susquehanna river then to chesapeake bay and shipbuilders at baltimore lumbermen would then walk home following old pine creek path at end of their journey as 19th century progressed fewer pines were left and more hemlocks and hardwoods were cut and processed locally by 1810 there were 11 sawmills in pine creek watershed and by 1840 there were 145 despite a flood in 1832 which wiped out nearly all mills along creek selective harvesting of pines was replaced by clearcutting of all lumber in a tract first lumbering activity close to what is now colton point was in 1838 when william dodge and partners built a settlement at big meadows and formed pennsylvania joint land and lumber company dodge s company purchased thousands of acres of land in area including what is now colton point state park in 1865 last pine spar raft floated down creek and on march 28 1871 general assembly passed a law which allowed construction of splash dams and allowed creeks to be cleared to allow loose logs to float better earliest spring log drives floated up to of logs in pine creek at one time these logs floated to west branch susquehanna river and to sawmills near susquehanna boom at williamsport log drives could be dangerous just north of park is barbour rock named for samuel barbour who lost his life on pine creek there after breaking up a log jam hemlock wood was not widely used until advent of wire nails but bark was used

with nyc allied lines in williamsport to southeast by 1896 rail line s daily traffic included three passenger trains and of freight in surrounding forests log drives gave way to logging railroads which transported lumber to local sawmills there were 13 companies operating logging railroads along pine creek and its tributaries between 1886 and 1921 while last log drive in pine creek watershed started on little pine creek in 1905 by 1900 leetonia logging railroad was extended to headwaters of fourmile run which has several high waterfalls that prevented logs from being floated down it in 1903 line reached colton point and bear run which is northern border of park today lumber on fourmile run that had been previously inaccessible was harvested and transported by train initially to leonard harrison s mill at tiadaghton when that mill burned in 1905 lumber went to leetonia mill on cedar run in elk township old growth forests were clearcut by early 20th century and gorge was stripped bare nothing was left except dried out tree tops which became a fire hazard as a result much of land burned and was left barren on may 6 1903 wellsboro newspaper had headline wild lands aflame and reported landslides through gorge soil was depleted of nutrients fires baked ground hard and jungles of blueberries blackberries and mountain laurel covered clearcut land which became known as pennsylvania desert floods swept area periodically and much of wildlife was wiped out conservation thumb left cabins on either side of fourmile run along pine creek as seen from leonard harrison

pennsylvania sears lived in wellsboro from 1844 until his death in 1890 and was first to describe pine creek gorge he also described a trip to what became leonard harrison state park and view west across gorge to what became colton point state park after a buggy ride he had to hike through tangles of fallen trees and branches down ravines and over banks for five hours at last he reached point which he wrote was jutting terminus of a high ridge which not only commands a capital view of opposite mountain but also of pine creek valley up and down for miles quoted in land on which colton point state park sits was sold to commonwealth in late 19th century for by pennsylvania joint land and lumber company which had no further use for it elsewhere in gorge state bought land abandoned by lumber companies sometimes for less than these purchases became tioga state forest which was officially established in 1925 as of 2015 state forest encompasses mostly in tioga county and surrounds colton point state park to north west and south leonard harrison state park is on eastern border of colton point in 1922 wellsboro lumber baron leonard harrison donated his picnic grounds on eastern rim of gorge to commonwealth of pennsylvania which named it leonard harrison state forest park harrison also built two cabins named and on west side of pine creek just north of mouth of fourmile run sometime after 1903 former pennsylvania governor william a stone built a cabin named heart s ease just south of mouth of fourmile run in 1966 these cabins were still standing and were three of only four man made structures inside canyon proper but by 1993 only stone s cabin and one of harrison s cabins remained as of 2004 these properties were still owned by stone family and are part of a small parcel of private land within park modern era thumb ccc built shelter 3 in park civilian conservation corps ccc started work on park in june 1935 and it opened as colton point state forest park in 1936 ccc founded by united states president franklin d roosevelt during great depression created jobs for unemployed young men from throughout united states much of work of ccc at colton point is still visible as of 2015 and is one of many examples of work of ccc throughout northcentral pennsylvania in 1936 year park opened larry woodin of wellsboro and other tioga county business owners began a tourism campaign to promote pine creek gorge as grand canyon of pennsylvania greyhound bus lines featured a view of canyon from a leonard harrison lookout on back cover of its atlantic coast timetable bus line s chicago to new york city tour had an overnight stay in wellsboro and a morning visit to canyon for 3 more than 300 000 tourists visited canyon by autumn of 1936 and 15 000 visited leonard harrison over memorial day weekend in 1937 that year more visitors came to pine creek gorge than to yellowstone national park in response to heavy use of local roads ccc widened highways in area and guides from ccc gave tours of canyon colton point originally opened with only limited facilities but success of tourism campaign led to park s expansion by ccc new facilities were added in 1938 and included buildings such as picnic pavilions latrines and a concession stand as well as stone cook stoves tables and developed trails and overlooks an amazing amount of work in one year ccc also built road to park and planted stands of larch spruce and white pine for reforestation on february 12 1987 entire park was listed in national register of historic places nrhp including eight buildings and nine structures park has five ccc built picnic shelters pavilions 1 3 and 4 are made of stone and timber with stone fireplaces while pavilions 2 and 5 each has log columns that support a pyramidal roof ccc also built six rustic latrines with clapboard siding and gable roofs and an underground reservoir that is covered with a low hipped roof additional structures constructed by ccc include three overlooks and a rectangular gable roofed maintenance building with wane edge siding and exposed rafters made of logs structures built by ccc are noteworthy in that they exemplify rustic style of construction that was prevalent at national and state parks built during great depression workers used locally found natural materials in construction that blended with natural surroundings note this includes not all of ccc s work has survived a concession stand was built by ccc and sold food and souvenirs from late 1930s to at least 1953 but was not listed on 1986 nrhp nomination form ccc also built a brick and stone incinerator but it is in ruins now thumb left upright this water fountain was built by ccc with native stone pennsylvania geographic board dropped word forest and officially named it colton point state park on november 11 1954 first major change in park was in 1970 when a camping area was established that same decade saw completion of a new water system in 1973 and a holding tank dump station was added to camping area in 1977 a park office was built in 1983 but as of 2009 park headquarters are in adjoining leonard harrison state park and colton point office does

colton point state park continued to attract national attention in post war era new york times featured park and its breath taking views of gorge as well as its trails and location in wilds of state forest in a 1950 article and in 1966 praised whitewater boating on pine creek and park s outstanding look out points pine creek gorge including colton point and leonard harrison state parks and a section of tioga state forest was named a national natural landmark nnl in april 1968 a 1973 new york times article on whitewater canoeing noted damage along pine creek done by hurricane agnes year before another times story in 2002 noted park for its beauty and wildlife and cited it as a starting point for hiking west rim trail in new millennium two state parks on either side of pine creek gorge are frequently treated as one a 2002 new york times article called colton point and leonard harrison state parks two state parks divided by a canyon and noted their overlooks offer most

pine creek and walls of gorge visible from opposite shoreline are also protected by state as a pennsylvania scenic river in 1968 pine creek was one of only 27 rivers originally designated as eligible to be included in national wild and scenic rivers system and one of only eight specifically mentioned in law establishing program before pine creek could be included in federal program state enacted its state scenic rivers act then asked that pine creek be withdrawn from national designation there was much local opposition to its inclusion based at least partly on mistaken fears that protection would involve seizure of private property and restricted access eventually this opposition was overcome but pennsylvania did not officially include it as one of its own state scenic and wild rivers until november 25 1992 state treated pine creek as a state scenic river between 1968 and 1992 it protected creek from dam building and water withdrawals for power plants and added public access points to reduce trespassing on private property by visitors to creek no isbn geology and climate although rock formations exposed in colton point state park and pine creek gorge are at least 300 million years old gorge itself formed about 20 000 years ago in last ice age pine creek had flowed northeasterly until then but was dammed by rocks soil ice and other debris deposited by receding laurentide continental glacier dammed creek formed a lake near what would later be village of ansonia and lake s glacial meltwater overflowed debris dam reversing flow of pine creek creek flooded to south and quickly carved a deep channel on its way to west branch susquehanna river thumb left looking north to barbour rock left and other rock outcrops in pine creek gorge park is at an elevation of on allegheny plateau which formed in alleghenian orogeny some 300 million years ago when gondwana specifically what became africa and what became north america collided forming pangaea although gorge and its surroundings seem to be mountainous area is a dissected plateau years of erosion have cut away soft rocks forming valleys and left hardest of ancient rocks relatively untouched on top of sharp ridges giving them appearance of mountains land on which colton point state park sits was once part of coastline of a shallow sea that covered a great portion of what is now north america high mountains to east of sea gradually eroded causing a buildup of sediment made up primarily of clay sand and gravel tremendous pressure on sediment caused formation of rocks that are found today in pine creek drainage basin sandstone shale conglomerates limestone and coal five major rock formations present in colton point state park are from devonian and carboniferous periods youngest of these which forms highest points in park and along gorge is early pennsylvanian pottsville formation a gray conglomerate that may contain sandstone siltstone and shale as well as anthracite coal low sulfur coal was once mined at three locations within pine creek watershed below this is late mississippian mauch chunk formation which is formed with grayish red shale siltstone sandstone and conglomerate millstones were once carved from exposed sections of this conglomerate together pottsville and mauch chunk formations are some thick next below these is late devonian and early mississippian huntley mountain formation which is made of relatively soft grayish red shale and olive gray sandstone this is relatively hard rock and forms many of ridges below this is red shale and siltstone of catskill formation about thick and some 375 million years old this layer is relatively soft and easily eroded which helped to form pine creek gorge cliffs formed by huntley mountain and catskill formations are visible north of park at barbour rock lowest and oldest layer is lock haven formation which is gray to green brown siltstone and shale over 400 million years old it forms base of gorge contains marine fossils and is up to thick allegheny plateau has a continental climate with occasional severe low temperatures in winter and average daily temperature ranges of 20 degf 11 degc in winter and 26 degf 14 degc in summer mean annual precipitation for pine creek watershed is highest recorded temperature at park was in 1936 and record low was in 1934 ecology thumb a log drive on pine creek clearcutting caused pennsylvania desert local extinction of many species and changes in seasonal stream flow descriptions from early explorers and settlers give some idea of what pine creek gorge was like before it was clearcut forest was up to 85 percent hemlock and white pine hardwoods made up rest of forest no isbn area was inhabited by a large number of animal species many of which have vanished by end of 20th century a herd of 12 000 american bison migrated along west branch susquehanna river in 1773 pine creek was home to large predators such as wolves lynx wolverines panthers fishers bobcats and foxes all are locally extinct except for last three as of 2007 area had herds of elk and deer and large numbers of black bears river otters and beavers in 1794 two of earliest white explorers to travel up pine creek found so many rattlesnakes on its banks that they had to sleep in their canoe further upstream insects forced them to do same virgin forests cooled land and streams creeks and runs flowed more evenly year round since centuries of accumulated organic matter in forest soil caused slow percolation of rainfall into them no isbn pine creek was home to large numbers of fish including trout but dams downstream on susquehanna river have eliminated shad salmon and eels once found here by blocking their migrations habitat for land animals was destroyed by clearcutting of forests but there was also a great deal of hunting with bounties paid for large predators state natural area and wildlife while colton point and leonard harrison state parks and parts of surrounding tioga state forest are now pine creek gorge national natural landmark it is their status as part of a pennsylvania state natural area that provides strongest protection for them within this natural area logging mining and drilling for oil and gas are prohibited furthermore only foot trail access is allowed in 1988 pennsylvania department of environmental resources precursor to dcnr described it as about 95 state owned and designated pine creek gorge natural area it is a place of unique geologic history and contains some rare plant communities an old growth hemlock stand active bald eagle
