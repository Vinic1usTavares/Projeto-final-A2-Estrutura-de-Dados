barbeyella minutissima is a slime mould species of order echinosteliales and only species of genus barbeyella first described in 1914 from jura mountains its habitat is restricted to montane spruce and spruce fir forests of northern hemisphere where it has been recorded from asia europe and north america it typically colonises slimy algae covered logs that have lost their bark and have been partially to completely covered by liverworts sporangia are roughly spherical up to 0 2 mm in diameter and supported by a thin stalk up to 0 7 mm tall after spores have developed walls of sporangia split open into lobes species is one of smallest members of myxogastria and is considered rare taxonomy and classification species was first described in 1914 by charles meylan on basis of a collection made at an altitude of from swiss jura in september year before meylan thought species warranted a new genus based on unique mode of dehiscence and makeup of capillitium genus was named for swiss botanist william barbey 1842 1914 it and genus together make up family studies of ultrastructure of sporocarps suggests that barbeyella occupies a systematic position intermediate between echinosteliales and characteristics thumb 320px right a sporangium b through e open sporangium b from side c and d from above e transparent peridium protoplasmodium a microscopic undifferentiated granular mass with a slime sheath is transparent and colourless a single sporangiophore fruiting structure is produced from protoplasmodium which is approximately one and a half times diameter of mature sporangia it acquires dark spots as it matures and centre of protoplasm later becomes dark then transparent and milk white protoplasmodium climbs along stem to top where first capillitium and peridium and finally spores are produced at room temperature this process lasts roughly one day long stemmed blackish brown or blackish purple barely translucent sporangia of barbeyella are spherical 0 15 to 0 2 mm in diameter and together with stem measure 0 3 to 0 7 mm long they are usually scattered on substrate but also often grouped in loose large colonies tissue upon which sporangiophore rests has a diameter of at least 0 7 mm although not visible on mosses it has a reddish brown color when growing on wood brownish black stem is up to 0 1 mm thick thinning to 5 um towards top and is filled with scrap material columella arising from stem tip matures at upper end at roughly half height of sporangiophore into 7 to 13 simple or occasionally bifurcated 1 to 4 um large dark brown capillitium strands usually individual occasionally in pairs these are firmly fused with lobed segments of peridium which are round in cross section when spores mature sporangium splits and empties into peridium towards base this prevents lobes of peridium from detaching and provides spore dispersal over a longer period similar to a dehiscing capsule sporangia are filled towards top with plasmatic granules which diminish increasingly towards base depending on size of plasmatic granules sporangia appear papillate or smooth mass of spores is blackish brown or brown if viewed under polarised light surface texture ranges from almost smooth to warty and spores measure 7 9 um in diameter material collected from oregon however varies from european material in several ways fruit body is brown branching of capillitium from columella differs having primary and secondary branches instead of radiating branches from an expanded tip spore mass is tan and individual spores measure 10 12 um habitat and distribution barbeyella minutissima is considered rare its habitat corresponds to mountainous spruce fir forests of northern hemisphere it is largely restricted to altitudes between occasionally appearing as low as sea level and as high as it has been found in europe finland germany switzerland poland romania latvia and russia in west and east north america washington oregon california and mexico north and south carolina and virginia in indian himalayas as well as in japan it is relatively common in fir forests on high altitude mexican volcanoes suggesting that air borne spore dispersal is effective ecology species grows only on slightly to heavily rotten and deadwood in coniferous forests in cool moist areas wood is about 40 to 100 overgrown with especially of genera nowellia or b minutissima has been found growing on liverwort although nowellia is main indicator for slime mould in addition to liverworts barbeyella is found socialised with algae it is assumed that protoplasmodium either algae or bacteria on their surface other myxogastria species are often found together with barbeyella especially and album is a fungus i e living on or within fruit bodies of that has been reported growing on specimens of b minutissima collected from north carolina references external links discover life images and description category myxogastria
