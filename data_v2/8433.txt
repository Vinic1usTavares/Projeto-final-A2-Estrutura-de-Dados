eysyslopterus is a genus of eurypterid an extinct group of aquatic arthropods eysyslopterus is classified as part of family adelophthalmidae only clade within derived advanced adelophthalmoidea superfamily of eurypterids one fossil of single and type species e patteni has been discovered in deposits of late silurian period ludlow epoch in saaremaa estonia genus is named after eysysla viking name for saaremaa and opterus a traditional suffix for eurypterid genera meaning wing species name honors william patten an american biologist and zoologist who discovered only known fossil of eysyslopterus eysyslopterus is a little known basal genus that was distinguished from rest of adelophthalmids by position near head margin of eyes different from rest of its relatives its carapace was parabolic approximately u shaped and with transverse deep furrows forming ornamentation with an estimated length of 8 cm 3 1 in eysyslopterus was a small eurypterid it lived in a nearshore lagoonal quiet community along other eurypterid species description left thumb size comparison of e patteni like other adelophthalmid eurypterids eysyslopterus was a small eurypterid total size of only known

length eysyslopterus is a little known eurypterid with only one specimen collected that only preserves prosoma head with no appendages limbs prosoma was rather broad with a parabolic approximately u shaped outline it was 19 5 millimetres 0 77 in long and 22 mm 0 87 in wide although anterior part of prosoma is not preserved fossil mold indicates a pointed portion posterior border was slightly convex a narrow rim surrounded lateral margins of carapace dorsal shield of prosoma prosoma surface was gently arched with central portion rather level eyes were reniform bean shaped and with a thin and light colored test external shield on its surface they measured 4 5 mm 0 18 in in length ocelli simple eyes were located in posterior half of prosoma and consisted of two circular spots posterior part was smooth but previous part had a distinctive ornamentation this ornamentation extended until end of eyes and was composed of transverse lines developed as deep furrows eysyslopterus was a basal primitive genus with respect to rest of adelophthalmids with eyes closer to margin than to ocelli suggesting that eyes migrated towards a central position from basal genera to adelophthalmus history of research thumb restoration of carapace of eysyslopterus patteni based on stormer s of 1934 eysyslopterus is only known from one single specimen and is therefore holotype amnh housed at american museum of natural history which preserves carapace this fossil was collected by american biologist and zoologist william patten during his extensive explorations at rootsikula formation in saaremaa estonia then part of soviet union during a meeting between patten and norwegian paleontologist and geologist leif stormer in 1932 stormer observed patten s private collection of eurypterids among which he recognized a carapace of a new unknown species he described it in 1934 as belonging to genus hughmilleria patteni named after patten who died months after meeting stormer noticed several differences between his new species and other hughmilleria species essentially shape of prosoma and form or position of eyes he also suggested a close relationship between h patteni and other species especially scottish species h lanceolata however in 1961 american paleontologist erik norman kjellesvig waering split hughmilleria in two subgenera h hughmilleria for species with large ovoid marginal eyes and h nanahughmilleria for small reniform intramarginal within margin eyes since h patteni fulfilled this condition it was referred to h nanahughmilleria it was not until 2008 when during a phylogenetic review of entire adelophthalmidae family by norwegian odd erik tetlie and german markus poschmann paleontologists n patteni was recognized as sufficiently different to represent its own genus due to anterior position of its eyes much more exaggerated than in other adelophthalmid genera first part of generic name is composed of word eysysla viking name for saaremaa and second part by opterus a suffix commonly used in eurypterids which means wing and therefore translated as wing of eysysla classification eysyslopterus is classified as part of family adelophthalmidae only clade group within superfamily adelophthalmoidea dunlop j a penney d jekel d 2018 a summary list of fossil spiders and their relatives in world spider catalog natural history museum bern e patteni was originally described as a species of genus hughmilleria but it was considered different enough to represent a new separate genus in 2008 eysyslopterus is considered to be most basal adelophthalmid genus due to position of its eyes these are placed closer to margin than to ocelli in contrast to any other in fact carapace of eysyslopterus and other basal genera belonging to superfamilies orcanopterus and herefordopterus were almost identical in orcanopterus eyes were separated from margin by marginal rim whereas in herefordopterus they were completely marginal a feature present in all pterygotioid genera in addition triangular anterior carapace margin present in eysyslopterus was shared with hughmilleria indicating that it might be a plesiomorphic trait a trait present in a common ancestor these characteristics have led some authors to question whether eysyslopterus really represents an adelophthalmid or sister taxon of a group formed by pterygotioidea and adelophthalmoidea but until more fossil material is found this can not be proven thumb restoration of related adelophthalmus type genus of adelophthalmidae cladogram below presents inferred phylogenetic positions of most of genera included in three most derived superfamilies of diploperculata infraorder of eurypterids adelophthalmoidea pterygotioidea and waeringopteroids as inferred by tetlie and poschmann in 2008 based on results of a 2008 analysis specifically pertaining to adelophthalmoidea and a preceding 2004 analysis paleoecology single known specimen of eysyslopterus has been recovered from silurian deposits of ludlow epoch of rootsikula formation of saaremaa estonia this formation was habitat of a fauna of eurypterids among them erettopterus laticauda e osiliensis eurypterus mixopterus and strobilopterus laticeps fossil remains of indeterminate osteostracid and thelodontid fishes have also been found habitat in which eysyslopterus lived is considered to be a nearshore lagoonal quiet
