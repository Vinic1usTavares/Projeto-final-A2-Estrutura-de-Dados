kootenay kootenai in u s and historically called flatbow is a major river in northwest plateau within borders of southeastern british columbia canada and northern montana and idaho in united states it is one of uppermost major tributaries of columbia river largest north american river that empties into pacific ocean kootenay river runs from its headwaters in kootenay ranges of canadian rockies flowing from british columbia s east kootenay region into northwestern montana then west into northernmost idaho panhandle and returning to british columbia in west kootenay region where it joins columbia at castlegar fed mainly by glaciers and snow melt river drains a rugged sparsely populated region of more than over 70 percent of basin is in canada from its highest headwaters to its confluence with columbia river kootenay falls more than in elevation above its confluence with columbia kootenay is comparable in terms of length drainage area and volume but has a steeper gradient and is characterized by larger falls and rapids part of lower kootenay forms kootenay lake one of biggest natural lakes in british columbia ktunaxa kootenai were first people to live along kootenay river for hundreds of years they hunted and fished on river quite isolated from neighboring indigenous groups in 19th century a canadian explorer david thompson became first recorded european to reach kootenay and established trading posts throughout region a gold rush on kootenay and later silver and galena strikes in its western basins in late 19th century drew thousands of miners and settlers to region who soon were followed by arrival of railroads and steamboats doukhobors a russian religious sect immigrated and established a short lived colony brilliant at kootenay s mouth subsequently dispersing into many settlements they contributed to region s timber and agricultural industries as with many pacific northwest rivers many dams were built on kootenay in 20th century to generate hydroelectricity and protect against floods and droughts today over of river have been impounded behind five dams and a sixth controls level of kootenay lake name river was described with slightly different names by two groups of local ktunaxa kootenai indian tribes these indigenous people who lived along upper river knew it as simply meaning river people along lower river called it a name whose meaning is not certain name flatbow river comes from name blackfeet used to call ktunaxa for their powerful stylish bows jenish p 139 and was later recorded by french canadian fur traders while searching for ultimate source of columbia river explorer david thompson encountered columbia lake where columbia river starts north as a small stream and kootenay rushes south already a powerful river already knowing from earlier maps that region included two rivers called columbia and kootenay thompson thought that what is now called columbia was kootenay and he thought that he had not yet found real kootenay thence he applied name mcgillivray s river to real kootenay in honor of his trading partners william and duncan mcgillivray jenish p 133 in his writings columbia from columbia lake to big bend was actually called kootenae burpee p lix name kootenai was also used by french canadians to refer to ktunaxa in 19th century kootenai is thought to be a word meaning water people in an algonquian language landers et al p 28 river is still referred to as kootenai in united states while in canada where two thirds of its length and 70 percent of its drainage basin lies river is spelled slightly different into kootenay comparisons of various u s geological survey usgs topographic maps from 20th century show many misinterpretations or alternative names being applied to segment of river within united states these include kootanie and geographic names information system of usgs lists swan river as an alternate name although origin of this name is uncertain there is however a

kootenay river s watershed is one of largest sub basins of columbia basin its drainage basin encompasses an area almost from north to south and from east to west roughly defining a region of pacific northwest known as kootenays kootenai subbasin plan introduction p 11 in canada term kootenays is loosely defined although kootenay land district which includes whole region is formally defined name indirectly refers to territory of kootenay indigenous people spanning from rockies on east and selkirks and purcells in u s on west in southeastern british columbia bc and is used to mean more area drained by kootenay river namely including lower canadian stretches of columbia from revelstoke to us border and also reaches of upper columbia north from canal flats at least as far as golden boundary country is sometimes referred to as being part of west kootenay over 70 percent of kootenay s watershed is in canada while montana and idaho portions occupy 23 and 6 respectively kootenay is one of few major rivers in north america that begin in one country cross into another and return to first others include milk river a tributary of missouri river river a tributary of assiniboine river

area geologic story of kootenay is strongly connected to geology of columbia selkirk and rocky mountains mountains in much of kootenay river catchment are composed of precambrian sedimentary rock of belt supergroup in turn stratified into several subgroups with slightly different characteristics and ages however most of rocks have one thing in common rocks are generally hard and erosion resistant kootenai subbasin plan introduction p 26 rocky mountain trench is thought to be a partial graben or a long narrow strip of land that has dropped in elevation over time because of parallel faults on both sides kootenai subbasin plan introduction p 27 faults in kootenay river watershed trend north northwest to south southeast as is common in much of british columbia underlying rock is generally stable and contains more outcroppings of metamorphic and igneous rock as one progresses westwards kootenai subbasin plan introduction p 28 formations of cambrian and devonian rock also appear in small amounts in u s portion of kootenay bedrock composes much of streambed in upper and lower reaches of kootenay but in middle portion alluvial sediments allow river to meander over a broader valley floor sediments probably originated through heavy glaciation during previous ice age about 15 000 years ago cordilleran ice sheet advanced southwards into present day bc montana and idaho blocking kootenay river at outlet of kootenay lake which did not yet exist glaciers covered most of northern kootenay river watershed and heavily shaped peaks and valleys one sees today glacier that formed kootenay lake caused river to back up into an enormous body of water that stretched all way to libby montana near where libby dam now stands and possibly even connected to lake pend oreille which also was much enlarged at time glacially deposited sediments buried old streambed of kootenay river and created a natural dam where kootenay turns west out of kootenay lake after glaciers retreated kootenay lake receded to its present level and kootenay flats were formed history first inhabitants thumb right kootenai group with circa 1900 first peoples of kootenay river valley residents at time of european contact were ktunaxa people often referred to as kootenai from whom river s name derives bc names entry kootenay river ktunaxa creation myths state that their people were created by supreme being and have always lived in region one reads i have created you kootenai people to look after this beautiful land to honor and guard and celebrate my creation here however linguistic and other evidence suggests that they are descended from great plains tribes that were driven out of their historic territory by blackfeet in 16th century ktunaxa are considered quite isolated from other pacific northwest and great plains tribes their language is an isolate which is only distantly related if at all to salishan languages spoken by tribes of lake pend d oreille area they were semi nomadic people and inhabited a large area of kootenay valley from headwaters to kootenay lake four villages provided their shelter in winter while in rest of year they traveled between fishing hunting and berry picking areas northern ktunaxa hunted buffalo while southerners mainly fished notably ktunaxa were first tribe west of rockies to capture and use feral european introduced horses for their own use miller p 10 origin and meaning of name kootenai is uncertain prior to their discovery by europeans they were known as people of standing arrow it is thought that french canadian fur trappers of hudson s bay company and other companies in early 19th century were first refer to them as kootenai which means water people in an algonquian language it may also mean deer robes referring to their excellent skill for hunting deer in some written records from early 19th century also by french ktunaxa were sometimes called arcs plats and river called flatbow river other inhabitants of area included montana salish in south and shuswap in north but these tribes were mostly not on main river exploration thumb right 1814 map of pacific northwest and central canada by david thompson kootenay river is shown near bottom left as mcgillivray s river in 1806 explorer david thompson set out from saskatchewan to find source of columbia he crossed over canadian rockies through howse pass and eventually arrived on banks of kootenay which he thought to be columbia thompson traveled down river a ways but turned back when he was attacked by native americans holbrook p 40 following year thompson his family and several men made another attempt at finding columbia they crossed over rockies at a more northerly spot and traveled down blaeberry river to columbia eventually discovering columbia lake and establishing there trading post kootenae house in spring of 1808 he set off down kootenay river this time reaching present day montana and idaho where he established house and house trading posts on lake pend oreille and clark fork respectively holbrook pp 41 42 after spending a winter in montana he tried to reach columbia by traveling down pend oreille river but failed in this attempt eventually returning to kootenae house via kootenay river northwards following spring holbrook p 43 thumb left falls of kootenay river below kootenay lake ca 1936 through early 19th century thompson continued to trade furs throughout kootenay region for north west company burpee p 48 and for few years when he had a total monopoly over canadian fur trade west of rockies he outlawed alcoholic drinks altogether he was known to have written i had made it a law to myself that no alcohol should pass mountains in my company holbrook p 41 42 when two of thompson s trading partners tried to make him take two barrels of rum to house thompson placed two kegs on a vicious horse and by noon kegs were empty and in pieces horse rubbing his load against rocks to get rid of it i told them what i had done and that i would do same to every keg of alcohol holbrook p 42 of course wine beer rum and other intoxicating drinks were imported in time john palliser crossed rockies through a pass in 1858 that led to headwaters of palliser river a tributary of kootenay river now named in his honor however at first his party referred to it as palliser s river his expedition made it downstream to columbia lake but had some trouble making their way back to alberta return route that they had chosen proved too dangerous to negotiate after trading for some horses and new supplies from a band of ktunaxa they made it back over rockies later that year through north kootenay pass near lower and upper lakes after traveling up elk river forgotten highways pp 131 134 series of expeditions he would later lead through 1859 were to be known as palliser expeditions or officially british north american exploring expedition which although involved some travel west of rockies was mostly limited to east side of continental divide palliser s earlier travels were credited for being a vital forerunner to european settlement of prairies of central canada providing volumes of information on resources of this vast region in september 1859 palliser traveled into kootenay river valley to find a suitable path for a trade route and possibly a railroad instead of crossing rockies as thompson did palliser set out from fort colville a hudson s bay company trading post near kettle falls on columbia river palliser p 13 he then proceeded up pend oreille river noted as and crossed into kootenay river valley which in his records was either kootanie or flat bow river palliser p 14 kootenay lake was called flat bow lake palliser was told by ktunaxa tribal members that a trail already existed along kootenay river terminating at columbia lake but was in decrepit condition having been out of use for many years and entirely impracticable for horses palliser p 15 they re blazed trail for many miles and returned to kootenay lake by mid october of same year palliser p 16 expedition s findings were later to become important transportation routes through rockies to kootenays area and trail that they followed later became route of canadian pacific railway brink p 135 gold and silver boom thumb 350px mining settlement of fort steele in 1910 in 1863 a gold strike at confluence of wild horse and kootenay rivers in east kootenay p 12 resulted in wild horse gold rush in which between three and ten thousand men descended upon area and gold rush town of fisherville was built it had to be moved when it was discovered town sat atop some of richest deposits originally river and area were known as stud horse by early miners but government officials changed it to wild horse new town s site was officially named kootenai though still known as fisherville also spelled kootenay and and also known as wild horse galbraith s ferry was established across kootenay near fort steele to facilitate crossing by incoming rush of prospectors and merchants most of gold was mined out by 1864 in june of which one american prospector wrote that some 200 miners were arriving each day by 1865 peak of rush was over and diggings had been found not as rich as previously believed when news arrived in 1865 of strikes in big bend of columbia and bulk of mining population moved there en masse fisherville which had a hudson s bay post and other businesses continued on with a few hundred residents for a few years most of them chinese by end as was case with many other bc gold towns also but was eclipsed as a supply centre with creation of nearby fort steele chinese miners continued to work played out claims abandoned by american and canadian miners taking what little gold was left fisherville eventually was abandoned its buildings left to ruin and little remains of settlement today other gold rushes on moyie and goat rivers tributaries of kootenay were followed by discovery of silver and galena mines in kootenay lake and slocan valley areas silvery slocan leading rapidly to settlement of region and creation of various silver city boomtowns notably nelson at outlet of kootenay lake midway up its north arm new denver silverton slocan city and in 1880s and 1890s by 1889 a smelter had been constructed close to mouth of kootenay near revelstoke to process ore from mines basque p 68 serving mines and settlers steamer companies plied kootenai river from bonners ferry idaho to nelson and to lardeau or district at north end of kootenay lake and also on upper kootenay river between cranbrook fort steele area and points in montana steamboats thumb j d farrell and north star on kootenay at jennings montana when canadian pacific railway cpr finished its transcontinental line across southern british columbia steamboats began to ply upper columbia and kootenay rivers carrying passengers produce ore and other trade items through region to be distributed via cpr s line at golden total run was about long ranging from golden to north to jennings montana in south with a portage at canal flats kootenay s steamboat era was short and lasted for only about 28 years holbrook p 164 in 1882 as part of an incentive to help navigation on golden jennings run and possibly divert water northwards to interior of british columbia in order to provide flood control for a low lying area south of kootenay lake called kootenay flats european adventurer william adolf baillie grohman proposed creation of a canal between kootenay river and columbia lake basque p 80 construction of long broad channel was finished in 1889 baillie grohman canal as it was called had one lock which was long and wide holbrook p pp 75 77 because of rugged terrain and rough waters on two rivers especially on glacier fed kootenay steamboat operation was extremely difficult and proved to be anything but cost effective roughest water was in jennings canyon now mostly submerged in lake koocanusa reservoir behind libby dam two of first steamers duchess and cline both sank when transporting miners to wild horse gold rush on kootenay both ships had not even reached canal flats when they hit rocks in columbia holbrook p 167 first steamboat to actually run kootenay was in 1893 later vessels such as gwendoline had mixed success captain frank p armstrong who had piloted several earlier steamboats on golden jennings run was her builder and when she was about three quarters completed armstrong decided to take her to golden to complete job gwendoline sailed up to canal which unfortunately was unusable because gates of lock had been dynamited due to a kootenay flood armstrong was forced to portage vessel and eventually made it to golden gwendoline eventually sailed back south to jennings to haul iron ore on kootenay holbrook p 169 she was also only ship to ever travel through canal by proper means and made two of only three steamboat trips through canal last ship ever to pass through canal and one of last on kootenay was north star also piloted by captain armstrong in 1902 armstrong decided to take north star to sail on columbia instead finding business on kootenay less and less profitable as mines in region played out as cpr established its kootenay central railway branch and for a variety of other reasons holbrook pp 170 171 in june of that year armstrong took north star to baillie grohman canal which was in decrepit condition lock was also too small to accommodate vessel armstrong had two makeshift dams built to create a temporary lock long and then forward dam was blown up so ship could ride surge of water ahead into columbia lake holbrook pp 171 172 transit of north star to columbia lake was last time canal was ever used by a steamboat and marked end of steamboat era on kootenay doukhobor settlement in 20th century members of a russian religious sect called doukhobors living in plains of saskatchewan in central canada were facing persecution internal problems and land confiscation by canadian government their leader peter verigin decided to move them to british columbia in 1909 seeking land and an improved life holbrook pp 196 198 he chose a townsite on north bank of kootenay where it joins columbia across big river from where present day town of castlegar now stands holbrook p 199 in 1909 he purchased about adjoining mouth of kootenay river partly using funds raised by sale of farm equipment in saskatchewan and added to other lands acquired throughout bc doukhobor owned lands ultimately totaled there was already a small settlement on site called waterloo but verigin renamed it brilliant for sparkling waters of river whole area was known by name meaning valley of consolation by 1913 there were already more than 5 000 doukhobors living in region thumb left peter verigin left and group of followers in glade british columbia circa 1907 when they first arrived in british columbia doukhobors began felling trees in kootenay river valley to build their first homesteads they also cleared areas of level ground in order to plant orchards and fields and constructed sawmills on columbia and kootenay rivers to process logs into lumber after more settlers began arriving they built larger buildings that housed multiple families instead of small cabins then typical of region each larger house or dom holding 70 100 persons each was constructed on roughly plots of land that verigin had divided entire community into back in 1911 doukhobors then constructed a brick factory at present day site of grand forks from where they made bricks to be used mostly in brilliant settlement brilliant was one of first cities in area to have running water a reservoir was constructed to hold water from kootenay river and a local spring holbrook p 200 and by 1912 each household had running water in 1913 verigin converted an abandoned factory in nelson about up kootenay from brilliant to produce jam and marmalade doukhobors then established a ferry across columbia river and a suspension bridge serving same purpose was completed in 1913 for many years brilliant continued to be a major center in region s lumber industry thumb verigin memorial however doukhobor views on education and extremist actions of a doukhobor group called sons of freedom eventually spelled end of their settlement in 1920s unknown arsonists destroyed several public schools in brilliant as an act against british columbia law holbrook p 202 then in 1924 on a routine rail trip to grand forks peter verigin and seven other people were killed by a dynamite explosion that completely destroyed coach that he was traveling in pieces of battery and alarm clock indicated that this was work of people who intentionally wanted to kill verigin holbrook pp 204 205 most likely members of sons of freedom or as some historians put it by lover of one of verigin s handmaidens over 7 000 people attended verigin s funeral doukhobor leader was buried in an elaborate tomb on a headland overlooking city of brilliant and kootenay and columbia rivers verigin was succeeded by his son peter p verigin who arrived from russia in 1927 despite economic reforms he created in response to debt to federal government his arrival coincided with a terrible depression and bankruptcy which caused doukhobors to lose most of their lands verigin jr died in 1939 and by 1963 almost all doukhobor lands were sold to government today little remains of former settlement at brilliant except for verigin s tomb holbrook pp 206 207 doukhobor suspension

basin in this article denotes any parts of columbia river watershed that drain to columbia upstream of where it crosses canada us border regardless if tributary passes through united states as well such as kootenay under this usage for example kootenay which originates in canada flows back to us and returns to canada is considered part of canadian portion whereas okanogan river which begins in canada but joins columbia in us is not part of canadian portion clark fork pend oreille system whose watershed is almost entirely within united states is considered part of canadian portion because pend oreille meets columbia just north of border there are 447 species of terrestrial vertebrates most of kootenay basin lies within columbia glaciated ecoregion which encompasses much of northeastern washington northern idaho northwestern montana and southern british columbia fish fauna in region are largely shared with those of columbia unglaciated ecoregion to south which has about fifty species of fish and only one endemic species there are no endemic fish within columbia glaciated region itself riparian vegetation is mostly found along lower two thirds of kootenay and many of tributaries that join within united states other sections of river flow through far more rugged terrain and are characterized by braiding low nutrient content shifting channels and coarse sediments making it difficult for riparian zones to be established as is with most of its upper and lower tributaries characterization of biomes p 89 92 wetlands are found primarily where river broadens into a series of sloughs side channels marshes and small lakes before entering kootenay lake this biologically diverse area kootenay flats once supported over 1 million migratory birds every year before river was diked and many of wetlands converted to agriculture naturally kootenay has a high sediment content because of high erosion of glacial sediments in mountains because of steep rapids and falls between kootenay lake and river s mouth kootenay with exception of its tributary slocan river has never been a significant stream for annual runs of columbia river salmon however landlocked salmon inhabit upper reaches of river above and in kootenay lake columbia p 8 this is attributed to a kootenay river flood a long time ago before construction of any dams on columbia columbia river dams now block salmon from reaching any of salmon run streams above chief joseph dam which overflowed into columbia lake it was with creation of this temporary body of water that salmon somehow managed to swim over submerged canal flats and into kootenay where they became trapped populations of large land mammals such as caribou moose deer elk have been declining dramatically since reintroduction of wolves species almost entirely gone that were once common in area include white tailed jackrabbit pygmy short horned lizard band tailed pigeon and passenger pigeon after exploitation of kootenay basin by fur trappers beaver population was nearly exterminated as well fish and wildlife communities p 181 182 economy thumb 1887 illustration of logging at canal flats british columbia even before non aboriginal people came to region kootenay river valley was an important path of trade and transport between tribes of canadian rockies and idaho panhandle mostly between ktunaxa who practiced agriculture and aquaculture and salish blackfeet and pend d of south and east and with shuswap in north physiographic continuation of kootenai valley southwards from present day bonners ferry idaho into pend oreille basin via purcell trench formed a natural corridor through which natives of area could interact barrier formed by rocky mountains to east however meant that tribes of area especially ktunaxa were economically and linguistically isolated from great plains tribes with exception of shoshone whose territory spanned both sides of rockies logging began in 19th century as a result of white emigration to kootenay region and remains one of primary industries of area in fact much of economy of pacific northwest and columbia basin has historically been and continues to be to this day dependent on lumber industry lumber was required for construction of buildings forts railroad tracks and boats and today is exported from region in great amounts providing jobs and income for inhabitants of area even in relatively uninhabited regions of watershed logging roads criss cross hills and mountainsides over 90 percent of kootenay basin is forested but only about 10 percent of area is not affected by some kind of lumber industry development now defined as about twenty roadless areas or blocks with 18 in us to a limited extent kootenay river has also been used for navigation commercial navigation began with steamboats in 19th century to transport ores lumber passengers and other imported and exported products between kootenay river valley and canadian pacific railway station at golden british columbia boat travel on upper river ceased when a rail line was built along kootenay upstream of big bend steamboats also operated briefly on lower river and kootenay lake to service silver mines in nearby mountains in modern times boats continue to ply kootenay lake and limited reaches of kootenay river mining is also an important economic support of kootenay river area although originally valuable minerals such as gold and silver were unearthed today coal is primary resource extracted from underground conventional coal deposits underlie much of east kootenay especially in elk river valley which is home to elk valley coalfield and crowsnest coalfield in purcell mountains east kootenay is most important coal producing area of british columbia has since 1898 produced over 500 million tons and about 25 percent of world s steel making coal comes from region most of coal from east kootenay coalfields is exported to japan and korea thumb river a headwater of kootenay river in kootenay national park lead zinc copper and silver are still mined at some places in kootenay river basin notably at giant sullivan mine near kimberley british columbia which is largest in kootenay watershed agriculture however is a much less important industry and many of fertile riverside lands have been flooded by construction of dams most notably libby dam in montana which backs water into canada only about two percent of entire kootenay basin is used for agriculture and much of that is for pasture and foraging crops such as oats barley and wheat account for 62 percent of agricultural output of region much of which is used locally or exported by rail primary agricultural region is kootenai valley of northern idaho just south of kootenay lake west kootenay however is transitioning from a coal mining to a tourism based economy and rest of kootenay region is also starting to do so economy of southeastern british columbia is becoming increasingly reliant on tourism and several canadian national and state parks have already been established and several national forests in u s river modifications thumb left map highlighting major dams and reservoirs in kootenay river watershed and surrounds dams power plants and diversions of kootenay river of which there are many have been built for a variety of reasons throughout 19th and 20th centuries seven dams on kootenay serve many purposes ranging from generation of local electricity to regulation of columbia river flow between canada and united states none provide for navigation or fish passage in former times kootenay would rise each spring and early summers with enormous freshets that every summer flood kootenay river valley burpee p xlvi but because of water regulation nowadays such extreme variation in flow are no longer common on lower river below libby dam falls as early as 1898 without building a dam original lower bonnington power plant was generating hydroelectricity from bonnington falls in kootenay river near confluence of slocan river in order to supply water to mines in rossland british columbia for upper bonnington first dam built on river original goal was to improve navigation between kootenay lake and kootenay s mouth on columbia by drowning dangerous falls rapids that also blocked fish migration and hopefully introducing fish to upper river by constructing a fish ladder none of these amenities for steamboats or salmon were ever constructed in fact dam ended up being built above falls instead of below them and upper bonnington dam when completed in 1906 only generated hydroelectric power and has served that purpose ever since commercial demand led to two more dams at falls these were south slocan dam in 1928 and corra linn dam at rapids above bonnington in 1932 three of dams are of run of river type 4 5 km length of falls is now impounded in small lakes all except corra linn which was built to raise and regulate level of kootenay lake kootenay canal generating station completed in 1976 by bc hydro has its inlet at kootenay lake next to corra linn canal travels several kilometers parallel to and above river to utilize roughly high water drop in elevation between kootenay lake and south slocan bypassing old dams canal is used to generate hydroelectricity as are four dams lower river after falls and junction with slocan river last of river is a gradual slope to merger with columbia in 1944 last privately owned development brilliant dam was built just before kootenay river flows into columbia river at castlegar columbia river treaty thumb duncan dam on duncan river regulates water flow into kootenay lake as part of columbia river treaty thumb stanley peak in kootenay national park thumb kootenay lake columbia basin is noted for its spring floods major flood years were 1876 1894 1948 and 1964 as recently as mid 1960s upper columbia and kootenay rivers in british columbia were still free flowing and unaffected by dams and reservoirs resulting in 1948 vanport oregon flood uncontrolled discharge past canada u s border created problems for electricity generation in us and canada also wanted to utilize columbia river for production of hydroelectric power negotiated in 1961 between governments of two countries columbia river treaty attempted to ratify these problems construction of first three of four dams authorized by treaty mica keenleyside and duncan was implemented in 1964 of four dams first two are on columbia third is on duncan river a tributary of kootenay and fourth libby on kootenay river proper however operation of dams has led to environmental problems in both rivers because they have caused unnatural flow fluctuations blocked fish migration flooded fertile agricultural land and forced over 2 000 people to relocate solely built for purpose of regulating water flow into kootenay lake duncan dam first dam built for treaty was raised in 1967 and increased long size of duncan lake to a reservoir long because of its purpose it has no power generation facilities libby dam fourth and last dam built under treaty was completed in 1975 by u s army corps of engineers it is first of dams that kootenay encounters durings its journey and provides further regulation of water that flows into kootenay lake other two dams built for treaty keenleyside and mica are both on columbia river kootenay basin reservoirs provide nearly of storage which constitutes almost half of stored in columbia river treaty reservoirs diversion proposal in 1970s it was proposed that kootenay river be diverted into columbia river two rivers are separated by a distance of no more than near canal flats in rocky mountain trench in southeastern british columbia this would allow for generation of increased hydroelectric power on columbia it would also make easier reclamation of kootenay flats an area south of kootenay lake for agricultural purposes spring freshets once raised level of lake by up to inundating lowlands around it basque p 81 there were also never implemented plans to divert part of kootenay enlarged columbia river through a tunnel to headwaters of thompson river in northwest and thence to fraser river valley of southwestern british columbia columbia p 325 proposal was strongly opposed by both environmentalists as well as local residents economy of southeastern british columbia is strongly dependent on tourism with columbia river including columbia lake and windermere lake being very popular for summer swimming and boating activities diversion of glacier fed kootenay river would have resulted in columbia river becoming much deeper and colder flooding riverside communities and damaging tourism at opposite end of scale it would dry bed of kootenay river downstream of canal flats cutting off water supply to residents of upper kootenay valley and invalidating effectiveness of libby dam whose construction was to begin in a few years as a result this proposed river diversion was never undertaken columbia p 326 recreation many national provincial and state parks wilderness preserves protected areas and national forests lie partially or wholly

known swinging bridge across kootenai reach trail on lower river is about long running from brilliant to glade further downstream five separate sites around kootenay lake form kootenay lake provincial park west arm provincial park is on impounded stretch of kootenay river just west of kootenay lake and to northeast of nelson smaller kokanee creek provincial park one of more popular recreation areas in west kootenay sits across river from west arm fishing is generally good on middle reaches of kootenay river and in kootenay lake cutthroat trout bull trout kokanee salmon landlocked pacific salmon rainbow trout and white sturgeon are among many species found in river kokanee and rainbows are commonly found in lake koocanusa kootenai falls which drops some within a run of a few hundred meters forms a natural boundary between fishes of upper and lower river but libby dam several kilometres upstream is an even more formidable barrier fish in kootenay have traditionally been abundant but construction of dam may have led to declines in population of sturgeon among other fishes because of changes in water flow best season for fishing is from june to november one may fish from banks sandbars and islands or from boats because of size and strength of river fishing from drift boats is easier than from shore also because kootenay s primary sources are glaciers fishing conditions are quite different from most rivers in montana and idaho which are fed by snowmelt in united states kootenay with its exceptional trout fishing is considered a blue ribbon fishery thumb boathouses on kootenay lake near balfour british columbia steep and strewn with rapids kootenay despite being unsuitable for commercial transportation of agricultural and mineral products is considered an outstanding whitewater river whitewater rafting is popular on kootenay in two stretches in jennings canyon between libby dam in montana and bonners ferry in idaho and in upper reaches of river in kootenay national park in british columbia rafting middle kootenay between libby dam and bonners ferry is best at flows of run about from east to west includes class iv rapids and includes kootenai falls which rarely has been run safely in middle of its course in montana river is rated a class i water under montana stream access law for recreational purposes from libby dam to montana idaho border class i represents bodies of water that are navigable and suitable for recreation rafting is also popular in some of canadian stretches of river especially those near headwaters that have steepest gradient and most challenging rapids several canadian outfitters provide trips on river near kootenay national park ranging from a few hours to several days canoeing in numerous sloughs side channels and distributaries of kootenay that thread through wetlands of kootenay flats has additional benefit of watching birds and wildlife in creston valley wildlife management unit and other
