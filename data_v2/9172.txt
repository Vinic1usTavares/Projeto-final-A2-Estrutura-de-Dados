fit into neat social racial or economic categories with its characters not fitting into any traditional stereotypes style thumb alt two screenshots from film showing ishak pahing nino fernandez at his marriage to nani kuddus imelda soraya bottom is sakera yama carlos at his marriage to maida atiqah hasiholan both are in a muslim manner ruma maida uses a sepia overlay and static camera for events happening in past with more natural tones and different angles for events in present some plot points such as marriages between ishak and nani top as well as sakera and maida bottom run parallel ruma maida uses colours and shooting styles to indicate different time periods past events have a soft sepia overlay and are shot with a static camera while those in 1998 have more natural tones and are shot with a handheld use of handheld was meant to show present in as rough and non sterile a manner possible while past was meant to have a sweet beautiful and clean feeling this played on theme of romanticising past events in pahing s life are shown in flashbacks interspersed throughout maida s struggle to retake house film is paced slowly and shots are taken from unique angles in tempo
