seal containing their physical forms allowing two minerans to return to them group escape mysticete with lithia who explains that in an effort to stop warring on minera creed lithia and her sister fluora created gardenia a xerom capable of remotely absorbing spirias though intended to quell violent thoughts in population gardenia went berserk when activated and absorbed every spiria on minera planet lithia creed too once desired peace although thing he created in that service was an abomination queen of all xeroms savior system capable of absorbing spirias from afar you know her as gardenia black moon white moon was not always white once it was a vibrant blue planet and our home world of minera but 2000 years ago creed and i activated gardenia and in process caused our own planet to we thought we were doing right we only wanted to remove seeds of war from our people s spiria but we made a horrible mistake our world was doomed instant we set gardenia in motion fluora used herself to seal gardenia away and when creed attempted to free fluora lithia interfered causing both to be separated from their physical forms since then they have been living in organican hosts and battling each other for two millennia creed who still believes minerans are alive within gardenia intends to undo fluora s work and rebuilding minera at cost of organica and its people lithia having expelled each other s spirias from our physical bodies creed and i existed in organican hosts for millennia changing hosts over countless generations we waged a secret and endless war for control of gardenia hisui so what s creed plan now he s got his little science project off and running again lithia creed believes that spiria of all minerans are alive within gardenia he also believes that fluora is alive despite her sacrificing herself to beast so she might escape he intends to reactivate gardenia and resurrect my sister along with our entire planet in aftermath kohaku and kor find out how lithia and creed ended up inside them eighteen years before creed and lithia were respectively in bodies of zirconia then ruler of maximus empire and iola hearts kohaku s mother iola faced zirconia with a group of somatics that included sydan and kor s mother kardia who was then carrying him during their final battle iola s spiria was shattered forcing lithia to transfer herself into unborn kohaku s spiria and creed was forced to abandon his host leaving zirconia emotionally scarred creed attempted to possess kardia s child but with help from unborn kor she succeeded in sealing creed away with kor s help at cost of her spiria kardia stay away from my kid bastard you haven t seen dangerous until you ve run into an angry mother creed impressive but without your friends it will take more than a flimsy seal to contain me wh what s this where is this new power coming from h how why kardia aw did you help mommy good to know i have a kid who listens unlike me heh that seal was just patchwork though it won t be holding him forever sorry kid mommy tried her best though kor is initially disheartened by these revelations kohaku helps bring him round kor you remember gramps last words right do not hate to not succumb to anger in heat of battle i screwed that up about as badly as a guy can now creed s back to destroy world and it s my fault xerom despir creed it all comes back to me everyone would be better off if i died kohaku that s not true because you re alive i was able to meet you and meeting you has made me happy even darkest place has a little bit of light you taught me that with creed controlling mysticete and xerom attacking people across planet group along with peridot and pyrox manage to unite disputing factions of maximus empire with world now united against xerom they set off to find means of turning chalcedony s wing based soma into an airship for their use in gathering final component inside an active volcano incarose attacks them and group are forced to leave peridot and pyrox to die after this lithia is shown to be dying as her spiria is in a severely weakened condition but she resolves to live until her mission is complete kunzite this phenomenon is preliminary stage of calcification hisui your spiria s that far gone lithia i had no idea lithia i trust you two can keep it a secret hisui but lithia i will not perish so easily not before i ve sealed gardenia away once and for all during their first assault on mysticete group are repelled and end up on minera finding their way to a transport tower that can take them to gardenia they have a final confrontation with incarose who is defeated and forced to provide power for their journey at cost of her life reaching gardenia two are unable to prevent creed from freeing fluora and activating gardenia gardenia instantly absorbs fluora and creed fuses with it in an attempt to gain control over it when he is defeated kor and kohaku together with his friends and still living mineran spirias destroy gardenia then escape as creed dies with gardenia after learning that minerans have a chance of being reborn kunzite saves dying lithia by sealing her inside his spiria and entering a comatose state kunzite looped time within his nexus replaying day of minera s calcification over and over therefore it is logical to assume that i can control time within my nexus as well if i can replay time i can stop it and if master lithia sleeps in such a state she can live on closing narration there lies a princess fair and dear who has slept for over a thousand years amidst a bramble of thorny spires love of friends is a radiant beam and to them she grants a sword of dreams an ebony moon by hero slew an ivory moon to be born anew whale of legend still does fly but now it is a star in dark night sky to soothe sleep of you and i princess dreams in her forest of thorns prayers of people her heart warms she is protected by her metal knight as two stars shine out eternal light and she is always dreaming dreaming her world will awaken after this rest of group return to kor s home village where kor and kohaku confirm their love for each other development hearts began development in winter of 2006 while debugging was being performed on playstation 2 remake of tales of destiny though active development did not begin until spring following year production was headed by hideo baba producing his first original tales game and development team was made up of members from both team symphonia team behind 3d entries in series and team destiny responsible for 2d titles multiple development assets were borrowed from destiny remake for use in hearts earliest form of game was as a ds remake of destiny game s characteristic genre name a recurring feature of series in japan was which represented core theme of people s hearts meeting and uniting to overcome difficulties in their lives characters were designed by regular tales series designer mutsumi inomata inomata worked on designs while she was also working on character designs for tales of innocence and found it hard working on both titles at once characters names were inspired by various ores and gemstones more conventional names were repeatedly suggested and rejected despite being third tales title on nintendo ds after tales of tempest and innocence it was first to be produced by namco tales studio and thus it was an unusual experience for development team according to director naoto one of most difficult aspects was creating a suitable interface and fitting game s content on limited hardware which required a trial and error programming process during early phases team considered ways of using ds touch screen during battles but this was eventually scrapped and final game made little to no use of feature production i g created anime cutscenes while shirogumi ltd created cgi cutscenes for a separate edition of game cgi cutscenes were worked on by a three person team including company director manabu koike three worked closely with development team to make sure cutscenes fit properly into game and that they did justice to inomata s character designs despite different animation style one issue they had was lip synching dialog to cgi character models main reason behind creation of cgi cutscenes was that team wanted to try something new attempting to sell two versions of games hearts was released as two separate game editions anime edition featuring cutscenes by production i g and cg movie edition using shirogumi cutscenes after release it was determined that cgi cutscenes were less popular with fans speaking to siliconera after game s release baba said that it was tales game he most wanted western players to try out due to its story and technical achievements hearts r hearts r was primarily developed by japan based developer 7th chord with staff from in house development studio bandai namco studios helping with development game was a complete remake of hearts featuring full voice acting for main scenario new playable characters 3d graphics and over ten new anime cutscenes created by production i g in addition to anime edition cutscenes already present due to poor reception of cg edition by fanbase it was decided not to use cgi cutscenes again it was given an altered genre name staff of game also had differences hironori naoi replaced as director while takashi yota also known under alias ryuji odate and mika murakita produced game in place of baba inomata returned as character designer concept behind hearts r was to leave base story and theme intact while building on and improving it using development of innocence r as a template it was developed alongside innocence r and many staff overlapped on projects naoi joined team in early 2012 after finishing work on tales of heroes twin brave and was principle developer for new combat system in middle of development chase link system was added based on a similar gameplay mechanic from innocence r naoki scenario writer for hearts returned to co write extra story content with maeda for rebuilt battle system team were asked by baba to create a sense of speed when compared with original along with gameplay and story additions two new playable characters were introduced chalcedony and new character gall gruner chalcedony originally an antagonist in hearts was included in playable cast to fully explore character s relationship with kor gall was originally conceived as a woman but at a suggestion from murakita for a mature leader figure for group gall was changed to a man s design was based on a picture of yota wearing sunglasses narrative connection to innocence r was initially unplanned but positive fan reception prompted team to add it in audio hearts soundtrack was composed by veteran tales composer motoi sakuraba hiroshi tamura and shinji tamura as hibiki aoyama official soundtrack album tales of hearts original soundtrack was published by bmg japan on two compact discs on december 10 2008 in addition to original soundtrack a special disc of selected arranged tracks titled tales of hearts cg

perfectly on handheld system while kimberley wallace of game informer said that pace and various features help keep battles exciting andrew fitch of electronic gaming monthly was more mixed about gameplay citing combat as a less smooth experience compared to previous tales titles and being annoyed at reintroduction of random encounters a feature not present in original hearts story received a generally mixed response beck found characters to be a mixed assortment being particularly unimpressed with kohaku s condition through most of game and stating that her awkward romance with kor almost feels forced wallace referred to storyline as cheesy and campy stating that it didn t impress her despite it not being taken very seriously mccarrol was unimpressed by story or cast while macgregor cited story as a slow burn though commenting that cast succeeded in seeming like real people rather than character archetypes in contrast with other reviewers fitch generally enjoyed story calling it one of stronger casts and narratives of recent tales titles localization received some criticism over discrepancies between english text and japanese dialogue with fitch describing it as written with an ultimately canceled english dub in mind and mccarrol citing renaming of some characters despite presence of original japanese as a downside macgregor while not minding setup was concerned that lack of an english option would cause controversy todd ciolek of anime news network listed game as second most overlooked title from 2014 stating that its release mediums and close proximity to release of
