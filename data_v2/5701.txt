television and new york dolls and was branded as being in a class of its own while elizabeth wurtzel wrote in new yorker that pretty on inside is such a cacophony very few people are likely to get through it once let alone give it repeated listenings it needs for you to discover that it s probably most compelling album to have been released in 1991 simon reynolds of new york times described album as a cauldron of negativity band grind s out torturous sound vaguely redolent of black sabbath ms love s songs explore full spectrum of female emotions from vulnerability to rage songs are fueled by adolescent traumas feelings of disgust about body passionate friendships with women and desire to escape domesticity her lyrical style could be described as emotional q called album loud ugly and deliberately shocking awarding it three out of five stars spin noted in their review album revolves around a fascination of repulsive aspects of l a superficiality sexism violence and drugs love is embodiment of what drives band dichotomy of pretty ugly pretty ugly dynamic also comes across in hole s music a song like teenage whore at first comes across like a ranting noisy rage but underneath is a surprisingly lush melody melody maker columnist sharon o connell said album was very best bit of fucked up rock n roll i ve heard all year and it was named one of 20 best albums of year by spin in december 1991 deborah frost of village voice in her review of album called it genre defying taking note of love s reputation on album as girl who won t shut up she is all things that

an unhinged raw sounding debut a great deal of professional calculation went into putting this record together they also applauded love s lyrics and said album judiciously toes line between evasively obtuse and overtly obscene in a 1994 article rolling stone journalist david fricke called album gloriously assaultive and a classic of sex mad self laceration guitars and full moon bawling in particular spectacular goring of joni mitchell s both sides now aka clouds at end of record you don t really know solitary despair at core of that song until you ve heard love s embittered delivery of last two lines it s life s illusions i recall i really don t know life at all over guitarist eric erlandson s fading squall in 1995 alternative press magazine ranked album at no 74 in their top 99 of

articulate courtney love s pent up rage as well as her lyrics and while that might make album difficult to absorb in one sitting it also makes it a singular achievement music historian andrew referred

bold musical splendour on display that leaves one feeling nothing short of in a 2015 retrospective assessment spin noted album s overt noise rock influences writing that it played like release legacy

british rock band nine black alps also noted album as a major influence on their third release locked out from inside 2009 and indie singer songwriter scout niblett cited it as a major influence on her for me thing that i loved about them and her courtney love was anger and aggressiveness along with tender side said niblett that was something i hadn t seen before in a woman playing music that was hugely influential and really inspiring women up til then were kind of one dimensional twee sweet ethereal and that annoys shit out of me contemporarily album has also gained a cult following
