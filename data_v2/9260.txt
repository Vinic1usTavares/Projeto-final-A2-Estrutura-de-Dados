12 gauge is sixth studio album by finnish melodic death metal band kalmah released on 3 march 2010 album was recorded with more thrash metal elements than their previous releases while melodies that band is known for and environmental themes regarding swamps of finland were retained 12 gauge was recorded in three sessions over a three month period at tico tico studios in finland each of band members kept in touch with their fans by keeping track of their recording sessions online at official website s studio diary in addition guitarist antti kokko videotaped recording and photo shoot sessions seven videos were posted online during months leading up to album s release promotion for album was otherwise minimal there were no official singles but track bullets are blind was released on a 2 cd compilation included with soundi magazine s 35th anniversary issue and a music video to album s title track was produced and posted online 12 gauge received generally favorable reviews by european and american critics with a few considering it better than either of its immediate predecessors for revolution and black waltz it was agreed that band succeeded in producing a album but most critics found music to be less sophisticated than band s previous efforts 12 gauge charted in two countries peaking at number 32 in canada and number 15 in band s homeland because band had not been offered a worldwide tour support for album would be limited to europe and canada background when kalmah began writing music for their melodic death metal album their intent was to incorporate more aggressive thrash material than their previous recordings had as a result songs were going to be as vocalist pekka kokko described quite straightforward but band did not want to lose melodies they were known for album would not be entirely thrash metal since band planned on adding acoustic guitar sections and also trumpets antti kokko primary songwriter for 12 gauge composed riffs and melodies at his home these ideas were developed into complete songs during rehearsals guitar and keyboard solos were then written sometimes with both instruments soloing in same song trading off repeatedly two of tracks and sacramentum were composed entirely by keyboardist marco sneck including solos when music was completed pekka began working on lyrics which were inspired by various topics including politics religion drinking failure and pessimism several of songs shared an environmental theme hook monster was about fishing 12 gauge was inspired by hunting and impact of land development in swamps of finland was subject of commenting further on swamps pekka remarked those valuable areas are a part of our northern wilderness and are always threatened to be ditched or drained people are interested in those areas to use as a source of energy production recording and mixing took place at tico tico studios in kemi finland studio s schedule was too full for a single recording session so kalmah had to book time to record album in three separate sessions between months of may and august 2009 majority of tracks were recorded in may beginning with janne kusmin s drums which were completed by 12 may kusmin was not able to play as well as he had hoped because he had not been practicing as a result several of his drum parts were changed by following week timo lehtinen had finished laying down bass tracks his technique was to play nearly all his parts with downstrokes to bring more balls to sound he continued recording even after his thumb had formed a blister according to lehtinen he used only two bass string sets and broke five picks pekka and antti took turns recording their rhythm and lead guitar parts respectively both guitarists played by striking guitar strings at a 45 degree angle to achieve a more aggressive sound several of guitar techniques used on album had specific names described rapid succession of downstrokes and a slower version of this technique was called speed picking with alternating upstrokes and downstrokes was referred to as finnish for grinding some of techniques used were difficult for pekka and his brother antti took time to show him proper fingering and grasps acoustic guitars were played by antti ahti kortelainen album s recording engineer was credited by band for his input on how acoustic guitars were recorded especially for song sacramentum all guitar tracks excluding solos were finished by 28 may by middle of june pekka had recorded vocals for five tracks which antti described as very raw way we want them to be pekka s vocals would continue to be recorded in august and he completed them on 20 august antti had also completed his guitar solos by june and was pleased with results for me solos are best that i have ever managed to create and i m very satisfied after a summer break band returned to record sneck s keyboards which took place over three days 17 19 august sneck worked with software effects for first time along with sound modules he introduced synthesized horns to band s instrumentation but an actual trumpet was used for intro to rust never sleeps thumb right pekka kokko performing in helsinki finland on 6 march 2010 although band produced album pekka stated that antti was main producer since he was present at every step of production including mixing and mastering because they were comfortable self producing on all their previous albums they refused to bring in an outside record producer for 12 gauge this concept has worked for us since beginning and we just want to trust it everything goes easy with this setup and we don t want any extra risk factors mastering for disc took place at cutting room in stockholm sweden title of album was chosen by pekka and antti who both enjoy hunting they wanted to draw a comparison between shotgun shells and music pekka added that title also alludes to unpleasant matters that listener can infer from his lyrics when it came time to design album cover band decided against using computer generated graphics they commissioned rami mursula to create a hand drawn piece of artwork depicting a man emerging from swamp to fight a beast pekka explained symbolism in kalmah s mindset there is swamplord defending his marshlands against monster created by common materialism industrial pollution and world wide nausea of globalism layout was inspired by akseli gallen kallela s 1896 painting defense of promotion images used in album artwork were photographed by vesa ranta at one of finland s many swamps photo session was documented by antti in a two part video titled call of wild these and five other short videos documenting recording of 12 gauge were uploaded in months leading up to album s release there was no official single but in december 2009 track bullets are blind was included on a 2 cd collection released as a companion to 35th anniversary issue of soundi magazine and a music video was shot and posted online for track 12 gauge in february 2010 kalmah launched a second myspace page solely dedicated to new album album was released on cd and digital download in japan in february followed by releases in canada and europe in march and in us in april a vinyl pressing was also made available in april limited to 500 copies there would not be a worldwide tour to promote album because band had not received a decent offer 12 gauge promotion was therefore limited to several gigs in finland and a brief 10 show tour in canada 4 march performance in jyvaskyla finland was considered to be album s release party critical reception allmusic s eduardo rivadavia said kalmah s sixth album was more aggressive than its immediate predecessors david e gehlke of blistering was already devoted to kalmah s previous album for revolution so he had high expectations for 12 gauge he found album full of break neck riff action visceral melodies and daring dueling between antti s guitar and sneck s keyboard although gehlke believed that kalmah gets better with each output he decided that 12 gauge did not match glory of for revolution jussi of imperiumi net said that pekka s vocals harkened back to band s 2006 album black waltz he said album was not anything new but he found production to be best of kalmah s releases s sean bester decided kalmah s strength lay in their consistency releasing energetic and melodic music with consistent intervals of time between them delivering tracks that are consistently likable and each one is consistent with sound they ve firmly established for themselves gave album a perfect score because it was beautifully arranged wonderfully varied did not contain any filler material and it succeeded at combining melodic thrash with blackened death metal a combination of black metal and death metal chris colgan writing for popmatters found album to have longest and most intricate solos yet and he too mentioned increased trading off between antti s and sneck s solos he thought it important that kalmah had not fallen prey to tendency of introducing american metal elements or becoming more mainstream with their sound their music now is as unique as it was in their early years if not more so marko saynekoski of soundi described performances as controlled burly and performed effortlessly stalker s kathleen admitted that she was unfamiliar with kalmah s previous work but she was nevertheless impressed with its technicality double guitar melodies fast solos and combining of genres she called album a lot of fun to listen to 12 gauge music video thumb right pekka kokko singing camera effects simulated influences of a mysterious drink a music video was created for song 12 gauge though acoustic intro was excised from final version it was shot on 20
