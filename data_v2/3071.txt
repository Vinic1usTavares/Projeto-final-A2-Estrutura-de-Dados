mainframe computers are computers used primarily by businesses and academic institutions for large scale processes before personal computers first termed microcomputers became widely available to general public in 1970s computing industry was composed of mainframe computers and relatively smaller and cheaper minicomputer variant during mid to late 1960s many early video games were programmed on these computers developed prior to rise of commercial video game industry in early 1970s these early mainframe games were generally written by students or employees at large corporations in a machine or assembly language that could only be understood by specific machine or computer type they were developed on while many of these games were lost as older computers were discontinued some of them were ported to high level computer languages like basic had expanded versions later released for personal computers or were recreated for bulletin board systems years later thus influencing future games and developers early computer games began to be created in 1950s and steady increase in number and abilities of computers over time led to gradual loosening of restrictions on access to mainframe computers at academic and corporate institutions beginning in 1960s this in turn led to a modest proliferation of generally small text based games on mainframe computers with increasing complexity towards end of decade while games continued to be developed on mainframes and minicomputers through 1970s rise of personal computers and spread of high level programming languages meant that later games were generally intended to or were capable of being run on personal computers even when developed on a mainframe these early games include hamurabi an antecedent of strategy and city building genres lunar lander which inspired numerous recreations in 1970s and 1980s civil war an early war simulation game star trek which was widely ported expanded and spread for decades after space travel which played a role in creation of unix operating system and baseball an early sports game and first baseball game to allow player control during a game background thumb right a 1965 ibm system 360 model 30 mainframe computer at computer history museum mainframe computers are powerful computers used primarily by large organizations for computational work especially large scale multi user processes term originally referred to large cabinets called main frames that housed central processing unit and main memory of early computers prior to rise of personal computers first termed microcomputers in 1970s they were primary type of computer in use and at beginning of 1960s they were only type of computer available for public purchase minicomputers were relatively smaller and cheaper mainframe computers prevalent in 1960s and 1970s though they were still not intended for personal use one definition from 1970 required a minicomputer to cost less than us 25 000 in contrast regular mainframes could cost more than us 1 000 000 by end of 1960s mainframe computers and minicomputers were present in many academic research institutions and large companies such as bell labs while commercial video game industry did not yet exist at that point in early history of video games and would not until early 1970s programmers at these companies created several small games to be played on their mainframe computers most of these spread only to other users of same type of computer and therefore did not persist as older computer models were discontinued several however inspired future games or were later released in modified versions on more modern systems or languages these early mainframe games were largely created between 1968 and 1971 while earlier games were created they were limited to small academic audiences mainframe games also continued to be developed through 1970s but rise of commercial video game industry focused on arcade video games and home video game consoles followed by rise of personal computers later in decade meant that beginning in 1970s audience and developers of video games began to shift away from mainframe computers or minicomputers and spread of general purpose programming languages such as basic programming language meant that later mainframe games could generally be run on personal computers with minimal changes even if initially developed on a mainframe early games very first computer games began to appear in 1950s starting with bertie brain a computer based game of tic tac toe built by dr josef kates for 1950 canadian national exhibition while status of these games as video games depends on definition used games developed during this time period ran on large antecedents of mainframe computers and were primarily developed for purposes of academic research or to showcase technological development of computers on which they ran access to these computers located almost exclusively in universities and research institutions was restricted to academics and researchers preventing any development of entertainment programs over course of decade computer technology improved to include smaller transistor based computers on which programs could be created and run in real time rather than operations run in batches and computers themselves spread to more locations by 1960s improvements in computing technology and early development of relatively cheaper mainframe computers which would later be termed minicomputers led to loosening of restrictions regarding programming access to computers at massachusetts institute of technology mit access to tx 0 experimental computer was opened to students and employees of university this in turn led to development of programs that in addition to highlighting power of computer also contained an entertainment aspect games created for tx 0 by small programming community at mit included tic tac toe which used a light pen to play a simple game of noughts and crosses against computer and mouse in maze which let players set up a maze for a mouse to run through when digital equipment corporation dec pdp 1 computer was installed at mit in 1961 community built a video game to showcase its abilities spacewar which then became first known video game to spread beyond a single computer installation as it was copied and recreated on other pdp 1 systems and later on other mainframe computers over course of decade computers spread to more and more companies and institutions even as they became more powerful by 1971 it is estimated that there were over 1000 computers with monitors rather than few dozen at beginning of 1960s while different computers could generally not run same programs without significant changes to programs code due to differences in physical hardware or machine languages expansion of computing industry led to creation of catalogs and user groups to share programs between different installations of same series of computers such as dec s pdp line these catalogs and groups such as ibm program catalog and digital equipment computer users society decus shared small games as well as programs including for example bbc vik baseball demonstrator and three dimensional tic tack toe in april 1962 ibm catalog and dice games and question and answer games in decus newsletter sumerian game 1964 for ibm 7090 a strategy video game of land and resource management was first educational game for children mainframe games were developed outside of ibm and dec communities as well such as 1962 polish marienbad for odra 1003 by latter half of 1960s higher level programming languages such as basic which were able to be run on multiple types of computers further increased reach of games developed at any given location while most games were limited to text based designs rather than visual graphics like spacewar these games became more complicated as they reached more players such as baseball and basketball simulation games access to computers themselves was also extended to more people by systems such as dartmouth time sharing system dtss which connected several thousand users through many remote terminals to a central mainframe computer by 1967 68 school year dtss library of 500 programs for system included john kemeny and thomas kurtz wrote many games over a quarter of system s usage was for casual or entertainment purposes which kemeny and kurtz welcomed as helping users to become familiar with and not fear computer they noted that we have lost many a distinguished visitor for several hours while he quarterbacked dartmouth football team in a highly realistic simulated game 101 basic computer games thumb right a pdp 8 minicomputer on display at national museum of american history in 1971 dec employee david h ahl converted two games hamurabi and lunar lander from focal language to basic partially as a demonstration of language on dec pdp 8 minicomputer their popularity led him to start printing basic games in dec newsletter he edited both ones he wrote and reader submissions in 1973 he published 101 basic computer games containing descriptions and source code for video games written in basic games included were written by both ahl and others and included both games original to language and ported from other languages such as focal many of these ports were originally mainframe computer games 101 basic computer games was a best seller with more than 10 000 copies sold more sales than computers in existence at time its second edition in 1978 basic computer games was first million selling computer book as such basic ports of mainframe computer games included in book were often more long lived than their original versions or other mainframe computer games hamurabi in particular is mostly known for its appearance in ahl s book after hearing of sumerian game doug at dec created his own sumer game for fellow employee richard merrill s newly invented focal programming language game consists of ten rounds wherein player as ancient babylonian king hammurabi manages how much of their grain to spend on crops for next round feeding their people and purchasing additional land while dealing with random variations in crop yields and plagues multiple versions of game were created for focal and focal 69 languages but an expanded uncredited version of game was included in 101 basic computer games as hamurabi and later versions of game even in focal referenced new title over old hamurabi influenced many later strategy and simulation games and is an antecedent to city building genre other game ahl originally ported to basic lunar lander appeared in book in three different forms original version of game was called lunar and was originally written in focal for pdp 8 by jim storer while a high school student in fall of 1969 a different version called rocket was written in basic by eric peters at dec and a third version lem was written by william labaree ii in basic ahl converted jim storer s focal version to basic changed some of text and published it in his newsletter a year or so later all three basic versions of game appeared in 101 basic computer games under names rocket storer version rockt1 peters version and rockt2 labaree version all three text based games required player to control a rocket attempting to land on moon by entering instructions to rocket in response to textual summary of its current position and heading relative to ground ahl and steve north converted all three versions to microsoft basic changed collective name to lunar lander and published them in creative computing magazine in 1976 that name was used in 1978 edition of basic computer games thumb right modern recreation of star trek running in a linux command terminal another game from book is civil war a text based computer game that puts player against computer in a simulation of american civil war civil war originated on multi user mainframe computers in 1968 and simulates fourteen major battles of conflict with human player as south and computer as north player can control four direct variables which interact to determine a battle s outcome how much of their money to spend on food salaries and ammunition and which of four offensive or four defensive strategies to use side with fewest casualties wins a battle and if player wins eight or more battles they win game after appearing in 101 basic computer games civil war was later one of a number of text based games available on early 1980s pay to play systems possibly most popular of mainframe games that appeared in ahl s book was star trek game is a text based computer game that puts player in command of starship enterprise on a mission to hunt down and destroy an invading fleet of klingon warships unlike other text based games however it did not use written responses to player input but instead had character based graphics with different characters used as graphical symbols to represent objects it was initially developed by mike mayfield in 1971 on an sds sigma 7 mainframe game was also unlike many of other mainframe games in book in that it was originally written in basic by time book was published it had been widely copied among minicomputer and mainframe systems and modified into several versions it was one of these renamed by ahl as space war that appeared in 101 basic computer games 1978 version of book contained a microsoft basic port of super star trek an expanded version of game first written in 1974 and this version was ported to numerous personal computer systems of era ahl stated in book that it was difficult to find a computer installation that did not contain a version of star trek multiple updated versions in a wide variety of languages have been made since by 1980 star trek was described by dragon magazine as one of most popular if not most popular computer games around with literally scores of different versions of this game floating around other games thumb right gameplay image of space travel some mainframe games that did not appear in 101 basic computer games have still had a lasting impact one such game was space travel developed by ken thompson in 1969 which simulates travel in solar system player flies their ship around a two dimensional scale model of solar system with no objectives other than to attempt to land on various planets and moons player can move and turn ship and adjust overall speed by adjusting scale of simulation ship is affected by single strongest gravitational pull of astronomical bodies game was developed at bell labs and was ported during 1969 from multics operating system to operating system on ge 635 computer and then to pdp 7 minicomputer while porting game to pdp 7 thompson developed ideas for his own operating system which later formed core of unix operating system space travel never spread beyond bell labs or had an effect on future games leaving its primary legacy as part of original push for development of unix another influential early mainframe game was baseball a sports game that was created on a pdp 10 minicomputer at pomona college in 1971 by english major don daglow baseball was first baseball video game that allowed players to manage game as it unfolded rather than just picking players at beginning of a game program is documented at national baseball hall of fame and museum in cooperstown new york baseball was continually updated through 1974 and distributed to other pdp 10 installations text based game had each player control pitcher or batter they would enter their intention to for example pitch to or walk batter or switch hitters batting player could direct on base players to steal and batter to hit results of play would be printed out onto paper as a verbose description like a radio description of game daglow went on to develop more sophisticated baseball games in 1983 with intellivision world series baseball and 1987 with earl weaver baseball as well as numerous other games references sources category early history of video games
