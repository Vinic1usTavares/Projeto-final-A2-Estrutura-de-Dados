signed during sonic heroes development gave sega ownership of anything they made using a sega ip vision scape closed in 2006 mcdonald ordered staff to dispose of their development hardware and a number software development kits were taken to a recycling plant however sonic extreme prototype survived and was traded between collectors rediscovery and reception sonic extreme was publicly

predictably and compellingly awful respectively and gamesradar joked it prov ed once again that slapping word extreme onto any popular franchise activity or consumer good is a surefire way to guarantee that it will be anything but game also elicited commentary on sega s quality control process game informer and computer and video games expressed relief that it was never released but
