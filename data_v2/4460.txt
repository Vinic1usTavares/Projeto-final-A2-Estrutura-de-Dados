sm ub 45 was a type ub ii submarine or u boat built for and operated by german imperial navy during world war i ub 45 operated in mediterranean and black seas and was sunk by a mine in november 1916 ub 45 was ordered in july 1915 and was laid down at ag weser shipyard in bremen in september ub 45 was about in length and displaced between depending on whether surfaced or submerged she was equipped to carry a complement of four torpedoes for her two bow torpedo tubes and had an deck gun as part of a group of six submarines selected for mediterranean service ub 45 was broken into railcar sized components and shipped to pola where she was assembled and then launched and commissioned in may 1916 in five patrols in her six month career ub 45 sank four ships of in early november 1916 ub 45 was departing from base at varna bulgaria when u boat struck a mine and sank rapidly fifteen of twenty men on board were killed in attack one of five crewmen rescued from ub 45 later died from his injuries ub 45s wreck was located and raised by bulgarian navy in 1930s with an eye toward rebuilding submarine engineers from ag weser determined that restoration of submarine was feasible but this was never accomplished remains recovered from wreck were buried in varna after a funeral procession through town in november 1938 design and construction german ub ii design improved upon design of ub i boats which had been ordered in september 1914 gardiner p 174 in service ub i boats were found to be too small and too slow a major problem was that because they had a single propeller shaft engine combo if either component failed u boat became almost totally disabled miller p 48 to rectify this flaw ub ii boats featured twin propeller shafts and twin engines one shaft for each engine which also increased u boat s top speed williamson p 13 new design also included more powerful batteries larger torpedo tubes and a deck gun tarrant p 172 as a ub ii boat u 45 could also carry twice torpedo load of her ub i counterparts and nearly ten times as much fuel to contain all of these changes hull was larger and surface and submerged displacement was more than double that of ub i boats german imperial navy ordered ub 45 from ag weser on 31 july 1915 as one of a series of six ub ii boats numbered from to ub 45 was long and abeam she had a single hull with saddle tanks and had a draught of when surfaced she displaced while submerged but only on surface submarine was equipped with twin daimler diesel engines and twin siemens schuckert electric motors for surfaced and submerged running respectively ub 45 had a surface speed of up to and could go as fast as while underwater u boat could carry up to of diesel fuel giving her a range of at her electric motors and batteries provided a range of at while submerged ub 45 was equipped with two bow torpedo tubes and could carry four torpedoes u boat was also armed with one uk l 30 deck gun ub 45 was laid down by ag weser at its bremen shipyard on 3 september 1915 as one of six u boats selected for service in mediterranean while under construction ub 45 was broken into railcar sized components and shipped overland to austro hungarian port of pola halpern p 383 miller p 49 shipyard workers from weser assembled boat and her five sisters at pola where she was launched on 12 may 1916 service career sm ub 45 was commissioned into german imperial navy on 26 may 1916 under command of oberleutnant zur see karl palis 31 year old palis had been in navy s april 1904 cadet class with 20 other future u boat captains including wilhelm canaris for palis information see for cadet crew information see ub 45 palis second u boat command palis had previously commanded was assigned to navy s pola flotilla although flotilla was based in pola site of main austro hungarian navy base boats of flotilla operated out of austro hungarian base at cattaro which was located farther south and closer to mediterranean german u boats typically returned to pola only for repairs halpern p 384 in mid july ub 45s first success occurred when in three days she sank two steamers first virginia was sunk on 16th while carrying salt destined for calcutta two men on board 4 279 ton british ship were lost when she went down off cape matapan two days later french ship ville de rouen was sunk southwest of cape matapan 4 721 ton ville de rouen would be ub 45s largest victim germany s conquest of romania provided german imperial navy with sufficient fuel oil for submarines to operate in black sea ub 45 and three of her sister ships in pola flotilla were ordered to constantinople and en route had to navigate through dardanelles which had been heavily mined by allies in middle of 1916 halpern pp 248 49 other three boats were and ub 45 joined constantinople flotilla on 12 august german submarines in black sea accomplished little sinking only six ships between august and end of year halpern p 249 ub 45 accounted for two of these while in black sea on 31 august ub 45 sank 2 660 ton italian steamer tevere off poti tevere had been requisitioned by imperial russian navy and was in use as a transport ship at time two days later u boat torpedoed 3 701 ton gioconda another russian transport off trebizond gioconda was towed into trebizond and converted to a landing platform making ship an apparent total loss gioconda was last ship sunk by ub 45 thumb left 13 november 1938 funeral procession for ub 45s crewmen after u boat s 1936 recovery at 14 30 on 6 november ub 45 was departing varna bulgaria under escort by bulgarian torpedo boat strogi that had cleared a path through russian mines messimer p 166 messimer identifies bulgarian ship as destroyer conway s all world s fighting ships 1906 1921 pp 411 12 reports no such ship but does report a bulgarian torpedo boat named strogi at what was thought to be edge of minefield ub 45 swung around port side directly into a second minefield that had been laid by russian forces night before a hertz horn mine exploded between ub 45s control room and engine room with enough force to break boat in half ub 45 sank so rapidly that only survivors were three men on conning tower and two on deck all of whom were injured other fifteen men on board perished in attack one of survivors died from severity of his wounds following day in 1932 bulgarian navy conceived a plan to search for wreck of ub 45 with intent of raising it for restoration as a training vessel or at very least to recover sunken u boat s deck gun an additional consideration was recovery of remains of ub 45s crew on 19 july 1934 after a two year search bulgarian minesweepers discovered location of wreck which was resting at position near then bulgarian romanian border ub 45s wreck was raised in an operation that cost several times less than cost of a new 8 8 centimeter gun remains recovered were buried on 26 february 1936 in a varna cemetery after a procession through town engineers from ag weser ub 45s german builder inspected hulk and determined that repair of wreck was feasible a restoration of submarine to operating condition as either a training vessel or a military would cost 21 million leva about us 250 000 in 1936 dollars significantly less than 56 to 65 million leva 680 000 to 790 000 that a comparable new submarine would cost in 1936 100 leva equalled about us 1 22 see brandt p xxxiii ultimately bulgarian navy opted to order new submarines from germany rather than repair ub 45 bulgarian submarine order was cancelled by germany after start of world war ii ub 45s deck gun was reused however and one of u boat s diesel engines was restored to operating condition and used on training ship assen summary of raiding history ships sunk by sm ub
