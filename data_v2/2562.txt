like tonight show with jay leno live with kelly and ryan and late show with david letterman to promote book critical and commercial reception mr peabody s apples was not received well critically book debuted at number one on new york times best seller list but fell from top by its fourth week by october 2004 it had sold 127 000 copies according to nielsen bookscan samantha critchell from associated press called a book a little hokey critic believed that it would be a big seller but premise was stale since target was young readers and grade school going children who might not respond well to a tale of moral you d think that a celebrity with madonna s notoriety wouldn t need a centuries old story to inspire her to write about value of truth and pain that comes with gossip that spreads like wildfire reviewer concluded deirdre donahue from usa today panned release especially madonna naming a character billy little just because he is short donahue found story to lack depth unlike previous release english roses and declared mr peabody s apples as a dreary heavy handed tale with a pedestrian and predictable message reviewing book for tablet ayelet waldman felt that neither mr peabody s apples nor english roses will be added to list of approved reading material kept by world s jewish grandmothers although she believed that former book contained a simple moral and nice metaphor american writer e lockhart reviewed book for salon under her real name emily jenkins she found madonna s second endeavor to be neither bouncy nor flirty rather described it as dour and joyless despite pretty masculinity of loren long s norman rockwell style illustrations jenkins noted that children were depicted in book as passive receptors of adult wisdom but here misguided semi protagonist ends up in a guilty never to be redeemed limbo for his relatively innocent crime a review in publishers weekly was critical of story but praised long s illustrations describing them as lushly nostalgic with their robin s egg blue skies bountiful golden farmlands and working men in straw hats and rolled sleeves pay homage to rural paintings of thomas hart benton similar thoughts were echoed by tim adams from guardian who believed that story was saved by long s glorious illustrations which cast norman rockwell light on mad magazine faces nicolette jones from times found story to be more coherent than its predecessor english roses lacks its irritating conversational asides and has more sense of time and place release details kingdomnovember 7 statesnovember 10 11 2 6 2006audio
