basil ii 15 december 1025 nicknamed bulgar slayer was senior byzantine emperor for almost 50 years 10 january 976 15 december 1025 having been a junior colleague to other emperors since 960 he and his brother constantine were named as co rulers before their father romanos ii died in 963 throne went to two generals nikephoros phokas r 963 969 then john tzimiskes r 969 976 before basil became senior emperor his influential great uncle basil lekapenos was de facto ruler of byzantine empire until 985 basil ii then held power for forty years early years of basil s reign were dominated by civil wars against two powerful generals from anatolian aristocracy first bardas skleros and later bardas phokas which ended shortly after phokas death and skleros submission in 989 basil then oversaw stabilization and expansion of eastern frontier of byzantine empire and complete subjugation of first bulgarian empire its foremost european foe after a prolonged struggle although byzantine empire had made a truce with fatimid caliphate in 987 988 basil led a campaign against caliphate that ended with another truce in 1000 he also conducted a campaign against khazar khaganate that gained byzantine empire part of crimea and a series of successful campaigns against kingdom of georgia despite near constant warfare basil distinguished himself as an administrator reducing power of great land owning families who dominated empire s administration and military filling its treasury and leaving it with its greatest expanse in four centuries although his successors were largely incapable rulers empire flourished for decades after basil s death one of most important decisions taken during his reign was to offer hand of his sister anna porphyrogenita to vladimir i of kiev in exchange for military support thus forming byzantine military unit known as varangian guard marriage of anna and vladimir led to christianization of kievan rus and incorporation of later successor nations of kievan rus within byzantine cultural and religious tradition basil is seen as a greek national hero but as a despised figure among bulgarians physical appearance and personality courtier and historian michael psellos who was born towards end of basil s reign gives a description of basil in his chronographia psellos describes him as a stocky man of shorter than average stature who nevertheless was an impressive figure on horseback he had light blue eyes strongly arched eyebrows luxuriant which he had a habit of rolling between his fingers when deep in thought or angry and in later life a scant beard psellos also states that basil was not an articulate speaker and had a loud laugh that convulsed his whole frame basil is described as having ascetic tastes and caring little for pomp and ceremony of imperial court typically wearing a sombre dark purple robe furnished with few of gems that usually decorated imperial costumes he is also described as a capable administrator who left a well stocked treasury upon his death basil supposedly despised literary culture and affected scorn for learned classes of byzantium according to 19th century historian george finlay basil saw himself as prudent just and devout others considered him severe rapacious cruel and bigoted for greek learning he cared little and he was a type of higher byzantine moral character which retained far more of its roman than its greek origin modern historian john julius norwich wrote of basil no lonelier man ever occupied byzantine throne and it is hardly surprising basil was ugly dirty coarse boorish philistine and almost pathologically mean he was in short deeply un byzantine he cared only for greatness of his empire no wonder that in his hands it reached its apogee early life thumb coronation of

a poor tavern keeper named and may have originated from city of sparta he may have had an elder sister named helena born romanos succeeded constantine vii as sole emperor upon latter s death in 959 basil s father crowned him as co emperor on 22 april 960 and his brother constantine born 960 or 961 eventually to rule as sole emperor constantine viii in 1025 1028 in 962 or 963 only two days after birth of his youngest child anna romanos ii died on 15 march 963 at 24 years of age his unexpected death was commonly thought at time to be result of poisoning with hemlock chroniclers leo deacon and john skylitzes imply that theophano was responsible and according to skylitzes she had been complicit in an earlier attempt by romanos ii to poison constantine vii basil and constantine were too young to rule in their own right when romanos died in 963 therefore although byzantine senate confirmed them as emperors with their mother as nominal regent de facto power passed for time into hands of parakoimomenos joseph bringas theophano did not trust bringas however and another enemy of powerful parakoimomenos was basil lekapenos an illegitimate eunuch son of emperor romanos i basil s great grandfather lekapenos himself had been parakoimomenos to constantine vii and megas to romanos ii yet another enemy of bringas was successful and widely popular general nikephoros phokas who had just returned from his conquest of emirate of crete and a highly successful raid into cilicia and syria which culminated in sack of aleppo phokas was proclaimed emperor by his men in july and marched on constantinople bringas tried to bring in troops to stop his rival s advance but capital s populace supported nikephoros bringas fled leaving his post to lekapenos and on 16 august 963 nikephoros phokas was crowned emperor on 20 september phokas married theophano but problems resulted it was a second marriage for each spouse and nikephoros was thought to be godfather of basil or his brother perhaps both although patriarch of constantinople disapproved of marriage church declared it to be valid with it nikephoros secured his legitimacy and became guardian of romanos sons he was murdered in december 969 by theophano and his nephew john tzimiskes who then became emperor john i and exiled theophano john married theodora a sister of romanos ii basil ii acceded to throne as effective

proved himself to be an able general and a strong ruler in early years of his reign administration remained in hands of basil lekapenos as president of byzantine senate lekapenos was a wily gifted politician who hoped young emperors would be his puppets younger basil waited and watched without interfering devoting himself to learning details of administrative business and military science nikephoros ii and john i were brilliant military commanders but proved to be poor administrators towards end of his reign john i had belatedly planned to curb power of great landowners his death which occurred soon after he spoke out against them led to rumors that he had been poisoned by lekapenos who had illegally acquired vast estates and feared an investigation and punishment at start of his reign failures of his immediate predecessors left basil ii with a serious problem bardas skleros and bardas phokas members of wealthy military elite of anatolia had sufficient means to undertake open rebellion against his authority skleros and phokas both of whom were experienced generals wanted to assume imperial position that nikephoros ii and john i had held and thus return basil to role of impotent cypher basil showing a penchant for ruthlessness took to field himself and suppressed rebellions of both skleros 979 and phokas 989 with help of 12 000 georgians of tornikios and david iii kuropalates of tao fall of lekapenos occurred between rebellions in 985 he was accused of plotting with rebels and was punished with exile and confiscation of his property relationship between two generals was complicated phokas was instrumental in defeating rebellion of skleros but when phokas later rebelled skleros returned from exile to support him when phokas died in battle skleros whom phokas had imprisoned assumed leadership of rebellion basil s brother constantine who had no interest in politics statecraft or military led troops alongside basil this was only military command constantine would hold campaign ended without combat when skleros was forced to surrender to basil in 989 skleros was allowed to live but he died blind either through disease or from being blinded as punishment for his insurrection these rebellions had a profound effect on basil s outlook and methods of governance psellos describes defeated skleros giving basil following advice which he took to heart cut down governors who become over proud let no generals on campaign have too many resources exhaust them with unjust exactions to keep them busied with their own affairs admit no woman to imperial councils be accessible to no one share with few your most intimate plans to defeat these dangerous revolts basil formed an alliance with prince vladimir i of kiev who in 988 had captured chersonesos empire s main base in crimean peninsula vladimir offered to evacuate chersonesos and to supply 6 000 of his soldiers as reinforcements to basil in exchange he demanded to be married to basil s younger sister anna at first basil hesitated byzantines viewed all of nations of northern europe both franks and slavs as barbarians anna objected to marrying a barbarian ruler because such a marriage would have no precedence in imperial annals vladimir had researched various religions having sent delegates to various countries marriage was not his main reason for choosing christianity when vladimir promised to baptize himself and to convert his people to christianity basil finally agreed vladimir and anna were married in crimea in 989 rus warriors taken into basil s army were instrumental in ending rebellion they were later organized into varangian guard this marriage had important long term implications marking beginning of process by which grand duchy of moscow many centuries later would proclaim itself third rome and claim political and cultural heritage of byzantine empire campaigns against fatimid caliphate once internal strife was quelled basil turned his attention to empire s other enemies byzantine civil wars had weakened empire s position in east and gains of nikephoros ii and john i had nearly been lost to fatimid caliphate in 987 988 a seven year truce with fatimids was signed it stipulated an exchange of prisoners recognition of byzantine emperor as protector of christians under fatimid rule and of fatimid caliph as protector of muslims under byzantine control and replacement of name of abbasid caliph with that of fatimid caliph in friday prayer in mosque at constantinople this lasted until long time vizier yaqub ibn killis died in 991 fatimid caliph al aziz billah chose to pursue a more aggressive stance in syria and appointed manjutakin as governor of damascus manjutakin s attacks on aleppo and basil s first expedition to syria encouraged by defectors after death of emir sa d al dawla al aziz decided to renew his attacks on hamdanid emirate of aleppo a byzantine protectorate perhaps expecting basil would not interfere manjutakin invaded emirate defeated a byzantine force under doux of antioch michael bourtzes in june 992 and laid siege to aleppo city easily resisted in early 993 after thirteen months of campaigning a lack of supplies forced manjutakin to return to damascus in 994 manjutakin resumed his offensive and in september scored a major victory at battle of orontes against bourtzes bourtzes defeat forced basil to intervene personally in east with his army he rode through asia minor to aleppo in sixteen days arriving in april 995 basil s sudden arrival and exaggeration of his army s strength circulating in fatimid camp caused panic in fatimid army especially because manjutakin expecting no threat had ordered his cavalry horses to be dispersed around city for pasture despite having a considerably larger and well rested army manjutakin was at a disadvantage he burned his camp and retreated to damascus without battle byzantines besieged tripoli unsuccessfully and occupied tartus which they refortified and garrisoned with armenian troops al aziz now prepared to take to field in person against byzantines and initiated large scale preparations but they were abandoned upon his death second expedition to syria and conclusion of peace warfare between two powers continued as byzantines supported an anti fatimid uprising in tyre in 998 byzantines under damian dalassenos successor of bourtzes launched an attack on apamea but fatimid general jaysh ibn al samsama defeated them in battle on 19 july 998 this defeat drew basil back into conflict he arrived in syria in october 999 and remained there for three months basil s troops raided as far as baalbek placed a garrison at shaizar and burnt three minor forts in vicinity of abu and siege of tripoli in december failed while hims was not threatened basil s attention was diverted to developments in georgia following murder of david iii kuropalates he departed for cilicia in january and dispatched another embassy to cairo in 1000 a ten year truce was concluded between two states for remainder of reign of al hakim bi amr allah r 996 1021 relations remained peaceful as al hakim was more interested in internal affairs even acknowledgement of fatimid suzerainty by abu muhammad lu lu al kabir of aleppo in 1004 and fatimid sponsored installment of aziz al dawla as city s emir in 1017 did not lead to a resumption of hostilities especially because al kabir continued to pay tribute to byzantines and al dawla quickly began acting as an independent ruler al hakim s persecution of christians in his realm and especially 1009 destruction of church of holy sepulchre at his orders strained relations and along with fatimid interference in aleppo provided main focus of fatimid byzantine diplomatic relations

thumb victorious byzantine cataphracts pursuing fleeing bulgarian heavy cavalry from madrid skylitzes basil sought to restore former territories of byzantine empire at start of second millennium he fought samuel of bulgaria his greatest adversary bulgaria had been partly subjugated by john i after invasion of svyatoslav i of kiev but parts of country had remained outside byzantine control under leadership of samuel and his brothers because bulgars had been raiding byzantine lands since 976 byzantine government sought to cause dissension among them by allowing escape of their captive emperor boris ii of bulgaria this ploy failed so basil used a respite from his conflict with nobility to lead an 30 000 strong army into bulgaria and besiege sredets sofia in 986 taking losses and worried about loyalty of some of his governors basil lifted siege and returned for thrace but he fell into an ambush and suffered a serious defeat at battle of gates of trajan basil escaped with help of his varangian guard and attempted to recover his losses by turning samuel s brother aron against him aron was tempted by basil s offer of his sister anna in marriage but negotiations failed when aron discovered bride he was sent was an imposter by 987 samuel had eliminated aron although titular emperor roman of bulgaria was captured in 991 basil lost moesia to bulgarians while basil was distracted with internal rebellions and recovering military situation on his eastern frontier samuel had extended his rule from adriatic sea to black sea recovering most of territory that was controlled by bulgaria before invasion of svyatoslav he also conducted damaging raids into byzantine territory as far as central greece in 996 byzantine general nikephoros ouranos defeated a bulgarian army raid at battle of in thessaly samuel and his son gabriel narrowly escaped capture beginning in 1000 basil was free to focus on a war of conquest against bulgaria which he fought with grinding persistence and strategic insight in 1000 byzantine generals nikephoros xiphias and theodorokanos took former bulgarian capital great preslav and towns lesser preslav and pliskova in 1001 basil operating from thessalonica regained control of vodena and servia following year he based his army in philippopolis and occupied length of military road from western haemus mountains to danube cutting off communications between samuel s macedonian heartland and moesia following this success basil laid siege to vidin which fell after a prolonged resistance samuel reacted to byzantine campaign by launching a large scale raid into heart of byzantine thrace and took major city of adrianople by surprise after turning homeward with his extensive plunder samuel was intercepted near skopje by a byzantine army commanded by basil whose forces stormed bulgarian camp defeating bulgarians and recovering plunder from adrianople skopje surrendered shortly after battle and basil treated its governor romanos with overt kindness in 1005 governor of dyrrhachium ashot taronites surrendered his city to byzantines defection of dyrrhachium completed isolation of samuel s core territories in highlands of western macedonia samuel was forced into an almost entirely defensive stance he extensively fortified passes and routes from coastlines and valleys held by byzantines to territory remaining in his possession during next few years byzantine offensive slowed and no significant gains were made although an attempt by bulgarians to counter attack in 1009 was defeated at battle of to east of thessalonica in 1014 basil was ready to launch a campaign aimed at destroying bulgarian resistance on 29 july 1014 in battle of kleidion he and his general nikephoros xiphias outmaneuvered bulgarian army which was defending one of fortified passes samuel avoided capture through valor of his son gabriel having crushed bulgarians basil exacted his vengeance cruelly he was said to have captured 15 000 prisoners and fully blinded 99 of every 100 men leaving one one eyed man in each cohort to lead rest back to their ruler samuel was struck down by sight of his blinded army and died two days later on 6 october 1014 after suffering a stroke bulgaria fought on for four more years its resistance fired by basil s cruelty but it submitted in 1018 this submission was result of continued military pressure and a successful diplomatic campaign aimed at dividing and suborning bulgarian leadership this victory over bulgarians and later submission of serbs fulfilled one of basil s goals empire regained its ancient danubian frontier for first time in 400 years rulers of neighbouring croatia kresimir iii and who were previously allies of bulgaria accepted basil s supremacy to avoid same fate as bulgaria basil warmly received their offers of vassalage and awarded them honorary title of patrikios croatia remained a tributary state to basil until his death in 1025 before returning to constantinople basil celebrated his triumph in athens he showed considerable statesmanship in his treatment of defeated bulgarians giving many former bulgarian leaders court titles positions in provincial administration and high commands in army in this way he sought to absorb bulgarian elite into byzantine society because bulgaria did not have a monetary economy to same extent as byzantium basil decided to accept bulgarian taxes in kind basil s successors reversed this policy a decision that led to considerable bulgarian discontent and rebellion later in 11th century khazar campaign

claim to david s succession george who was young and ambitious launched a campaign to restore kuropalates s succession to georgia and occupied tao in 1015 1016 he entered in an alliance with fatimid caliph of egypt al hakim forcing basil to refrain from an acute response to george s offensive byzantines were also involved in a relentless war with bulgarians limiting their actions to west as soon

treaty with doge of venice pietro ii orseolo under terms reducing venice s custom duties in constantinople from 30 nomismata to 17 nomismata in return venetians agreed to transport byzantine troops to southern italy in times of war according to one estimate a byzantine landowning farmer might expect a profit of 10 2 nomismata after paying dues for half of his best quality land basil was popular with country farmers class that produced most of his army s supplies and soldiers to assure this continued basil s laws protected small agrarian property owners and lowered their taxes despite almost constant wars basil s reign was considered an era of relative prosperity for class seeking to protect lower and middle classes basil made ruthless war upon system of immense estates in asia minor which his predecessor romanos i had endeavored to check by executing a legal decree in january 996 that limited rights to property ownership if owner of an estate could prove that he claimed his estate prior to novels of romanos he would be allowed to keep it if a person had illegally seized an estate following novels of romanos he would have his rights to estate declared null and legal owners could reclaim it in 1002 basil also introduced allelengyon tax as a specific law obliging wealthy landholders to cover for arrears of poorer tax payers though it proved unpopular with wealthier sections of byzantine society basil did not abolish tax emperor romanos iii abolished allelengyon in 1028 by 1025 basil with an annual revenue of 7 000 000 nomismata was able to amass 14 400 000 nomismata or 200 000 pounds 90 tonnes of gold for imperial treasury due to his prudent management despite his attempts to control power of aristocracy they again took control of government following his death military policies basil ii was praised by his army because he spent most of his reign campaigning with it rather than sending orders from constantinople as had most of his predecessors this allowed his army to be largely supportive of him often making his stance in political and church matters unquestionable he lived life of a soldier to point of eating same daily rations as rest of army he also took children of dead army officers under his protection and offered them shelter food and education many of these children became his soldiers and officers taking places of their fathers basil did not innovate in terms of military organization in conquered territories he introduced both small themes or centred around a fortress town that were such a common feature of 10th century reconquests on east under phokas and tzimiskes as well as extensive regional commands under a doux or katepano iberia in 1000 or upper media in 1019 22 paristrion in 1000 20 bulgaria in 1018 and sirmium in 1019 exact size of army under basil ii is unknown but estimates put it as high as 110 000 men excluding imperial tagmata in constantinople a considerable force compared with nominal establishment force of in 9th 10th centuries or 150 000 160 000 of field armies under justinian i at same time however under basil practice began of relying on allied states most notably venice for naval power beginning slow decline of byzantine navy during 11th century later years thumb upright 2 5 byzantine empire at death of basil ii in 1025 basil ii later secured annexation of sub kingdoms of armenia and a promise that its capital and surrounding regions would be willed to byzantium following death of its king hovhannes in 1021 he also secured cession of kingdom of vaspurakan by its king john in exchange for estates in sebasteia basil created a strongly fortified frontier in those highlands other byzantine forces restored much of southern italy which had been lost during previous 150 years basil was preparing a military expedition to recover island of sicily when he died on 15 december 1025 holmes 2005 p 433 and 2003 having had longest reign among byzantine emperors at time of his death empire stretched from southern italy to caucasus and from danube to levant which was its greatest territorial extent since muslim conquests four centuries earlier basil was to be buried in

west and at outposts of east o man seeing now my tomb here reward me for my campaigns with your prayers during pillage of 1204 basil s grave was desecrated by invading crusaders of fourth crusade assessment an assessment of reign in eyes of subsequent generations is given by psellos he crushed rebellions subdued feudal landowners conquered enemies of empire notably in danubian provinces and east everywhere might of roman arms was respected and feared treasury was overflowing with accumulated plunder of basil s campaigns even lamp of learning despite emperor s known indifference was burning still if somewhat dimly lot of ordinary folk in constantinople must have been pleasant enough for most of them life was gay and colourful and if city s defensive fortifications were at some points in disrepair they had no cause to dread attacks legacy basil ii s reign is one of most significant in byzantine history his constant military campaigns led to zenith of byzantine power in middle ages restoration of danubian frontier helped establish a more stable and secure border for empire in europe maintaining a stronger frontier against hungarian and pecheneg raiders conquest of bulgaria and submission of south slavs created relative peace for empire s balkan frontier keeping larger cities including constantinople safe from previously frequent sieges and looting basil s military experience that allowed him to eventually turn war against bulgaria in byzantine empire s favor were gained through revolts of phokas and skleros in anatolia that challenged his throne and sometimes got close to deposing him basil s creation of varangian guard provided him and his successors with an elite mercenary force capable of changing battle outcomes and boosting morale that became feared by emperor s enemies at this time macedonian renaissance was taking effect seeing rise of classical scholarship being assimilated into christian art and study of ancient philosophy studies of these subjects and enlargement projects of emperors greatly expanded library of university of constantinople which again established itself as main source of learning for its day though he was not a man of literature basil was a relatively pious ruler who involved himself in construction of churches monasteries and to some extent cities basil ii lacked heirs due to dearth of cousins found within macedonian dynasty so he was succeeded by his brother constantine and his family who proved to be ineffective rulers nevertheless fifty years of prosperity and intellectual growth followed because funds of state were full borders were safe from intruders and empire remained most powerful political entity of age at end of basil ii s reign byzantine empire had a population of approximately 12 million people although they were beneficial basil s achievements were reversed very quickly many of georgian armenian and fatimid campaigns were undone after succession crisis and eventual civil war after battle of manzikert in 1071 because many of empire s governors went to capital with their soldiers to seize power after capture of emperor romanos iv anatolian frontier was
