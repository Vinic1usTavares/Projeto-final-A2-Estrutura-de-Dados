similarly praised video pointing out its high concept and stating singer s visual treatment brings lyrics to life highlighting its themes of resilience with a fitting storyline despite serious undertones of defiance video is jam packed with katy s goofy humour throughout and doesn t take itself too seriously at all evan of nrj likened three women seen in clip accompanying perry to characters from 1993 american comedy horror fantasy film hocus pocus and 1899 french film cinderella julien goncalves of pure charts compared parts of video s concept to madonna s live performance of vogue 1990 at 1990 mtv video music awards in a negative review highsnobiety s gorsler wrote visuals are to put it kindly less than stellar with over top production and a lavishly nonsensical plot making music video one of weirdest things to come out this year but all that is to be expected from an artist like katy perry who is famous for her eccentricity he also criticized heavy product placement and use of an air horn rap trumpet sound at beginning of video which sound s like katy perry spent a little too much time playing around with virtual dj vice magazine also slightly criticized product placement sequences live performances perry promoted hey hey hey with several live performances and included song in closing segment of her witness tour 2017 2018 concert tour where
