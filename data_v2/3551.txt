acrobat is a song by rock band u2 it is eleventh track on their 1991 album achtung baby song developed from a riff created by guitarist edge and is played in a time signature http www last fm music u2 acrobat lyrically song expresses themes of hypocrisy alienation and moral confusion although acrobat was rehearsed prior to third leg of zoo tv tour it had not been performed live until its debut on experience innocence tour on 2 may 2018 inspiration writing and recording lead singer bono was influenced by work of delmore schwartz when writing lyrics of acrobat to whom song is dedicated title of his first book in dreams begin responsibilities is quoted in final verse bono noted book was on my mind when i was writing words it s hard to wrap book up in a few lines but delmore schwartz is kind of a formalist i m opposite i m in mud as a writer so i could do with a bit of schwartz and that s why i enjoy him song was developed from a riff guitarist edge developed during a soundcheck in auckland new zealand on lovetown tour in 1989 flanagan 1996 p 444 he noted that beat is unusual for a u2 song saying it was jumping off point to try and do something with an unusual beat producer daniel lanois became disoriented with direction u2 took acrobat during its recording bono noted daniel had such a hard time on that he was trying to get us to play to our strengths and i didn t want to i wanted to play to our weaknesses i wanted to experiment bono noted that end product doesn t quite get off ground way i d hoped it would an early mix of track was included on some versions of 20th anniversary reissue of achtung baby mix titled baby acrobat contained lyrics that were later modified to a different perspective you know i d hit out if i only knew who to hit instead of final i know you d hit out if you only knew who to hit or scrapped entirely if sky turns to purple and moon turns to blood will you dig me out when i m face down in mud composition and theme acrobat is played in a time signature edge noted it s a very irish time signature it s used in a lot of traditional irish music but in rock and roll you don t really hear it that much in time leading up to start of achtung baby sessions u2 listened to records which had a hard edged industrial kind of sound including works by kmfdm and sonic youth as well as artists such as roy orbison and jacques brel these influences led band to seek creation of songs which were harder musically than their previous work while remaining personal lyrically acrobat is one of most personal songs on achtung baby with bono acknowledging personal weakness contradictions and inadequacy edge noted that song contained a bit of venom likening it to bitter john lennon tradition of working class hero slightly snarling and cynical bono stated as we moved from eighties to nineties i stopped throwing rocks at obvious symbols of power and abuse of it i started throwing rocks at my own hypocrisy acrobat goes don t believe what you hear don t believe what you see if you just close your eyes you can feel enemy i can t remember it but point is you start to see world in a different way and you re part of problem not just part of solution assayas 2005 p 106 in 2006 he noted it was a song about being a hypocrite and i think we all can be and i certainly have been and you know you exact very high standards on people in world but then you don t live them personally noting theme was most evident in lyric i must be an acrobat to talk like this and act like that hot press editor niall stokes felt edge s guitar playing combined elements of where streets have no name with bullet blue sky speaking of its theme he said at its heart is an awareness of ravages of time and what it does to people and to relationships but beyond that there is self awareness that itself comes only with experience bono acknowledges his own weakness and inadequacy he is more conscious now than ever before of contradictions in his own position andy greene of rolling stone believed aggressive and venomous song reflected bono s thoughts during album sessions saying nearly every lyric brims with rage it was a new decade and it was quite possible they were about to be dismissed as a relic of past u2 biographer bill flanagan credits bono s habit of keeping his lyrics in flux until last minute with providing a narrative coherence to album flanagan 1996 p 20 flanagan interpreted achtung baby as using moon as a metaphor for a dark woman seducing singer away from his virtuous love sun he is tempted away from domestic life by an exciting nightlife and tests how far he can go before returning home flanagan 1996 p 187 for flanagan final three songs on achtung baby ultraviolet light my way acrobat and love is blindness are about how couple deal with suffering they have forced on each other hot press writer joe jackson felt that song was dominated by a theme of moral confusion author john luerssen believed song was about fight to persevere he added it was long on piss and vinegar as evidenced by its snarling cynical approach craig delancey an assistant professor of philosophy at state university of new york cited conclusion of acrobat as an example of how rock music can be profoundly successful at evoking mixture of anger and contempt that can keep you going in face of seemingly overwhelming opposition he noted that powerful closing sentiments of achtung babys acrobat can help us feel motivated and empowered in face of powers that want us to feel powerless delancey 2006 pp 130 131 timothy cleveland head of philosophy department at new mexico state university wrote that opening lyric was an introspection of self he noted here feeling is contrasted with perceptual states that make one aware of world around them enemy that one can feel is oneself to feel in this case refers to a kind of awareness one has of oneself independent of sensations of outside world like perceptual feeling it is a kind of direct awareness and so a kind of knowledge by acquaintance cleveland 2006 p 182 robyn brothers felt line i d break bread and wine if there was a church i could receive in referenced feelings of spiritual alienation brothers 1999 p 257 she compared song to zooropa stating that both reference a response to uncertainty and an unavoidable feeling of alienation brothers 1999 pp 251 257 writing for uncut gavin martin wondered if lyric what are we going to do now it s all been said no new ideas in house and every book has been read was an examination of band s longevity stating bono sounded fragile wounded seeming even to ponder band s usefulness he noted that it contained references to both holy communion and oral sex and compared it to fly noting that both songs were delivered in an amoral voice and helped to deconstruct prevailing image of band artist gavin friday a childhood friend of bono thought chorus line don t let bastards grind you down was a retaliation to criticism of press stokes 2005 p 108 elizabeth wurtzel of new yorker felt line gave song a political martyr complex she noted that it eventually unfurls as a song about love facing long run it comes as a relief to discover after all this time that guys in u2 are as charged and concerned with love as rest of us wurtzel 2003 p 97 reception acrobat received mixed reception from critics kitchener record felt that song added to band s tremendous presence saying that it showed band s commitment to each individual song and that it indicates a very clear evolution in bono s lyricism and band s clear artistic focus bono named it one of his favourite u2 songs a sentiment that edge agreed with mccormick 2006 p 228 stokes said for most writers acrobat would have been a slow song it was a brave attempt by a rock n roll band to find a distinctive hard edge for what was essentially another love song martin rated track 4 stars describing it as deliciously dark steve morse of boston globe felt it was one of album s exceptional love songs greg potter of vancouver sun believed it sums up bono s lyrical direction and mindset better than any song on album alluding to theory that true contentment must begin from within jon pareles of new york times had a more negative opinion of song calling lyrics pompous bill wyman of entertainment weekly was similarly dissenting stating acrobat formless and overwrought is just a mess theme of moral confusion cited by jackson was later used in u2 s song zooropa from 1993 album of same name coda in zooropa features lyric dream out loud which bono included as a reference to acrobat stokes 2005 pp 111 112 phrase dream out loud was first used by bono during lovetown tour in 1989 de la parra 2003 p 136 and has appeared several times in u2 s work since then including song always a b side to beautiful day single released in 2000 and being spoken by bono in popmart live from mexico city concert release live performances acrobat was rehearsed extensively in an acoustic form prior to third leg of zoo tv tour in 1992 de la parra 2003 p 151 end of song segued into beginning of zoo station leading concert historian pimm jal de la parra to speculate that it was being considered to open set however band did not end up performing it during tour in 2006 edge said it never became a live favourite i don t think that is what people come to u2 for in 2012 willie williams u2 s lighting designer and concert director described rehearsed version as extremely dramatic saying in a stadium situation it could be argued that it might have same dramatic impact as walking out on stage and telling audience to fuck off acrobat had not been performed live in more than 26 years luerssen 2010 p 262 until band finally gave song its debut performance during experience innocence tour on 2 may 2018 prior to performances of song on tour bono adopts stage character macphisto a representation of devil that he previously portrayed on 1993 legs of zoo tv tour character is depicted through an augmented reality video filter applied to bono s face on video displayed on screens as macphisto he comments on recent events in us such as 2017 charlottesville rally by riffing on lyrics from rolling stones song sympathy for devil macphisto this monologue by saying when you don t believe that i exist that s when i do my best work this segues into performances of acrobat bassist adam clayton confirmed that part of reason for finally playing song was because devoted u2 fans had been requesting it critics noted relevance of song s opening lines don t believe what you hear don t believe what you see in post truth world of time covers song was covered by dutch band kane on their 2000 live album with or without you reworked song for 2011 tribute album ahk toong bay bi covered
