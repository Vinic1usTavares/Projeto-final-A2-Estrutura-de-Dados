according to video game review aggregator metacritic eduardo vasconcellos of gamespy praised game s storyline and high quality voice work but criticized jagged visuals that caused character renderings to look off he also complained of lack of responsiveness in controls disjointed and awkward camera angles and slowness with which some enemies react to player items from tv series such as multi perspective screens as shown on box cover were popular for illustrating multiple viewpoints of an objective use of episode start and end graphics to mark start and end of missions was also liked script was generally described as being a redeeming feature of game although fans of series may find that viewpoints motives and reasoning of villains isn t covered well cutscenes were singled out for particular praise by ign highlighting good use of camera angles and tight focus voice acting was generally popular although some lines suffered from poor direction or emphasis in contrast device and ambiance sounds were well received with gunfire getting a particular mention gameplay mechanics were singled out as being particularly poor third person shooter sections suffered from poor camera angle management making targeting enemies feel awkward and disjointed enemy artificial intelligence for these sections was described as predictable and basic adopting repeated firing stances or ignoring character despite being shot repeatedly sniper variants of this fared better vehicle sections were also disappointing with physics and vehicle handling being rated poorly vehicles were described as feeling slow and clapped out with pursuits described as being boring use of ai in these sections were heavily criticized for being predictable and simplistic with enemy vehicles having no regard for their own safety puzzle games were also received badly being described as 15 shades of easy and 20 shades of terrible interrogation scenes were in contrast well liked with reviewers finding dialogue during these scenes entertaining times gave game four stars out of five and said it was more for 24 fans who will instantly love it so long as they don t mind another tv addiction to feed sydney morning herald gave it three and a half stars out of five stating newcomers to trials and tribulations of jack bauer are unlikely to be impressed by this game s generic shooting and driving action but fans of 24 will be quaking thanks to authentic atmosphere and gripping story set between season two and three of tv series however a v club gave it a c and stated that for once you ll wish you could skip action to get to cutscenes detroit free press gave it a similar score of two stars out of four and said controls are just too unpolished to make it worthwhile though movements are flaky and aiming is far too loose sometimes i got into a tight firefight where i couldn t hit a terrorist a few feet in front of me and driving missions are worse references external links category 2006
