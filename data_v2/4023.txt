kolberg class was a group of four light cruisers built for german imperial navy and used during first world war class comprised four vessels lead ship and ships were built between 1908 and 1910 and two kolberg and augsburg were modernized in 1916 1917 ships were armed with a main battery of twelve 10 5 cm sk l 45 guns and had a design speed of first three ships were assigned to reconnaissance forces of high seas fleet augsburg was instead used as a torpedo and gunnery training ship at outbreak of war in august 1914 augsburg was deployed to baltic while kolberg mainz and coln remained in north sea three ships were assigned to patrol duty in heligoland bight on 28 august 1914 they were attacked during battle of heligoland bight mainz and coln were both sunk in battle kolberg saw action at battle of dogger bank in january 1915 and joined augsburg for battle of gulf of riga in august 1915 both ships also saw service during operation albion in october 1917 both ships survived war kolberg was ceded to france where she was renamed colmar and served in french navy until 1927 augsburg was surrendered to japan and was then sold for scrap design general characteristics ships of kolberg class were long at waterline and long overall they had a beam of and a draft of forward and aft they displaced as designed but ships varied in their full load displacement kolberg displaced at full load mainz displaced coln displaced and augsburg displaced groner p 106 ships were steel built their hulls were constructed with longitudinal and transverse steel frames hulls contained thirteen watertight compartments and a double bottom that extended for fifty percent of length of keel ships were good sea boats although they suffered from severe rolling and were fairly stiff they were not very maneuverable and had a large turning radius steering was controlled by a single rudder their transverse metacentric height was ships had a standard crew of 18 officers and 349 enlisted men and carried a number of smaller vessels including one picket boat one barge one cutter two yawls and two dinghies machinery all four ships had slightly different propulsion systems in order to test engines from competing companies gardiner gray p 159 kolberg was equipped with two sets of melms pfenniger steam turbines driving four three bladed propellers in diameter mainz was powered by two aeg curtiss turbines driving a pair of three bladed screws in diameter coln initially had zoelly turbines though before sea trials these were replaced with two sets of germania turbines with four three bladed screws two were in diameter and two were wide augsburg was equipped with two sets of parsons turbines with four 3 bladed screws 2 25 m in diameter all four ships were equipped with fifteen marine type water tube boilers divided into four boiler rooms on centerline in 1916 kolberg and augsburg were equipped with supplementary oil firing to increase burn rate of coal fired boilers mainz and coln had been sunk by that time ships engines were designed to give with exception of mainzs engines which were rated at these were powered by fifteen coal fired marine water tube boilers which were trunked into three evenly spaced funnels these gave ships a top speed of mainzs more powerful engines gave her a half knot speed advantage all four ships exceeded these figures on speed trials however and all four cruisers reached speeds in excess of kolberg carried of coal and after 1916 of oil this gave her a maximum range of approximately at mainz carried of coal which allowed her to steam for at cruising speed coln carried of coal for a cruising radius of augsburg carried and had same radius of action as coln armament and armor ships were armed with twelve 10 5 cm sk l 45 guns in single pedestal mounts two were placed side by side forward on forecastle eight were located amidships four on either side and two were side by side aft for kolberg and augsburg 10 5 cm guns were replaced in 1916 1917 with six 15 cm sk l 45 guns they also carried four 5 2 cm sk l 55 anti aircraft guns though these were replaced on surviving ships with a pair of two 8 8 cm sk l 45 anti aircraft guns in 1918 they were also equipped with a pair of torpedo tubes submerged in hull two deck mounted torpedo tube launchers were added to kolberg and augsburg in 1918 all four ships could also carry 100 mines ships were protected with a combination of normal steel and krupp cemented steel armor consisted of a layer of krupp steel backed with two layers of steel from stern to stem deck was covered with thick armor aft thick armor plate over machinery spaces 20 mm thick armor forward of machinery spaces and on bow for ships funnels were thick conning tower had 100 mm thick sides and a 20 mm
