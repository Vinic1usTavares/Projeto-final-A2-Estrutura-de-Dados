operation cobra was codename for an offensive launched by first united states army lieutenant general omar bradley seven weeks after d day landings during normandy campaign of world war ii intention was to take advantage of distraction of germans by british and canadian attacks around caen in operation p 64 and break through german defenses that were penning in his troops while germans were unbalanced once a corridor had been created first army would then be able to advance into brittany rolling up german flanks once free of constraints of bocage country after a slow start offensive gathered momentum and german resistance collapsed as scattered remnants of broken units fought to escape to seine lacking resources to cope with situation german response was ineffectual and entire normandy front soon collapsed operation cobra together with concurrent offensives by british second army and canadian first army was decisive in securing an allied victory in normandy campaign having been delayed several times by poor weather operation cobra commenced on 25 july with a concentrated aerial bombardment from thousands of allied aircraft supporting offensives had drawn bulk of german armored reserves toward british and canadian sector and coupled with general lack of men and materiel available to germans it was impossible for them to form successive lines of defense units of u s vii corps led initial two division assault while other first u s army corps mounted supporting attacks designed to pin german units in place progress was slow on first day but opposition started to crumble once defensive crust had been broken by 27 july most organized resistance had been overcome and vii and viii corps advanced rapidly isolating cotentin peninsula by 31 july xix corps had destroyed last forces opposing first army which emerged from bocage reinforcements were moved west by field marshal gunther von kluge and employed in various counterattacks largest of which unternehmen luttich operation liege was launched on 7 august between mortain and avranches although this led to bloodiest phase of battle it was mounted by already exhausted and understrength units and was a costly failure on 8 august troops of newly activated third united states army captured city of le mans formerly german 7th army headquarters operation cobra transformed high intensity infantry combat of normandy into rapid maneuver warfare and led to creation of falaise pocket and loss of german position in northwestern france background following successful allied invasion of normandy on 6 june 1944 progress inland was slow to facilitate allied build up in france and to secure room for further expansion deep water port of cherbourg on western flank of american sector and historic town of caen in british and canadian sector to east were early objectives van der vat p 110 original plan for normandy campaign envisioned strong offensive efforts in both sectors in which second army lieutenant general sir miles dempsey would secure caen and area south of it and first us army lieutenant general omar bradley would wheel round to loire bradley p p 24 general sir bernard montgomery commanding all allied ground forces in normandy intended caen to be taken on d day while cherbourg was expected to fall 15 days later williams p 38 second army was to seize caen and then form a front to southeast extending to caumont l evente to acquire airfields and protect left flank of first us army as it moved on cherbourg ellis p 78 possession of caen and its surroundings desirable for open terrain that would permit maneuver warfare would also give second army a suitable staging area for a push south to capture falaise which could be used as pivot for a swing east to advance on argentan and then touques river greiss p p 81 capture of caen has been described by british official historian lionel ellis as most important d day objective assigned to british i corps lieutenant general john crocker ellis and chester wilmot called allied plan ambitious since caen sector contained strongest defenses in normandy 300px thumb anglo canadian offensives in caen area after d day from 6 june 20 july 1944 initial attempt by i corps to reach city on d day was blocked by elements of 21st panzer division and with germans committing most of reinforcements sent to meet invasion to defense of caen anglo canadian front rapidly congealed short of second army s objectives bercuson p 215 operation perch in week following d day and operation epsom 26 30 june brought some territorial gains and depleted its defenders but caen remained in german hands until operation charnwood 7 9 july when second army managed to take northern part of city up to river orne in a frontal assault keegan p p 131 successive anglo canadian offensives around caen kept best of german forces in normandy including most of armor to eastern end of allied lodgement but even so first us army made slow progress against dogged german resistance in part operations were slow due to constraints of bocage landscape of densely packed banked hedgerows sunken lanes and small woods for which u s units had not trained greiss p 317 with no ports in allied hands all reinforcement and supply had to take place over beaches via two mulberry harbors and was at mercy of weather greiss p 308 310 on 19 june a severe storm descended on english channel lasting for three days and causing significant delays to allied build up and cancellation of some operations williams p 114 first us army advance in western sector was eventually halted by bradley before town of saint lo to concentrate on seizure of cherbourg williams p p 312 defense of cherbourg consisted largely of four german battlegroups formed from remnants of units that had retreated up cotentin peninsula but port defenses had been designed principally to meet an attack from sea hastings p 163 organized german resistance ended only on 27 june when 9th us infantry division managed to reduce defenses of cap de la hague north west of port hastings p 165 within four days vii corps major general j lawton collins resumed offensive toward saint lo alongside xix corps and viii corps causing germans to move more armor into u s sector greiss p 316 planning originator of idea for operation cobra is disputed according to montgomery s official biographer foundation of operation cobra was laid on 13 june williams p 126 planning was immensely aided by detailed ultra intelligence which supplied up to date decodes of communications between oberkommando der wehrmacht okw german armed forces high command and hitler s generals lewin p 336 montgomery s plan at that time called for u s first army to take saint lo and coutances and then make two southward thrusts one from caumont toward vire and mortain and other from saint lo toward and avranches although pressure was to be kept up along cotentin peninsula towards la haye du puits and valognes capture of cherbourg was not priority with capture of cherbourg by vii corps on 27 june montgomery s initial timetable was overtaken by events and thrust from caumont was never adopted esposito pp 78 80 following conclusion of operation charnwood and cancellation of first army offensive towards saint lo montgomery met with bradley and dempsey on 10 july to discuss plans for 21st army group wilmot p p p 49 bradley said that progress on western flank was very slow but that plans had been laid for another breakout attempt codenamed operation cobra to be launched by first army on 18 july blumenson p p este p p p p 175 montgomery approved plan and that strategy would remain diversion of german attention from first army to british and canadian sector bradley p 272 dempsey was instructed to go on hitting drawing german strength especially armour onto yourself so as to ease way for brad to accomplish this operation goodwood was planned and eisenhower ensured that both operations would have support of allied strategic bombers thumb german dispositions night of 24 25 july 1944 on 12 july bradley briefed his commanders on cobra plan which consisted of three phases main effort would be under control of vii corps in first phase breakthrough attack would be conducted by 9th infantry division major general manton s eddy and 30th infantry division major general leland hobbs which would break into german defensive zone and then hold flanks of penetration while 1st infantry division major general clarence huebner and 2nd armored division major general edward h brooks pushed into depth of position until resistance collapsed 1st infantry division was to take marigny with this objective exploited by a stream of general watson s 3rd armored division armor that would move south toward coutances 2nd armored division part of collins exploitation force of 2nd armored division in east of vii corps sector and 1st infantry division reinforced by combat command b of 3rd armored division in west would pass through 30th infantry division sector and guard overall american left flank if vii corps succeeded western german position would become untenable permitting a relatively easy advance to southwest end of bocage to cut off and seize brittany peninsula hastings p pp 76 77 first army intelligence estimated that no german counterattack would occur in first few days after cobra s launch and that if they did later they would be no more than battalion sized operations cobra was to be a concentrated attack on a front unlike previous american broad front offensives and would have a mass of air support hastings pp 249 250 fighter bombers would concentrate on hitting forward german defenses in a belt immediately south of saint lo periers road while general spaatz s heavy bombers would bomb to a depth of behind german main line of resistance williams p 181 it was anticipated that physical destruction and shock value of a short intense preliminary bombardment would greatly weaken german defense so in addition to divisional artillery army and corps level units would provide support including nine heavy five medium and seven light artillery battalions over 1 000 divisional and corps artillery pieces were committed to p 151 and approximately 140 000 artillery rounds were allocated to operation in vii corps with another 27 000 for viii corps griess p p 219 to overcome constraints of bocage that had made attacks so difficult and costly for both sides rhino modifications were made to some m4 sherman m5a1 stuart tanks and m10 tank destroyers by fitting them with hedge breaching tusks that could force a path through hedgerows hastings p 252 german tanks remained restricted to roads but u s armored vehicles could maneuver more freely although effectiveness of devices was exaggerated zaloga p 3 by eve of cobra 60 percent of tanks of first army had rhino modification weigley p 149 to preserve operational security bradley forbade their use until cobra was launched blumenson p 207 in all 1 269 m4 medium tanks 694 m5a1 light tanks and 288 m10 tank destroyers were available zaloga p 30 supporting operations thumb men of 1st battalion welsh guards part of 32nd guards brigade of guards armoured division in action near cagny 19 july 1944 on 18 july british viii and i corps to east of caen launched operation goodwood offensive began with largest air bombardment in support of ground forces yet with more than 1 000 aircraft dropping of high explosive and fragmentation bombs from low altitude williams p 161 german positions to east of caen were shelled by 400 artillery pieces and many villages were reduced to rubble but german artillery further to south on bourguebus ridge was outside range of british p 165 and defenders of cagny and were largely unscathed by bombardment williams p 167 this contributed to losses suffered by second army which sustained over 4 800 casualties principally an armored offensive between 250 and 400 british tanks were put out of action although recent examination suggests that only 140 were completely destroyed with an additional 174 damaged trew pp 97 98 operation remains largest tank battle ever fought by british der vat p 158 and resulted in expansion of orne bridgehead and capture of caen on south bank of orne simultaneously ii canadian corps on western flank of goodwood began operation atlantic to strengthen allied foothold along banks of orne river and take verrieres ridge to south of caen copp approach to verrieres ridge atlantic made initial gains but ran out of steam as casualties mounted having cost canadians 1 349 men and with heavily defended ridge firmly in german hands atlantic was closed down on 20 july zuehlke p 166 at montgomery s urging strongly underlined in supreme commander s communications to montgomery ii canadian corps commander lieutenant general guy simonds began a second offensive a few days later codenamed operation spring this had limited but important aim of tying down german units to prevent them from being transferred to american sector although simonds took opportunity to make another bid for verrieres ridge stacey pp 195 196 again fighting for verrieres ridge proved extremely bloody for canadians with 25 july marking costliest day for a canadian battalion black watch royal highland regiment of canada since dieppe raid of 1942 bercuson p 225 a counterstroke by two german divisions pushed canadians back past their start lines and simonds had to commit reinforcements to stabilize front with goodwood canadian operations caused germans to commit most of their armor and reinforcements to eastern sector operation spring despite its cost had drawn 9th ss panzer division away from u s sector on eve of operation cobra hastings p 256 only two panzer divisions with 190 tanks now faced first army jackson p 113 seven panzer divisions with 750 tanks were around caen far away from operation cobra as were all heavy tiger tank battalions and three nebelwerfer brigades in normandy hastings p p 389 logistics each division consumed of supplies daily allied offensive preliminary attacks thumb left bradley and collins near cherbourg to gain good terrain for operation cobra bradley and collins conceived a plan to push forward to saint lo periers road along which vii and viii corps were securing jumping off positions hastings p 249 on 18 july at a cost of 5 000 casualties american 29th and 35th infantry divisions managed to gain vital heights of saint lo driving back general der eugen meindl s ii parachute corps meindl s paratroopers together with 352nd infantry division which had been in action since its d day defense of omaha beach were now in ruins and stage for main offensive was set due to poor weather conditions that had also been hampering goodwood and atlantic bradley decided to postpone cobra for a few days a decision that worried montgomery as british and canadian operations had been launched to support a breakout attempt that was failing to materialize hastings p p 174 by 24 july skies had cleared enough for start order to be given and 1 600 allied aircraft took off for normandy however weather closed in again over battlefield under poor visibility conditions more than 25 americans were killed and 130 wounded in bombing before air support operation was postponed until following day some enraged soldiers opened fire on their own aircraft a not uncommon practice in normandy when suffering from friendly fire main attack and breakthrough 25 27 july thumb 300px operation cobra 25 29 july 1944 after one day postponement cobra got underway at 09 38 on 25 july when around 600 allied fighter bombers attacked strongpoints and enemy artillery along a wide strip of ground located in st lo area williams p 180 for next hour 1 800 heavy bombers of u s eighth air force saturated a area on saint lo periers road succeeded by a third and final wave of medium bombers hastings p 254 approximately 3 000 u s aircraft had carpet bombed a narrow section of front with panzer lehr division taking brunt of attack however once again not all casualties were german bradley had specifically requested that bombers approach target from east out of sun and parallel to saint lo periers road in order to minimize risk of friendly losses but most of airmen instead came in from north perpendicular to front line bradley however had apparently misunderstood explanations from heavy bomber commanders that a parallel approach was impossible because of time and space constraints bradley had set additionally a parallel approach would not in any event have assured that all bombs would fall behind german lines because of deflection errors or obscured aim points due to dust and smoke sullivan p 107 despite efforts by u s units to identify their positions inaccurate bombing by eighth air force killed 111 men and wounded 490 williams p 182 dead included bradley s friend and fellow west pointer lieutenant general lesley mcnair highest ranking u s soldier to be killed in action in european theater of operations by 11 00 infantry began to move forward advancing from crater to crater beyond what had been german outpost line although no serious opposition was forecast remnants of fritz bayerlein s panzer lehr consisting of roughly 2 200 men and 45 armored vehicles had regrouped and were prepared to meet advancing u s troops and to west of panzer lehr german 5th parachute division had escaped bombing almost intact williams p 183 collins vii corps were quite disheartened to meet fierce enemy artillery fire which they expected to have been suppressed by bombing hastings p 255 several u s units found themselves entangled in fights against strongpoints held by a handful of german tanks supporting infantry and guns vii corps gained only during rest of day however if first day s results had been disappointing general collins found cause for encouragement although germans were fiercely holding their positions these did not seem to form a continuous line and were susceptible to being outflanked or bypassed even with prior warning of american offensive british and canadian actions around caen had convinced germans that real threat lay there and tied down their available forces to such an extent that a succession of meticulously prepared defensive positions in depth as encountered during goodwood and atlantic were not created to meet cobra thumb 300px st lo breakthrough 25 31 july on morning of 26 july u s 2nd armored division and 1st infantry division joined attack as planned reaching one of cobra s first objectives a road junction north of le mesnil herman following day hastings p 257 also on 26 july viii corps major general troy h middleton entered battle led by 8th u s infantry division and 90th u s infantry division despite clear paths of advance through floods and swamps across their front both divisions initially disappointed first army by failing to gain significant p 258 but first light next morning revealed that germans had been compelled to retreat by their crumbling left flank leaving only immense minefields to delay viii corps by noon on 27 july 9th u s infantry division was also clear of any organized german resistance and was advancing rapidly breakout and advance 28 30 july by 28 july german defenses across u s front had largely collapsed under full weight of vii and viii corps advance and resistance was disorganized and patchy 4th armored division viii corps entering combat for first time captured coutances but met stiff opposition east of town and u s units penetrating into depth of german positions were counter attacked by elements of 2nd ss panzer division 17th ss

panzer division and 17th ss panzergrenadier division which passed through american lines in darkness other elements of 2nd armored division were attacked near and fought for six hours bradley and his commanders knew that they were dominating battlefield and such desperate assaults were no threat to american position when ordered to concentrate his division colonel heinz gunther guderian senior staff officer of 116th panzer division was frustrated by high level of allied fighter bomber activity without receiving direct support from 2nd panzer division as promised guderian stated that his panzergrenadiers could not succeed in a counterattack against americans hastings p 263 advancing southward along coast later that day u s viii corps seized town of avranches described by historian

allied attacks at both ends of normandy bridgehead by time of american breakout at avranches there was little to no reserve strength left for unternehmen luttich which had been defeated by 12 august leaving 7th army with no choice but to retire rapidly east of orne river with a rearguard of remaining armored and motorized units to allow time for surviving infantry to reach seine after first stage of withdrawal beyond orne maneuver collapsed for a lack of fuel allied air attacks and constant pressure of allied armies culminating in encirclement of german forces in falaise pocket aftermath thumb

they could now avoid defeat hastings p 277 rather than order his remaining forces to withdraw to seine adolf hitler sent a directive to von kluge demanding an immediate counterattack between mortain and avranches unternehmen luttich to annihilate enemy and make contact with west coast of cotentin peninsula d este p p 196 eight of nine panzer divisions in normandy were to be used in attack but only four one of them incomplete could be relieved from their defensive tasks and assembled in time wilmot p 401 german commanders immediately protested that such an operation was impossible given their remaining resources but these objections were overruled and counter offensive commenced on 7 august around mortain hastings p 283 2nd 1st ss and 2nd ss panzer divisions led assault although with
