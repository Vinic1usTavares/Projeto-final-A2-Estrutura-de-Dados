direction of endeavor for chinese christianity in construction of new china commonly known as christian manifesto or three self manifesto was a political manifesto of protestants in china whereby they backed newly founded people s republic of china prc and leadership of communist party of china cpc published in 1950 manifesto paved way for government controlled three self patriotic movement tspm of protestants this movement proclaimed three principles of self government self support and self propagation drafting and content of manifesto was and remains controversial to this day manifesto was devised after protestant leaders presented their concerns with religious freedom to zhou enlai premier of china instead of receiving their report zhou demanded them to come up with a statement in support of new communist leadership y t wu and other leftist clergymen espoused task and presented a draft manifesto that after some opposition and changes became a foundational text of christianity in new people s republic it condemns missionary activities in china as a form of imperialism pledges loyalty to communist leadership and encourages church to take up an indigenous chinese stance toward christianity published on front page of people s daily manifesto was accompanied by a campaign to gather signatures many christian leaders and laymen signed while others refused to do so after korean war broke out campaign became an increasingly politicized test of loyalty that became merged with campaign to suppress counterrevolutionaries some view manifesto as a betrayal of church while others find sympathy for position of chinese christians struggling to reconcile their faith with changed political situations manifesto ended missionary activities in china and separation of church and state it led to founding tspm and brought persecution to dissidents background after declaration of people s republic of china prc in 1949 religious life in mainland china was forced to adapt itself in relation to new rulers of all religions in china christianity was particularly susceptible to such pressure because its inherently foreign character made government think of it as a political threat communist party of china cpc was compelled to draw up a plan to persecute christians whose religion it viewed as an ideological competitor of marxism or at least to make christian population politically accountable at same time common program adopted by chinese people s political consultative conference in 1949 de facto interim constitution of prc guaranteed freedom of religion chinese protestants dispatched envoys all over china to see how this provision was being met in practice upon their return they planned to write a report about situation and present it to chinese government chinese church faced four problems in changed reality it was dependent on foreign funding its confession was fundamentally at odds with communist ideology it was wary of how local cpc cadres would implement religious policy of new government and finally church was uneasy with china s foreign policy of friendly ties with soviet union in order to exert control government supported those christian groups that were willing to accommodate one such group were chinese protestants who were based in shanghai headed by y t wu secretary of ymca in china wu had envisioned transforming chinese church even before 1949 he developed ideas ranging from advocating social gospel to christian socialism and communism government s political goals thus coincided with his core ideas of christian manifesto had already been presented by wu in a 1948 article present day tragedy of christianity similarly in december 1949 wu s associates published an open letter message from chinese christians to mission boards abroad that declared foreign missionary activities unwelcome in china and called for their legacy to be critically reassessed wu and his associates would implement government s desires by publishing a document outlining chinese christianity in new era by late summer of 1950 christian manifesto had become part of a campaign to establish three self patriotic movement tspm to replace its more outward oriented predecessor national christian council of china ncc tspm would not be a church but a government sponsored parachurch organization directly controlled by religious affairs division rad now state administration for religious affairs which in turn is under united front work department of cpc role of tspm was and still is to ensure that protestant churches approved by officials operate according to government s religious policy history thumb y t wu left having a conversation with mao zedong in june 1950 between approval and publication of christian manifesto y t wu and other shanghai churchmen were joined by protestants from northern regions of china to hold talks with premier zhou enlai in may 1950 some of other christian leaders included in 19 strong delegation were deng t c chao and three such meetings were arranged on 2nd 6th and 13th each lasting several hours on agenda were most likely all four problems of church reliance on foreign funding irreconcilability of faith and communist ideology suspicion towards local party cadres and resistance to china s friendly ties with soviet union it was however local cpc cadres that were church leaders main concern and reason they had requested audience with zhou churchmen had prepared a letter to zhou explaining adversities faced by church and likely hoped to get assurances of protection from him zhou however turned tables on them insisting that they came up with a new document that supported government instead delegation was forced to cancel its future appointments in provinces and start working on manifesto at final meeting a first draft manifesto was presented by wu and approved by government manifesto had been largely composed by wu it is possible that wu and zhou had privately agreed on writing manifesto beforehand wu was in contact with zhou throughout drafting but accusations at home and abroad that zhou had personally penned manifesto have proven unsubstantiated some attributed work to chen of china democratic league whose writings were very similar in content among protestant parties concerned attitudes to situation varied widely and so writing manifesto had been as painstaking as it was controversial churches in china protested draft and wu was forced to make some changes although he refused other suggestions on grounds of time constraints draft ultimately went through several revisions some of which were discussed with leaders of cpc in beijing some members of clergy were left discontent and they withdrew from movement led by wu manifesto was issued on 28 july later on 23 september it was published on front page of people s daily with editorials and signatures release spanned three pages wide circulation followed over subsequent days christian magazine tian feng and other newspapers particularly in shanghai published it as well it was publication in newspaper of cpc that made it an authoritative statement however both chinese church and foreign missionaries were left out of process from that point on publication was accompanied by a campaign among protestants to collect signatures in support of it signatures document s 40 original signatories were all church leaders including t c chao jiang zhao and initial publication in people s daily was accompanied by 1 527 signatures from christian leaders these names included han yu zhu and sun tian feng closely followed success of manifesto and number of its signatories by end of august more than 1 500 had signed 3 000 by september and 20 000 by november january 1951 saw figure go up to 90 000 and april 180 000 campaign ultimately reached 417 389 claimed signatories before circulation was over in 1954 amounting to about half of all chinese protestants more than one million additional signatures were gathered after official circulation had been concluded high number of signatures has since been disputed by journalist david aikman and others for instance more lutherans purportedly signed document than were in existence in china it has also been claimed that many names were included without consent regardless number of signatories can be interpreted in two ways a relatively high number of signatories testifies to success of wu and campaign to accommodate to communist government conversely number of people who did not sign manifesto count as people who did not want chinese church to sever its links with foreigners it was feared that ncc which had facilitated cooperation between chinese protestants and foreign missionaries since 1922 would lose its independence most appear to have signed document out of patriotic sentiments not because of fundamental agreement with actual provisions of manifesto not all were convicted marxists it is also possible that becoming a signatory was initially on a voluntary basis but after korean war had broken out doing so certainly became a test of loyalty that could not be avoided war resulted in campaign rising to an unforeseen level of political urgency and by early 1951 it had become mingled with campaign to suppress counterrevolutionaries similar intensification affected other government led campaigns as well after china s entry into war leaders of independent chinese churches who refused to sign manifesto began to be persecuted they lost their churches pastors were arrested congregations forced underground and dissidents were dragged to denunciation meetings that sometimes could result in imprisonment or execution though only a small number of christians ended up being indicted or executed meetings were very humiliating for dissidents some notable protestant ministers such as k h ting did not sign document in ting s case reason remains unclear he stated that he supported document but said nonetheless it just happened that i haven t signed it it could have been that reason was that he was abroad at time of manifesto s circulation he could have like many did sign it after official circulation but never did this casts some doubt on his stated rationale wang ming dao outright refused to sign christian manifesto this and his deliberate failure to register his church with rad led to his imprisonment for 23 years and ensued his worldwide fame robin chen too refused to sign although he took part in activities of tspm later notably watchman nee did sign as did many members of his little flock church nee was able to gather as much as 34 983 signatures in total though most of them had been for a petition against nationalization of little flock property nee simply included them in christian manifesto as well move proved to be controversial joseph tse hei lee thinks that nee complied with wishes of campaign but tang an associate of nee has said that he was just trying to appear cooperative on surface but in reality sabotaged campaign share of signatures gathered by nee was 17 of total signatures of manifesto at time of earlier signatories of manifesto largest segment had been members of indigenous jesus family church ncc which was highest protestant authority in country also signed manifesto after years of inactivity organization convened a meeting in october 1950 meeting was initially scheduled for august but proponents of christian manifesto were able to postpone it in order to further success of manifesto preparatory committee of meeting tried to fend off attempts to have manifesto endorsed at meeting and even planned writing a counter manifesto its efforts failed and even though tspm was not even on agenda of meeting it ended up unanimously supporting manifesto and tspm effectively terminating its own organization it was first meeting in history where all chinese protestants were represented and so its signing of manifesto was of special importance from that point on road was open for both inception of tspm and success of manifesto for china author richard c bush it was this moment rather than initial publication that marked manifesto s transforming of chinese christianity content manifesto is short less than 1 000 chinese characters and unambiguous in its message manifesto has four sections first section condemns protestant missionary activities in china as a form of imperialism second part examines task of church and sides with government policy third focuses on future aims of church in patriotic terms last section lays out concrete methods christian manifesto makes three central claims first chinese church should obey new communist government and partake in building of a new china second church should cut its ties with western imperialism finally church should strive to construct a christianity indigenous to china embodying so called three self principles self government self support and self propagation manifesto urged chinese christians to pledge allegiance to new people s republic its main theme is anti imperialism manifesto stresses that imperialism had used christianity to extend its reach consciously or unconsciously directly or indirectly and that present day christianity ought to be purged from such tendencies united states is blamed for supporting reactionaries in guise of religion wording of manifesto remains controversial to this day written in carefully measured and relatively polite terms it goes out of is way not to blame church outright document urges christians to accept new communist reality rather than to denounce their faith manifesto adopts propagandistic language of chinese revolution resulting in overly optimistic and naive terms it however failed to give chinese church any guidance concerning its future in china under cpc manifesto implied that compliance would be rewarded and chinese christianity would prosper in truth government would soon engage in persecution of many christians manifesto was intended for both domestic and foreign audiences covering letter accompanying it states that its target audience is people outside church and aims to educate them about social and political position of christianity in china responses by other parties many if not most chinese protestants thought that manifesto was too radical methodist church in china refused to sign manifesto as did initially chung hua sheng kung hui anglican church in china both issued alternative manifestos of their own all anglican bishops in china later caved in and signed christian manifesto and almost all of them became tspm associates initially foreign missionary societies were perplexed by manifesto that had been preceded by mixed messages it was labeled as a partisan work of a faction within chinese church china inland mission naively brushed off charges of imperialism on grounds that churches they had founded were relatively independent when it was discovered that even devout believers had signed manifesto it was attributed to political pressure when missionaries finally realized implications of manifesto they had no choice but to condemn it regarding it as a unilateral termination of their relationship with chinese christians although chinese protestants took no immediate action against missions manifesto marked beginning of end manifesto did not specify a time frame for end of missionary activities other than within shortest possible time consequentially new missionaries were called to china even after manifesto had been issued missionary activities effectively ended in china after a tit for tat involving chinese and american governments first in november 1950 united states forbade any transfer of funds to china china retaliated by prohibiting organizations in country from receiving funding from abroad by december both countries had frozen each other s assets an immediate order to chinese churches to cease all cooperation with foreign missionaries soon followed although chinese catholics were particularly defiant they were as unable to resist as protestants their key positions having been domesticated by government consequentially catholics issued a manifesto very much like protestant one in november 1950 further analysis affiliates of chinese house churches unofficial protestant churches not affiliated with tspm and other critics of manifesto think that it sold out christianity in china to political elites leslie theodore lyall for instance called it outright a betrayal gao however points out that manifesto paints a sympathetic picture of chinese church its past allegiance to imperialism is called unfortunate and overall church s contributions are recognized gao however concedes that manifesto misled chinese christians into thinking that they would be well off with new government foreign missionaries went as far as calling manifesto failure of christian conscience in china gao argues that manifesto is not to be entirely blamed on wu rather it was a product of a particular time from 1948 to 1950 that witnessed victory of ccp and establishment of prc similarly bob whyte argues manifesto was appropriate in its historical setting as t he tide of history had left them with no other choice chinese academics and tspm attribute chinese church s modern successes to christian manifesto official chinese historiography claims that initiative for christian manifesto came from chinese protestant church and premier zhou enlai merely granted their wish according to george a hood it is more likely that zhou had effectively forced church leaders to draft a manifesto in support of government similarly oi ki ling attributes church s role to public pressure philip wickeri however points out that talks with zhou were initiated by church project of securing religious freedom in china although conditioned by chinese patriotism was thus a christian endeavor instead of a government fiat in other words church had assumed agency and independence in relation to cpc within united front wickeri also points to absence of ting s signature and initial failure of other anglicans to sign as proof of alternatives to total submission in early tspm ting managed to become head of organization and other prominent anglicans were given positions in movement too most experts think that large number of signatories cannot be explained with reference to political convenience or pressure only robert g orr thinks that number of signatories indicated that chinese christians agreed with cpc with regard to its analysis of imperialism in china in this sense it was a self imposed condemnation of missionary past of chinese church according to wickeri this was not necessarily a disadvantage since it allowed church to discover an indigenous chinese identity and a new social conscience this was central to project of tspm as well according to k h ting chinese christians genuinely espoused three self ideology chee kong lee cites patriotism as reason for manifesto s success a middle of road position holds that chinese church leaders acted with sincere aim to preserve church but by signing manifesto they had to compromise with leaders of country to achieve that end theologically christian manifesto reflects upon wu s idea that spirit of god is discernible in socio political progress according to wickeri and peter tze ming ng christian manifesto is however not so much a theological treatise as it is a political statement wickeri contends that this was only way that church could make its position understood by largely non christian chinese population who shared their patriotism but not their religion before manifesto chinese church had separated church and state matters but according to oi christian manifesto marked a turning point in this regard see also anti christian movement china chinese communist revolution chinese independent churches four olds
