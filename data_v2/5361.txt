battle of westerplatte was one of first battles in germany s invasion of poland marking start of world war ii in europe beginning on 1 september 1939 german army naval and air forces and danzig police assaulted poland s military transit depot wojskowa or wst on westerplatte peninsula in harbor of free city of danzig poles held out for seven days and repelled 13 assaults that included dive bomber attacks and naval shelling westerplatte s defense served as an inspiration for polish army and people in face of german advances elsewhere and is still regarded as a symbol of resistance in modern poland background westerplatte is a peninsula in bay of gdansk following reestablishment of polish independence after world war i much of surrounding region became part of poland however city of danzig present day gdansk poland historically an important port city became an independent city state free city of danzig free city was nominally supervised by league of nations but over time danzig became increasingly allied with germany reflecting its predominantly ethnic german population in 1921 in wake of polish soviet war league of nations granted poland right to install a garrisoned ammunition depot near gdansk despite objections from free city this right was confirmed in 1925 and an area of was selected on westerplatte peninsula westerplatte was separated from new port of free city of danzig mainly by harbor channel on land polish held part of westerplatte was separated from danzig s territory by a brick wall topped with barbed wire a dedicated rail line passing through free city connected depot with nearby polish territory depot referred to in league documents as was completed in november 1925 officially transferred to poland on last day of that year and became operational shortly after in january 1926 with 22 active storage warehouses polish garrison s complement was set at 88 soldiers 2 officers 20 ncos and rest privates and poland was prohibited construction of further military installations or fortifications on site by early 1933 german politicians and media figures complained about need for border adjustments in addition polish and french discussed need for a preventive war against germany on 6 march 1933 in what became known as westerplatte incident or crisis polish government landed a marine battalion on westerplatte briefly reinforcing outpost to about 200 men demonstrating polish resolve to defend outpost more locally polish maneuver was also intended to put pressure on danzig government which was trying to renounce a prior agreement on shared danzig polish control over harbor police and to acquire full control of police and harbor additional polish troops were withdrawn on 16 march 1933 following protests from league danzig and germany but only in exchange for danzig s withdrawal of its objections to harbor police agreement according to another source on 14 march 1933 league had authorized poland to reinforce its garrison over subsequent years poles constructed clandestine fortifications on westerplatte these were not impressive there were no bunkers or tunnels only several small outposts partially hidden in peninsula s forest and several more buildings in peninsula s center including barracks most buildings were constructed with reinforced concrete and were supported by a network of field fortifications trenches barricades and barbed wire prelude in march 1939 a german ultimatum to lithuania led to germany s annexation of nearby lithuanian coastal klaipeda region subsequently westerplatte garrison was placed on alert fearing a possible nazi coup d etat in danzig poles decided to secretly reinforce their garrison and for that purpose resorted to a subterfuge civilians in polish army uniform would leave base and new polish soldiers would enter it by late august 1939 poles had reinforced their 88 man garrison though its strength is still debated older sources speak of 182 men but more recent research suggests something in range of 210 to 240 including six officers major henryk sucharski captain franciszek dabrowski captain lieutenant lieutenant and second lieutenant estimates include some 20 mobilized civilians and about 10 regular troops who happened to be on site when fighting began in addition to light arms pistols grenades and about 160 rifles weaponry included a two antitank bofors 37 mm guns four and about 40 machine guns including 18 heavy ones field fortifications were extended more trenches were dug wooden barricades were built barbed wire was strung into wire obstacles and reinforced concrete shelters were built into basements of barracks foliage was thinned to reduce cover from expected avenues of attack polish defense which anticipated principally a german land based assault rested on three lines of defense outer line included entrenchments which were to hold long enough for garrison to mobilize second line of defense centered on six outposts final defense comprised headquarters and barracks at depot s center plan called for westerplatte to hold out for 12 hours after which siege was expected to be lifted by polish reinforcements arriving from mainland on 25 august 1939 german pre dreadnought battleship under pretext of making a courtesy call sailed into danzig harbor anchoring from westerplatte on board was a marine shock troop company with orders to launch an attack on westerplatte on morning of 26 august 1939 for their planned attack on westerplatte germans had an ss heimwehr danzig force of 1 500 men under police general friedrich georg eberhardt and 225 marines under lieutenant wilhelm henningsen in overall command was captain gustav kleikamp aboard schleswig holstein on 26 august he moved battleship farther upstream major sucharski commanding westerplatte put his garrison on heightened alert shortly before german disembarkation orders were rescinded hitler had postponed hostilities on learning of polish british common defence pact signed day before on 25 august 1939 and that italy was hesitant about its obligations under pact of steel neither general eberhardt nor captain kleikamp had specific information on polish defenses germans assumed that preliminary bombardment would soften up fortifications enough for marines to capture westerplatte reportedly captain kleikamp had been assured by danzig police that westerplatte would be taken in 10 minutes general eberhardt himself was more cautious estimating that a few hours would be needed to overcome polish garrison which germans estimated at no more than 100 men battle thumb right 400px map of battle on early morning of 1 september 1939 schleswig holstein suddenly fired a broadside salvo at polish garrison that salvo s time has been variously stated as 04 45 04 47 or 04 48 polish historian jaroslaw explains that 04 45 was planned time 04 47 was time order was given by kleikamp and 04 48 was time guns actually fired shortly after on westerplatte major sucharski radioed nearby polish military base on hel peninsula sos i m under fire eight minutes later lieutenant wilhelm henningsen s marines from schleswig holstein advanced expecting an easy victory over poles a polish soldier staff sergeant wojciech was killed by machine gun fire first combat casualty of battle and perhaps of war however soon after crossing artillery breached brick wall germans stepped into an ambush they found themselves in a kill zone of polish crossfire from concealed firing positions they believed they were also fired on by snipers in trees but that was not so while barbed wire entanglements impeded their movements poles knocked out a german machine gun nest and lt leon opened intense howitzer fire on advancing germans who faltered and broke off their attack single 75 mm field gun fired 28 shots knocking out several machine gun nests atop warehouses across harbor canal before it was destroyed by battleship s guns at 06 22 german marines frantically radioed battleship that they had sustained heavy losses and were withdrawing danzig police had tried to seize control of harbor on other side of westerplatte but had been defeated casualties were approximately 50 germans and eight poles mostly wounded a longer bombardment from battleship lasting from 07 40 to 08 55 preceded a second attack germans tried again from 08 35 to 12 30 but encountered mines felled trees barbed wire and intense fire by noon germans retreated henningsen gravely wounded on first day s combat polish side had sustained four killed and several wounded german marines had lost 16 killed and some 120 wounded german commanders concluded that a ground attack was not feasible until polish defenses had been softened re examining aerial photographs where they had previously underestimated polish defenses they now overestimated them concluding poles had constructed extensive underground and armored fortifications six haystacks were declared to be armored bunker domes in following days germans bombarded westerplatte peninsula with naval and heavy field artillery including a 105 mm howitzer battery and 210 mm mortars on 2 september from 18 05 to 18 25 a two wave air raid by 60 junkers ju 87 stuka dive bombers dropped 26 5 tons of bombs taking out polish mortars destroying outpost five with a 500 kg bomb and killing at least eight polish soldiers air raid shrouded all of westerplatte in clouds of smoke and destroyed poles only radio and much of their food supplies according to some german sources after air raid poles briefly displayed a white flag but not all historians are convinced of this and german observers may have been mistaken on 4 september a german torpedo boat t196 supported by an old minesweeper von der formerly made a surprise attack from sea side poles wal post had been abandoned and now only fort position prevented an attack from north though poles never landed a hit on german naval units t196 and schleswig holstein suffered accidents due to crew error or equipment failure with at least several injured men and at least one fatality on battleship on 5 september major sucharski held a conference with his officers during which he urged surrender post had only been supposed to hold out for twelve hours his deputy captain franciszek dabrowski opposed surrender and group decided to hold out a while longer subsequently poles repelled several cautious german probing attacks by marines danzig ss and police and wehrmacht at 03 00 on 6 september during one of attacks germans sent a burning train toward land bridge but ploy failed when terrified driver decoupled prematurely train failed to reach oil cistern and set fire to woods which had provided poles with valuable cover in addition flaming wagons created a perfect field of fire and germans suffered heavy losses a second fire train attack in afternoon likewise failed thumb german soldiers on westerplatte 8 september after battle at a second conference with his officers on 6 september sucharski was again ready to surrender german army was by now outside warsaw and westerplatte was running critically low on supplies moreover many of wounded were suffering from gangrene at 04 30 on 7 september germans opened intense fire on westerplatte which lasted till 07 00 flamethrowers and bombardment destroyed outpost two and damaged outposts one and four schleswig holstein took part in bombardments at 09 45 on 7 september 1939 a white flag appeared polish defense had so impressed germans that their commander general eberhardt let sucharski keep his ceremonial polish saber in captivity it was however confiscated later contemporary english language publications such as life and pictorial history of war misidentified polish commander as a major sucharski surrendered post to captain kleikamp and germans stood at attention as polish garrison marched out at 11 30 over 3 000 germans soldiers and support formations such as danzig police had been tied up in week long operation against small polish garrison about half of germans 570 on land over 900 at sea had taken part in direct action german casualties totaled 50 killed 16 from kriegsmarine and 150 wounded poles had lost 15 men and had sustained at least 40 wounded aftermath thumb 140px german war flag being raised on westerplatte 8 september 1939 on 8 september day after capitulation germans discovered a grave with bodies of four unidentified polish soldiers who had been executed by their comrades for attempted desertion this had likely taken place following 2 september air raids five days after capitulation on 12 september 1939 polish wireless operator sergeant kazimierz was murdered by germans he was shot after brutal interrogation during which he refused to hand over radio codes on 19 september adolf hitler came to visit gdansk while there on 21 september he inspected westerplatte controversy surrounds polish garrison s commanding officer major henryk sucharski and his executive officer captain franciszek dabrowski early historiography considered major sucharski to have been in command throughout battle and consequently early accounts portrayed him as a heroic figure more recent accounts from early 1990s have presented evidence that sucharski s officers had vowed not to disclose in their lifetimes that their commander had been shell shocked for most of battle and had advocated surrender as early as 2 september and several times thereafter and that captain dabrowski had effectively taken command following sucharski s breakdown on second day of siege sucharski s conduct is still debated by historians remembrance thumb ruins of westerplatte barracks 2005 thumb a polish naval officer delivering

independence and is inscribed in list of most heroic battles of modern europe for both sides battle had mostly political rather than tactical importance still it did tie up substantial german forces for much longer than anyone had expected notably preventing schleswig holstein from lending fire support in nearby battles of hel and gdynia westerplatte s defense inspired polish army and people even
