thalassocnus is an extinct genus of semiaquatic ground sloths from miocene and pliocene of pacific south american coast five species t antiquus t natans t littoralis t carolomartini and t yuacensis represent a chronospecies a population gradually adapting to marine life in one direct lineage they are only known aquatic sloths they have been found in pisco formation of peru and bahia inglesa coquimbo and horcon formations of chile thalassocnus are placed in subfamily thalassocninae of family megatheriidae thalassocnus evolved several marine adaptations over course of 4 million years such as dense and heavy bones to counteract buoyancy internal nostrils migrating farther into head to help with breathing while completely submerged snout becoming wider and more elongated to consume aquatic plants better and head angling farther and farther downwards to aid in bottom feeding long tail was probably used for diving and balance similarly to modern day beaver castor spp and platypus ornithorhynchus anatinus thalassocnus probably walked across seafloor and dug up food with its claws they probably could not do high powered swimming relying on paddling if necessary early thalassocnus were probably generalist grazers eating seaweed and seagrasses close to shore whereas later species specialized on seagrasses farther off coast they were probably preyed upon by sharks and macroraptorial sperm whales such as acrophyseter thalassocnus were found in formations with large marine mammal and shark assemblages taxonomy type specimens thalassocnus were ground sloths that lived from late miocene to end of pliocene late huayquerian to early uquian in salma classification and all five species were discovered in different horizons of pisco formation in peru t antiquus was discovered in aguada de lomas horizon in 7 or 8 million year old strata t natans type species from horizon lived around 6 million years ago mya t littoralis from sud sacaco horizon lived around 5 mya t carolomartini from sacaco horizon lived between 3 and 4 mya and t yaucensis from horizon lived 3 to 1 5 mya specimens were also found in bahia inglesa formation coquimbo formation and horcon formation in chile at total of three species has been identified with certainty in chilean formations t carolomartini t natans t antiquus while presence of t yaucensis is judged likely in 1995 genus thalassocnus was formally described with species t natans with a partial skeleton musm 433 by paleontologists christian de muizon and h gregory mcdonald t littoralis was described from a nearly complete skull musm sas 1615 in 2002 t carolomartini from a skull smnk pal 3814 and hands smnk pal 3814 was also described in 2002 and two t carolomartini specimens may represent one individual t antiquus was described from musm 228 in 2003 comprising a skull jaw and most of rest of body though latter is badly damaged t yuacensis was described in 2004 from a nearly complete skeleton musm 1034 and skull musm 37 etymology species name is named in honor of carlos martin late owner of sacaco hacienda and finder of several bones in pisco formation including holotype specimen and yuacensis after village which is near where species was found phylogeny in 1968 taxonomist robert placed undescribed sloth remains into family megatheriidae possibly belonging to now defunct subfamily mainly based on similarities with ankle bone and femur upon species description in 1995 they were moved into subfamily in 2004 this was later elevated to family and sloths were put into new subfamily thalassocninae in 2017 sloths were moved back to family megatheriidae thalassocninae probably diverged from during age of miocene around 16 mya five species seem to form one direct lineage chronospecies however it is possible t antiquus is not ancestor of t natans description thumb size diagram comparing a human t yuacensis red t littoralis yellow and t natans blue thalassocnus is only aquatic xenarthran a group that includes sloths anteaters and armadillos though ground sloth eionaletherium from miocene of venezuela may have adapted to nearshore life thalassocnus as time progressed increased in size t natans has most complete skeleton preserved and measures from snout to tail based on a femur to body length ratio t littoralis specimen probably a female measured in life and t yuacensis specimen thick and dense bones of younger species allowed animal to combat buoyancy and sink to seafloor similar to modern day manatees t antiquus had a bone density comparable to terrestrial ground sloths in later species bone grew to be so compact that medullary cavity which holds bone marrow was nearly absent in limbs likewise limbs made heaviest contribution to overall skeletal weight this condition has been seen in ancient archaeocete whales with reduced limbs this developed over a relatively short period of time around 4 million years modern sloths and anteaters already have denser bones than most other mammals so sloth may have had a predisposition to dense bones and developed them much faster exaptation thalassocnus may have exhibited sexual dimorphism indicated by variation of individual fossils of t littoralis and between two skulls of t carolomartini skulls show disparity in general size slenderness of teeth and length of premaxillae which make up snout size difference in premaxillae are reminiscent of developed upper lips or proboscis in males of modern mammals like elephant seal spp skull thumb thalassocnus skull cast museum of natural history karlsruhe later thalassocnus species had enlarged premaxillae and thus had a more elongated snout lower jaw progressively elongated and became more spoon shaped possibly mimicking function of splayed incisor teeth in ruminants later species had stronger lips indicated by large size of infraorbital foramen which supplies blood vessels and like modern day grazers probably had horny pads on lips like in other grazers snout had a square shape as opposed to triangular shape in browsers nostrils moved from front of snout to top of snout similar to seals in later species to adapt to feeding underwater soft palate of mouth separating trachea from esophagus was more developed and internal nostrils between nasal cavity and throat were farther inside head this also increased size of mouth however these adaptations also developed in some terrestrial mammals and so could instead be related to chewing efficiency masseter muscle on skull was probably main muscle used for biting down later species had a more powerful bite to better grasp seagrass pterygoid muscle in later species was larger to adapt to a grinding motion rather than a cutting motion while chewing thalassocnus had a hypsodont dentition pattern with high tooth crowns and tooth enamel extending beyond gums thalassocnus lacked canine teeth and had four upper and three lower molars on either side of mouth similar to other sloths teeth had an outer coating of a bonelike version of dentine and had softer inside a form of dentine that allows blood flow teeth were prism shaped with a circular cross section and teeth interlocked tightly while chewing in later species in earlier species chewing pattern sharpened their teeth earlier species had more rectangular teeth that had a similar build to giant ground sloth megatherium americanum whereas later species had squarer and larger teeth from earlier species to later species teeth show a change of function from cutting food to grinding food vertebrae thumb restoration of t natans in its hypothetical swimming pose without fur thalassocnus had 7 neck vertebrae 17 thoracic vertebrae compared to 18 in other sloths 3 lumbar vertebrae like other ground sloths and 24 tail vertebrae as opposed to other ground sloths which have less than 20 vertebral centra segments progressively became shorter in length making spine more stable probably an adaptation for digging efficiency in later species spinous processes which jut upwards from vertebrae are markedly taller in thoracic vertebrae than neck vertebrae as opposed to other sloths where they are around same height small neck vertebrae show they had weak neck muscles as an aquatic creature does not need to hold its head up and neck probably faced downwards while at rest however atlanto occipital joint which controls neck movement was stronger than it is in other sloths which was probably an adaptation for bottom feeding to keep head in a fixed position like in whales head could align directly with spine spinous process of first thoracic vertebra is nearly vertical but unlike other sloths other vertebrae incline towards tail inclination increases in later species with t littoralis and t carolomartini having a 70deg inclination as opposed to t antiquus and t natans with a 30deg inclination inclination begins to decrease at ninth thoracic vertebra this inclination may have caused less developed back muscles that would have been needed for high powered swimming structure of tail vertebrae indicates strong musculature and is similar to beaver castor spp and platypus ornithorhynchus anatinus which use their tails for balance and diving rather than propulsion while swimming length of tail proportionally longer than other ground sloths was probably a diving adaptation similar to modern day cormorants spp which use their long tails to provide downward lift to resist buoyancy limbs indicated by large fossae or depressions on shoulder blades elbow and wrist later thalassocnus species had strong arm muscles these and relatively shorter arms were probably adaptations for digging thalassocnus had five claws decreasing width of legs in later species and reduction of iliac crests of pelvis indicate less reliance on them for support relying more on buoyancy and animal probably preferred to sit semi submerged in water while resting legs also became more flexible with later species able to at maximum extension have femora reach a horizontal position parallel to torso femur and kneecap are smaller in t yuacensis than in t natans unlike other ground sloths which put a lot of stress on their hind limbs for locomotion specifically from standing on two legs bipedalism leg bones of thalassocnus are slender bipedalism also led to shorter tibiae in ground sloths opposite is seen in thalassocnus where tibiae and femora are about same length earlier species like other sloths bore their weight on sides of their feet whereas later species planted their feet flat plantigrade to better paddle and walk along seafloor digits decreased in size in later species third digit was constantly flexed perhaps acting like a crampon to anchor itself to seafloor while digging like other ground sloths fifth digit was vestigial and non functioning paleobiology thumb left thalassocnus probably walked seafloor like desmostylians above thalassocnus were nearshore herbivores which likely became aquatic due to desertification of land and a lack of terrestrial food earlier species were likely general grazers that foraged for seagrass and seaweed along sandy coastline indicated by scratch marks on teeth caused by chewing sand probably foraging in areas with a depth of less than t antiquus probably did not enter water to feed instead eating plants that washed ashore conversely later species t carolomartini and t yaucensis lacking these marks probably fed in deeper waters in a manner similar to manatees earlier species chewed with jaws going up and down to mash food whereas later species chewed with jaws going front to back to grind it later species fed entirely on seafloor similar to sirenians manatees and dugongs and extinct desmostylians becoming specialist bottom feeders of seagrasses they probably fed on seagrasses which are known from pisco formation specifically marine eelgrass zostera tasmanica which is now only known from australia later thalassocnus probably mainly walked across seafloor instead of swimming through water they possessed no adaptations for high powered swimming probably paddling like terrestrial mammals later species probably dug up seagrasses to roots with their claws like beaver and platypus though like sirenians also used strong lips to rip out grasses their diet may have also included buried food thumb thalassocnus were perhaps preyed upon by acrophyseter above thalassocnus may have used their claws for loosening dirt cutting vegetation grasping food or anchoring themselves to seafloor they may have also used claws to grab onto rocks during strong waves and there are tibiae and fibulae remains that have been broken and healed indicating individual may have been thrown against rocks of shore during a storm this individual may have used its claws to drag itself onto shore thalassocnus may have competed with sirenians for seagrasses they along with other marine mammals of bahia inglesa formation could have been killed by harmful algal blooms they may have been preyed upon by macroraptorial sperm whale acrophyseter and injured individuals vulnerable to shark attacks paleoecology thalassocnus fossils have been found in peru and chile an area which has been a desert since middle miocene pisco formation of peru is known for its wide assemblage of marine vertebrates several whales are known most commonly mid sized baleen whales other whales found are rorqual baleen whale balaenoptera siberi beaked whale dolphin some oceanic dolphins tusked dolphin odobenocetops and macroraptorial sperm whales acrophyseter and livyatan other vertebrates include seals acrophoca and sea turtles such as which probably also fed on seagrasses crocodile piscogavialis cormorants petrels and boobies sula spp formation has a large cartilaginous fish assemblage mainly belonging to ground sharks such as requiem sharks and hammerhead sharks and to a lesser extent mackerel sharks such as white sharks sand sharks and many shark teeth were associated with extinct broad tooth mako and megalodon megalodon other cartilaginous fish include eagle rays sawfish and angelsharks most of bony fish findings represent tunas and croakers livyatan and megalodon were probably apex predators in chile bahia inglesa formation in caldera basin is known for a large shark population especially broad toothed mako and great white shark carcharodon carcharias others include blue shark glauca smalltooth sand tiger odontaspis ferox pristiophorus sawsharks squatina angelsharks bullhead sharks spp eagle rays and spp prion seabirds were found here it also yielded several marine mammals a rorqual acrophoca sperm whale scaldicetus and odobenocetops coquimbo formation in bay and horcon formation of valparaiso basin also display diverse shark assemblages including megalodon great white shark carcharodon shortfin mako pristiophorus sawsharks smalltooth sand tiger carcharhinus sharks school shark galeorhinus galeus copper shark carcharhinus brachyurus and bluntnose sixgill shark hexanchus griseus several penguin species are known from all three of these formations such as ancient banded penguins spp extinction thalassocnus went extinct at end of pliocene due to a cooling trend that followed closing of central american seaway which killed off much of seagrass of pacific south american coast as seagrass specialists later species of thalassocnus had evolved negative buoyancy to allow them to feed at sea floor similar to modern dugongs this feeding style probably involved bottom walking like hippopotamuses and extinct desmostylians and digging negative buoyancy requires dense bones and a limited layer of blubber which would make thermoregulation difficult for them in cooler water temperatures particularly in view of low metabolic rate of xenarthrans thus thalassocnus would have been poorly adapted to changing conditions even if enough seagrass remained to subsist on see also
