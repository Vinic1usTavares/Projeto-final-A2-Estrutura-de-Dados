thumb right 250 px hurricane qpf tropical cyclone rainfall forecasting involves using scientific models and other tools to predict precipitation expected in tropical cyclones such as hurricanes and typhoons knowledge of tropical cyclone rainfall climatology is helpful in determination of a tropical cyclone rainfall forecast more rainfall falls in advance of center of cyclone than in its wake heaviest rainfall falls within its central dense overcast and eyewall slow moving tropical cyclones like hurricane danny and hurricane wilma can lead to highest rainfall amounts due to prolonged heavy rains over a specific location however vertical wind shear leads to decreased rainfall amounts as rainfall is favored downshear and slightly left of center and side is left devoid of rainfall presence of hills or mountains near coast as is case across much of mexico haiti dominican republic much of central america madagascar reunion china and japan act to magnify amounts on their windward side due to forced ascent causing heavy rainfall in mountains a strong system moving through mid latitudes such as a cold front can lead to high amounts from tropical systems occurring well in advance of its center movement of a tropical cyclone over cool water will also limit its rainfall potential a combination of factors can lead to exceptionally high rainfall amounts as was seen during hurricane mitch in central america federal emergency management agency are you ready retrieved on 2006 04 05 use of forecast models can help determine magnitude and pattern of rainfall expected climatology and persistence models such as r cliper can create a baseline for tropical cyclone rainfall forecast skill simplified forecast models such as kraft technique and eight and sixteen inch rules can create quick and simple rainfall forecasts but come with a variety of assumptions which may not be true such as assuming average forward motion average storm size and a knowledge of rainfall observing network tropical cyclone is moving towards forecast method of trap assumes that rainfall structure tropical cyclone currently has changes little over next 24 hours global forecast model which shows

of center with lesser amounts farther away from center most of rainfall in hurricanes is concentrated within its radius of gale force winds j matyas relating tropical cyclone rainfall patterns to storm size retrieved on 2007 02 14 larger tropical cyclones have larger rain shields which can lead to higher rainfall amounts farther from cyclone s center storms which have moved slowly or loop lead to highest rainfall amounts riehl calculated that of rainfall per day can be expected within one half degree or of center of a mature tropical cyclone herbert riehl tropical meteorology mcgraw hill book company inc new york 1954 pages 293 297 many tropical cyclones progress at a forward motion of 10 knots which would limit duration of this excessive rainfall to around one quarter of a day which would yield about of rainfall this would be true over water within of coastline russell tropical cyclone quantitative precipitation forecasting retrieved on 2007 02 25 and outside topographic features as a cyclone moves farther inland and is cut off from its supply of warmth and moisture ocean rainfall amounts from tropical cyclones and their remains decrease quickly vertical wind shear thumb right

frank d marks jr effects of vertical wind shear and storm motion on tropical cyclone rainfall asymmetries deduced from trmm retrieved on 2007 03 28 if wind shear is strong enough bulk of rainfall will move away from center leading to what is known as an exposed circulation center when this occurs potential magnitude of rainfall with tropical cyclone will be significantly reduced interaction with frontal boundaries and upper level troughs as a tropical cyclone interacts with an upper level trough and related surface front a distinct northern area of precipitation is seen along front ahead of axis of upper level trough surface fronts with water amounts of or more and upper level divergence overhead east of an upper level trough can lead to significant rainfall norman w junker original maddox et al mcs archetypes associated with flash flooding retrieved on 2007 06 24 this type of interaction can lead to appearance of heaviest rainfall falling along and to left of tropical cyclone

for isabel 2003 climatology and persistence hurricane research division of atlantic oceanographic and meteorological laboratory created r cliper rainfall climatology and persistence model to act as a baseline for all verification regarding tropical cyclone rainfall theory is if global forecast models cannot beat predictions based on climatology then there is no skill in their use there is a definite advantage to using forecast track with r cliper because it could be run out 120 hours 5 days with forecast track of any tropical cyclone globally within a short amount of time frank marks and tropical cyclones retrieved on 2007 03 15 short range variation which uses persistence is tropical rainfall potential technique trap technique which uses satellite derived rainfall amounts from microwave imaging satellites and extrapolates current rainfall configuration forward for 24 hours along current forecast track elizabeth ebert sheldon kusselson and michael turk validation of tropical rainfall potential trap forecasts for australian tropical cyclones retrieved on 2007 03 28 this technique s main flaw is that it assumes a steady state tropical cyclone which undergoes little structural change with time which is why it is only run forward for 24 hours into future stanley q kidder sheldon j kusselson john a knaff and robert j kuligowski improvements to experimental tropical rainfall potential trap technique retrieved on 2007 03 15 thumb right 150px gfs for isabel 2003 numerical weather prediction computer models can be used to diagnose magnitude of tropical cyclone rainfall since forecast models output their information on a grid they only give a general idea as to areal coverage of moderate to heavy rainfall no current forecast models run at a small enough grid

frank marks wsr 88d derived rainfall distributions in hurricane danny 1997 retrieved on 2007 04 13 it was noted from rainfall amounts in imperial units reported by first order rainfall network in united states that storm total rainfall fit a simple equation 100 divided by speed of motion in knots norman w junker hurricanes and extreme rainfall retrieved on 2007 03 15 this rule works even in other countries as long as a tropical cyclone is moving and only first order or synoptic station network with observations spaced about apart are used to derive storm totals canada uses a modified version of kraft rule which divides results by a factor of two which takes into account lower sea surface temperatures seen around atlantic canada and prevalence of systems undergoing vertical wind shear at their northerly latitudes main problem with this rule is that rainfall observing network is denser than either synoptic reporting network or first order station networks which means absolute maximum is likely to be underestimated another problem is that it does not take size of tropical cyclone or topography into account see also tropical cyclone forecasting tropical cyclone observation
