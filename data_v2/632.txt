catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia cpvt is an inherited genetic disorder that predisposes those affected to potentially life threatening abnormal heart rhythms or arrhythmias arrhythmias seen in cpvt typically occur during exercise or at times of emotional stress and classically take form of bidirectional ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation those affected may be asymptomatic but they may also experience blackouts or even sudden cardiac death cpvt is caused by genetic mutations affecting proteins that regulate concentrations of calcium within cardiac muscle cells most commonly identified gene is ryr2 which encodes a protein included in an ion channel known as ryanodine receptor this channel releases calcium from a cell s internal calcium store sarcoplasmic reticulum during every heartbeat cpvt is often diagnosed from an ecg recorded during an exercise tolerance test but it may also be diagnosed with a genetic test condition is treated with medication including beta adrenoceptor blockers or flecainide or with surgical procedures including sympathetic denervation and implantation of a defibrillator it is thought to affect as many as one in ten thousand people and is estimated to cause 15 of all unexplained sudden cardiac deaths in young people condition was first recognised in 1960 and underlying genetics were described in 2001 signs and symptoms thumb abnormal heart rhythms in a case of cpvt 260x260px although individuals with cpvt may not experience any symptoms most commonly reported symptoms are blackouts or sudden loss of consciousness referred to as syncope these blackouts often occur during exercise or as a response to emotional stress situations in which chemical messengers known as catecholamines such as adrenaline are released within body blackouts may be misinterpreted as being caused by simple faints or epilepsy often leading to delays in reaching correct diagnosis in a third of those affected first manifestation of disease may be cardiac arrest potentially leading to sudden death this can occur in very young children presenting as sudden infant death syndrome or cot death approximately 30 of those with cpvt will have a family member who has experienced blackouts seizures or sudden death in response to exercise or stress in those with cpvt catecholamine release can lead to an abnormal heart rhythm or arrhythmia known as ventricular tachycardia ventricular tachycardia may take a characteristic form known as bidirectional ventricular tachycardia this form of ventricular tachycardia occurs relatively infrequently but if seen is suggestive of an underlying diagnosis of cpvt or related condition andersen tawil syndrome these ventricular arrhythmias in some cases terminate by themselves causing a blackout from which person then recovers however if abnormal heart rhythm continues it can degenerate into a more dangerous arrhythmia known as ventricular fibrillation causing a cardiac arrest and if untreated sudden death there are typically very few abnormal signs on clinical examination in persons with cpvt however those with cpvt may develop a less serious heart rhythm disturbance called atrial fibrillation which can be detected on examination as an irregular pulse furthermore approximately 20 of those with cpvt have a slow resting heart rate known as a sinus bradycardia mechanism excitation contraction coupling arrhythmias that those with cpvt experience are caused by abnormalities in way that cardiac muscle cells control their levels of calcium calcium interacts with protein fibres or myofibrils inside cell that allow cell to contract and concentration of calcium within each cell needs to be tightly regulated during each heartbeat concentration of calcium must rise to allow muscle to contract and then fall to allow muscle to relax a process achieved by using a store within cell known as sarcoplasmic reticulum thumb proteins involved in cardiac calcium cycling at start of each heartbeat calcium is released from sarcoplasmic reticulum through specialised channels known as ryanodine receptors ryanodine receptors open when concentration of calcium near channel increases this happens when in response to an electrical signal from cell membrane called an action potential a small amount of calcium flows across cell membrane into cell through l type calcium channels many of which are located on specialised of membrane called t tubules designed to bring these surface ion channels close to sarcoplasmic reticulum increase in calcium concentration triggers ryanodine receptors on sarcoplasmic reticulum to release a puff of calcium known as a calcium spark each spark triggers release of further sparks from neighbouring ryanodine receptors to create an organised rise of calcium throughout cell known as a calcium transient at end of each heartbeat calcium is pumped back by a protein called serca along with its regulatory protein phospholamban calcium is then held within sarcoplasmic reticulum by a protein called calsequestrin fine tuning of this process can be achieved by these proteins as an example during exercise catecholamines activate beta on cell surface which trigger protein kinase a to phosphorylate l type calcium channel increasing flow of calcium into cell simultaneously phosphorylation of regulatory protein phospholamban causes more calcium to be drawn up into sarcoplasmic reticulum overall effect of this is to generate a larger calcium transient with each beat leading to a more forceful contraction calcium dependent arrhythmias alterations to proteins involved in excitation contraction coupling can disrupt this carefully regulated process in those with cpvt normally tight regulation of calcium can become deranged leading to arrhythmias while calcium is generally released from sarcoplasmic reticulum in response to an action potential calcium sparks can also occur spontaneously in a healthy heart a spontaneous calcium spark is generally an isolated event and goes no further but if ryanodine receptors or proteins that regulate them are abnormal these sparks can trigger releases from neighbouring ryanodine receptors which spread throughout cell as a calcium wave these calcium waves are much more likely to occur when cardiac muscle cells are stimulated by catecholamines such as adrenaline which increase concentration of calcium within sarcoplasmic reticulum and ryanodine receptors uncontrolled wave of calcium can be forced out through cell membrane via sodium calcium exchanger causing an electric current known as a delayed afterdepolarisations if large enough can trigger additional action potentials premature ventricular contractions or sustained arrhythmias

receptors cpvt can be caused by mutations in several genes all of which are responsible for regulating concentrations of calcium within cardiac muscle cells most commonly identified genetic mutation in cpvt is a mutation in ryr2 gene that encodes cardiac ryanodine receptor responsible for releasing calcium from sarcoplasmic reticulum mutations associated with cpvt have also been identified in casq2 gene which encodes calsequestrin a protein that binds calcium within sarcoplasmic reticulum other genes associated with cpvt include tecrl encoding trans 2 3 enoyl coa reductase like protein calm1 encoding calmodulin and trdn encoding triadin cpvt1 ryr2 mutations most commonly identified genetic mutations in those suffering from cpvt occur in ryr2 gene which encodes cardiac ryanodine receptor mutations in this gene lead to an autosomal dominant form of cpvt known as cpvt1 while precise effect differs between specific mutations in this gene many ryr2 mutations cause ryanodine receptor to open in response to lower concentrations of calcium threshold for calcium release is lower as a result sarcoplasmic reticulum spontaneously releases calcium through these abnormal ryanodine receptors when concentration of calcium within sarcoplasmic reticulum rises a process known as store overload induced calcium release sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium content increases in response to stimulation from catecholamines explaining why arrhythmias in those with cpvt occur at times when catecholamine levels are elevated some suggest that increased sensitivity to calcium occurs only when ryanodine receptor is phosphorylated by protein kinase a while other suggest that increased sensitivity also occurs under resting conditions two theories have been proposed for underlying mechanism by which mutations in ryr2 promote store overload induced calcium release domain unzipping and fkbp12 6 domain unzipping refers to separation of two important regions of ryanodine receptor n terminus and central domain through this mechanism a mutation might destabilise ryanodine receptor s closed state and increase its sensitivity to calcium a second potential mechanism involves regulatory protein fkbp12 6 a protein that binds to and stabilises ryanodine receptor binding of fkbp12 6 to ryanodine receptor is regulated by phosphorylation phosphorylation by protein kinase a leads to dissociation of fkbp12 6 rendering ryanodine receptor more sensitive to cytosolic calcium ryr2 mutations may interfere with binding of 6 to ryanodine receptor and thereby increase sensitivity to calcium it is likely that fkbp12 6 plays a role in some cpvt mutations but not others ryr2 mutations responsible for cpvt are mainly found in four major domains of gene mutations affecting domains iii and iv of gene corresponding to n terminal region of protein and cytosolic linker respectively occur in 46 of cases mutations are seen less frequently affecting domains i and ii both of which encode sections of n terminal region of protein ryr2 mutations associated with cpvt that occur outside these four domains are very rare being responsible for as few as 10 of reported cases ryr2 mutations are most often missense mutations such as single nucleotide substitutions causing one amino acid to be replaced by another although in frame substitutions and duplications have been described more damaging nonsense mutations have not been reported in association with cpvt potentially because these variants may lead to different cardiac diseases such as cpvt2 casq2 mutations mutations in casq2 gene are associated with an autosomal recessive form of cpvt known as cpvt2 this gene encodes calsequestrin major calcium binding protein and calcium buffer within sarcoplasmic reticulum mutations in casq2 account for only 3 5 of cases of cpvt fourteen mutations in casq2 have been identified in association with cpvt two of these are nonsense mutations causing protein to be abnormally short and two are deletion mutations while ten are missense mutations that substitute one amino acid for another in chain forming protein mutations in casq2 cause a decrease in sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium buffering capacity this means that abrupt changes in sarcoplasmic total calcium will be buffered less and therefore translate to larger shifts in free calcium higher peaks in free calcium have greater potential to cause store overload induced calcium release from sarcoplasmic reticulum leading to afterdepolarisations in addition to its role as a calcium buffer calsequestrin also regulates release of calcium from sarcoplasmic reticulum by directly modulating ryanodine receptors when concentration of calcium is low calsequestrin monomers form a complex with proteins triadin and which inhibit ryanodine receptors however at high calcium concentrations calsequestrin forms polymers that dissociate from ryanodine receptor channel complex removing inhibitory response and increasing sensitivity of ryanodine receptor to spontaneously releasing calcium decreased casq2 is also associated with high levels of calreticulin a protein which among other roles regulates reuptake of calcium into sarcoplasmic reticulum by serca in absence of casq2 calreticulin levels increase and provide some compensatory calcium binding within sarcoplasmic reticulum it is possible that calreticulin may contribute to generation of arrhythmias seen in association with casq2 mutations diagnosis thumb normal resting 12 lead ecg in a patient with cpvt cpvt may be challenging to diagnose as structure of heart appears normal in those affected by condition when assessed using an echocardiogram cardiac mri scan or cardiac ct scan while electrical function of heart also appears normal at rest when assessed using a standard 12 lead ecg however in response to exercise or catecholamines such as adrenaline abnormal heart rhythms such as bidirectional ventricular tachycardia or frequent polymorphic ventricular ectopic beats may be seen 12 lead ecg resting 12 lead ecg is a useful test to differentiate cpvt from other electrical diseases of heart that can cause similar abnormal heart rhythms unlike conditions such as long qt syndrome and brugada syndrome resting 12 lead ecg in those with cpvt is generally normal however approximately 20 of those affected have a slow resting heart rate or sinus bradycardia exercise and other provocative testing thumb treadmill exercise stress testing exercise testing commonly performed on a treadmill or stationary bicycle can help to diagnose cpvt during test those with cpvt often experience ectopic beats which may progress to bidirectional and then polymorphic ventricular tachycardia as intensity of exercise increases some of those suspected of having cpvt such as young children may not be able to perform an exercise tolerance test in these cases alternative forms of testing include adrenaline provocation testing during which adrenaline is infused into a vein at gradually increasing doses under close supervision and ecg monitoring additionally long term or holter ecg monitoring can be performed although this form of testing is less likely to detect an arrhythmia invasive electrophysiological studies do not provide useful information to help diagnose cpvt or to assess risk of life threatening arrhythmias genetic testing cpvt can also be diagnosed by identifying a disease causing mutation in a gene associated with cpvt using genetic testing this technique may be only way to identify condition in someone suspected of having cpvt who has died and in this case may be known as a molecular autopsy treatment treatments for cpvt aim to prevent lethal abnormal heart rhythms from occurring and to rapidly restore a normal rhythm if they do occur as arrhythmias in cpvt generally occur at times when heart is exposed to high levels of adrenaline or other similar chemical messengers catecholamines many treatments for cpvt aim to lower levels of catecholamines heart is exposed to or block their effects on heart first line treatment for those with cpvt involves lifestyle advice this includes avoiding competitive sports very strenuous exercise and highly stressful environments as high levels of adrenaline can occur in these settings which can provoke arrhythmias medication several medications can be useful for those with cpvt mainstays of treatment are beta blockers which block effects of adrenaline and other catecholamines on heart reducing chance of abnormal heart rhythms developing of all beta blockers nadolol may be most effective for treating cpvt this drug lowers heart rate to a greater extent than other beta blockers and only needs to be taken once daily reducing risk of missed doses nadolol may be difficult to obtain and is not available in all countries and an alternative beta blocker suitable for use in cpvt is propranolol flecainide is a class 1c antiarrhythmic drug that is recommended for those with cpvt who experience abnormal heart rhythms despite taking a beta blocker flecainide reduces risk of arrhythmias in those with cpvt but it remains uncertain how flecainide achieves this some have suggested that flecainide directly interacts with cardiac ryanodine receptor which is frequently abnormal in those with cpvt while other suggest that anti arrhythmic effects of flecainide rely entirely on its sodium channel blocking effects is a calcium channel antagonist that when combined with a beta blocker may reduce risk of arrhythmias in patients with cpvt is another antiarrhythmic that may reduce risk of arrhythmias potentially through direct effects on ryanodine receptor sympathetic denervation thumb sympathetic nervous system some persons with cpvt continue to experience life threatening arrhythmias despite pharmaceutical therapy in this case a surgical procedure can be used to affect nerves supplying heart that communicate using catecholamines a collection of nerves known as sympathetic nervous system supply heart as well as other organs these nerves when activated encourage heart to beat harder and faster sympathetic nervous system uses noradrenaline a catecholamine as a chemical messenger or neurotransmitter which can promote arrhythmias in those with cpvt to prevent this a region of sympathetic nervous system can be intentionally damaged in an operation known as cardiac sympathetic denervation or sympathectomy while sympathetic nervous system feeds into heart from both sides often only left sided nerves are targeted during sympathectomy although destruction of nerves on both sides may be required through this process sympathectomy is effective at decreasing risk of further life threatening arrhythmias implantable cardioverter defibrillator thumb chest x ray of a patient with an implantable defibrillator components labelled while medication and sympathectomy aim to prevent abnormal heart rhythms from occurring in first place an implantable defibrillator icd may be used to treat arrhythmias that medication has failed to prevent and restore a normal heart rhythm these devices usually implanted under skin at front of chest below shoulder can continuously monitor heart for abnormal heart rhythms if a life threatening arrhythmia is detected device can deliver a small electric shock to terminate abnormal rhythm and restart heart implantable defibrillators are often recommended for those with cpvt who have experienced blackouts ventricular arrhythmias or cardiac arrest despite taking appropriate medication these devices can be life saving although resulting surge of adrenaline caused by pain of an electric shock from device can sometimes bring on a cycle of recurrent arrhythmias and shocks known as an electrical storm because of this it is strongly recommended that those with an icd implanted for cpvt take a beta blocker to dampen effects of adrenaline prognosis a significant proportion of those with cpvt will experience a life threatening abnormal heart rhythm with estimates of this risk ranging from 13 20 over course of 7 8 years life threatening arrhythmias are more likely to occur if cpvt has been diagnosed in childhood if a person with cpvt does not take beta blockers and if arrhythmias occur on exercise testing despite taking beta blockers epidemiology cpvt is estimated to affect 1 in 10 000 people symptoms from cpvt are typically first seen in first or second decade of life and more than 60 of affected individuals experience their first episode of syncope or cardiac arrest by age 20 however a small number of patients may present later in life and genetic testing in these patients frequently fails to identify a causative gene history in 1960 norwegian cardiologist knut berg published a report on three sisters who suffered from blackouts during exercise or emotional stress in what is now recognised as first description of cpvt bidirectional ventricular tachycardia associated with this condition was described in 1975 term catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia was first used in 1978 in 1999 first genetic mutation causing cpvt to be identified was localised to chromosome 1q42 q43 which was found to be a variant in ryr2 gene in 2001 ongoing research aims to identify better treatments for cpvt to increase understanding of mechanisms of arrhythmia and to identify other genes causing condition references external links category cardiac arrhythmia category medical emergencies category rare diseases category category disorders
