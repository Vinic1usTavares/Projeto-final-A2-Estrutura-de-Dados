banksia aculeata commonly known as prickly banksia is a species of plant of family proteaceae native to stirling range in southwest of western australia a shrub up to tall it has dense foliage and leaves with very prickly serrated margins its unusual pinkish pendent hanging flower spikes known as inflorescences are generally hidden in foliage and appear during early summer although it was collected by naturalist james drummond in 1840s banksia aculeata was not formally described until 1981 by alex george in his monograph of genus a rare plant banksia aculeata is found in gravelly soils in elevated areas native to a habitat burnt by periodic bushfires it is killed by fire and regenerates from seed afterwards in contrast to other western australian banksias it appears to have some resistance to soil borne water mould phytophthora cinnamomi description a bushy shrub banksia aculeata grows up to tall with fissured grey bark on its trunk and branches unlike many other banksia species it does not have a woody base or lignotuber leaves range from long and wide with sharply pointed rigid lobes on margins appearing in february and march cylindrical flower spikes known as inflorescences range from long growing at ends of short leafy 2 3 year old side branches hanging downward rather than growing upright like those of most other banksias they are composed of a central woody spike or axis from which many compact individual flowers arise perpendicularly these floral units are made up of a smooth tubular perianth that envelops flower s sexual organs perianth is long and pink at base grading into cream in late bud end of perianth has a characteristic four angled squarish appearance it then splits at anthesis to reveal smooth straight pistil which is slightly shorter than its enveloping structure at long fruiting cone known as an infructescence is a swollen woody spike in which up to 20 massive follicles are embedded withered flower parts persist on spike giving it a hairy appearance oval in shape follicles are wrinkled in texture and covered with fine hair they are long high and wide obovate egg shaped seed is long and fairly flattened it is composed of wedge shaped seed body containing embryonic plant measuring long by wide and a papery wing one side termed outer surface is grey and wrinkled and other is black and sparkles slightly seeds are separated by a sturdy dark brown seed separator that is roughly same shape as seeds with a depression where seed body sits adjacent to it in follicle known as cotyledons first pair of leaves produced by seedlings are cuneate wedge shaped and measure long by wide they are dull dark green sometimes with a reddish tinge and margin of wedge is convex auricle at base of cotyledon leaf is pointed and measures long hypocotyl is thick smooth and dark red obovate to oblong seedling leaves are long by wide with serrated margins v shaped sinuses and sharp teeth related banksia caleyi is similar in appearance but can be distinguished by its recurved downward curving leaf margins and smaller follicles and perianths its flowers appear from october to december taxonomy banksia aculeata was first collected by james drummond on one of his three trips to stirling range between 1843 and 1848 though he did not regard it as distinct from b caleyi this was only recognised over a century later by alex george george described b aculeata in his 1981 monograph genus banksia l f proteaceae for type of species george selected a specimen he collected on chester pass road in stirling range east of cranbrook on 20 march 1972 he gave it specific epithet aculeata latin for sharp in reference to sharply pointed leaf lobes george placed b aculeata in b subg banksia because its inflorescence is a typical banksia flower spike in b sect banksia because of its straight styles and b ser tetragonae because of its pendulous inflorescences he considered its closest relative to be b caleyi from which it differs in having narrower leaves with fewer larger lobes longer perianths which grade from red to cream rather than from cream to red shorter pistils and also differences in follicles seeds and flowering time in 1996 kevin thiele and pauline ladiges published results of a cladistic analysis of morphological characters of banksia they retained george s subgenera and many of his series but discarded his sections george s b ser tetragonae was found to be monophyletic and therefore retained and their analysis of relationships within series supported placement of b aculeata alongside b caleyi thumb right flower spikes in early bud stage b aculeatas placement in thiele and ladiges arrangement may be summarised as follows banksia b subg isostylis 3 species b elegans incertae sedis b subg banksia b ser tetragonae b elderiana b lemanniana b caleyi b aculeata arrangement of thiele and ladiges was not accepted by george and was discarded in his 1999 revision under george s 1999 arrangement b aculeatas placement was as follows banksia b subg banksia b sect banksia b ser salicinae 11 species 7 subspecies b ser grandes 2 species b ser banksia 8 species b ser crocinae 4 species b ser prostratae 6 species 3 varieties b ser cyrtostylis 13 species b ser tetragonae b lemanniana b caleyi b aculeata since 1998 austin mast has been publishing results of ongoing cladistic analyses of dna sequence data for subtribe banksiinae his analyses suggest a phylogeny that is rather different from previous taxonomic arrangements but support placement of b aculeata alongside b caleyi in a clade corresponding closely with b ser tetragonae a 2013 molecular study by marcel cardillo and colleagues using chloroplast dna and combining it with earlier results found that b aculeata was sister to b lemanniana and that b caleyi was next closest relative early in 2007 mast and thiele initiated a rearrangement by transferring dryandra to banksia and publishing b subg spathulatae for species having spoon shaped cotyledons in this way they also redefined autonym b subg banksia they foreshadowed publishing a full arrangement once dna sampling of dryandra was complete in meantime if mast and thiele s nomenclatural changes are taken as an interim arrangement then b aculeata is placed in b subg banksia distribution and habitat thumb right distribution within western australia b aculeata is native to foothills of stirling range in southwest of western australia occurring at elevations between in shrubland in gravelly soils annual rainfall is around it is a fairly rare plant with most populations consisting of fewer than 100 plants with fairly small populations and a narrow distribution b aculeata is considered rare but is not currently classed as endangered because at least some populations are thought not to be under immediate threat department of environment and conservation of western australian state government classes it as priority two poorly known flora ecology like many plants in australia s southwest banksia aculeata is adapted to an environment in which bushfire events are relatively frequent most banksia species can be placed in one of two broad groups according to their response to fire reseeders are killed by fire but fire also triggers release of their canopy seed bank thus promoting recruitment of next generation resprouters survive fire resprouting from a lignotuber or more rarely epicormic buds protected by thick bark b aculeata is killed by fire because it possesses neither thick protective bark nor a lignotuber to reshoot from it is serotinous it accumulates a canopy seed bank that is released only in response to fire so populations typically recover rapidly after a fire but this strategy makes it dependent on a suitable fire regime plants take three to four years to reach flowering after a bushfire pollinators have not been observed and flowering period is brief when compared with other banksias however flowers appear when little else is in bloom rendering it a valuable food source for animals b aculeata has been reported as susceptible to dieback from soil borne water mould phytophthora cinnamomi but in a 2008 study this pathogen was found to have no direct impact on species as a result of this finding together with low percentage of populations infested or facing imminent infestation species was classed as having a very low extinction risk cultivation banksia aculeata grows slowly generally taking five to six years to flower from seed though there is a report of it flowering in three years at in victoria regarding its potential as an ornamental plant alex george observes that flowers are brightly coloured but have a short life and are obscured by foliage which is quite prickly he nonetheless considers both new foliage and infructescence attractive this species can grow in a range of soil types so long as they provide good drainage nominal soil ph range is from 5 5 to 6 5 it prefers full sun although it will grow in partly shaded situations producing fewer flowers it will tolerate light pruning references external links aculeata category eudicots of western australia category plants
