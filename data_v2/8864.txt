catherine flannagan 1829 3 march 1884 and margaret higgins 1843 3 march 1884 were irish sisters who were convicted of poisoning and murdering one person in liverpool lancashire england and suspected of more deaths women collected a burial society payout a type of life insurance on each death and it was eventually found that they had been committing murders using arsenic to obtain insurance money though catherine flannagan evaded police for a time both sisters were eventually caught and convicted of one of murders they were both hanged on same day at kirkdale prison modern investigation of crime has raised possibility that flannagan and higgins were known or believed by investigators to be only part of a larger conspiracy of murder for profit a network of black widows but no convictions were ever obtained for any of alleged conspiracy members other than two sisters deaths in early 1880s unmarried sisters catherine and margaret spell last name both flannagan and flanagan but most use two ns ran a rooming house at 5 street liverpool household in final months of 1880 consisted of two sisters catherine s son john and two lodger families hod carrier thomas higgins and his daughter mary and patrick jennings and his daughter margaret john flannagan 22 and previously healthy died suddenly in december 1880 his death did not raise any particular comment catherine collected ps71 worth roughly ps in 2012 pounds from burial society with which he had been registered and he was interred shortly thereafter by 1882 a romance had sprung up between margaret and lodger thomas higgins pair married in october of that year thomas s daughter mary 8 died within months of wedding after a short illness once again burial society payout was collected upon death this time by margaret higgins in january 1883 margaret jennings 19 died her burial payout was collected by catherine in face of neighbourhood gossip about death rate in home catherine margaret and are unclear about point at which patrick jennings left household but he is not among deaths attributed to it moved their household to 105 latimer street and then again to 27 ascot street in september 1883 thomas higgins then 45 became yet another member of household to fall mysteriously ill his stomach pains were severe enough that doctor whitford was called doctor attributed higgins s illness to dysentery related to drinking cheap whiskey and prescribed opium and castor oil higgins died after two days of illness days later same doctor was contacted and asked to provide a death certificate he did so attributing death to dysentery investigation though thomas higgins s death by apparent dysentery raised no questions for attending doctor higgins s brother patrick was surprised to hear that his brother who had been strong and in good general health could have succumbed so easily to illness when he also discovered that his brother has been insured with five different burial societies which left his widow with a profit of around ps100 he pursued matter with authorities a postmortem examination was ordered on higgins s body to surprise of mourners coroner arrived at home to perform examination during wake being held there for higgins catherine flannagan upon hearing that a full autopsy was to be performed fled home when a full autopsy of higgins s body was carried out evidence of arsenic poisoning was found higgins s organs showed traces of arsenic in quantities indicating poisoning had taken place over several days evidence from home including a bottle containing a mystery white substance and a market pocket worn by margaret was examined by poison expert dr campbell brown who verified presence of arsenic dust in margaret s pocket and an arsenic solution containing unusual adulterants in bottle margaret higgins was arrested immediately catherine after moving from one boarding house to another to avoid police for nearly a week was taken into custody in wavertree on 16 october 1883 sisters were formally charged with murder of thomas higgins orders for bodies of previously deceased members of household to be exhumed were issued when it became clear that arsenic was mechanism of thomas higgins s death bodies of john flannagan mary higgins and margaret jennings all showed evidence of minimal deterioration a quality associated with arsenic poisoning and traces of arsenic were found in remains of all three investigators initially assumed that arsenic used to poison victims had come from rat poison but when common adulterants used in rat poison failed to show up in autopsies they were forced to come up with a new theory it was unlikely that illiterate sisters would have been able to acquire arsenic through usual method of visiting a chemist a route more open to doctors than spinsters eventually it was discovered that common flypaper at time contained arsenic and that by soaking flypaper in water a solution substantially identical including same adulterants to that found in a bottle at higgins residence could be obtained aftermath at time of her arrest catherine claimed to her solicitor that murders sisters committed were not isolated and provided a list of six or seven other deaths that she claimed to be murders related to burial society fraud as well as a list of five other women who had either perpetrated those murders or provided insurance to those who did alleged conspiracy catherine flannagan s list of alleged conspirators to arsenic deaths contained three poisoners other than herself one accomplice and three agents of insuring groups who had provided payouts upon deaths margaret evans bridget begley and margaret higgins were named as poisoners margaret potter a mrs fallon and a bridget stanton were insurers and catherine ryan was alleged to have obtained arsenic needed by one of poisoners according to flannagan margaret evans had been instigator of crime ring beginning with murder of a mentally handicapped teenager in which ryan obtained poison and evans administered it though evans did not personally receive an insurance payout from this death there were implications that she had dealings with boy s father and may have profited from those women flannagan alleged to have been involved in conspiracy all appear often in accounts of suspicious deaths in this period mrs stanton for example was linked to insurance policies of three of deaths and groups of two or more of involved women were seen visiting those who died shortly before their deaths in one case when an insurance company supervisor requested to meet thomas higgins in course of issuing insurance on him he was greeted at higgins home by a woman who was neither flannagan nor higgins who presented to him a thomas who he later realised upon seeing deceased thomas higgins was not thomas higgins at all flannagan s testimony was sometimes contradictory to both herself and to what seemed to be obvious facts of conspiracy however in one case despite mrs stanton s close links to insurance payouts of murder victims and flannagan s identification of her as part of conspiracy flannagan exonerated stanton after police arrested woman ultimately it was decided by prosecuting solicitor for liverpool that while additional deaths were indeed likely to be murder it would be difficult to prove that anyone other than higgins or flannagan had committed them especially considering that primary evidence against other women was being provided by flannagan who had every reason to attempt to minimise her own responsibility in such crimes as a result only flannagan and higgins were tried for crime of murdering thomas higgins despite continuing suspicion by all investigating parties that there had been more deaths than just four household ones and more murderers than just two sisters trial at trial in 1884 prosecutors implicated sisters in three other deaths in their household as well as that of thomas higgins with which they were officially charged catherine flannagan s offer to provide evidence against other conspirators for prosecution in exchange for leniency was refused sisters were found guilty and sentenced to be hanged sentence was carried out on 3 march 1884 at kirkdale prison with sisters attended to by a roman catholic priest deaths were witnessed by a reported one thousand people in media contemporary accounts of flannagan sisters referred to them as disciple s of lucrezia borgia or as borgias of slums in reference to their use of poison and tales of how borgia had been known to do same modern accounts of flannagan sisters such as those by angela brabin and television series deadly women have focused more on cooperative aspect of crimes rather than poison aspect and tend to refer to them as black widows or black widows of liverpool particularly in reference to allegation that flannagan sisters were part of a larger murder ring wax effigies of flannagan and higgins were placed in madame tussaud s chamber of
