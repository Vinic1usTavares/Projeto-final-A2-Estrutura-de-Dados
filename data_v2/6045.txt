dimartino and published by dark horse comics with konietzko consulting on art thumb left 200px michael dante dimartino writer of legend of korra turf wars dimartino began outlining trilogy in july 2015 transitioning from television to comic book medium posed a challenge for him especially as this was first comic he had ever written biggest change for dimartino was being sole writer as he was used to collaborating with others for his television scripts writer found that his background as a storyboard artist and director eased transition as he was already used to visualizing images dimartino also had difficulty trying to incorporate many characters and story arcs from show into graphic novels on writing korra and asami s relationship he noted that it was a balancing act as he didn t want their romance to be too perfect but he also didn t want to saddle it with too much conflict either brittney williams was originally announced as artist in october 2015 williams later dropped out of project and a new artist irene koh was announced in october 2016 after williams departure a friend of koh s was offered job but recommended koh instead a self described bisexual asian martial artist koh was already a fan of franchise before being brought on and found that her background in martial arts helped her better illustrate fighting sequences she was asked to draw art in her own style instead of style of animated series and her style has been described as more relaxed and loose in addition to largely chinese japanese and inuit based characters featured in animated series koh wanted to design more diverse asian characters in graphic novels as a result new characters introduced include a bangladeshi a korean as well as several south and southeast asians koh described working on legend of korra turf wars as a deeply collaborative process noting that she received a lot of feedback along way from dimartino konietzko and nickelodeon publication legend of korra turf

thumb 250px korra and asami s first kiss art by irene koh and colors by killian ng ending of legend of korra depicting its two female leads starting a same sex relationship with each other was unprecedented for lgbt representation in american children s television at time however it was met with mixed reactions over perceived subtle and last minute reveal of relationship with legend of korra turf wars shift to comic book medium gave creative team more flexibility to explore lgbt themes including showing couple s first kiss romance between korra and asami is a major focus of graphic novels dimartino felt that it was natural for books to give prominence to a same sex couple as he and konietzko had always considered franchise to be very inclusive jason segarra writing for adventures in poor taste saw this focus as dimartino s attempt to address concerns over ending of animated series unlike original series which had time jumps between each season dimartino felt that it was important for readers of comics to see early stages of korra and asami s relationship as such part one begins immediately after ending of animated series with first part of book dedicated solely to pair s getaway in spirit world legend of korra turf wars also looks at coming out process as korra and asami come out to friends and family to varying reactions part one establishes historical treatment of lgbt individuals by different nations of this fantasy world with some nations revealed to be of them according to dimartino he and konietzko thought best approach was to view lgbtq representation through lens of different cultures kya and avatar kyoshi were also revealed to be queer on decision to introduce homophobia into this fictional universe artist irene koh noted that
