helicopter they brought a bobcat loader and a shipping container with engineer equipment soldiers reinforced base with existing terrain sandbags barbed wire and used bobcat to fill a number of barriers essentially wall sized sandbags around three squad positions and to create a firing pit for big 120 mm mortar however bobcat broke down for one day and could not lift high enough to place barriers to a height but were placed to just a level which would make it vulnerable to direct fire from guns or rockets which attackers would exploit troops dug many of fortifications and trenches with hand shovels still in preparation at time of attack some areas were only protected by a barrier of concertina wire but with no posts or stakes wire was simply stretched out on ground afghan company contracted to bring heavy construction equipment delayed its arrival to until july 13 it was decided that soldier labor with aid of an engineer squad and a bobcat front end loader already at bella would be good enough to prepare an initial defense in six days until heavier equipment arrived number of men at base was judged adequate to defend against intelligence estimates that placed insurgent forces in local area at about 150 experienced fighters though they did not know that attackers would be backed up by other guerrilla groups from neighboring regions as far away as pakistan and kashmir while they thought it was possible base might be attacked while camp was being prepared they thought it unlikely platoon sergeant later remarked i was expecting harassing fire from any one of high ground in every direction i did not think village itself would let aaf anti afghan force turn their village into a battle zone soldiers at base noticed warning signs including groups of men watching construction from nearby village which was set at a higher elevation than outpost and other groups of men moving through nearby mountains at a dinner meeting in village a villager told americans that they should shoot any men seen in mountains and asked them if u s uavs were keeping watch nearby day before attack militants began flowing water through an irrigation ditch feeding an

brigade commander colonel chip preysler and battalion commander lieutenant colonel william ostlund citing lack of supplies equipment and drinking water for troops stationed in wanat at same time report praised performance of its soldiers under fire same report criticized actions of involved commanding officers as being counterproductive to military goals stating that highly kinetic approach favored by tf rock rapidly and inevitably degraded relationships between u s army and population this statement portraying operational approaches of 173rd airborne brigade tf bayonet and 2 503 pir tf rock in a negative light is contradicted by david kilcullen in his book accidental guerrilla kilcullen stated that in march 2008 fact that kunar has bucked general trend downward trend in security across country seems largely to be result of a consistent u s strategy of partnering with local communities to separate insurgents from people bring tangible benefits of governance and development to population and help population choose their own local khan s protectors usually military through elections kilcullen also noted a statement by a previous u s commander in kunar regarding ltc william ostlund 2 503 commander bill o understood deeply that effect of coalition operations on people was key question statement by ltc colonel chris battalion commander of 1 32 infantry in kunar valley in 2005 2006 italics in quotes are from source aftermath u s withdrawal after battle major general jeffrey j schloesser u s army commander of coalition troops in regional command east afghanistan decided to abandon patrol base and sent additional u s troops to assist base evacuation three days after engagement united states and afghan armies withdrew from wanat an isaf statement said isaf and afghan security forces will continue to perform regular patrols near village of wanat coalition forces continued to maintain a larger patrol base about four miles away from wanat and concentrated on protecting larger pech river valley district police force for area was disarmed by americans and district chief and police chief were briefly detained and questioned both were released within 24 hours according to a spokesperson for district chief speaking at a pentagon news conference after attack u s chairman of joint chiefs of staff navy admiral mike mullen said incident indicated that all involved with operations on pakistan afghanistan especially porous kunar kashmir and nuristan border must do a better job of policing region and eliminating extremists safe havens in pakistan s federally administered tribal areas that are launching pads for attacks on coalition forces associated press reported that attack underscored a general gain in strength of afghan militants however 173rd brigade commander colonel charles chip preysler specifically rebutted that conclusion in an interview on july 20 2008 he stated that previous media accounts of engagement mischaracterized level of development of platoon s defences he also said that withdrawal of platoon did not constitute abandoning position because no permanent defensive infrastructure was developed or left behind he further stated that position was not overrun in any shape manner or form adding that it was close combat to be sure hand grenade range u s army investigation thumb right 300px view of wanat cop looking east from mortar position with 2nd squad position bazaar and op topside s later location in background july 9 2008 an investigation by u s army completed on august 13 and released to public first week of november 2008 found that taliban attackers had been assisted by afghan local police alp forces and a district leader evidence included large stocks of weapons and ammunition discovered in police barracks in wanat after battle stocks were much more than could be used by villages 20 man police force and included dirty weapons which appeared to have been used recently in response to report schloesser concluded that governor and local police chief had probably been acting under duress and had been cooperative with american troops governor was absolved of blame in attack but it was unclear about what was done with local police chief investigation also examined whether army had intelligence about a possible assault and whether troops had access to it report found that despite reports earlier in july that 200 to 300 militants had been massing to attack another remote outpost in vicinity including numerous reports from local villagers that an attack was imminent commanders at wanat had no reason to expect such a large frontal assault report however criticized incredible amount of time 10 months it took nato military leaders to negotiate arrangements over site of outpost giving taliban plenty of time to coordinate and plan an attack on base further actions in july 2009 u s senator james webb asked u s dod inspector general to formally examine battle and u s army s investigation into event in his request webb cited an unreleased report from army s combat studies institute by a contractor douglas cubbison that criticized how senior army leaders in afghanistan especially ostlund and acted before assault at wanat according to that report soldiers at wanat base were critically short of basic necessities such as water and sandbags and had complained repeatedly to no avail that their base was in a precarious position cubbison had written report at request of lieutenant general william b caldwell iv commander of united states army combined arms center cubbison wrote that a few days before battle on july 4 a u s army helicopter mistakenly attacked and killed 17 civilians including all of doctors and nurses at a local clinic infuriating local afghans platoon leader brostrom and company commander captain matthew myer told their commanders that they expected a retaliatory attack and asked for extra surveillance brostrom s father retired army colonel david p brostrom alerted webb s office to army historian s report said brostrom after i read report i was sick to my stomach letters of reprimand were issued to colonel charles preysler lieutenant colonel william ostlund and captain myer for failing to properly prepare defenses at wanat pentagon officials said march 12 that same month myer was awarded silver star for his actions during battle of wanat on september 30 2009 u s central command commander general david h petraeus appointed u s marine corps lieutenant general richard f natonski to lead a new inquiry into battle and which would look into related issues beyond tactical level a later review was conducted by general charles c campbell which focused on totality of circumstances that included and affected actions at wanat including interviews of officers involved and reviews of previous investigations with exception of fort leavenworth combat studies institute csi narrative stating that it had not undergone pre publication vetting and academic review in accordance with standing csi research protocols campbell concluded that officers involved were not at fault officers were neither negligent nor derelict in performance of their duties exercising a degree of care that a reasonably prudent person would have exercised under same or similar circumstance to criminalize command decisions in a theater of complex combat operations is a grave step indeed it is also unnecessary particularly in this case it is possible for officers to err in judgment and to thereby incur censure without violating a criminal statute this is particularly true where errors are those of omission where standards come from multiple non punitive doctrinal publications where there is less than complete and certain knowledge of enemy capabilities and intent and where commanders enjoy wide discretion in their exercise of their command prerogatives and responsibilities in june 2010 general campbell revoked officers reprimands citing that they would have a chilling effect on ground operations army said that second look at incident proved that officers were neither negligent nor derelict and by their valor and their skill they successfully defended their positions and defeated a determined skillful and adaptable enemy who masses and attacks at times ways and places of his choosing secretary of army john mchugh was also humbled by their courage stating we remain grateful for and humbled by their extraordinary courage and valor gen george w casey jr army chief of staff further commended performance of soldiers in every review and study conducted to date courage valor and discipline of soldiers who fought at wanat have been universally praised these soldiers were well trained well led and fought bravely to defeat a determined and intense enemy action to overrun their base in wanat they persevered in a fashion that deserves broad recognition of their bravery and tenacity our hearts go out to families of fallen soldiers upset over campbell s decision family members of those killed in action wrote a letter to secretary of army asking that findings of natonski s investigation be upheld and reprimands reinstated in addition to family members letter was signed by senators daniel jim webb saxby chambliss patty murray and claire mccaskill cole william senators want explanation for army s reversal on wanat honolulu advertiser july 23 2010 in november 2010 u s army s combat studies institute published a historical account of battle of wanat official u s army history of battle published in december 2010 places little blame on senior officers involved instead blaming uncertain nature of war mistakes by junior officers lack of knowledge by army officers on wanat region s
