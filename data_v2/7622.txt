super cyclonic storm gonu is strongest tropical cyclone on record in arabian sea and is also strongest named cyclone in northern indian ocean second named tropical cyclone of 2007 north indian ocean cyclone season gonu developed from a persistent area of convection in eastern arabian sea on june 1 2007 with a favorable upper level environment and warm sea surface temperatures it rapidly intensified to attain peak winds of 235 km h 145 mph on june 4 according to india meteorological department gonu weakened after encountering dry air and cooler waters and early on june 6 it made landfall on easternmost tip of oman becoming strongest tropical cyclone to hit arabian peninsula it then turned northward into gulf of oman and dissipated on june 7 after making landfall in southern iran first landfall in country since 1898 intense tropical cyclones like gonu are extremely rare in arabian sea and most storms in this area tend to be small and dissipate quickly cyclone caused 50 deaths and about 4 2 billion in damage 2007 usd in oman where cyclone was considered nation s worst natural disaster gonu dropped heavy rainfall near eastern coastline reaching up to 610 mm 24 inches which caused flooding and heavy damage in iran cyclone caused 28 deaths and in damage 2007 usd meteorological history toward end of may 2007 monsoon trough spawned a low pressure area in eastern arabian sea by may 31 an organized tropical disturbance was located about 645 km 400 mi south of mumbai india with cyclonic convection or thunderstorm activity and a well defined mid level circulation disturbance initially lacked a distinct low level circulation instead it consisted of strong divergence along western end of a surface trough of low pressure a favorable upper level environment allowed convection to improve and by late on june 1 system developed to extent that india meteorological department imd classified it as a depression it tracked westward along southwestern periphery of a mid level ridge over southern india convection continued to organize and early on june 2 joint typhoon warning center jtwc classified storm as tropical cyclone 02a about 685 km 425 mi southwest of mumbai upon first forming system contended with entrainment of dry air to northwest of storm which was expected to limit intensification storm steadily intensified and early on june 2 imd upgraded it to deep depression status later in day imd classified system as cyclonic storm gonu about 760 km 470 mi southwest of mumbai india as a mid latitude trough developed over pakistan gonu turned to north and northeast though it resumed a westward track after ridging built to north of storm with a solid area of intense convection it rapidly intensified to attain severe cyclonic status early on june 3 and with good outflow jtwc upgraded it to equivalent of a minimal hurricane dry air ultimately had a smaller impact on intensification than previously estimated a well defined eye developed in center of convection and after moving over a local increase in ocean heat content gonu rapidly deepened thumb right tropical cyclone gonu off coast of oman on june 5 late on june 3 imd upgraded storm to very severe cyclonic storm gonu with warm waters low amounts of vertical wind shear and favorable upper level outflow gonu strengthened further to attain peak 1 min sustained winds of 270 km h 165 mph and gusts to 315 km h 195 mph about 285 km 175 mi east southeast of masirah island on coast of oman imd upgraded it to super cyclonic storm gonu late on june 4 with peak 3 min sustained winds reaching 240 km h 150 mph and an estimated pressure of 920 mbar this made it first super cyclonic storm in arabian sea on record after storm maintained peak winds for about six hours imd downgraded gonu to very severe cyclonic storm status late on june 4 gonu s eye became cloud filled and ragged and cyclone gradually weakened due to cooler water temperatures and drier air as it approached arabian peninsula due to land interaction with oman inner core of deep convection rapidly weakened and over a period of 24 hours intensity decreased by 95 km h 60 mph according to imd cyclone gonu crossed easternmost tip of oman near muscat early on june 6 with winds of 143 km h 89 mph although winds continued to gradually decrease overall organization increased slightly in hours prior to landfall gonu maintained a well defined low level structure with a weak eye after emerging into gulf of oman cyclone briefly re intensified slightly possibly due to warm waters however increasing wind shear and entrainment of dry air from arabian peninsula continued to remove deep convection from its eastern semicircle on june 6 cyclone turned to north northwest and later that day jtwc downgraded gonu to tropical storm status imd followed suit by downgrading gonu to severe cyclonic storm status and later to cyclonic storm status early on june 7 gonu crossed coast in iran six hours later and imd stopped issuing advisories on cyclone this made it first tropical cyclone on record to hit country since 1898 after landfall gonu persisted as a remnant low over iran through june 8 preparations oman chairman of national committee for civil defence general malek bin sulaiman al ma amari remarked nation had already developed a contingency plan which included activation of army and police personnel after storm s passage significant damage was expected especially in northeastern areas along with up to 150 mm 6 in of rainfall and very strong winds officials recommended citizens evacuate

facilities along its path after initial price rises oil dropped over us 2 per barrel as a result across northern arabian sea passage of gonu produced stronger winds and significant upwelling an oceanographic phenomenon that involves replacement of nutrient depleted surface water with deeper nutrient rich water passage caused a significant increase in phytoplankton additionally cyclone delayed arrival of indian ocean south west monsoon in western ghats in india in oman production of desalinated water was interrupted as both of oman s desalination plants failed first lost supplies of natural gas halting production while second sustained a damaged switchgear due to flooding these plants provided water to muscat s 631 000 residents and surrounding areas triggering severe water shortages across eastern oman to rectify situation officials used water tanks water returned to near normal in five days as two plants returned to service additionally electricians worked quickly to repair power outages across region five days after gonu hit utilities were restored to most of muscat and coastal provinces omani army assisted residents in returning to their houses even though omani government did not request any international aid united states offered assistance through naval ships in area this was eventually rejected country lost an estimated 200 million 2007 usd in oil exports
