high virgo also known as weapons system 199c ws 199c was a prototype air launched ballistic missile albm jointly developed by lockheed and convair division of general dynamics during late 1950s missile proved moderately successful and aided in development of later gam 87 skybolt albm it was also used in early tests of anti satellite weapons design and development as part of ws 199 project to develop new strategic weapons for united states air force s strategic air command lockheed corporation and convair division of general dynamics proposed development of an air launched ballistic missile to be carried by convair b 58 hustler supersonic medium bomber parsch 2005 in early 1958 two companies were awarded a contract for development of weapon designated ws 199c and given code name high virgo while project was intended to be strictly a research and development exercise it was planned that weapon would be quickly capable of being developed into an operational system if required 2010 p 37 high virgo missile was a single stage weapon powered by a solid fueled thiokol tx 20 rocket and was equipped with an advanced inertial guidance system derived from that of agm 28 hound dog cruise missile 2008 p 266 four tailfins in a cruciform arrangement provided directional control missile was developed by lockheed utilising components developed for several existing missiles to reduce cost of project and also to reduce development time required convair was responsible for development of a pylon for carriage and launching of missile from prototype b 58 pylon replacing aircraft s normal weapons pod operational history four test flights of high virgo missile were conducted due to development problems first two did not include inertial guidance system instead they were fitted with a simple autopilot guiding weapon on a pre programmed course launched from its b 58 carrier aircraft at high altitude and supersonic speed initial flight conducted on september 5 1958 was a failure when missile s controls malfunctioned second test three months later proved more successful with missile flying over a range of nearly third flight test following june utilized inertial guidance system for first time it was a successful flight anti satellite test fourth high virgo missile was utilized in a test mission intended to demonstrate capability of missile for use as a satellite interceptor or anti satellite missile asat missile modified with cameras to record results of test was initially targeted at explorer 4 satellite due to errors in calculating satellite s orbit explorer 5 was targeted instead asat test mission final flight of high virgo missile was conducted on september 22 1959 less than a minute after launch of missile from its b 58 carrier aircraft at mach 2 temple 2004 p 111 telemetry signal was lost yenne 2005 p 67 no data was recovered from test and camera data intended to be recovered afterward was not located hence test was inconclusive no further test firings of high virgo were conducted research project having been concluded air force had begun work on what would become gam 87 skybolt missile which incorporated lessons learned from ws 199 project launch history date time gmt launch site outcome remarks 1958 09 05 amr dz failure apogee 1958 12 19 amr dz success apogee 1959 06 04 amr dz success apogee 1959 09 22 amr dz inconclusive apogee see also references notes citations bibliography category air launched ballistic missiles category ballistic missiles of united states category anti satellite missiles category cold war air to surface missiles of united states category air to surface missiles of united states
