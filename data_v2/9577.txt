appearance of harold perrineau as a main cast member episode features last appearance of actor harold perrineau whose character michael dies in an explosion as a main cast member character of michael was absent for entire third season of lost and returned midway through fourth season in ji yeon perrineau was disappointed that he was brought back to show only to be killed and that michael does not get a chance to reunite with his son walt saying there are all these questions about how writers respond to black people on show walt just winds up being another fatherless child it plays into a really big weird stereotype and being a black person myself that wasn t so interesting fate of jin who is also on freighter when it explodes is left uncertain actor daniel dae kim was arrested for driving under influence of alcohol which prompted speculation about his future on series due to co stars michelle rodriguez ana lucia cortez and cynthia watros libby leaving lost after dui arrests this episode also marks malcolm david kelley s first appearance on show since third season excepting a computer effects shot of actor in meet kevin johnson kelley s character walt was benched for

released on december 9 2008 writing throughout season four jack and locke have argued about true nature of island whether it had supernatural powers and on how oceanic flight 815 crashing could be part of survivors destiny upon witnessing island vanish at end of this episode jack finally realizes that locke was right jack then takes locke s advice and convinces other survivors that they must lie about island once they are rescued this is further emphasized by fact that same music is played during jack and locke s conversation and when survivors encounter penny s boat lindelof has also stated that sawyer s message to kate in helicopter is a critical plot point in that it ultimately leads to end of jack and kate s relationship once they return home as seen in something nice back home in terms of plot structure main action scene of episode where others and survivors confront mercenaries was deliberately placed at beginning of part 2 so that remainder of episode could focus on character development furthermore all of present time plotlines are interconnected by c4 bomb on freighter even though writers themselves have called use of bomb as a plot device ridiculous it was necessary however in order to keep both michael and jin from leaving freighter with other survivors thumb writers damon lindelof left and carlton cuse right were unable to shorten script and finale was extended by an hour final scenes of episode particularly ben turning wheel penny and desmond s reunion and last shot of locke in coffin were kept secret in order to prevent spoilers from leaking phrase frozen donkey wheel was coined to describe not only wheel that ben turns but also final scene in which locke is shown to be in coffin only six people knew that locke was in coffin actors

of strike lindelof said that effect of strike on fourth season would be minimal and season s story arc would be completed as originally intended however first draft of second part of there s no place like home was 85 pages long approximately 30 pages longer than a typical one hour lost script lindelof and cuse found that they could not compress second half of season finale into one episode and actually wanted to expand it subsequently show runners went into advanced talks with executives at abc and convinced them to produce one of their episodes in bank thereby extending there s no place like home part 2 to two hours however this caused a scheduling problem with grey s anatomy and ugly betty which were both already scheduled to air their season finales on may 22 2008 to allow lost to

as other episodes of fourth season director jack bender and several others became seasick after only spending a short time on board helicopter featured in several scenes never actually took off from or landed on kahana because rotors were too large and would hit boat if used instead rotors were added using digital effects and helicopter was raised and lowered by a crane onto deck of freighter

flashforwards patrick kevin day of los angeles times praised michael giacchino s musical score writing that i m reminded of heights of emotion this series can evoke jarett wieselman of new york post thought that finale s split and two week break was not cool but asked how brilliant was sun s smackdown on her bad daddy alan sepinwall of star ledger wrote that when lost is at its best it manages to balance revelations with great character moments i don t know that i d put this one in pantheon again a lot of it was set up for parts 2 3 but it was definitely in spirit of what i love about show kristin dos santos of e praised chemistry between naveen andrews and andrea gabriel who play sayid and nadia respectively chris carabott of ign gave part 1 of three hour finale a 7 9 he commended music and called it a good opening to what should be an exciting season finale however lack of suspense in favor of set up was cited as reason for modest rating however carabott gave parts 2 3 a perfect 10 review tying with other perfect 10 episodes such as constant and through looking glass he stated that not a moment is wasted in this brilliantly paced and well executed conclusion to what has been a fantastic season dan compora of syfy portal called part 1 an excellent setup episode with fast pace important revelations and nearly a full utilization of cast compora decided that certain characters work much better in very small doses a little bit of hurley goes a long way and it was nice to see jack featured without completely dominating an episode oscar dahl of buddytv summed up part 1 as very good but said that opening flashforward in which oceanic six are reunited with their families was anticlimactic and although each flashforward scene had minor and major revelations it felt patched together and a little sloppy like lindelof and cuse had all this ground to cover in their quest to link all action up to final scene of season 3 that said flashforward scenes all played out exceedingly well daniel of tmz welcomed return of richard on island and gave episode an a saying that it had more than a few fantastic scenes all flashforward scenes tonight were right on money as far as i was concerned jay glatfelter of huffington post really liked this episode and concluded that it definitely showcased new breath of life fourth season gave to show matthew fox received much praise for his performance in scene in which his character jack reacts to revelation that claire is his half sister jarett wieselman of new york post called this brilliant acting while alan sepinwall of star ledger said that fox played jack s anguish beautifully and called this scene a contender for fox s single best moment in history of show kristin dos santos gave fox mad props and chris carabott of ign said that fox hasn t been given much of an opportunity to stretch his acting muscles this season but he gives a great performance in this scene robert bianco of usa today said that a great season of lost ended with a suitably great finale which ended with whoa inducing discovery that locke was man in casket didn t see that coming and i can t wait to see what this terrific tv series has coming next matthew gilbert of boston globe wrote that episode was dynamic and busy enough as it relied heavily on action adventure but finale wasn t as mind bending as third season s farewell during which we received show s first flash forward alan sepinwall of star ledger enjoyed triple length there s no place like home but ranked it in middle of his list of season s episodes from best to worst and decided that there s no place like home both parts played fair with audience 100 percent answered many questions and yet i feel ever so slightly disappointed by all of this he also found special effects looked much than usual and praised score frazier moore of associated press thought that it might be most rewarding deliciously challenging episode in history of this mystical abc serial dan compora of syfy portal wrote that part 2 was perhaps most action packed meaningful episode of television i ve watched all year pace was excellent and revelations were plentiful compora also wrote that though pace was considerably slower finale delivered in a big way it was not a letdown being well written and well directed in its own right awards second part of there s no
