tunnel railway also known as ramsgate cliff railway ramsgate tunnel railway ramsgate underground railway and world scenic railway was a narrow gauge underground railway in ramsgate kent england following restructuring of railway lines in ramsgate in 1926 section of line between broadstairs and ramsgate harbour including a tunnel to seafront at ramsgate was abandoned narrow gauge tunnel railway was opened within disused tunnel in 1936 to connect tourist attractions and shops near ramsgate harbour with new railway main line at dumpton park except for its two stations one at each end of tunnel line ran entirely underground line was built in less than three months and on its completion in 1936 was one of shortest independent railway lines in country it was open for only three years before being converted to a major air raid shelter during world war ii after war s end it was not included in 1948 nationalisation of british railways but remained in private hands passenger numbers fell during 1960s and line became economically unviable following a train crash in 1965 owners closed line at end of september that year tunnel still exists but no trace remains of either of two stations background thumb upright 1 5 full extent of railway network in kent showing twin lines from london to ramsgate and margate coastal resort and port town of ramsgate was historically served by a complex network of unconnected railway lines legacy of competition between two rival companies to provide links to london and to neighbouring margate town s first railway station ramsgate town was opened by south eastern railway on 13 april 1846 on what was then outskirts of town about a mile from seafront lines from station ran north before splitting west to canterbury and on to london and north to margate harding p 4 london chatham and dover railway opened a second line to ramsgate on 5 october 1863 this line ran from london via herne bay margate and broadstairs before descending to sea level at ramsgate through a tunnel to ramsgate harbour station on seafront immediately adjacent to harbour although very conveniently sited for passengers ramsgate harbour station presented severe operating difficulties its situation at end of a steep gradient in tunnel meant there was constant risk that an out of control train would run through station onto beach as happened on 3 august 1891 and 24 march 1915 mitchell and smith ss and smith ss 111 cramped conditions allowed no room for station growth or improvement and small turntable meant larger engines could not be used so heavier trains needed two engines to haul them up tunnel s gradient additionally by 1920s population of ramsgate had almost doubled since station had opened making freight facilities inadequate with no room for expansion mitchell and smith ss 110 1926 restructuring thumb upright 1 5 layout of pre and post 1926 lines and stations in ramsgate following railway grouping of 1923 both south eastern railway and london chatham dover railway became part of newly formed southern railway which decided to address duplication of lines and stations at ramsgate and margate it decided to link two lines at ramsgate to allow through running between them this scheme had been proposed by south eastern and chatham railway before world war i but work did not commence until 1925 mitchell and smith ss 104 this meant closure of terminus stations at ramsgate town and ramsgate harbour and construction of a line skirting northern edge of town to link two existing lines new stations on north eastern and north western fringes of town called dumpton park and ramsgate respectively replaced existing stations in town centre and at harbour harding p 6 construction work on new line involved over 700 men moving of chalk at a cost of approximately ps500 000 ps in mitchell and smith ss 105 new link opened on 2 july 1926 from which date both former ramsgate stations were closed along with line through tunnel to ramsgate harbour tunnel was sealed and abandoned and former ramsgate harbour station was sold to thanet amusements who converted it into a zoo and funfair called merrie england harding p 7 although adequate for town s residents new stations were a long way from seafront attractions which were at foot of a steep hill day trippers on whom ramsgate s tourist industry depended were therefore increasingly attracted to margate where station was next to beach by 1933 merrie england now under ownership of ramsgate olympia had become extremely popular and ramsgate olympia began to lobby southern railway to reopen line through tunnel with a new junction station between dumpton park and broadstairs harding p 8 however southern railway rejected proposal as too costly and impractical ramsgate olympia and southern railway were keen to make attractions near harbour accessible from railway main line and to provide a service from seafront to greyhound stadium at dumpton park two companies eventually agreed on a scheme by which a new line would use of tunnel nearest beach before branching off into a new tunnel to emerge at a new station at hereson road a walk from dumpton park station ramsgate olympia planned construction of a large scale housing estate charabanc parking facilities and a 10 000 seat stadium at dumpton park to increase passenger numbers and encourage people to use new rail line route thumb upright trains at lower station immediately outside tunnel entrance stations each had three platforms a broad island platform in centre for passengers waiting to board trains and narrower outer platforms from which passengers exited trains although upper station was known as hereson road from outset lower station was never officially named it was known at various times as olympia beach sands and lower terminus harding p 20 platforms and ticket offices were immediately outside mouth of tunnel at both stations line ran between hereson road across road from dumpton park station down a steep gradient of in new tunnel before running at a gradient down original tunnel to lower terminus line consisted of a single line branching into two platform tracks at two stations with a crossing loop halfway along tunnel over journey between hereson road and lower terminus line descended harding p 21 construction and infrastructure new line s infrastructure was designed by henry a leading figure in design of narrow gauge railways he had begun his career at metropolitan railway now part of london underground and had designed route buildings locomotives and rolling stock for rhyl miniature railway and nearby romney hythe and dymchurch railway harding p 9 as new railway would not be carrying heavy loads and would be travelling only a short distance it was built as a narrow gauge railway with a track gauge of this allowed new branch tunnel to be built to far smaller dimensions than existing tunnel at just high and wide although a cable haulage system had initially been considered ramsgate olympia decided early in line s planning to electrify line a third rail system was rejected due to concerns for safety of large numbers of children expected to use line and locomotives had trolley poles drawing power from a single 400 volt dc overhead line running length of tunnel wire ran along wall of old tunnel on brackets in roof of new tunnel and was supported by poles at open air stations electricity was supplied by an electrical substation built by english electric inside tunnel near lower end harding p 24 thumb junction of main tunnel and narrow tunnel to hereson road in 1984 19 years after closure construction work began on 2 may 1936 company hoped to have line open in time to serve large crowds expected on august bank holiday leading to a very tight construction deadline of three months to try to meet deadline construction work was carried out both day and night harding p 10 as journey would take place entirely underground it was decided to line wider original tunnel with illuminated displays showing scenes from around world this led to line becoming semi officially known as world scenic railway english electric built two trains for line designed to resemble electric trains already in use on southern railway but on a smaller scale a four car train painted red was capable of carrying 108 passengers and had a driver s cab at each end to avoid need to turn train around a train painted yellow was also able to carry 108 passengers but had two extra driver s cabs in centre allowing it to be split into two separate trains each capable of carrying 54 passengers it was envisaged that when line was busy both trains would be used but during quiet periods line could be operated by two halves of yellow train harding p 12 red train was modified so that it could also be split reducing its capacity to 102 as two rows of seats at centre were replaced by driver s cabs harding p 13 opening line opened to passengers on 31 july 1936 less than 12 weeks after construction began harding p 14 it was formally opened by lieutenant colonel edwin charles cox traffic manager of southern railway who commented that as traffic manager of what was then largest electric rail service in world he was now opening what was probably smallest initially tunnel was decorated with illuminated scenes depicting switzerland canada netherlands japan and egypt railway proved very popular and over bank holiday weekend carried 20 000 passengers harding p 17 as it relied on tourist trade for business it closed at end of september throughout 1937 1938 and 1939 seasons railway operated between whitsun and end of september each year closing for autumn and winter harding p 18 railway never had a timetable and operated according to demand whenever one station had a sufficient number of passengers driver signalled to other station that he was about to depart and trains from both stations would set off simultaneously passing at halfway crossing loop journey took approximately five minutes outside of times of peak demand full length trains were generally not used and trains used split into their two car sections there was no depot trains were stabled in lower section of tunnel wartime thumb ramsgate air raid shelter tunnel network april 1939 in late 1930s war between britain and germany began to seem likely ramsgate s location on both english channel and north sea and its proximity to thames estuary its large port facilities and its close proximity to raf manston made it a likely target for heavy aerial bombing and as a landing site for any german invasion of britain with this in mind town s borough engineer and surveyor r d devised a scheme in 1938 for a network of tunnels beneath town to serve as a vast deep level air raid shelter for town s inhabitants a semi circular network of tunnels was dug beneath northern ramsgate connecting to existing railway tunnel it was opened by duke of kent on 1 june 1939 three months before outbreak of war and visited during war by winston churchill network was capable of sheltering 60 000 people although ramsgate s civilian population at time was approximately 33 000 post war operations tunnel railway reopened for 1946 season as usual illuminated tableaux had been removed during war but were replaced but this time they were illuminated by floodlights fitted to sides of trains rather than being self illuminated harding p 19 line was not included in 1948 nationalisation of railways and so remained in hands of ramsgate olympia later pleasurama tableaux were removed around 1955 due to increasing vandalism searle p 31 and station signage changed from world scenic railway to tunnel railway thumb upright site of former merrie england and tunnel railway lower terminus 2004 part of chalk cliff near lower terminus collapsed in 1957 forcing railway s closure while a strengthening concrete wall was built new wall reduced lower terminus to a single length of track second track at hereson road was closed at same time and removed to build a short siding near bottom of tunnel for stabling trains wooden station platforms were replaced by modern concrete structures at 2 15 pm on 1 july 1965 one of two car yellow trains lost control while approaching lower terminus and ran off end of rails before smashing into a building driver 74 year old ernest brown was trapped in cab and suffered pelvic injuries while a number of passengers suffered minor injuries although station was repaired and services were resumed pleasurama decided to close line at end of 1965 holiday season services stopped on 26 september 1965 mitchell and smith ss 114 after closure after closure tunnel was sealed although it remained structurally intact inside harding p 29 site of lower terminus was cleared and became an empty site surrounded by a construction hoarding there was a small roundabout directly outside south portal of tunnel hereson road station became used car dealership four of railway s carriages were sold to steam collection and remain in use while other three were given to hampshire narrow gauge railway society most of rails and sleepers were sold to romney hythe and dymchurch railway harding p 30 following three years of renovation lower section of tunnel was reopened to public in 2014 as part of ramsgate tunnels tourist attraction tunnels were formally reopened by prince edward duke of kent in a ceremony on 27 may 2014 references notes bibliography external links tunnel railway and ramsgate air raid shelters at subterranea britannica
