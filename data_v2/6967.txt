state route 504 sr 504 designated as spirit lake memorial highway is a state highway in southwestern washington state in united states it travels along north fork toutle river to mount st helens area serving as main access to mount st helens national volcanic monument highway begins at an interchange with interstate 5 i 5 and sr 411 in castle rock and terminates at johnston ridge observatory near spirit lake cowlitz county government built spirit lake highway in 1903 and paved it in early 1930s before it was transferred to state control becoming secondary state highway 1r ssh 1r in 1937 ssh 1r initially ended at boundary of columbia national forest now gifford pinchot national forest but was extended in 1961 to timberline of mountain it was renumbered to sr 504 in 1964 and remained popular with loggers and tourists requiring bridges and sections to be rebuilt a major section of sr 504 was destroyed in may 18 1980 eruption of mount st helens and its subsequent lahar on north fork toutle river state government rebuilt most of highway from 1988 to 1997 relocating it further north and connecting to new interpretive centers at coldwater ridge and johnston ridge a part of old alignment near toutle river sediment dam is signed as a spur route continued volcanic activity at mount st helens particularly in mid 2000s has resulted in closures and evacuations along highway at various times route description thumb left hoffstadt creek bridge on sr 504 located near toutle river sediment dam alt a steel bridge with a slight arch carrying a two lane road across a gorge that cuts

toutle river and also includes a rest area sr 504 continues further into mountains crossing bear creek and traveling around elk rock to a viewpoint on its southeast side from elk rock area highway forms northern boundary of mount st helens national volcanic monument and encounters more mountainous terrain that results in several hairpin turns between other scenic viewpoints after crossing several branches of maratta creek sr 504 reaches a partial cloverleaf interchange with an access road that serves coldwater science and learning center a visitor center that overlooks mountain and open from autumn to spring highway heads west before completing a hairpin turn to travel south around end of coldwater lake beyond milepost 45 sr 504 is closed during winter months due to hazardous conditions for drivers and potential avalanches thumb right a view of mount st helens from inside johnston ridge observatory located at east end of sr 504 alt a view of mount st helens with its

spring to autumn and situated at an elevation of sr 504 terminates downhill from observatory at its parking lot located north of mount st helens crater sr 504 is maintained by washington state department of transportation wsdot which conducts an annual survey on state highways to measure traffic volume in terms of average annual daily traffic average traffic volumes on highway in 2016 ranged from a minimum of 500 vehicles near coldwater lake to a maximum of 14 000 vehicles at i 5 interchange in castle rock sr 504 is main route for a majority of 3 million annual visitors to mount st helens area it is designated by state government as spirit lake memorial highway a state scenic byway and a national forest scenic byway by united states forest service history early history and state acquisition spirit lake highway was completed in 1903 by cowlitz county government connecting castle rock to shore of spirit lake by following north fork toutle river highway was initially unpaved and characterized as rough and narrow and several sections were improved or bypassed in 1910s it was added to state highway system in 1937 as secondary state highway 1r ssh 1r terminating at western boundary of columbia national forest near spirit lake state government paved sections of highway in late 1930s and early 1940s with only a short section at east end remaining unpaved by 1944 remaining section of highway within columbia national forest was improved and paved by federal bureau of public roads in late 1930s for 1 2 million equivalent to in dollars expanded logging and a planned ski resort on mount st helens hastened construction of a modern highway linking spirit lake to timberline on mountain s northern slopes despite support from state government forest service and bureau of public roads highway project was put on hold for several years due to funding shortfalls state legislature approved funds for extension of ssh 1r into national forest which began in late 1959 in 1961 ssh 1r designation was extended on new timberline highway which opened to traffic following september during 1964 state highway renumbering ssh 1r was designated sr 504 under modern sign route now state route system state highway department completed construction of a new bridge over toutle river at kid valley in november 1965 replacing a narrower truss bridge by 1970s several new campgrounds trailheads and recreation areas had been established along highway by forest service and logging companies like to serve tourists visiting mount st helens area a major flood in december 1977 left eight sections of highway washed out and only passable by one lane of traffic until repairs were completed following year 1980 eruption and rebuilding thumb left a truss bridge carrying sr 504 over

mount st helens was struck by an earthquake swarm that indicated potential eruptive activity for volcano which had been dormant for over a century forest service established a roadblock on sr 504 approximately west of spirit lake on march 28 because of potential avalanche risks in following days roadblock was moved to west of lake and later west as risk of an imminent eruption grew many local residents and sightseers violated roadblock which was planned to be moved further west by an order from governor dixy lee ray to take effect on may 19 an exception was made on may 17 allowing for retrieval of belongings from various buildings during a four hour period that was monitored by local authorities in case of a mass evacuation on may 18 1980 north face of mount st helens slid away and triggered a massive eruption that created a lahar that devastated north fork toutle river lahar destroyed about of sr 504 including seven of highway s eight major bridges leaving only kid valley bridge standing because of its sufficient clearance remaining section between toutle and kid valley was buried in up to of sediment but was able to re open by september with temporary bailey bridges and other structures several vehicles on highway were swept away by lahar including those carrying some of eruption s 57 victims thumb right a section of sr 504 near coal bank buried under a lahar deposit alt a high surface of mud with a person posing next to a traffic sign reading no shoulder that is almost completely buried highway was closed beyond town of toutle controlled by a roadblock and an existing turnaround loop installed by weyerhaeuser access to kid valley was restored by early september using a temporary bailey bridge over toutle river highway was extended to debris and sediment dam and weyerhaeuser s camp baker site in 1987 at a cost of 11 million equivalent to in dollars in 1982 federal government designated area around volcano as mount st helens national volcanic monument and state government designated sr 504 as spirit lake memorial highway to honor victims of eruption a visitor center was also opened at silver lake in 1987 to serve growing number of tourists to area but highway would remain closed beyond sediment dam preliminary plans for a replacement for highway to serve north side of mount st helens were approved by state government in 1986 highway would include of new road built at a higher elevation between kid valley and newly formed coldwater lake crossing over various creeks with ten major bridges project s 118 million cost equivalent to in dollars was paid from emergency funds from federal highway administration construction of new highway and its scenic viewpoints began in 1988 and first section to coldwater ridge visitor center was completed on october 16 1992 expected influx of tourists and their potential impact on recovering habitat around volcano alarmed scientists looking to preserve areas for sensitive research after finding that elk herds were leaving areas with improved highway access forest service established restricted zones within national monument that prohibited off trail hiking pets fires and camping two additional visitor centers weyerhaeuser s forest learning center and former hoffstadt bluffs visitor center opened in 1995 at milepost 33 and 1996 at milepost 27 respectively in may 1997 sr 504 was extended to its current terminus at newly opened johnston ridge observatory named for volcanologist david a johnston construction of extension included underground blasting to compact soil and provide one of highway s bridges with a stable foundation it replaced an original plan to build a forest road that would be used by shuttle buses between coldwater ridge and johnston ridge facility recent history a long proposed extension of sr 504 to eastern side of mount st helens area gained traction in early 2000s sparking outcry from scientists and environmentalists route connecting coldwater lake to existing forest highway 99 near windy ridge and beyond to forest highway 25 was supported by officials from cowlitz and lewis counties as a tourist draw and a potential evacuation route wsdot studied several options for proposed highway which enjoyed mixed public support and estimated a cost of 18 5 million to construct one option and 44 million for another equivalent to and respectively in dollars proposed highway was rejected by state legislators due to its cost despite attempts at salvaging cheaper proposal by converting it into a toll road from 2004 until 2006 increased volcanic activity at mount st helens caused a surge in tourist traffic on sr 504 along with periodic shutdowns of johnston ridge section an evacuation of area was ordered in early october 2004 due to seismic activity indicating a possible buildup of magma forcing 2 500 visitors to leave coldwater and johnston centers for several days evacuation was later cancelled and other restrictions were relaxed after steam eruptions diffused pressure inside volcano a minor mudslide in march 2007 blocked a section of sr 504 near kid valley and was removed after a week long cleanup by wsdot crews major intersections spur route sr 504 has a short spur route east of kid valley that runs along sediment dam road it follows a section of former highway and terminates at a wsdot maintenance facility near toutle river sediment dam an average of 50 vehicles use road on a daily basis according to annual daily traffic data measured by wsdot in 2016 references external links highways of washington state category
