roystonea regia commonly known as cuban royal palm or florida royal palm is a species of palm that is native to mexico parts of central america and caribbean and southern florida a large and attractive palm it has been planted throughout tropics and subtropics as an ornamental tree although it is sometimes called r elata conserved name r regia is now correct name for species royal palm reaches heights from 50 to over 80 feet tall populations in cuba and florida were long seen as separate species but are now considered to belong to a single species best known as an ornamental r regia is also used as a source of thatch construction timber and in some forms of so called traditional medicine although there is currently no valid scientific evidence to support efficacy or use of any palm species for medicinal purposes fruit is eaten by birds and bats which disperse seeds and fed to livestock its flowers are visited by birds and bats and it serves as a roosting site and food source for a variety of animals roystonea regia is national tree of cuba and has a religious role both in santeria and christianity where it is used in palm sunday observances description thumb worm eye view of a mature royal palm thumb distinctive smooth crownshaft and rows of circular leaf scars are clearly visible roystonea regia is a large palm which reaches a height of tall with heights up to reported and a stem diameter of about k f connor reports a maximum stem diameter of trunk is stout very smooth and grey white in colour with a characteristic bulge below a distinctive green crownshaft trees have about 15 leaves which can be up to long flowers are white with pinkish anthers fruit are spheroid to ellipsoid in shape long and wide they are green when immature turning red and eventually purplish black as they mature root nodules containing bacteria have been found on r regia trees in india presence of rhizobia containing root nodules is usually associated with nitrogen fixation in legumes this was first record of root nodules in a monocotyledonous tree further evidence of nitrogen fixation was provided by presence of nitrogenase an enzyme used in nitrogen fixation and a compound which allows nitrogenase to function by reducing oxygen concentration in root nodule in addition to evidence of nitrogen fixation nodules were also found to be producing indole acetic acid an important plant hormone taxonomy roystonea is placed in subfamily arecoideae and tribe placement roystonea within arecoideae is uncertain a phylogeny based on plastid dna failed to resolve position of genus within arecoideae as of 2008 there appear to be no molecular phylogenetic studies of roystonea and relationship between r regia and rest of genus is uncertain species was first described by american naturalist william bartram in 1791 as palma elata based on trees growing in central florida in 1816 german botanist carl sigismund kunth described species oreodoxa regia based on collections made by alexander von humboldt and aime bonpland in cuba in 1825 german botanist curt polycarp joachim sprengel moved it to genus oenocarpus and renamed it o regius genus oreodoxa was proposed by german botanist carl ludwig willdenow in 1807 and applied by him to two species o acuminata now known as acuminata and o praemorsa now praemorsa although these species were transferred to other genera genus oreodoxa continued to be applied to a variety of superficially similar species which were not in fact closely related to address this problem american botanist orator f cook created genus roystonea which he named in honour of american general roy stone and renamed kunth s species roystonea regia thumb left botanical garden aswan egypt right thumb stem base of two individuals in kolkata showing fibrous roots typical of monocots cook considered floridian populations to be distinct from both cuba r regia and puerto rican r borinquena and he placed them in a new species r floridana which is now considered a synonym of r regia in 1906 charles henry wright described two new species based on collections from georgetown british guiana now guyana which he placed in genus euterpe e and e both species are now considered synonyms of r regia name r regia var was applied by paul h allen to central american populations of species however scott zona determined that they did not differ enough from cuban populations to be considered a separate variety based on rules of botanical nomenclature oldest properly published name for a species has priority over newer names bartram applied linnaean binomial palma elata to a large solitary palm with an ashen white trunk topped by a green leaf sheath crownshaft and pinnate leaves growing in central florida while no type collection is known there are no other native palms that would fit bartram s description in 1946 francis harper pointed out that bartram s name was valid and proposed a new combination roystonea elata liberty hyde bailey s use of name in his 1949 revision of genus established its usage harper s new combination immediately supplanted cook s r floridana but there was disagreement as to whether cuban and floridian populations represented a single species or two species zona s revision of genus concluded that they both belonged to same species according to rules of botanical nomenclature correct name of species should have been roystonea elata zona pointed out however that name r regia or oreodoxa regia has a history of use in horticulture that dated from at least 1838 and that species had been propagated around world under that name roystonea elata on other hand had only been used since 1949 and was used much less widely on that basis zona proposed that name roystonea regia should be conserved common names in cultivation roystonea regia is called cuban royal palm or simply royal palm in cuba tree is called palma real or palma criolla in india where it is widely cultivated it is called reproduction and growth thumb left a pair of trees in kolkata alongside on ground is a freshly shed leaf with sheath still green thumb shedding of leaf in royal palm roystonea regia produces unisexual flowers that are pollinated by animals european honey bees and bats are reported pollinators seeds are dispersed by birds and bats that feed upon fruit seed germination is adjacent during germination as cotyledon expands it only pushes a portion of embryo out of seed as a result seedling develops adjacent to seed embryo forms a and protrudes from this seedlings in cultivation are reported to begin producing a stem two years after germination at point where they produce their thirteenth leaf growth rates of seedlings averaged per year in florida jones julie lynn 1983 an

throughout tropics and subtropics as an ornamental seed is used as a source of oil and for livestock feed leaves are used for thatching and wood for construction roots are used as a diuretic and for that reason they are added to a haitian drink by cubans of haitian origin they are also used as a treatment for diabetes fibres extracted from leaf sheath of r regia have been found to be comparable with sisal and banana fibres but lower in density making it a potentially useful source for use in lightweight composite materials an extract from r regia fruit known as d 004 reduces benign prostate
