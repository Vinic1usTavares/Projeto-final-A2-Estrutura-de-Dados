thumb company telegraph stamp british and irish magnetic telegraph company also called magnetic telegraph company or magnetic was founded by john brett in 1850 magnetic was principal competitor to largest telegraph company in united kingdom electric telegraph company electric magnetic was leading company in ireland while electric was leading company in mainland britain between them they dominated market until telegraph was nationalised in 1870 magnetic s telegraph system differed from other telegraph companies they favoured underground cables rather than wires suspended on poles this system was problematic because of limitations of insulation materials available at time but magnetic was constrained by wayleaves owned by other companies on better routes they were also unique in not using batteries which were required on other systems instead operator generated necessary power electromagnetically coded message was sent by operator moving handles which moved coils past a permanent magnet thus generating telegraph pulses magnetic laid first submarine telegraph cable to ireland and developed an extensive telegraph network there they had a close connection with submarine telegraph company and for a while had a monopoly on underwater and hence international communication they also closely cooperated with london district telegraph company who provided a cheap telegram service in london magnetic was amongst first to employ women as telegraph operators company history thumb upright left stamp of english and irish magnetic telegraph company english and irish magnetic telegraph company which was known as magnetic was established by john brett in 1850 john pender also had an p 294 and charles tilston bright was chief engineer huurdeman p 129 company s initial objective was to connect britain with ireland following success of submarine telegraph company in connecting england with france with first ocean cable to be put in service smith p 21 british and irish magnetic telegraph company was formed in p 294 citing barty king p 11 says date was 1856 in liverpool through a merger of english and irish magnetic telegraph company and british telegraph company originally known as british electric telegraph company roberts ch p 77 main competitor of magnetic was electric telegraph company later after a merger electric and international telegraph company electric for short founded by william fothergill cooke by end of 1850s electric and magnetic companies were virtually a cartel in britain hills p 22 in 1859 magnetic moved its headquarters from liverpool to threadneedle street in london in recognition that they were no longer a regional company they shared these premises with submarine telegraph company kieve p 55 company had a close relationship with submarine telegraph company who laid first cable to france and many subsequent submarine telegraph cables to europe from about 1857 magnetic had an agreement with them that all their submarine cables were to be used only with of magnetic bright bright pp 73 74 magnetic also had control of first cable to ireland this control of international traffic gave them a significant advantage in domestic market hills pp 62 63 another company with a close relationship was london district telegraph company district formed in 1859 district provided a cheap telegram service within london only they shared headquarters and directors with magnetic magnetic installed their lines and trained their staff in return for district passing on traffic for magnetic outside london kieve pp 56 59 magnetic founded its own press agency it promoted its agency by offering lower rates to customers who used it than rates for customers who wanted connections to rival agencies hills p 66 in 1870 magnetic along with several other telegraph companies including electric were nationalised under telegraph act 1868 and company wound up telegraph system thumb plan view of henley and foster two needle telegraph telegraph system of magnetic was somewhat different from other companies this was largely because electric held patents for cooke and wheatstone telegraph mercer p 8 name of company refers to fact that their telegraph system did not require batteries power for transmissions was generated electromagnetically beauchamp p 77 system invented by william thomas henley and george foster in 1848 schaffner vol 1 p 201 vol 2 p 369 was a needle telegraph and came in double needle or single needle versions machine was worked by operator pushing pedal keys an armature connected to key moved two coils through magnetic field of a permanent magnet this generated a pulse of current which caused a deflection of corresponding needle at both ends of line needles were and so arranged that they were held in position by permanent magnet after deflection operator was able to apply a current in reverse direction so that there were two positions that needle could be held in code consisted of various combinations of successive needle deflections to left or right in later years magnetic used other telegraph systems after takeover of british telegraph company magnetic acquired rights to needle telegraph instrument of that company s founder henry highton this instrument was cheapest of any of instruments produced at time but like all needle telegraphs was slower than audible systems due to operator having to continually look up at instrument while transcribing message some companies moved to needle instruments with making two different sounds when needle struck them an innovation of cooke and wheatstone in 1845 bowers pp 150 151 to solve this problem magnetic instead used an 1854 invention of charles tilston bright on its more busy lines this was acoustic telegraph not to be confused with acoustic telegraphy method of multiplexing known as bright s bells in this system two bells placed either side of operator are rung with a hammer made to strike bell by a solenoid driven by a relay they are so arranged that right and left bells are struck according to whether a positive or negative pulse of current is received on telegraph line such bells make a much louder sound than clicking of a needle magnetic found a method of overcoming problem of dispersion on long submarine telegraph cables poorly understood phenomenon at that time was called retardation because different parts of a telegraph pulse travels at different speeds on cable part of pulse appears to be retarded arriving later than rest at destination this smearing out of pulse interferes with neighbouring pulses making transmission unintelligible unless messages are sent at a much slower speed hagen pp 300 311 magnetic found that if they generated pulses of opposite polarity to main pulse and slightly delayed from it retarded signal was sufficiently cancelled to make line usable at normal operator speeds bright p 26 magnetic played a part in solving dispersion problem on transatlantic telegraph cable of atlantic telegraph company magnetic were strongly connected with this project bright promoted it and shares were sold largely to magnetic shareholders including pender bright pp 31 32 dispersion on 1858 atlantic cable had been so severe that it was almost unusable it was destroyed by misguided attempts to solve problem using high voltage hunt p 64 for 1866 cable it was planned to use magnetic s opposite polarity pulse method but doubts were expressed over whether it would work over such a great distance magnetic connected together various of their british underground cables to provide a total line length of over for proof of principle testing bright pp 25 26 dispersion was not eliminated from submarine cables until loading coils started to be used on them from 1906 onwards newell p 478 telegraph network first connection to ireland company s first object in 1852 was to provide first telegraph service between great britain and ireland by means of a submarine cable between portpatrick in scotland and donaghadee in ireland smith p 21 cable core was gutta percha insulated copper wire made by gutta percha company this was armoured with iron wires by r s newall and company at their works in sunderland before this could be achieved two other companies attempted to be first to make connection across irish sea despite having contract to lay magnetic company s cable newall also secretly constructed another cable at their gateshead works with intention of being first to get a telegraph connection to ireland this newall cable was only lightly armoured with an open bird cage structure of iron wires there was no cushioning layer between core and armour and insulation was not properly tested before laying because of great hurry to get job done before magnetic was ready this cable was laid from holyhead in wales to howth near dublin with william henry woodhouse as engineer and thence to dublin via underground cable along railway line laying of submarine cable was completed on 1 june 1852 by city of dublin steam packet company s chartered paddle steamer britannia of 1825 usually used as a cattle ship and with assistance from admiralty with hms prospero haigh p 36 describes britannia as a 254 ton barque with an added steam engine built in 1827 at yarmouth no source to support this has been found however cable failed a few days later and was never put into service huurdeman p 129 credits laying of this cable to magnetic company in july of same year electric telegraph company of ireland tried using an insulated cable inside a hemp rope on portpatrick to donaghadee route this construction proved problematic because it floated submarine telegraph company s dover to calais cable in 1850 was also lightweight having no protection at all other than insulation but they had taken precaution of adding periodic lead weights to sink cable smith pp 7 8 it was laid from a schooner reliance assisted by tugs strong sea currents in irish sea deeper than english channel dragged cable into a large bow and there was consequently insufficient length to land it attempt was abandoned smith p 22 for their cable magnetic were more careful in testing insulation of batches of cable than newall coils of cable were hung over side of dock and left to soak before testing they used a new type of battery for insulation testing that was capable of being used at sea previously test batteries had been lined wooden cases with liquid electrolyte daniell cell new battery comprised a moulded gutta percha case filled with sand saturated with electrolyte making it virtually it was known as sand battery 144 cells were used in series around several suspect portions of insulation were removed and repaired by opening up iron wire armouring with spanish smith pp 22 23 newall attempted to lay sunderland made cable again using chartered steamer britannia in autumn of 1852 cable was too taut as she sailed from portpatrick resulting in test instruments being dragged into sea several delays caused by broken iron wires as cable was laid resulted in ship drifting off course and running out of cable and this attempt too was abandoned smith p 24 magnetic were successful with a new cable in 1853 over same route with newall this time using chartered newcastle collier william hutt ash p pp 36 37 this was a six core cable and heavier than 1852 cable weighing seven tons per mile at over down it was deepest cable laid to that date bright p 14 repairs to cable in 1861 required 128 splices tests on pieces of retrieved cable found that copper wire used was very impure containing less than 50 copper despite gutta percha company specifying 85 smith p 101 land network magnetic s network was centred on northern england scotland and ireland with its headquarters in liverpool like most other telegraph companies it ran its major telegraph trunk lines along railways in its home area beauchamp p 77 one of their first lines was ten unarmoured wires buried in space between two railway tracks of lancashire and yorkshire railway smith pp 302 303 magnetic developed an extensive underground cable network from 1851 onwards bright p 5 this was in contrast to other companies who used wires suspended between telegraph poles or in built up areas from rooftop to rooftop beauchamp p 77 partly magnetic buried cables for better protection from elements bright bright p 73 however a more pressing reason was that many railway companies had exclusive agreements with electric which shut out magnetic bright p 5 further british telegraph company had exclusive rights for overhead lines on public roads and united kingdom telegraph company had exclusive rights along canals bright bright pp 74 75 magnetic had a particular problem in reaching london their solution was to run buried cables along major roads ten wires were installed in this way along route london birmingham manchester glasgow carlisle bright p 5 wires on poles do not need to be electrically insulated although they may have a protective coating this is not so with underground lines these must be insulated from ground and from each other insulation must also be waterproof wheen p 83 good insulating materials were not available in early days of telegraphy but after william montgomerie sent samples of gutta percha to europe in 1843 gutta percha company started making gutta percha insulated electrical cable from 1848 onwards haigh pp 26 27 gutta percha is a natural rubber that is thermoplastic so is good for continuous processes like cable making synthetic thermoplastic insulating material was not available until invention of polyethylene in 1930s and it was not used for submarine cables until 1940s ash p 29 on cooling gutta percha is hard durable and waterproof making it suitable for underground and later submarine cables this was cable chosen by magnetic for its underground lines beauchamp p 77 in ireland too magnetic developed an extensive network of underground cables in 1851 in anticipation of submarine cable connection being laid to donaghadee magnetic laid an underground cable to dublin bright p 25 once submarine link was in place dublin could be connected to london via manchester and liverpool in west of ireland by 1855 they had laid cables that stretched down entire length of island on route sligo galway limerick tralee cape clear bright p 24 relationship of magnetic with irish railway companies was exact opposite of that in britain magnetic obtained exclusive agreements with many railways including in 1858 with midland great western railway in ireland it was electric s turn to be forced on to roads and canals kieve p 54 in 1856 magnetic discovered that insulation of cables laid in dry soil was deteriorating this was due to essential oils in gutta percha evaporating leaving just a porous woody residue bright tried to overcome this by oils but with limited success this problem was main driver for acquiring unprofitable british telegraph company so that magnetic inherited their overhead cable rights from this point magnetic avoided laying new underground cables except where it was essential to do so bright bright pp 72 73 atlantic cable brett started fundraising for atlantic telegraph company s project to build transatlantic telegraph cable at magnetic s liverpool headquarters in november 1856 brett was one of founders of this company and magnetic s shareholders were inclined to invest because they expected that transatlantic traffic would mean more business for magnetic s irish lines this was because landing point for cable was in ireland and traffic would therefore have to pass through magnetic s lines kieve pp 106 107 social issues magnetic was an early advocate of employing women as telegraph operators they were paid according to speed with which they could send messages up to maximum of ten shillings per week when 10 was achieved it was a popular job with unmarried women who otherwise had few good options beauchamp p 77 notes references bibliography ash stewart development of submarine cables ch 1 in burnett douglas r beckman robert davenport tara m submarine cables
