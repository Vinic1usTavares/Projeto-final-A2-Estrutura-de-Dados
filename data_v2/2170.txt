persona 2 duology innocent sin and eternal punishment for playstation producer kouji okada was one of original creators of atlus megami tensei series longtime megami tensei artist kazuma kaneko acted as art director and character designer director was katsura hashino having worked as a planner on multiple titles since shin megami tensei if maken x was his debut as a game director game was developed by internal studio atlus r d1 most of development team were directly carried over from second persona 2 game atlus staff were beginning to feel limited by scope of megami tensei universe so when they were shown specifications of dreamcast console they immediately decided to create something new for that console okada later said that atlus main desire when creating maken x was to develop something new after making role playing games for most of company s lifetime speaking in an interview okada and kaneko referred to development period for maken x as quite turbulent kaneko felt at first that game was an odd job but over time he became deeply involved as game graduated into being an important project for him it was first time team had tried development with dreamcast which proved more versatile and powerful than expected developers initially wanted a neat development project but demands came for a more expansive project resulting in game s scale greatly increasing and development process becoming chaotic with more staff coming on board to help development due to these factors period of trial and error when creating gameplay lasted much longer than intended first person perspective combined with sword based action was chosen to create a unique feel for game while 3d elements had been included in earlier atlus titles maken x was first time atlus used both full 3d visuals and full motion 3d cgi cutscenes game was also first time megami tensei team had attempted development of a game outside role playing genre okada described main theme as power achieved through intelligence and overcoming environments main narrative featured multiple references to chinese mythology while many of player characters drew from historical and literary figures from each country game visited hakke leaders of sangokai were designed around a particular part of their body being malformed a narrative element carried over from megami tensei franchise was a system of choices based on morality that influenced ending while these elements had been thoroughly explored in megami tensei team felt themes still had potential and so used it in maken x game was atlus first title to feature full voice acting team initially planned to voice event scenes in english and chinese with japanese subtitles but included voice acting across whole game due to positive feedback a similar set of circumstances led to wide use of stereophonic sound across whole game when it was initially planned only for action sequences maken shao demon sword maken shao demon sword known in japan simply as maken shao was developed by atlus for playstation 2 okada hashino and kaneko returned to their respective roles additional cgi segments were created by polygon magic while basic gameplay and original plot were carried over several adjustments were made biggest change was a shift from a first person to a third person perspective this was done due to a recurring problem with japanese gamers dubbed 3d sickness where people became motion sick when playing first person games another improvement was sound environment which made full use of dolby surround software title s added yao character an archaic chinese symbol was used as it represented two x characters showing game s status as an evolved version of maken x music game s original score was composed by shoji meguro and takahiro ogata musical style which was described by okada as all techno music with heavy drumbeats was intended to make game feel lively and fast meguro worked on soundtrack for around a year and a half and composed most of game s music receiving some concepts for tunes and then being left to his own devices he was faced with restrictions with console s hardware but was able to have more creative freedom than his work on devil summoner soul hackers jazz oriented ending theme sung by diana leaves was cited by meguro as one of his favorite compositions from game due to his work meguro was unable to contribute to persona 2 duology at time despite his previous involvement with revelations persona meguro returned to compose for maken shao remixing many paces and adding additional musical elements an official soundtrack was released by king records in japan on december 23 1999 an album of remixed tracks from game by a number of guest musicians maken x remix soundtrack l image released by avex mode on january 19 2000 maken x album which became fairly rare in years following its release was later re released by atlus on itunes on june 1 2011 a new remix

tenth anniversary release maken x was first announced in november 1998 maken x was published by atlus on november 25 1999 while atlus earlier megami tensei titles were aimed fully at japanese market maken x had been designed from outset to have an international appeal voice recording for international release took place in north america meguro was involved in process which he stated was a positive experience localization was handled cooperatively by atlus and american branch of sega who acted as game s publishers game s international release was announced in february 2000 one of points atlus was concerned about for international version was use of nazi imagery for some enemies due to what were described as cultural points that could be harmful game s graphics were altered for international release to avoid controversy gameplay remained unchanged between versions kaneko described voice recording as most difficult part of localization initially scheduled for release in march game was pushed forward into april for unspecified reasons although it was speculated that it was due to that month already boasting several game releases maken x was eventually released in north america on april 26 2000 in europe game was released on july 7 of that year maken shao was first announced in february 2001 prior to its official announcement there was speculation that it was a

design that kept it from contending with likes of goldeneye 007 saying that it was otherwise a good dreamcast game for adventure players in contrast lee skittrell of computer and video games felt it was not worth purchasing other than by those desperate for an action game due to many faults he found james mielke of gamespot called maken x a strong addition to dreamcast library and a good game in its own right ign s anoop gantayat felt game should be rented rather than immediately bought due to his own complaints while website game revolution said that maken x was one of those games that could have been great nerys coward of official dreamcast magazine praised story calling it theatrical and intriguing while in contrast gantayat felt storytelling was poor and faulted sega s translation for further effecting it edge magazine noted story s prominence set maken x apart from equivalent first person games of time skittrell was highly critical of story segments as boring and far too long but said story was entertaining game revolution praised unique choice of maken as protagonist along with variety of endings english voice acting was panned by multiple critics coward described gameplay as highly enjoyable praising variety of playable characters but faulting controls as stiff edge praised combat options and refreshing change from standard combat in other first person games noting variety offered by character abilities but criticizing lack of multiplayer options mielke called gameplay pretty standard aside from enemy variety and character options and noted light puzzle elements skittrell generally found game s substance lacking but enjoyed brainjacking feature multiple reviewers faulted controls as cumbersome or inappropriate for gameplay coward praised slick and glitch free environments while gantayat gave unanimous praise to both game s graphics and its character designs mielke gave particular praise to kaneko s character designs and like coward noted environments as being free of glitches and running smooth while maintaining quality skittrell called environmental graphics super crisp but lifeless and bland a sentiment shared by edge notes references external
