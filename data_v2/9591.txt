mcdonnell douglas now boeing av 8b harrier ii is a single engine ground attack aircraft that constitutes second generation of harrier jump jet family capable of vertical or short takeoff and landing v stol aircraft was designed in late 1970s as an anglo american development of british hawker siddeley harrier first operational v stol aircraft aircraft is primarily employed on light attack or multi role missions ranging from close air support of ground troops to armed reconnaissance av 8b is used by united states marine corps usmc spanish navy and italian navy a variant of av 8b british aerospace harrier ii was developed for british military while another tav 8b is a dedicated two seat trainer project that eventually led to av 8b s creation started in early 1970s as a cooperative effort between united states and united kingdom uk aimed at addressing operational inadequacies of first generation harrier early efforts centered on a larger more powerful pegasus engine to dramatically improve capabilities of harrier due to budgetary constraints uk abandoned project in 1975 following withdrawal of uk mcdonnell douglas extensively redesigned earlier av 8a harrier to create av 8b while retaining general layout of its predecessor aircraft incorporates a new wing an elevated cockpit a redesigned fuselage one extra hardpoint per wing and other structural and aerodynamic refinements aircraft is powered by an upgraded version of pegasus which gives aircraft its v stol ability av 8b made its maiden flight in november 1981 and entered service with usmc in january 1985 later upgrades added a night attack capability and radar resulting in av 8b na and av 8b harrier ii plus respectively an enlarged version named harrier iii was also studied but not pursued uk through british aerospace re joined improved harrier project as a partner in 1981 giving it a significant work share in project after corporate mergers in 1990s boeing and bae systems have jointly supported program approximately 340 aircraft were produced in a 22 year production program that ended in 2003 typically operated from small aircraft carriers large amphibious assault ships and simple forward operating bases av 8bs have participated in numerous military and humanitarian operations proving themselves versatile assets u s army general norman schwarzkopf named usmc harrier ii as one of several important weapons in gulf war aircraft took part in combat during iraq war beginning in 2003 harrier ii has served in operation enduring freedom in afghanistan since 2001 and was

expected to operate its harriers until 2025 development origins in late 1960s and early 1970s first generation harriers entered service with royal air force raf and united states marine corps usmc but were handicapped in range and payload in short takeoff and landing configuration av 8a american designation for harrier carried less than half 4 000 lb 1 800 kg payload of smaller a 4 skyhawk over a more limited radius donald and march 2004 p 55 to address this issue hawker siddeley and mcdonnell douglas began joint development of a more capable version of harrier in 1973 early efforts concentrated on an improved pegasus engine designated pegasus 15 which was being tested by bristol siddeley wilson 2000 p 26 although more powerful engine s diameter was too large by to fit into harrier easily jenkins 1998 pp 69 70 in december 1973 a joint american and british team completed a project document defining an advanced harrier powered by pegasus 15 engine advanced harrier was
