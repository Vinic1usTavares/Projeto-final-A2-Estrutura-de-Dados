sport of cross country skiing encompasses a variety of formats for cross country skiing races over courses of varying lengths according to rules sanctioned by international ski federation and by various national organizations such as u s ski and snowboard association ussa and cross country ski canada international competitions include fis nordic world ski championships fis cross country world cup and at winter olympic games such races occur over homologated groomed courses designed to support classic in track and freestyle events where skiers may employ skate skiing it also encompasses cross country ski marathon events sanctioned by worldloppet ski federation and cross country ski orienteering events sanctioned by international orienteering federation related forms of competition are biathlon where competitors race on cross country skis and stop to shoot at targets with rifles and paralympic cross country skiing that allows athletes with disabilities to compete at cross country skiing with adaptive equipment norwegian army units were skiing for sport and prizes in 18th century starting in latter part of 20th century technique evolved from striding in track classic technique to include skate skiing which occurs on courses that have been groomed with wide lanes for those using technique at same time equipment evolved from skis and poles that were made of wood and other natural materials to comprising such man made materials as fiberglass carbon fiber and polyethylene plastics athletes train to achieve endurance strength speed skill and flexibility at different levels of intensity offseason training often occurs on dry land sometimes on roller skis organization of cross country ski competitions aims to make those events accessible both to spectators and television audiences as with other sports that require endurance strength and speed some athletes have chosen to use banned performance enhancing drugs history thumb local championship norway 1925

a wagering race on skis bo olav skiing throughout history translated by w edson richmond oslo 1993 a distinct alpine technique emerged around 1900 from how skiing was practiced up until then when mathias zdarsky advocated ski method as an alternative to norwegian technique in norwegian refers to competitive skiing where goal is to complete a specific distance in pre set tracks in shortest possible time alpine skiing competitions known as hill races existed in norway during 18th and 19th centuries but were discontinued when main ski festival in oslo focused on long races competitive cross country skiing and ski jumping now known as nordic disciplines alpine disciplines reemerged in central europe around 1920 ski touring competitions are long distance cross country competitions open to public competition is usually within age categories in 1800s racers used a single wooden pole which was longer and stronger than modern poles and could be used for braking downhill as well in norway racing with two poles finland style met with resistance starting in 1880s when some race rules forbade them objections included issues of aesthetics how they made skiers waddle like geese as use of pairs of pole became norm materials favored lightness and strength starting with bamboo which gave way to fiberglass used at 1968 winter olympics aluminum used at 1972 winter olympics and ultimately carbon fiber introduced in 1975 skate skiing skate skiing was introduced to competition in 20th century at first german ski championship held at in black forest in 1900 norwegian bjarne won 23 km cross country race and was observed using a skating motion while skiing a technique unknown to spectators vaage jacob norske ski verden oslo gyldendal 1952 johan used skating technique at 1931 world championship in oberhof one of earliest recorded use of skating in competitive cross country skiing this technique was later used in ski orienteering in 1960s on roads and other firm surfaces finnish skier pauli developed a variant of style for marathon or other endurance events in 1970s by leaving one ski in track while skating outwards to side with other ski one sided skating this became known as marathon skate american skier bill koch further developed marathon skate technique in late 1970s skate skiing became widespread during 1980s after koch s success with it in 1982 cross country skiing championships drew more attention to technique norwegian skier ove started using technique in 1984 when he found it to be much faster than classic style skating is most effective on wide smooth groomed trails using fiberglass skis that glide well it also benefits a stronger athlete which according to olav bo are reasons that technique made a breakthrough in early 1980s athletes widely adopted skating to both sides by time of 1985 world championship and it was formally adopted by fis in 1986 despite initial opposition from norway soviet union and finland while preserving events

participants where mass starts often have a modified starting order by groupings of participants who have been judged to be of similar ability beginning with elite skiers group and ending with a group of least experienced skiers skiers can use either classic or skate skiing techniques depending on rules of race awards are usually based on overall placement placement by sex of athlete and by age category there are two major series in this category ski classics and worldloppet ski classics series ski classics is a commercially sponsored international long distance cross country skiing cup

orienteering championships are organized annually biathlon biathlon combines cross country skiing and rifle shooting depending on shooting performance extra distance or time is added to contestant s total running distance time for each shooting round must hit five targets skier receives a penalty for each missed target which varies according to competition rules in any given competition one of following penalties would apply skiing around a penalty loop which depending on conditions takes 20 30 seconds for elite athletes to complete adding one minute to skier s total time use of an extra cartridge placed at shooting range to hit target only three such extras are available for each round and a penalty loop must be made for each target left standing paralympic thumb olena iurkovska of ukraine competing on cross country sit skis at 2010 winter paralympics paralympic cross country skiing is an adaptation of cross country skiing for athletes with disabilities paralympic cross country skiing is one of two nordic skiing disciplines in winter paralympic games other is biathlon competition is governed by international paralympic committee ipc paralympic cross country skiing includes standing events sitting events for wheelchair users and events for visually impaired athletes under rules of international paralympic committee these are divided into several categories for people who are missing limbs have amputations are blind or have any other physical disability to continue their sport classifications are for standing skiers with arm impairments leg impairments or with both arm and leg impairments sit skiers all with leg impairments but with varying degrees of torso control skiers with visual impairment including blindness low visual acuity and limited field of vision technique and equipment jorgen brink skis with classic diagonal stride technique uphill in track at holmenkollen in 2007 thumb right cross country ski competitors employ one of two techniques according to event classic and skating in freestyle races where all techniques are allowed skiathlon combines two techniques in one race skis are lighter narrower and designed to be faster than those used in recreational cross country skiing and made of composite materials for classic events typical ski lengths are between 195 and 210 centimetres while ski lengths for skating are 170 to 200 cm skis for skating are also more rigid than skis for classical skis are waxed for speed and in case of classic skis traction when striding forward racing ski boots are also lighter than recreational ones and are attached at toe only to bindings that are specialized for classic or skate skiing racing ski poles are usually made from carbon fiber and feature smaller lighter baskets than recreational poles poles designed for skating are longer than those designed for classic skiing classic in classic cross country skiing skis remain parallel as skier strides straight ahead undersides of skis have a grip section in middle treated with a special ski wax that provides friction when foot is still yet glides when foot is in motion while rest of ski bottom has a glide wax classic events occur on courses with tracks set by a grooming machine at precise intervals and with carefully planned curvature both poles may be used simultaneously double poling or with alternating foot and arm extended as with running or walking with pole pushing on side opposite of extended sliding ski in classic skiing alternating technique is used for diagonal stride predominant classic sub technique in diagonal stride legs move like in ordinary walking but with longer and more powerful steps diagonal is useful on level ground and on gentle uphill slopes uphill steps are shorter and more frequent with double poling both poles are used simultaneously for thrust which may be augmented with striding double poling is useful on level ground and on gentle downhill slopes on steep uphills fishbone technique can be used skating michal malak skate skis at a qualifier for tour de ski 2007 thumb right while skate skiing skier provides propulsion on a firm snow surface by pushing alternating skis away from one another at an angle in a manner similar to ice skating skis are waxed with a glide wax over their entire length making them faster than classic skis freestyle events take place on smooth wide specially groomed courses with skating technique double poling is usually employed with alternating skating strides or with every skate stride following table puts these poling sequences into order according to speed achieved as a progression of gears in lowest gear rarely used in racing one is poling on side of sliding ski similar to diagonal stride in highest gear athlete skates without poles there are equivalent terms in other languages for example in norwegian skating is likened to paddling or dancing depending on tempo skate skiing terminology gear term used in us term used in canada 1st diagonal v single pole on stationary side diagonal skate 2nd v1 double pole on same side offset skate 3rd v2 double pole on alternate sides 1 skate 4th v2 alternate open field skate 2 skate 5th skate without poles free skate primary turns used for racing are parallel turn which is used while descending and can provide braking and step turn which is used for maintaining speed during descents or out of track on flats wedge turn or snowplow turn is sometimes used for braking and turning skier development and training thumb right dry land training and racing with roller skis countries with cross country ski teams usually have a strategy for developing promising athletes and programs to encourage participation in sport starting at a young age one example is cross country ski canada s long term athlete development program program encompasses youth development training introduction to competition and improvement of promising athletes with an emphasis on stamina endurance strength speed skill and suppleness flexibility it covers age groups from toddlers to mature adults who are able to enjoy and participate in sport similarly ussa has an outline of cross country athlete competencies that has four phases beginning at 12 years old and under and addressing 21 and older phase at top program encompasses six domains technical skills specific to cross country ski racing physiological and motor skills addressing physical fitness strength power and endurance psychological and sociological skills emphasizing sound relationships and mental skills required for competition training and competition performance addressing goal directed training to achieve favorable competition results equipment selection use and maintenance of athlete s skis boots bindings wax clothing and poles necessary to success education that eventually allows athlete to become his or her own coach ski training for athlete depends on whether desired specialty emphasizes endurance marathon or intensity mid distance events intensity theory of ski training uses stress to break down muscles and recovery to build them up stronger than before in this theory there are five levels of intensity for training aerobic low intensity aerobic training at 60 70 of an athlete s maximum intensity should consume most of training hours for endurance athletes strength strength training improves flexibility and joint motion to minimize injury and to improve overall strength not addressed by sport specific training lactate threshold this level builds an efficient base speed by training body to convert blood lactate into energy rather than creating a sensation of tired muscles vo2 max this level uses interval training to build athlete s vo2 max volume of oxygen that lungs pass into musculature via cardiovascular system speed this level of training addresses athlete s ability to sprint and is neuromuscular essentially training muscles to move quickly athletes train for each level on a seasonal schedule designed for targeted events marathon or mid distance additional aspects of training address aerobic low intensity exercise especially for endurance and strength to improve joint flexibility and to minimize risk of injury cross country ski training occurs throughout year including on dry land where athletes engage in roller skiing and ski striding to maintain ski specific muscle fitness race management event celebration with a podium ceremony is part of race management thumb right in its organizing committee handbook fis covers aspects of race management including layout of competition venue organization of events including scheduling officiating and awards and addressing ancillary factors such as role of media national handbooks such as ussa cross country technical handbook and cross country canada officials manual provide further guidance sometimes specific to their venues an important aspect of race preparation is grooming course to provide a surface for skate skiing and setting tracks for classic events this takes into account snow physics methods for packing snow and surface shaping and equipment used for these functions also key is layout of grooming and track setting in stadium with various formats for starts finishes and intermediate functions for relays and pursuits design of racing venues thumb right a cross country skiing stadium was part of racing venue at lahti ski games 2010 in its cross country homologation manual fis recognizes that fans of sport wish to follow it on television with this in mind manual addresses how to design race course and stadium in a manner that not only enhances experience of spectators but of viewers as well not just to show athletes in action but to show ways in which fans enjoy action manual includes considerations of course design criteria requirements for different race formats course layouts courses for skiers with disabilities stadium layout waxing rooms with ski test areas warm up course a course is expected to test skier s technical and physical abilities to be laid out in a manner that takes advantage of natural terrain and to provide smooth transitions among uphills and undulating terrain distributed approximately evenly among three manual advocates that courses present a variety of uphills varying in lengths and gradients between 6 and 12 which are arrayed efficiently within venue it cites two types of stadium horseshoe preferred for television and ski in ski out layout it emphasizes importance of accommodating television coverage at start finish and exchange zones for equipment or relays in addition television coverage requires a variety of facilities to support activities of press doping as with other sports some competitors in cross country skiing have chosen to enhance their performance through doping anti doping tests at 2001 world nordic skiing championships in lahti finland revealed that jari isometsa janne immonen and two other skiers from finland s gold medal relay team mika myllyla and harri kirvesniemi and two female skiers tested positive for starch hes a blood plasma expander usually used to cover up use of erythropoietin epo epo boosts oxygen carrying capability of hemoglobin in addition team head coach left needles and drip bags at a public location near helsinki airport at sochi winter olympic games austrian cross country skier johannes durr was ejected from competition after testing positive for blood booster epo in 2007 international olympic committee banned wolfgang and wolfgang rottmann and
