quagga catshark halaelurus quagga is a species of catshark belonging to family scyliorhinidae a small slim bodied shark reaching in length it has a distinctive color pattern of narrow dark brown vertical bars which resemble those of quagga its head is short and flattened with a pointed snout tip that is not upturned little is known of quagga catshark s natural history as it is known only from nine specimens caught off southwestern india and eastern somalia inhabiting offshore waters of continental shelf at depths of or more it is a bottom dwelling predator of shrimps it exhibits an oviparous mode of reproduction with a record of a female containing eight eggs that were enclosed in brown capsules bearing long tendrils at corners international union for conservation of nature iucn presently lacks sufficient data to assess conservation status of this species it is not economically valued but is taken as bycatch taxonomy thumb upright 1 2 left drawing of quagga catshark type specimen from illustrations of zoology of royal indian marine survey ship investigator 1900 which complemented alcock s description first specimen of quagga catshark was a long adult male collected by paddle steamer rims investigator from a depth of off malabar coast of india it was described by british naturalist alfred william alcock in a descriptive catalogue of indian deep sea fishes in indian museum published in 1899 he assigned new species to genus scyllium a synonym of and named it after quagga equus quagga quagga because of their similar color patterns later authors moved this species to genus halaelurus only nine quagga catshark specimens have been recorded in addition to alcock s type specimen four males were trawled from off eastern somali coast by research ship rv anton bruun in 1964 four more individuals two male and two female were found amongst contents of commercial fishing trawls conducted off quilon india in 2010 a male specimen reported from gulf of aden in 1939 was later re identified as a speckled catshark h description thumb 200px indian specimen of a quagga catshark showing dorsally positioned eyes and gill slits and non upturned snout tip slender and firm bodied quagga catshark has a short and flattened head with a pointed snout slightly protruding tip of snout is not upturned like in some other halaelurus species anterior rims of nostrils bear triangular flaps of skin small horizontally oval eyes are placed high on head and have rudimentary nictitating membranes below eyes are thick ridges and behind them are tiny spiracles rather large mouth is curved with upper teeth exposed when closed there are short furrows at corners of mouth jaws contain 26 28 upper and 27 lower tooth rows on each side in addition there are three tooth rows at upper symphysis jaw midpoint and one row at lower teeth have three cusps five pairs of gill slits are placed higher than level of mouth fifth pair are smaller than rest moderately large and rounded pectoral fins are positioned fairly close to pelvic fins adult males have thin tapering claspers with a denticle covered knob on outer side near tip first dorsal fin is placed just behind pelvic fin bases while larger second dorsal fin is placed just behind anal fin anal fin is larger than second dorsal fin and comparable in size to pelvic fins caudal fin has a small but discernible lower lobe and a large upper lobe with a notch in its trailing margin thick skin is covered by dermal denticles which have arrowhead shaped crowns with a central ridge and three posterior teeth this shark has a striking dorsal color pattern consisting of over 20 narrow dark brown vertical bars on a light brown background bars run from head to tail and extend onto dorsal fins underside is off white and pectoral pelvic and anal fins have pale trailing margins largest known specimen is long distribution and habitat known specimens of quagga catshark have been collected from laccadive sea off southwestern india and from indian ocean off somalia indian sharks were caught between depths of or possibly while somalian sharks were caught at depths of this is a bottom dwelling species found far from shore over continental shelf biology and ecology diet of quagga catshark consists of deep living shrimps its reproduction is oviparous like other members of its genus one of female indian specimens was gravid with eight eggs divided evenly between two oviducts eggs are enclosed in brown purse shaped capsules measuring in length with long coiled tendrils at their four corners smallest known specimen is long which is probably close to size at hatching males reach sexual maturity at between long female maturation size is unknown human interactions quagga catshark is harmless and is not utilized by humans it is caught incidentally by demersal fisheries in bottom trawls and potentially other gear such fishing activity is very intense in indian and somalian waters though specific data on this species is lacking therefore international union for conservation of nature iucn has listed it as data deficient references quagga catshark category fish of somalia category fish of
