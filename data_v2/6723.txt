family in rio de janeiro in 1808 changed lives of lima family king dom joao vi embarked upon a series of wars of conquest which resulted in expansion of brazil s territory with annexation of

barreto de souza explained that this did not mean that he began to serve as a child connection to regiment was simply honorific his as son of a military officer this infantry regiment was informally known as lima family regiment because so many members of family served in it including his father and grandfather in 1811 luis alves moved with his parents from his grandparents farm to rio de janeiro

brazil on 7 september 1822 prince was later acclaimed dom pedro i first brazilian emperor on 12 october those brazilian and portuguese forces who remained loyal to portugal refused to accept this outcome which led to a war fought on several fronts across brazil on 18 january 1823 pedro i created emperor s battalion a handpicked elite infantry unit that included luis alves who was named as adjutant to company s commander his uncle colonel jose joaquim de lima e silva emperor s battalion was sent to province of bahia in northeast on 28 january and placed along with other troops under

3 may and 3 june against portuguese positions around salvador all successful in engagement on 28 march he led a charge on an enemy bunker see during bahia campaign high ranking officers mutinied against labatut who was taken prisoner and sent back to rio de janeiro it is unlikely that luis alves was involved but his uncle joaquim de lima was almost certainly part of conspiracy and was chosen by officers to replace labatut campaign resumed and portuguese withdrew from salvador and set sail back to portugal on 2 july victorious brazilians entered city emperor s battalion returned to rio de

1828 and made second in command of emperor s battalion in early 1829 during his stay in montevideo he met maria angela furriol gonzalez luna how far their relationship progressed is unknown but there may have been a failed engagement he returned to rio de janeiro and witnessed increasing deterioration in emperor pedro i s political position a growing opposition to pedro i s policies eventually erupted into mass protests at field of santana in downtown rio de janeiro on 6 april 1831 situation became more ominous when several military units led by luis alves father and uncles joined protests emperor considered appointing luis alves to command emperor s battalion and asked him which side he would choose according to historian francisco doratioto luis alves answered that between love of his father and his duty to crown he would stay with latter pedro i expressed gratitude for his loyalty but instead ordered him to take emperor s battalion to field of santana and join rebels preferring abdication to decades later luis alves said in brazilian senate i marched along with emperor s battalion to field of santana out of devotion to competent orders from pedro i i was not a revolutionary

de lima s liberal party had pushed through premature declaration of emperor s majority on 23 july 1840 in may 1842 liberals rebelled in provinces of rio de janeiro sao paulo and minas gerais in retaliation for emperor s decision on advice of a council of state dominated by reactionaries to call for new elections annulling previous election tainted by widespread fraud by liberal party named

perceived as unruly liberals sometime around 1843 and certainly by 1844 reactionary party became known as partido da ordem party of order and its members as saquaremas caxias increasingly identified himself with saquarema ideology liberalism preservation of authority of state and support for representative parliamentary monarchy although his move toward saquarema camp was not clear at time he accepted appointment to put down rebellion in maranhao in 1839 his victory over liberal rebels in 1842 further solidified his allegiance to party of order ragamuffin war thumb 200px right alt

uncle minister of war at time also secretly supported rebellion on 28 september 1842 caxias was appointed president and military commander of province of rio grande do sul 16 year old pedro ii allowed caxias to prove once more that he was unlike his father and uncles and gave him a short and direct order end this revolution as you have ended others caxias brought with him a fellow saquarema and a famous poet domingos goncalves de magalhaes later viscount of araguaia to serve as his secretary as he had previously in maranhao caxias had made a short trip to rio grande do sul in 1839 to inspect troops fighting ragamuffins upon his return to province in november 1842 he found that rebels severely weakened after years of struggle had been forced to resort to guerrilla warfare when threatened rebels escaped to safety in nearby uruguay formerly cisplatina as in maranhao sao paulo and minas gerais caxias planted spies within enemy s ranks to gather information and to foment dissension historian roderick j barman said that he displayed military organizational and political talents essential to what is now termed counterinsurgency in early 1843 honorio hermeto became head of cabinet and so long as saquaremas remained in power caxias was secure in his position after honorio hermeto quarreled with pedro ii a year later he and saquaremas resigned see liberals replaced saquaremas in government but caxias was retained in his command war of ragamuffins took far longer to put down than had previous rebellions but through careful negotiation and military victories caxias finally managed to pacify province end of armed conflict was declared on 1 march 1845 he was made a permanent field marshal on 25 march and raised to rank of count on 2 april caxias ran for a senate seat and

men with whom caxias had close relationships among them eusebio de queiros who had helped him bring order to streets of rio de janeiro in late 1830s caxias was now a wealthy planter who owned slaves and was very much a part of landed aristocracy that formed backbone of party of order with help of his wealthy mother in law he purchased his first property a coffee farm in 1838 he acquired more lands in 1849 further expanding his plantation due to growing international demand coffee had become most valuable export commodity for brazil in 1851 juan manuel de rosas dictator of argentine confederation declared war on brazil caxias was appointed commander in chief of brazilian land forces minister of foreign affairs paulino soares de sousa later viscount of uruguai forged an anti rosas alliance between brazil uruguay and rebel argentine provinces when paulino soares asked who should be appointed as brazil s representative among allied forces caxias suggested honorio hermeto honorio hermeto who had been ostracized by his peers after his fall in 1844 was saquarema closest to caxias an army commanded by caxias crossed into uruguay in september 1851 allies decided to divide their forces into two armies a multinational force that included a single brazilian division and a second army composed entirely of brazilians under caxias against wishes of honorio hermeto caxias chose manuel marques de sousa later count of porto alegre to lead former force caxias met and befriended marques de sousa who had served under his command in war of ragamuffins during his trip to rio grande do sul in 1839 brazilian division led by marques de sousa along with uruguayan and argentine rebel troops invaded argentina on 3 february 1852 in battle of caseros allies defeated an army led by rosas

caxias s father died in december 1853 for years father and son had clashed taking opposite sides marquis ultimately prevailed adhering closely to his grandfather jose joaquim de lima s steadfast loyalty to crown and respect for law by time of his death francisco de lima a senator in his own right had long since lost his former influence and had not held any office of importance for years nevertheless caxias and francisco de lima maintained a loving and respectful relationship to very end as may be seen in few surviving letters between them his relationship with other family members however was marred by resentment as he told his wife years later we are placed in foreground of our society causing even envy to your relatives and to mine as well around 1853 and certainly by 1855 old party of order had become more widely known as conservative party on 14 june 1855 marquis accepted portfolio of minister of war and joined conciliation cabinet headed by honorio hermeto now marquis of parana caxias and parana had known each other since 1831 and had formed a deep friendship and strong bond based on trust and views in common parana had been facing overwhelming opposition in parliament from members of his and caxias s own party under guise of correcting flaws in elections so that all parties would have legitimate access to representation in parliament parana attempted to pass electoral reforms that would in practice allot cabinets even more influence to meddle in elections through coercion and patronage saquaremas understood threat it would undermine their own party or in fact any party by strengthening executive branch to detriment of legislative in search of broader support parana appointed as ministers politicians who had few or no links to saquaremas caxias himself was a saquarema but according to needell he was first and foremost a military man personal fealty to empire came before any other as so many did he identified this loyalty with fealty to crown in abstraction and to dom pedro personally he was a choice that could please all sides caxias said needell was not so much a political man as a man profoundly loyal to monarchy with which he had come to identify with conservative party thus parana may have appointed caxias to reassure traditional conservatives without endangering more independent political position parana was taking presidencies of council of ministers thumb 200px left alt painted three quarters length portrait of a seated man with gray mustache who is wearing a black frock coat white shirt with wingtip collar and black cravat and black gloves caxias around age 58 c 1861 parana succeeded in passing electoral reform which was called lei dos law of circles as predicted and feared it gave greater powers to president prime minister of council of ministers to meddle in elections unexpectedly parana fell ill and died on 3 september 1856 caxias replaced him but was reluctant to face legislature elected under electoral reform that was slated to convene next year he resigned along with other cabinet ministers on 4 may 1857 law of circles and controversy surrounding it split conservative party one faction was saquarema ultraconservative or wing then called reds or puritans led by eusebio de queiros uruguai and joaquim rodrigues torres viscount of itaborai second bloc comprised moderate conservative wing composed mostly of younger politicians who owed their positions to electoral reform moderate conservatives were conservatives in name only and did not support saquarema ideology and leadership during years following 1857 successive cabinets quickly collapsed unable to muster a majority in chamber of deputies as two conservative wings undercut each other in a fight for dominance emperor asked caxias to head a new cabinet on 2 march 1861 among his ministers were jose maria da silva paranhos later viscount of rio branco whom caxias had met and befriended during platine war while serving as secretary to parana caxias tried to secure support from traditional saquarema leadership they attempted however to use him as a figurehead and to further their own agendas he commented to paranhos i see what you meant with respect to bizarre behavior of these gentlemen who do not wish to govern country when they are invited to do so because they prefer to govern government they are completely mistaken about me since i am not disposed to serve them as a lacking support in parliament caxias cabinet resigned on 24 may 1862 after losing its majority in chamber of deputies national legislature s lower house pedro ii asked members of liga progressive league a new party consisting of moderate conservatives and liberals to form a new cabinet barely a month later caxias

paraguayan war four months later paraguayan troops invaded argentine territory in preparation for an attack on rio grande do sul situation in rio grande do sul was chaotic and local military commanders were incapable of mounting an effective resistance to paraguayan army pedro ii aware of danger decided to go to front to shore up operations as emperor s military aide de camp caxias followed him into combat zone marquis had warned progressive cabinet that brazil was unprepared to intervene in uruguay and even less prepared to resist a foreign invasion his warnings were ignored and he complained with a bit of irony to his friend joao mauricio baron of cotejipe a former colleague in conciliation cabinet i am almost mad with mistakes that i am seeing being made but since i am a red ultraconservative or traditional saquarema i am not listened to since everything is progress in our country imperial party arrived in rio grande do sul s capital porto alegre in july 1865 from there they traveled inland until they reached uruguaiana in september this brazilian town was occupied by a paraguayan army by time caxias and his party arrived town was under siege by a combined

progressive cabinet decided to create a unified command over brazilian forces operating in paraguay and it turned to 63 year old caxias made permanent army marshal on 13 january as new leader on 10 october 1866 see he told his wife that reason he had accepted post was because war was an evil that has reached more or less all from emperor to most unfortunate slave caxias arrived in paraguay on 18 november and assumed supreme command of land and naval forces in war his first measure was to arrange dismissal of vice admiral joaquim marques lisboa later marquis of tamandare and also a member of progressive league by government and appoint fellow conservative vice admiral joaquim jose inacio later viscount of inhauma to lead navy from october 1866 until july 1867 all offensive operations were suspended during this period caxias trained his soldiers re equipped army with newer guns improved quality of officer corps and upgraded health corps and overall hygiene of troops putting an end to epidemics alfredo d escragnolle taunay later viscount of taunay who fought in war remembered that caxias was a generous military chief who forgave small errors but was implacable with those who committed grave misdeeds or then who betrayed his confidence as brazilian army was ready for combat caxias sought to encircle humaita and force its capitulation by siege to aid operation he used observation balloons to gather information of enemy lines combined brazilian argentine uruguayan army advanced through hostile territory to surround humaita by 2 november humaita was completely cut

emperor called conservatives under itaborai s leadership back into power on 16 july 1868 while progressive league was rechristened as liberal party meanwhile allies occupied humaita on 25 july after lopez managed to engineer a successful withdrawal of all paraguayan troops from its fortress pressing his advantage marquis began organizing an assault on new paraguayan defenses which lopez had thrown up along pikysyry south of asuncion paraguay s capital this stream afforded a strong defensive position which was anchored by paraguay river and by swampy jungle of chaco region both considered to be nearly impassable by a large force rather than making a frontal attack on lopez s line caxias had a road cut through chaco road was finished by early december allowing allied forces to outflank paraguayan lines and attack from rear in three successive battles ytororo and lomas which became known as dezembrada deed of december combined allied forces annihilated paraguayan army lopez barely managed to escape with a few followers see and on 1 january 1869 brazilians occupied asuncion according to historian ronaldo vainfas caxias performance ahead of allied forces contributed in an unquestionable way to final triumph over enemy marquis had to take great risks to win these victories in ytororo engagement which occurred on 5 december allied objective was to take a bridge over ytororo river several attempts were made to cross bridge but each was repelled by intense fire from paraguayan positions in final attempt brazilian soldiers panicked and began to flee in disorder caxias witnessing unfolding disaster unsheathed his sword and charged on horseback toward bridge followed by his staff he passed through fleeing troops shouting hail to his majesty hail to brazil and finally me os que brasileiros those who are true brazilians follow me see his display of courage stopped retreat immediately units regrouped and a vigorous attack led personally by caxias overwhelmed

hinterland he asked to be either relieved of his post or given a short leave although his request was denied he appointed a senior member of his staff as acting commander and left for brazil on 19 january 1869 emperor was angered that marquis had left his post without permission and especially that caxias had declared war to have been already won even though lopez was still at large and regrouping his few remaining military assets caxias ill conceived decision seriously endangered hard won achievements of past months even as objective of eliminating lopez as a threat remained within reach in early february marquis arrived back unannounced at his house in rio de janeiro much to surprise of his wife viscount of inhauma also returned home shortly afterwards but with his health so compromised that he died a few weeks later upon learning of inhauma s death caxias said and same would have had happened to me had i not resolved to get out of that hell pedro ii was greatly disappointed in caxias but he was also very aware that marquis was person most responsible for great successes during war accomplishments that had come at cost of years of sacrifice and personal bravery emperor called marquis to imperial palace paco de sao cristovao on 21 february 1869 for a reconciliation a few days later emperor awarded caxias order of pedro i and raised him from marquis to duke highest rank of brazilian nobility and a unique distinction during pedro ii s 58 year reign emperor also appointed him to council of state on october 1870 but none of this prevented caxias from attacks and accusations some petty in parliament including having left his post without permission embittered duke wrote to his friend manuel luis osorio marquis of erval when i was young my friend i

viability and undermined foundations of monarchy first resulted from controversy over law of free birth which caxias voted for law was to emancipate children born to slave women after its enactment with half of conservative party members supporting bill and other half staunchly opposed a serious rift opened in ranks opponents represented interests of powerful coffee farmers such as caxias planters who had long been main political social and economic supporters of conservative party second crisis was religious question which developed after government came into conflict with two bishops who had ordered that freemasons be expelled from lay brotherhoods dispute grew out of proportion when both bishops were convicted and given prison sentences for disobeying government s order to rescind their expulsions as catholicism was state religion emperor exercised with papacy s acquiescence a great deal of control over church affairs paying clerical salaries appointing parish priests nominating bishops ratifying papal bulls and overseeing seminaries as a result of furor over handling of affair rio branco and his cabinet resigned disunited and weary after four years in office according to historian roderick j barman pedro ii asked caxias to form a new cabinet duke later gave a remarkable account of their meeting elderly caxias almost 72 and widowed since 1874 was in poor health and could serve only as a figurehead president of government formed on 25 june 1875 cotejipe was de facto president caxias cotejipe cabinet attempted to dissipate discord created by previous cabinet their measures included financial aid to coffee farmers an amnesty for convicted bishops and to please pro slavery conservatives selection of new ministers and a call for elections caxias who was a freemason but also a staunch catholic threatened to resign if emperor did not grant amnesty which pedro ii grudgingly issued in september 1875 death thumb 200px left alt full length photographic

on sword at his side caxias around age 74 c 1877 at end of 1877 pedro ii paid a visit to caxias and ascertained that he could no longer remain in office entire cabinet resigned on 1 january 1878 his health problems had become so troubling that he had been asking repeatedly to resign since early 1876 caxias was not only afflicted by concerns over his declining health but increasingly felt a sense of alienation he did not feel he could play a relevant role in politics he belonged to an older generation who perceived emperor and consequently monarchy as essential for holding nation together new politicians who had begun to dominate government had little memory of times before pedro ii assumed control in 1840 unlike their predecessors they had no experience of regency and early years of pedro ii s reign when external and internal dangers threatened nation s existence they had only known a stable administration and prosperity young politicians saw no reason to uphold and defend imperial office as a unifying force beneficial to nation times were changing fast and caxias was aware of situation he became increasingly nostalgic for former times he had spent with his now dead conservative party colleagues and held a pessimistic view of future political prospects when itaborai one of last survivors of those conservative leaders who had begun their careers during 1830s died in 1872 duke wrote to a friend who will replace him i don t know i cannot see vacuum he left will not be filled as it was not with eusebio parana uruguai manuel and many others who helped us sustain this little church i e monarchy his second faith which collapsed or almost collapsed on 7 april 1831 confined to a wheelchair as his health slowly declined duke of caxias lived his remaining days at santa monica farm located near town of in countryside of rio de janeiro province on 7 may 1880 at 11 pm he quietly died attended by members of his family a saddened pedro ii who visited caxias several times during his long illness remarked about his friend of almost a half century that he had known him and esteemed him since 1832 he was 76 almost 77 years old and so we remain in this world caxias asked for a simple funeral with no pomp no honors no invitations and only six soldiers of good conduct to carry his coffin his last wish was not entirely respected pedro ii sent a carriage used for funerals of members of imperial family only to be followed by sixteen servants of imperial household and one corporal and thirteen not six soldiers of good conduct to carry his remains a huge procession was followed by a funeral attended by pedro ii and his body was laid to rest in sao francisco de paula cemetery in city of rio de janeiro legacy thumb 200px right alt photograph of a huge bronze statue atop a multi story stone plinth depicting a mounted rider with upraised sword monument in honor of duke of caxias in city of sao paulo from his death in 1880 until 1920s duke of caxias was not regarded as most important military figure in brazilian history this honor belonged to manuel luis osorio marquis of erval caxias was held to be a minor figure in comparison to erval his reputation slowly grew and in 1923 ministry of army created an annual celebration in his honor in 1925 his birthday officially became day of soldier which commemorates brazilian army on 25 august 1949 his remains along with those of his wife were exhumed and reinterred in rio de janeiro s duke of caxias pantheon on 13 march 1962 caxias became patrono protector of army making him most important figure in its tradition according to adriana barreto de souza francisco doratioto and celso castro caxias supplanted osorio because he was seen as a loyal and dutiful officer who could serve as a role model in a brazilian republic plagued since its birth in 1889 by military insubordination rebellions and coups his name said historian thomas whigham has become synonymous with upright officer and citizen who never breaks law hence popular term caxias which refers to individuals who follow regulations without mistrust doubt and evasion historiography is often positive toward caxias and several historians have ranked him as greatest brazilian military officer to historian nelson werneck sodre he was not only greatest military commander of his continent south america in his time but also a great politician moreover caxias was more than d pedro ii empire francisco doratioto said that duke in paraguay had doubts pride resentment and made mistakes in short he was a real character caxias however was able to rise above his limitations imposed on himself great personal sacrifices and incorporated responsibility of accomplishing objective in this context caxias was indeed a hero he carried with him it is true social and political prejudices of his time but one can not demand from past observance of present day values roderick j barman affirmed that caxias was not only extremely powerful in conservative party but also country s most distinguished and most successful soldier who had proved his capacity and his loyalty by defeating revolts against regime c h haring said that he was a brilliant army officer also brazil s most famous military figure and a man who was genuinely loyal to throne to whigham duke was destined to occupy a lofty spot in brazil s national mythology he often had to act as a statesman as much as military man and was s competent in both roles helio viana regarded caxias as greatest soldier of brazil a view shared by eugenio vilhena de morais pedro
