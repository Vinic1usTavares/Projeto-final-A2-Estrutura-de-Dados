three of country s major privately owned commercial banks in late 2008 following their difficulties in refinancing their short term debt and a run on deposits in netherlands and united kingdom relative to size of its economy iceland s systemic banking collapse was largest experienced by any country in economic history crisis led to a severe economic depression in 2008 2010 and significant political unrest in years preceding crisis three icelandic banks kaupthing landsbanki and glitnir multiplied in size this expansion was driven by ready access to credit in international financial markets in particular money markets as financial crisis of 2007 2008 unfolded investors perceived icelandic banks to be increasingly risky trust in banks gradually faded leading to a sharp depreciation of icelandic krona in 2008 and increased difficulties for banks in rolling over their short term debt at end of second quarter of 2008 iceland s external debt was 9 553 trillion icelandic kronur eur50 billion more than 7 times gdp of iceland in 2007 assets of three banks totaled 14 437 trillion kronur at end of second quarter 2008 glitnir isk 3 863 bn landsbanki isk 3 970 bn kaupthing isk 6 604 bn borrowings of three banks at same date were glitnir isk 2 242 bn landsbanki isk 1 220 bn kaupthing isk 2 883 bn equal to more than 11 times national gdp due to huge size of icelandic financial system in comparison with icelandic economy central bank of iceland found itself unable to act as a lender of last resort during crisis further aggravating mistrust in banking system on 29 september 2008 it was announced that glitnir would be nationalised however subsequent efforts to restore faith in banking system failed on 6 october icelandic legislature instituted an emergency law which enabled financial supervisory authority fme to take control over financial institutions and made domestic deposits in banks priority claims in following days new banks were founded to take over domestic operations of kaupthing landsbanki and glitnir old banks were put into receivership and liquidation resulting in losses for their shareholders and foreign creditors outside iceland more than half a million depositors lost access to their accounts in foreign branches of icelandic banks this led to 2008 2013 icesave dispute that ended with an efta court ruling that iceland was not obliged to repay dutch and british depositors minimum deposit guarantees in an effort to stabilize situation icelandic government stated that all domestic deposits in icelandic banks would be guaranteed

oblige icelandic residents to deposit any new foreign currency they receive with an icelandic bank there is anecdotal evidence that some icelandic exporters had been operating an informal offshore

small domestic market iceland s banks have financed their expansion with loans on interbank lending market and more recently by deposits from outside iceland which are also a form of external debt households also took on a large amount of debt equivalent to 213 of disposable income which led to inflation this inflation was exacerbated by practice of central bank of iceland issuing liquidity

situation a bank would normally have to ask for a loan from central bank as lender of last resort however in iceland banks were so much larger than national economy that central bank of iceland and icelandic government could not guarantee payment of banks debts leading to collapse of banks official reserves of central bank of iceland stood at 374 8 billion kronur at end of september 2008

iceland situation was made worse by fact that icesave was operating as a branch of landsbanki rather than as a legally independent subsidiary as such it was completely dependent on central bank of iceland for emergency loans of liquidity and could not turn to bank of england for help uk financial services authority fsa was aware of risk and was considering imposing special liquidity requirements on icelandic deposit taking banks in weeks before crisis however plan which was never implemented would have forced icelandic banks to cut interest rates or stop taking new deposits and might even have sparked sort of bank run it was designed to prevent guernsey authorities were also planning on bringing in restrictions on foreign banks operating as branches and on transfers of funds between guernsey subsidiaries and parent banks parental landsbanki operated in guernsey through a legally independent subsidiary existence of a bank run on landsbanki accounts in uk in period up to 7 october seems confirmed by a statement from bank on 10 october which said landsbanki islands hf transferred substantial funds to its uk branch during this time to fulfil its icesave commitments transfer of funds from landsbanki guernsey to heritable bank a landsbanki subsidiary in uk also suggests a bank run in uk a transfer of substantial funds from iceland to uk would have been a significant downward push on value of krona even before effects of any speculation bank restructuring wholesale funding disappeared in september 2008 leading to collapse of glitnir kaupthing and

loans given by banks to senior politicians during years before crisis bjorn former minister for justice and ecclesiastical affairs has started a blog detailing problems with business sector and efforts to cover them up this was cited as an example of how politicians and businessmen who traditionally held a tight grip over icelandic media have lost this control and that dozens of similar blogs have been created bjorn stated that i have written a lot about problems in business sector over last 14 years and i can only compare some parts of it to enron here companies have been playing a game using media and publishing to make themselves look good we only hope that foreign media will soon begin to understand what has been going on political aftermath thumb right some of 6000

russians might want to use keflavik air base russian ambassador replied that they had no need for it president is quoted to have said that iceland would soon recover even if they had to fight alone

online petition set up under heading icelanders are not terrorists relationship got even tenser when uk replied a month later by cancelling its scheduled patrol of icelandic airspace in december 2008 iceland has no standing army of its own and relies on a long term standing agreement with nato where a group of member states have committed in turns to defend icelandic airspace and uk royal air force had now cancelled this after mutual agreement with nato presumably with another member state having accepted responsibility according to a poll from late november 2008 64 were in favour of early

iceland ex pm haarde partly guilty over 2008 crisis bbc news 23 april 2012 crisis resolution recovery starting in 2011 iceland s financial position has steadily improved since crash economic contraction and rise in unemployment appear to have been arrested by late 2010 and with growth under way in mid 2011 oecd economic surveys iceland june 2011 oecd org three main factors have been important in this regard first is emergency legislation passed by icelandic parliament in october 2008 it served to minimise impact of financial crisis on country financial supervisory authority of iceland used permission granted by emergency legislation to take over domestic operations of three largest banks much larger foreign operations of banks however went into receivership a second important factor is success of imf stand by arrangement in country since november 2008 sba includes three pillars first pillar is a program of medium term fiscal consolidation involving painful austerity measures and significant tax hikes result has been that central government debts have been stabilised at around 80 90 percent of gdp a second pillar is resurrection of a viable but sharply downsized domestic banking system on ruins of its gargantuan international banking system which government was unable to bail out a third pillar is enactment of capital controls and work to gradually lift these to restore normal financial linkages with outside world an important result of emergency legislation and sba is that country has not been seriously affected by european sovereign debt crisis from 2010 despite a contentious debate with britain and netherlands over question of a state guarantee on icesave deposits of landsbanki in these countries credit default swaps on icelandic sovereign debt have steadily declined from over 1000 points prior to crash in 2008 to around 200 points in june 2011 fact that assets of failed landsbanki branches were estimated to cover most of depositor claims had an influence to ease concerns over situation finally third major factor behind resolution of financial crisis was decision by government of iceland to apply for membership in eu in july 2009 while views on feasibility of eu membership are quite mixed in iceland this action has served to enhance credibility of country on international financial markets one sign of success of above efforts is fact that icelandic government was successfully able to raise 1 billion with a bond issue on 9 june 2011 this development indicates that international investors have given government and new banking system with two of three biggest banks now in foreign hands a clean bill of health first two major measures were implemented by government of geir h haarde but also carried out by government of johanna sigurdardottir which then took step to apply for eu membership iceland has undertaken recapitalization of lenders such as injection of isk 33 billion 2 1 of 2010 gdp into housing financing fund at end of 2010 under a plan approved by oecd economic surveys iceland 2011 oecd 2011 page 50 housing finance fund cont increasing difficulties that many households have had in paying their mortgages since financial crisis struck have necessitated substantial debt restructuring eroding hff s capital including debt write downs associated with december 2010 agreement between government and main mortgage loan providers to reduce value of certain mortgages to 110 of value of underlying property impaired loans soared from isk 3 4 billion 0 4 of hff s loan portfolio in 2009 to isk 38 8 billion 5 2 of loan portfolio in 2010 to ensure that hff remained solvent government made a capital injection of isk 33 billion 2 1 of 2010 gdp at end of 2010 european surveillance authority recently approved this state aftermath 2012 2013 by mid 2012 iceland was regarded as one of europe s recovery success stories it has had two years of economic growth unemployment was down to 6 3 and iceland was attracting immigrants to fill jobs currency devaluation effectively reduced wages by 50 making exports more competitive and imports more expensive ten year government bonds were issued below 6 lower than some of nations in eu portugal italy ireland greece and spain tryggvi thor a member of parliament noted that adjustments via currency devaluations are less painful than government labor policies and negotiations nevertheless while eu fervor has cooled government continued to pursue membership iceland elected a new government in april 2013 which as one of their top priorities wanted to negotiate a debt haircut towards foreign creditors of three failed icelandic banks now in receivership as part of a deal to lift long enforced since november 2008 capital controls current capital controls ban a swap exchange of isk denominated assets to foreign currency and so by effect has trapped repayment of isk denominated assets to creditors which in theory mean they should be interested to accept a haircut in return for getting capital controls lifted icelandic government intent somehow to route saved money from negotiated debt haircut for creditors into a national household debt relief fund enabling a 20 debt relief for all household mortgages in july 2013 standard recommended iceland to drop debt relief initiative as it would only result in increased debt for government making it even more difficult to lend at credit markets and it was forecasted also to ignite high inflation along with an economic recession equal to a gdp detraction of 10 government has nevertheless appointed a taskforce to present proposals on how best to achieve government s goal about implementing a combined capital control abolition and debt relief for households with a reporting deadline in october 2013 capital controls were eventually ended in march 2017 bbc news iceland to end capital controls from 2008 financial crisis 12 march 2017 a significant amount of
