disqualification from race depending on severity of bump robin pemberton vice president of competition for nascar stated bump drafting in turns would no longer be tolerated he commented it crosses over line when drivers are in corner that is not a good place to bump draft a straight line it s not best either but a straight line is far safer than in corners there s guys that haven t totally

would win without knaus and dedicated it to his detractors i just have so much pride in my team with circumstances that we ve faced this week chad made a mistake and we re dealing with consequences that come with that but i think this shows how hard we work to be successful and nobody can deny fact that we worked out butts off and won sport s biggest race mears said he was happy to take second fifth top five finish of his career these races are so hard to get good finishes in because so many people can affect outcome obviously we would have liked to have won because it would have forced chip and felix team co owner to put me in indy 500 which would have been a lot of fun at end of day it was a good finish for us we had an excellent day and i couldn t be happier unless we won third placed newman told mears after race you cost me a million dollars he said he was proud to attempt a pass for win i told guys over radio afterward if i had that run and didn t take it i would have had a hard time sleeping tonight probably for next 10 or 15 years maybe you never know with regards to uncertainty over whether johnson would be allowed to retain victory johnson was confirmed as winner several hours later since his car passed post race inspection newman noted three of johnson s previous wins came under scrutiny from nascar this could still be first opportunity for nascar to pull away a victory if thing is illegal i think a lot of jimmie johnson and his talent but i m pretty sure that three of his past four wins have had conflict with cars being illegal it s not necessarily good for sport johnson responded by targeting newman s crew chief matt borland and said that he would defend against personal criticism and that to hendrick motorsports mears spoke his belief johnson earned victory in my mind fact that they got caught earlier in week took away every doubt in my mind that they d actually do anything to cheat in this race hendrick motorsports founder and owner rick hendrick declared knaus ejection from race as not important and said of issue we ve been through inspection i don t know how many times nascar did what they did and we came back and ran two races that was history two days after race nascar announced penalties for hendrick motorsports and hall of fame racing hendrick motorsport s penalties for actions detrimental to stock car racing and for making an unapproved template modification to johnson s rear window included a 25 000 fine for knaus who was suspended from nascar until march 22 2006 knaus was also placed on probation until december 31 2006 hendrick motorsports did not incur any points penalties team did not appeal penalties and grubb continued in knaus role until golden corral 500 hall of fame racing s penalties were for actions detrimental to stock car racing and for having a non compliant carburetor in accordance to 2006 nascar rule book crew chief philippe lopez was fined 25 000 and terry labonte and team owner bill saunders were penalized 25 points in drivers and owners championships hall of fame racing and its partner joe gibbs racing announced they would appeal their penalties appeal was heard before a three member national stock car racing commission on march 7 at nascar s research development center in concord north carolina all three upheld penalties hall of fame racing decided not to appeal further to nascar national commissioner charles d strang kenseth said stewart purposefully eliminated him from contention on lap 107 he was disenchanted with him as he urged nascar to address bump drafting there s no two ways about it he was mad because earlier in race when i passed him he got loose which i didn t think i did anything wrong stewart argued kenseth caused crash i guess matt didn t think anything when he got me sideways over in turn 2 either he should have thought about that first he got back what he started in first place i got penalized for that mcmurray commented on his accident with kurt busch on lap 187 i need to apologize to kurt i got into him that was 100 percent my fault and i feel really bad because he had a car capable of winning and i kind of screwed that up for him earnhardt who led most laps of any driver with 32 said he was pleased after finishing ninth we had a great race car built by all technology and resources at dei we came down here and ran great that s what we wanted to do i m real proud of everybody back at shop and all my guys down here that have been working on this car all week it s been a long week as this was first race of season johnson led
