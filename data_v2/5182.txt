emblem awakening was planned to be last in series due to decreasing sales game was a worldwide commercial success prompting nintendo to greenlight a new entry fates was co developed by regular fire emblem developer intelligent systems and nintendo spd with main staff of awakening returning to their respective roles for fates they were intelligent systems s kouhei maeda as director nintendo spd director genki yokota nintendo producer hitoshi yamagami art director toshiyuki kusakihara and character designer yusuke kozaki yokota s work on game ran parallel with his work on xenoblade chronicles x masahiro higuchi awakenings project manager came on board as a producer according to original staff request for a sequel was a shock as they had all developed awakening assuming it would be last in series during its early design stages fates was given working title fire emblem 3ds ii game s cutscenes were animated by studio anima while storyboarding was handled by spooky graphic to develop multiple versions one core team worked on game s shared assets while additional teams handled individual level design gameplay was refined and expanded from version they used in awakening my castle feature was suggested by maeda as an alternative activity for players and to provide a means for getting to know main characters outside battle amount of content included in feature made some staff comment that it could be its own game social elements of my castle were originally going to be exclusive to streetpass but it was suggested that players in areas with low streetpass activity should be able to access functions through a normal internet connection some ideas thought up by maeda for earlier titles such as dragon vein ability and way skills were inherited by second generation characters were also implemented due to necessity for multiple versions map designing became a larger task than anticipated with very few maps being shared between versions phoenix mode was included to bring new fans into series a philosophy that they had neglected up until awakening and improved for fates for first time in fire emblem series option for main character to marry a character of same sex was included potential male and female partners respectively appear in conquest and birthright and both appear in revelation according to nintendo this move was done to reflect diversity of their player base two kingdoms were based upon different cultures hoshido was themed after japan while nohr used a medieval european setting similar to earlier fire emblem games kingdoms of hoshido and nohr were designed to contrast each other in a variety of ways with most obvious being its architecture hoshido was themed around light and air while nohr was themed around darkness and stone when development first started team unanimously decided to ask kozaki to return as character designer as he had been for awakening sheer number of characters this approach entailed made staff worry about whether kozaki would be willing to return hoshido characters clothing were influenced by japanese culture and character designs drew inspiration from well known people in japan a main instance was ryoma whose clothing was based on samurai including historical figures such as takeda along with incorporating animal motifs such as lions colors used in their clothing were varied and mainly bright to emphasize country s focus on light for nohr a vampire like taste equivalent to dark fantasy was used to highlight it as a kingdom where sun did not shine kozaki used black and purple as key colors in character designs to create a cold and unified image nobility of nohr were given similar design elements to represent their familial connections first character kozaki designed was avatar kozaki did not put much thought into their general appearance but took care about their clothing so that it was not overtly styled after either hoshido or nohr keeping neutrality of player up to main story decision point they were given bare feet due to animalistic impression kozaki had after hearing of their strong ties to dragons along with creating a hook for players equivalent to other characters in game main key artwork showing two families together was described by kozaki as a pain to draw due to their clashing designs and was point of much discussion by staff before it was finalized azura was not included in artwork for two physical editions but she was more prominently presented in artwork surrounding revelation as she played a much larger role in story scenario during initial planning stage team reviewed how fans and critics had responded to awakening while gameplay and graphics were positively received story had been criticized for being too simple by some long time fans even though new players approved of it to that end they decided to write a story that would appeal to series veterans as well as newcomers concept of story changing depending on which protagonists main character sided with originated from yamagami s memories of first fire emblem which allowed for choosing different protagonists but did not change story wanting to play from both sides of a conflict and show both sides as neither good nor evil team decided to create multiple versions of game initially plan was just for a choice between one kingdom or other but yamagami wanted a neutral path where neither side was chosen so a third version of game was planned game s japanese title if came from sheer number of choices featured for players in game english title fates referred to concept of main character shaping and changing their fate by choosing a side after creation of three storylines team needed to make decision to divide birthright and conquest into separate physical releases this was because packaging them as a single release would have necessitated raising game s price to equivalent of a two game bundle which would not benefit people who wanted to play one single version another reason for this decision was how easy it had become to add other versions on as cheaper downloadable content dlc this opened up option for players to run through game until crucial decision point in chapter 6 then buy alternate routes as downloadable content so they had different choices each route was estimated to have same amount of gameplay and story content as awakening as plans for three different versions of game appeared staff realized that it was impossible to write three storylines in house after searching through known video game writers they decided to consider writers in other fields writer suggested by maeda was shin kibayashi who was famous in japan for his work on multiple manga and television series kibayashi was initially approached by kozaki through their shared editor and was pitched project by staff in december 2012 kibayashi was going to refuse project as he had a tight work schedule but after both he and his daughter played through a copy of awakening provided by staff kibayashi decided to accept and wrote an initial draft story despite his initial minimal commitment of a ten page summary for each storyline he became fond of characters and felt that 10 pages were not enough and thus full summary for birthright extended to about 500 pages after delivering his work he then wrote summaries of equal length for conquest and revelation driven by need to create a high quality story partially to surpass his daughter s pressuring expectations and ended up writing enough script to fill two books while japanese titles for birthright and conquest were written in kanji third storyline s title was written in katakana to distinguish it from other two a great deal of character traits for royals of hoshido and nohr were contributed by kibayashi after he had done his work on storylines other writers took over much of rest of work main scenario writer for revelation storyline was kitajima a writer associated with senran kagura series he and other staff from his company synthese also wrote support conversations for birthright and conquest one of principal writers for all three story routes was nami komuro who had previously worked on awakening music game s soundtrack was created by multiple composers intelligent system s hiroki morishita and t s music s rei kondoh previously worked on awakening while warioware composers takeru kanazaki and yasuhisa baba of intelligent systems and monster hunter composer masato kouda of design wave joined team as newcomers longtime series composer yuka tsujiyoko acted as a supervisor morishita and kanazaki wrote majority of game s tracks arrangements were handled by morishita kanazaki kondoh and kouda many of tsujiyoko s tracks for earlier fire emblem titles were remixed for use in fates game s theme song lost in thoughts all alone was written by morishita with lyrics by maeda and sung by japanese pop singer renka who also provided azura s in game singing voice developers were looking for a singer who could do justice to their vision for character and when they heard renka s audition they instantly decided that she was right for role according to music personnel several among them cried when they first heard her performance multiple versions were used throughout soundtrack azura s normal voice work is performed by japanese voice actress lynn in english version azura s speaking and singing voice were provided by rena strober lyrics were adapted into english by audrey drake an official soundtrack album fire emblem if official soundtrack released on

petting a chosen character s face on lower touch screen to build up affection was also removed from western versions while 2d interactions and support increases were present stylus based touch screen element was removed option for japanese voiceovers present in awakening was also removed from fates according to an official statement by nintendo other unspecified changes were also made where it was deemed necessary these changes among others pointed out through comparisons by fans between english and japanese versions generated controversy over internet in wake of game s release culminating in complaints being sent directly to nintendo it also prompted a group dubbed team if to start work on a more faithful fan translation though it was ultimately cancelled shortly after game s official release reception different versions of fates received high scores on aggregate site metacritic birthright scored 86 100 based on thirty five critic reviews conquest received a slightly higher score of 87 100 based on forty reviews revelation scored 88 100 based on twenty five reviews reviews for all versions of fates generated a score of 88 100 based on thirty six reviews famitsu which reviewed both physical versions in tandem praised them for their drama and characters despite noting that inter character relations of two versions were complicated and only playing one side of story might leave players unsatisfied they praised various battle functions relationship mechanics and easy to use interface my castle feature while starting out as feeling incomplete was a satisfying experience martin robinson of eurogamer praised game as a sound continuation of mechanical improvements of awakening he positively noted grey morality of characters and story and singled out conquest as cooler of two physical versions due to its challenge and cast his main criticism was its multi part release which he called needlessly convoluted and stated might alienate fans attracted to series by awakening he also faulted nintendo s translation work as less characterful than localization of awakening by 8 4 along with clumsy removal of japanese original s petting mechanic chris carter of destructoid called story relatively open and shut despite keeping complex character relationships intact while generally citing it as best starting place for series newcomers gwaltney of game informer called story of birthright a surprisingly dark tale praised improvements made to gameplay over awakening and was overall positive despite some criticism of its poor tutorial systems he also liked game s music and graphics although he critiqued latter a little due to low res battle models meghan sullivan of ign called story music and visuals great and greatly enjoyed gameplay systems despite mission repetition and a slow online interface alexa ray corriea of gamespot greatly enjoyed changes to gameplay and its strategy despite little variation in playable maps and enjoyed character interactions while noting that dialogue became overly melodramatic in places kimberley keller of nintendo world report reviewing all versions of game generally praised game as a whole while calling birthright perfect way to start fates due to its traditional fire emblem elements griffin mcelroy and allegra frank of polygon reviewing all versions of game were generally positive about gameplay and interplay between versions while criticizing overly complicated character class system they referred to birthright as a straightforward march for vengeance where victory almost always entails defeating an entire platoon or its leader both connor sheridan of gamesradar and ray carsillo of electronic gaming monthly shared many points of praise with other reviewers about general gameplay called birthright a familiar experience when compared to other titles while carsillo recommended it as a good starting point carter found conquest a much tougher experience from a gameplay perspective being geared towards dedicated tactical battles within pre set limits while finding its story more intriguing than that of birthright gwaltney called conquest a dark fantasy epic that asked difficult moral questions and generally cited gameplay as harder and consequently more rewarding than that of its counterparts despite sharing tutorial deficiencies with birthright he also shared his opinions on music and graphics with birthright jose otero writing for ign frequently noted game s challenge while generally sharing his praises with sullivan s review of birthright including slow online elements a point of praise not shared with birthright was its mission variety peter brown reviewing game for gamespot praised gameplay variety and characters development and meaningful use in battle while critiquing plot for being fairly middle of road and did not like lack of optional side missions keller noted harder gameplay structure of conquest while noting that its story had a far more comedic tone with its characters mcelroy and frank referred to conquest as more challenging of two physical releases an opinion shared by carsillo and sheridan latter added that game would not make players feel like a hero robinson called conquest cooler of two physical releases noting its steeper challenge and more engaging cast carter considered revelation to be a good middle ground between birthright and conquest and praised its story after moving beyond conceit of its premise corriae was highly positive about game while finding initial premise rather contrived she greatly enjoyed resultant drama and found story better than that of birthright and conquest she also praised game for its gameplay and variety keller said story of revelation keeps players on their toes while praised gameplay for finding a middle ground between two physical releases she called it a fulfilling conclusion to fates while generally positive about game as a whole sheridan was rather critical of fact that players needed to buy revelation as dlc to get whole story gwaltney was less favorable than he was about birthright and conquest while he enjoyed early tension of a limited party ability to expand and strengthen party sapped away tension while he found story rather ho hum and generic after more impactful stories of first two versions sullivan of ign greatly enjoyed combination of characters and gameplay from birthright and conquest but shared her opinion of central plot device with corriae carsillo found revelation most satisfying due to obscuring of key plot points in other versions despite birthright and conquest offering greater character insight along with positively noting its gameplay balance between two physical releases sales shortly after pre orders for special edition were
