appearance production development idea for 7 khoon maaf came when ruskin bond sent his book of short story collection to vishal bhardwaj making of 7 khoon maaf event occurs at approximately 00 17 he was intrigued by a four page story s title named susanna s seven husbands and thought it had potential for a novel and a film bhardwaj said i told myself why would a woman have seven husbands and then i came to know that she also kills them i was immediately hooked to it it reminded me of a very old film bluebeard s seven wives bhardwaj suggested story to a fellow director who was looking for a good story however after reading short story director dismissed it saying it has no film potential after reading story twice he became even more confident about possibility of a film making of 7 khoon maaf event occurs at approximately 02 25 bhardwaj who had previously adapted bond s novel blue umbrella into a film decided to adapt short story for screen bhardwaj later requested bond to turn story into a novella noting that only bond could flesh out characters well to which he agreed making of 7 khoon maaf event occurs at approximately 02 30 bond expanded story into an 80 page novella which later became a 200 page full length hindi script bhardwaj co wrote script with matthew robbins bhardwaj noted that he retained bond s theme but incorporated his own elements to make film a dark comedy he said i had previously taken liberties with shakespeare naturally when you adapt a story your vision also comes in it but i have remained honest to its essence he included keemat lal who plays a police officer in all bond s stories although character is not in original story bhardwaj decided to include him in film as an homage to bond explaining that he took liberties with characters names and traits bond also had to devise indian methods of killing husbands which he found challenging challenge was devising seven ingenious ways in which she could kill her husbands without being suspected and she does it successfully until towards end casting and characters priyanka chopra was bhardwaj s original choice for role of susanna after he worked with actress in kaminey he said that chopra is finest actor of her generation right now as a director i had so much trust on her that i felt that no one else can essay this role as brilliantly as she would do mohanlal was cast as one of
