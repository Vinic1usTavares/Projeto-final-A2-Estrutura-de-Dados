royal australian air force raaf has operated mcdonnell douglas f a 18 hornet fighter aircraft since 1984 australian government purchased 75 a and b variants of f a 18 in 1981 to replace raaf s dassault mirage iii fighters hornets entered service with raaf between 1984 and 1990 four hornets were destroyed in flying accidents during late 1980s and early 1990s two were transferred to canada in february 2019 and several others have been retired raaf hornets were first sent on a combat deployment as part of australian contribution to 2003 invasion of iraq during invasion 14 hornets flew patrols over iraq as well as close air support sorties to assist coalition ground forces raaf f a 18s also provided security for american air base at diego garcia between late 2001 and early 2002 and have protected a number of high profile events in australia between 2015 and 2017 a detachment of hornets was deployed to middle east and struck isil targets as part of operation okra since 1999 raaf has put its hornets through a series of upgrades to improve their effectiveness however aircraft are becoming increasingly difficult to operate and are at risk of being outclassed by fighters and air defence systems operated by other countries as a result raaf is currently retiring its f a 18s and last aircraft is scheduled to leave service in early 2020s under current australian government planning they will be replaced by 72 lockheed martin f 35 lightning ii fighters australian government has offered hornets for sale once they are no longer needed by raaf and finalised a deal to sell 25 to canada in early 2019 selection raaf began initial stages of scoping a replacement for its dassault mirage iii fighters in 1968 service issued an air staff requirement for new fighter aircraft in december 1971 which received a larger than expected number of proposals from manufacturers at this time raaf expected to start phasing out mirage iiis in 1980 wilson 1993 p 80 in 1973 a team of raaf personnel inspected mcdonnell douglas f 15 eagle northrop yf 17 saab 37 viggen and dassault mirage f1 programs but recommended that any decisions about a suitable replacement be delayed so that several new fighters that were expected to soon become available could also be considered wilson 1993 p 81 in august 1974 australian government decided to defer fighter replacement project and extend mirage iiis operational life into 1980s one of four mirage iii equipped squadrons was also disbanded at this time thumb alt photo of a modern fighter aircraft parked on tarmac usaf f 16a in 1980 work on mirage replacement program resumed in 1975 and tactical fighter project office was established in 1976 to manage process of selecting raaf s next fighter a request for proposals was issued in november that year and attracted eleven responses by march 1977 office had chosen to focus on f 15 eagle general dynamics f 16 fighting falcon dassault mirage 2000 and panavia tornado as well as mcdonnell douglas f 18a and f 18l f 18a was a carrier based fighter developed from yf 17 for united states navy and f 18l was a land based variant of this design grumman f 14 tomcat was also considered by project office but was regarded as unsuitable and never placed on official shortlist mclaughlin 2005 p 51 in november 1978 f 15 and tornado were removed from list of aircraft being considered tornado was excluded as it was principally a strike aircraft and had limited air to air capability while f 15 was an impressive aircraft that met or exceeded almost all of raaf s requirements it was believed that air force did not need a fighter with such advanced capabilities and that introducing it into service could destabilise australia s region mclaughlin 2005 p 52 further evaluation of remaining aircraft took place during 1979 wing commander and later air vice marshal bob richardson test flew a mirage 2000 in april 1979 and reported that while aircraft had excellent aerodynamic characteristics its avionics radar fuel system cockpit and weapons capability were inferior to those of us designs mclaughlin 2005 p 53 richardson also test flew a yf 17 that was being used as a demonstrator for f 18l in mid 1979 and was impressed by its capabilities no f had been ordered at this time however and raaf did not want to take on risk of being lead customer for design mclaughlin 2005 p 55 at about same time raaf rejected an offer of f 14 tomcats that had been originally ordered by iranian government but not delivered as a result of revolution in that country while tomcats were made available at a greatly reduced price air force judged that these aircraft were too large and complex for its requirements thumb left alt photo of a modern fighter aircraft moving along tarmac sand and buildings are visible in background us marine corps f a 18a in 1985 with mirage 2000 and f 18l rejected raaf was faced with a choice between f 16 and f 18a richardson and several other raaf pilots tested united states air force usaf f in 1979 and 1980 and reported that aircraft had excellent performance but could be difficult to control at times evaluation team was also concerned about reliability of f 16 s engine and regarded aircraft as technologically immature it was also noted that aircraft s radar was inferior to that of f 18a and that f 16s could not fire beyond visual range bvr air to air missiles and long range anti shipping missiles that f 18a was capable of operating mclaughlin 2005 pp 56 57 in contrast evaluation team was impressed by f 18a and regarded it as being a more robust and survivable aircraft as it had been designed to operate from aircraft carriers these features were important for operations from bare bases in northern australia mclaughlin 2005 p 57 richardson and three other raaf pilots test flew f 18as and reported that aircraft handled well but had some deficiencies with its flight control system and engines these were not seen as major flaws by evaluation team however mclaughlin 2005 pp 57 58 f 18a s twin engines were considered to be its main advantage over single engined f 16 as research conducted by evaluation team found that attrition rate for single engined fighters was twice that for aircraft with two engines mclaughlin 2005 p 59 overall however raaf judged that both f 16 and f 18a were too immature for a decision to be made in 1980 as had been originally planned and recommended to government that this be deferred by a year government accepted raaf s recommendation and delayed its decision on a mirage iii replacement until late 1981 this gave general dynamics an opportunity to offer improved f 16c to raaf capability of these aircraft was closer to that of f 18 as they were equipped with bvr missiles richardson and another raaf pilot test flew f in may 1981 f 18 design was also improved during 1981 and was redesignated f a 18 when raaf test pilots flew these aircraft during 1981 they found that deficiencies they had detected in 1980 were now addressed mclaughlin 2005 p 60 overall raaf concluded that while both aircraft met its requirements and f 16 was less expensive f a 18 was superior design as it was more technologically mature easier to maintain during operational deployments and likely to have a much lower attrition rate mclaughlin 2005 pp 60 61 government accepted this advice and announced on 20 october 1981 that 75 f a 18s would be ordered as part of this announcement minister for defence jim killen acknowledged that f 16 would have been seven percent cheaper to purchase but stated that f a 18 s lower running costs and expected attrition rate greatly reduced difference between lifetime cost of two designs mclaughlin 2005 pp 61 62 instead of directly ordering aircraft from mcdonnell douglas australian government purchased its f a 18s through us government s foreign military sales fms program wilson 1993 p 83 ordering aircraft via us government allowed raaf to take advantage of superior purchasing power of us military and reduced service s project management requirements mclaughlin 2005 p 67 this led to a complicated arrangement whereby aircraft were ordered by us government delivered to us navy and then transferred to raaf once initial flight testing had taken place process functioned smoothly however and was cost effective mclaughlin 2005 pp 69 70 production thumb alt photo of a modern fighter aircraft flying with its landing gear extended one of raaf s first f a 18bs in october 1985 raaf s order of 75 hornets comprised 57 single seat a variant fighters and 18 two seat b variant operational training aircraft wilson 2005 p 35 it was planned that each of three fighter squadrons and single operational conversion unit that were to operate f a 18 would be allocated 16 aircraft of which 12 were expected to be operational at any time while other four were undergoing maintenance remaining eleven hornets were labelled half life attrition buy and would replace aircraft that were expected to have been lost by 2000 as it happened this greatly exceeded raaf s actual losses mclaughlin march 2005 p 55 deliveries were planned to start in late 1984 and be completed in 1990 total cost of f a 18 program including aircraft spare parts other equipment and modifications to raaf s fighter bases was calculated as a 2 427 billion in august 1981 but was rapidly revised upwards due to depreciation of australian dollar at this time mclaughlin march 2005 p 54 australian hornets were very similar to standard us navy variants but incorporated a number of minor modifications these included addition of an instrument landing system very high frequency omnidirectional range ils vor system a high frequency radio a different ejection seat harness and deletion of all equipment used only to launch aircraft from catapults in addition two of australian aircraft were fitted with flight test instrumentation so that they could be used as part of trials wilson 1993 p 86 f a 18a and b variant 2005 p 42 year f a 18a f a 18b total 1985 1 7 8 1986 12 0 12 1987 7 7 14 1988 21 4 25 1989 12 0 12 1990 4 0 4 total 57 18 75 government sought to use mirage iii replacement program as a means to increase capabilities of australia s manufacturing industry accordingly it was decided to build aircraft in australia though it was recognised that this would lead to higher costs than if fighters were purchased directly from united states while first two raaf hornets were built in united states remainder were assembled at government aircraft factories plant at avalon airport in victoria and their engines were produced by commonwealth aircraft corporation at fishermans bend in melbourne another twelve australian companies were involved in other stages of project mclaughlin march 2005 pp 54 55 these firms were sub contracted to mcdonnell douglas and other major us companies that produced components for f a 18 and had to comply with requirements of fms program australian government hoped that singapore and new zealand would purchase australian built hornets but this did not eventuate canadian government expressed interest in purchasing 25 australian built f a 18as in 1988 in order to increase its force of these aircraft after they had ceased to be manufactured in united states but this did not lead to any sales wilson 1993 pp 127 128 thumb alt photo of a modern fighter aircraft landing on a runway mountains are visible in background of photo an f a 18a a21 49 landing in 2011 australian hornets began to roll off production lines in 1984 first two aircraft serial numbers a21 101 and a21 102 were entirely built at mcdonnell douglas factory in st louis and were handed over to raaf on 29 october 1984 these aircraft remained in united states until may 1985 for training and trials purposes wilson 2005 p 2005 p 70 next two australian hornets a21 103 and a21 104 were also built at st louis but were then disassembled and flown to avalon in june 1984 on board a usaf lockheed c 5 galaxy aircraft were then reassembled and a21 103 was rolled out at a ceremony attended by prime minister bob hawke and chief of air staff air marshal david evans on 16 november however aircraft s initial test flight was delayed until 26 february 1985 by a demarcation dispute over which category of pilot was permitted to fly aircraft wilson 2005 pp 41 42 in order to meet production targets gaf was required to complete 1 5 hornets per month production fell behind schedule during first half of 1987 however as a result of inefficiencies at company s factory and industrial relations problems gaf was able to accelerate production later in year though some components that were planned to be manufactured in australia were purchased from companies in united states instead final cost of hornet project was a 4 668 billion after adjusting for depreciation of australian dollar this was 186 million less than initial estimate raaf began to accept hornets into service in 1985 a21 103 was formally delivered on 4 may of that year two weeks later a21 101 and 102 were flown from naval air station lemoore in california to raaf base williamtown in new south wales between 16 and 17 may 1985 this ferry flight was conducted as a non stop journey and usaf mcdonnell douglas kc 10 extender tankers refuelled each of hornets 15 times as they crossed pacific as of 2005 this remained longest single flight to have been undertaken by f a 18s mclaughlin 2010 pp 12 13 despite delays to production in 1987 final australian hornet a21 57 was delivered on schedule at a ceremony held in canberra on 16 may 1990 f a 18as were allocated serial numbers a21 1 through to a21 57 and f a 18bs were allocated a21 101 to

which has been main f a 18 base throughout aircraft s service pre existing airfield at raaf base tindal in northern territory was also developed into a major air base between 1985 and 1988 at a cost of 215 million so that it could accommodate no 75 squadron until this time squadron had been stationed at raaf base darwin which due to its location on australia s north coast was vulnerable to damage from cyclones and difficult to defend during wartime wilson 1993 p 110 owing to concerns over airworthiness of raaf s general dynamics f 111 bombers and delays to lockheed martin f 35 lightning ii program australian government ordered 24 f a 18f super hornets in 2006 this design is significantly different from original or classic hornet however raaf s first super hornets entered service in 2010 and deliveries were completed next year mclaughlin 2010 pp 42 44 in 2013 australian government ordered 12 boeing ea 18g growler electronic warfare variants of super hornet and all were delivered to raaf between 2015 and 2017 maintenance and upgrades maintenance of raaf s hornets is carried out by both air force personnel and civilian contractors until early 1990s all routine servicing and a significant proportion of intensive deeper maintenance was undertaken by air force however share of intensive maintenance tasks outsourced to private sector was increased during 1990s under raaf wide commercial support program stephens 2006 pp 301 307 under current arrangements four hornet equipped units undertake all routine servicing and some of more complex deeper maintenance tasks remainder of deeper maintenance work as well as all major refurbishments and upgrade projects are carried out by commercial firms anao 2007 p 54 bae systems has been lead contractor for hornet deeper maintenance since 2003 and boeing australia has also provided maintenance services for aircraft since it won a contract to do so in 2010 in august 2017 boeing s contract was extended until planned retirement of hornets in 2021 with company also gaining responsibility for integrating weapons onto type this change was made to free up raaf personnel for activities associated with introducing f 35 into service raaf s hornet fleet received few modifications until late 1990s during this period an aas 38 nite hawk targeting pod was only new system fitted to aircraft pittaway 2012 p 22 however several asian countries introduced mikoyan mig 29 fighters into service during 1990s raising concerns that raaf s aircraft would be outclassed air force considered replacing hornet with eurofighter typhoon or boeing f a 18e f super hornet but concluded that both aircraft were technologically immature as a result it was decided to upgrade hornets thumb left photo of a modern fighter aircraft viewed from

systems navigation system and radio were replaced aircraft were also fitted to operate asraam air to air missile these weapons replaced aim 9 sidewinder pittaway 2012 p 23 hug phase 2 comprised four sub elements and sought to improve hornets combat performance during phase 2 1 apg 65 radar was replaced with improved an apg 73 and aircraft were fitted with a secure voice encryption communications system as well as various updates to their computer systems in hug phase 2 2 most important element of program hornets were fitted with a joint helmet mounted cueing system equipment needed to share data through link 16 network a new countermeasures dispensing system and several upgrades to their cockpit displays all of hornets were upgraded to this standard between january 2005 and december 2006 pittaway 2012 pp 23 24 in phase 2 3 an improved electronic counter measures system was fitted to hornets an alr 2002 was originally selected but proved unsuccessful it was replaced by alr 67 radar warning receiver in late 2006 as of early 2012 14 hornets had been fitted with system and remainder were scheduled to receive it by end of year pittaway 2012 p 24 during hug phase 2 4 hornets were modified to be able to use an 28 v litening targeting pod and 37 of these systems were purchased this phase was completed in 2007 third stage of hornet upgrade program sought to rectify airframe damage hug phase 3 1 involved minor structural work to all aircraft as they passed through other phases of program centre fuselages of ten hornets assessed as suffering greatest amount of structural damage were replaced in hug phase 3 2 it was originally intended that all raaf s hornets would receive new centre fuselages but scope of this phase of program was reduced after it was found that number of man hours needed to upgrade each aircraft was much greater than originally estimated ten aircraft were upgraded at an l 3 communications facility in canada and all were returned to service by june 2010 long running hug process complicated raaf s management of its fleet of f a 18s at any one time capabilities of individual aircraft differed considerably depending on their upgrades accordingly long standing arrangement where aircraft were almost permanently assigned to each squadron was replaced by a system where they were pooled attempts to allocate hornets with similar levels of modifications from common pool to each squadron were not successful frawley 2010 p 48 armament alt colour photo of a flying fighter aircraft firing a missile thumb an raaf f a 18 hornet firing an

thumb left alt photo of a modern fighter aircraft parked on tarmac top of aircraft is painted blue while remainder is grey an f a 18a in special colours to mark 20th anniversary of type s introduction into raaf service raaf s mirage iii pilots generally found process of converting to hornet to be straightforward while f a 18 was considered to be easier to fly its more sophisticated avionics and weapons systems required improved cockpit workload management skills hornets have also proven to be mechanically reliable and easy to maintain though shortages of spare parts reduced availability rates during early years of their service with raaf mclaughlin 2005 p 64 updates installed as part of hug process have further simplified maintenance procedures in recent years however aging aircraft have required much more servicing than was case in past to extend hornet s range four of raaf s six boeing 707 transport aircraft were converted to tankers in early 1990s first boeing 707 tanker entered service in 1990 wilson 1993 p 119 tankers were operated by no 33 squadron and supported hornet units until 707s were retired in 2008 these aircraft were replaced with kc 30a tanker transports in 2011 raaf has at times suffered from shortfalls of hornet qualified pilots service began to experience shortages of f a 18 and f 111 fast jet pilots in mid 1980s due to competition from commercial airlines and relatively low recruitment rates anao 2000 p 42 by june 1999 three operational hornet equipped squadrons had only 40 pilots which was less than number of aircraft allocated to these units raaf claimed that squadrons were able to meet their readiness targets however anao 2000 p 44 to overcome this shortfall raaf gave its fast jet units a higher priority for aircrew implemented measures to reduce separation rates and recruited pilots from other countries these reforms coincided with reduced demand for civil pilots following 11 september attacks and by late 2003 raaf s fast jet units were at near full strength anao 2004 pp 14 18 a 2010 article in magazine australian aviation stated that no 3 squadron typically had about 18 pilots on strength at any point in time frawley 2010 p 45

raaf s 116 mirages due to accidents pittaway 2017 p 31 similarly andrew mclaughlin noted in 2019 that loss of four hornets to this time was a remarkable endorsement of aircraft s rugged design and systems redundancy given that raaf had projected that eleven would have been lost by 2004 when aircraft were first acquired deployments in late 1990 consideration was given to deploying a squadron of

australia and this option was not adopted by government horner 2011 pp 383 384 as a result hornets only role in war was to support training of royal australian navy warships which were sent to gulf by

value coalition aircraft such as tankers and airborne early warning and control aircraft holmes 2006 p 86 as it rapidly became clear that iraqi air force posed no threat from 21 march no 75 squadron also began to also conduct air interdiction sorties against iraqi forces these sorties were initially flown in support of united states army s v corps but squadron was rarely assigned any targets to attack as a result australian commanders in middle east had no 75 squadron reassigned to support united states marine corps i marine expeditionary force at this time squadron also began flying close air support sorties during first two weeks of war squadron typically flew 12 sorties per day to avoid pilot fatigue additional aircrew were posted to middle east from australia number of sorties

in september 2007 hornets patrolled over sydney during apec leaders meeting there eight hornets were also deployed from williamstown to raaf base pearce in october 2011 to protect chogm meeting in nearby perth on 16 and 17 november that year hornets operated over canberra and darwin while president barack obama was present in march 2015 six f a 18as from no 75 squadron were deployed to middle east as part of operation okra replacing a detachment of super hornets no 81 wing s involvement in operation okra concluded in may 2017 with no 1 squadron resuming responsibility for this task by this time all of wing s three squadrons had completed at least one rotation to middle east no 3 squadron was deployed once and other two squadrons conducted two deployments squadrons used a common pool of aircraft during these deployments with either six or seven hornets being stationed in middle east at any time aircraft were typically deployed for eight months before rotating back to australia when becoming due for major servicing members of three hornet equipped squadrons served five or six month rotations and ground crew from 2ocu and no 81 wing s workshops were also deployed to fill specialist roles hornets attacked isil personnel and facilities in both iraq and syria including in support of iraqi forces engaged in battle of mosul overall no 81 wing conducted 1 973 sorties over iraq and syria during which 1 961 munitions were released despite age of aircraft and harsh environmental conditions in middle east detachment sustained a very high serviceability rate replacement thumb alt colour photo of a grey military aircraft on ground a man wearing blue is standing nearby and saluting aircraft one of raaf s first lockheed martin f 35a lightning iis in 2015 while hornet upgrade program has been successful raaf s hornets are approaching retirement it is expected that aircraft will be increasingly expensive to operate as they age and improvements to fighter aircraft and air defences operated by other countries will reduce hornets combat effectiveness davies 2011 pp 7 8 australian government is currently planning to replace raaf s f a 18 hornets with lockheed martin f 35a lightning ii fighters from 2018 onwards nordeen 2017 p 80 defence materiel organisation s project air 6000 phase 2a b specifies that 72 f 35a fighters will be acquired to equip three squadrons and an operational training unit no 3 squadron will be first hornet unit to be reequipped and ceased operating type in december 2017 it began to transition to f 35 in early 2018 squadron s hornets and most of its personnel were transferred to no 77 squadron which was expanded from two to three flights as part of this change mclaughlin 2018 p 30 all of f a 18a and bs are scheduled to be retired by 2023 raaf s hornet sustainability planning has been designed to allow type to be retained in service for longer if f 35 program experiences further delays in meantime raaf has implemented several measures to keep hornets in service these include a structural refurbishment program increased monitoring of fatigue related issues as well as repainting aircraft and frequently washing them to reduce risks posed by corrosion moclair and mclaughlin 2014 p 67 in 2015 defence science and technology group conducted new statistical analysis of hornets structural condition which found that airframes were less fatigued than previously believed and so able to remain in service for a longer period than planned if necessary this finding was accepted by directorate general technical airworthiness australian defence force as of september 2017 none of raaf hornets were subject to flying restrictions due to airframe fatigue however cost of maintaining ageing aircraft in service has been increasing pittaway 2017 p 33 a 2017 article by canadian defence analyst christopher cowan and australian strategic policy institute analyst dr andrew davies stated that raaf has done an excellent job managing its hornet fleet with each aircraft having a unique plan to minimise airframe fatigue at this time each of hornets had on average been flown for 4 200 hours as compared to nominal fatigue life of 6 000 hours for type in august 2019 hornet fleet passed milestone of having flown 400 000 hours at this time several hornets had been retired from service after becoming due for major servicing periods disposal australian government is planning to sell hornets and associated spare parts after type is retired from raaf service in august 2017 canadian government initiated discussions to purchase a number of australian f a 18s to augment royal canadian air force s fleet of similar mcdonnell douglas cf 18 hornets in event that a planned purchase of super hornets was cancelled as result of a trade dispute a canadian delegation also visited australia that month to inspect raaf hornets canadian government lodged a formal expression of interest to purchase australian f a 18s on 29 september 2017 on 13 december 2017 australian minister for defence payne confirmed sale of 18 f a 18 hornets and associated spare parts to canada canadian government announced at same time that it had cancelled its plans to acquire super hornets australian aircraft are being acquired to enable rcaf to continue to meet its international commitments until a new fighter type is ordered and enters service in june 2018 canadian government requested a further seven australian hornets these additional aircraft will be used as a source of spare parts sale of 25 hornets was finalised in early 2019 with purchase price being c 90 million of these aircraft 18 will be issued to operational units and remainder used for trials purposes and as a source of spare parts after they arrive in canada aircraft will be fitted with different ejection seats and software so that they are identical to cf 18s deliveries of ex raaf hornets to canada began in february 2019 two of aircraft were flown to cfb cold lake by australian pilots in mid february and handed over after they had formed part of raaf contingent at a red flag exercise in united states at this time deliveries of other 23 hornets were scheduled to be completed in 2021 however this schedule is dependent on progress with introducing f 35 into australian service notes citations references further reading category
