collins street west but it was considered too small at time a second gaol was then built between 1841 and 1844 at corner of russell and la trobe streets adjoining then supreme court first cell block was opened for prisoners in 1845 but facilities were considered inadequate escapes occurring frequently gaol was already crowded by 1850 with discovery of gold in 1851 when port phillip district became new colony of victoria and resulting influx of population law and order became more difficult to maintain subsequently a new wing with its own perimeter wall was constructed between 1852 and 1854 building using bluestone instead of sandstone design was based on that of british prison engineer joshua jebb and especially designs for pentonville model prison in london which suited current prison reform theories at time new wing was extended in between 1857 and 1859 with boundary wall also being extended during this time in 1860 a new north wing was built which included entrance buildings a central hall and chapel between 1862 and 1864 a cell block was built for female prisoners on western side it was basically a replica of present east block until this time female convicts were not kept apart from male prisoners in 1864 perimeter wall and gaol overall was completed making it a dominant feature of authority on melbourne skyline at its completion prison occupied an entire city block and included exercise yards a hospital in one of yards a chapel a bath house and staff accommodation a house for chief warders was built on corner of franklin and russell streets and 17 homes were built for gaolers on swanston street in 1860 artefacts recovered from area indicate that even gaolers and their families lived within gaol walls in 1850s and 1860s operation thumb calico hood much of daily life inside gaol could be gleaned from sources such as diaries written by john governor of gaol between 1869 and 1884 during its operation gaol was used to house short term prisoners lunatics and some of colony s most notorious and hardened criminals it also housed up to twenty children at a time including those imprisoned for petty theft or vagrancy or simply those staying with a convicted parent babies under twelve months old were allowed to be with their mothers youngest prisoner was recorded as three year old michael crimmins who spent 6 months in prison in 1857 for being idle and disorderly in 1851 13 and 14 year old o dowd sisters were imprisoned because they had nowhere else to go prisoners convicted of serious crimes such as murder arson burglary rape and shooting would begin their time on ground floor with a time of solitary confinement they were also forbidden from communicating with other prisoners which was strictly enforced by usage of a silence mask or calico hood when outside their cells they would only be given a single hour of solitary exercise a day with remaining 23 hours spent in their cells inside cells prisoners would be able to lie on a thin mattress over slate floors they could only bathe and change clothes once a week and attend chapel on sundays with a bible provided to promote good behaviour prisoners might only have been allowed to finally socialise with other prisoners towards end of their sentences routine for prisoners was regulated by a system of bells and enforced by punishments prisoners who obeyed rules would be promoted to second floor whereby they would be allowed to work in yards everyday male prisoners would perform hard labour including breaking rocks and other duties in stone quarries while women would sew clean and cook women would also make shirts and waistcoats for male prisoners as well as act as domestic servants for governor and his family prisoners who had become trusted those

convicted of minor crimes such as drunkenness vagrancy prostitution or petty theft executions thumb right old melbourne gaol gallows during its operation gaol was setting for 135 hangings most infamous was that of bushranger ned kelly at age of 25 on 11 november 1880 after a two day trial kelly was convicted of killing a police officer as stated by law at time executed prisoners were buried in unmarked graves in gaol burial yard before burial a death mask was produced from executed prisoners head as part of phrenological study of hanged felons historian and associate professor of wollongong university john states that lack of monitoring for burial processes was odd given victorian society s normally brilliant attention to detail first hanging of a woman in victoria elizabeth scott was performed in prison on 11 november 1863 along with her co accused julian cross and david gedge last person to be executed was angus murray in 1924 same year gaol was closed ned kelly thumb left death mask of ned kelly edward ned kelly born sometime between june 1854 and june 1855 was an irish australian bushranger and was seen by some as merely a cold blooded killer while to others he was a folk hero for his defiance of colonial authorities as a youth he clashed with victoria police and after an incident at his home in 1878 police parties searched for him in bush he killed three policemen and subsequently colony proclaimed kelly and his gang wanted outlaws a final violent confrontation with police took place at on 28 june 1880 kelly dressed in a home made plate metal armour and helmet was captured and sent to gaol he was hanged for murder at old melbourne gaol in november 1880 his notoriety affirmed him as a polarising iconic figure in australian history folk lore literature art and film colin campbell ross colin campbell ross an australian wine bar owner was wrongly convicted of rape and murder of 12 year old alma in december 1921 case dubbed gun alley murder was heavily influenced by public hysteria at time which ultimately served to condemn him despite his pleas of innocence including an attempt whereby a letter was thrown over gaol walls he was executed by hanging in gaol in april 1922 only 115 days after body was found a new four strand rope was used for first time at execution and proved to be a failure ross slowly strangled for more than forty minutes before his death a prison report later ruled that such a rope must never be used again he was posthumously pardoned on 27 may 2008 frederick bailey deeming frederick bailey deeming was born on 30 july 1853 at 16 years of age he ran away to sea and thereafter he began a long career of crime largely thieving and obtaining money under false pretences he was responsible for murder of his first wife marie and his four children at england on or about 26 july 1891 and a second wife emily at windsor melbourne on 24 december 1891 less than three months elapsed between discovery of emily mather s body in windsor melbourne in march 1892 and deeming s execution at old melbourne gaol for her murder in may 1892 a remarkably short time by comparison to modern western legal standards after his execution it was reported that over 12 000 people cheered on streets outside and there was public speculation that deeming was in fact jack ripper and tunnerminnerwait tragically two of these aboriginal men tunnerminnerwait known as jack and maulboyheenner known as bob or sometimes called timmy or jimmy became first people executed in port phillip district this took place in 1842 a mere seven years after john batman s fraudulent treaty with kuhn people when two tasmanian aboriginal men were publicly hanged for murder tunnerminnerwait and maulboyheenner public marker exists at place of execution website contains historical research and information on artists commissioned for marker artist brook andrew along with trent walter two tasmanian aboriginal men clad in white pyjamas went to their deaths on a makeshift gallows in melbourne in 1842 contemporaneous executions were apparently quite a spectacle one man maulboyheenner twisting on rope strangled slowly in front of a crowd of

conducted with recommendation being made to close gaol and relocate prisoners to more suitable locations gaol gradually slowed its operations and demolished portions of original site between 1880 and 1924 in 1924 gaol was finally closed however in march 1927 old melbourne gaol was integrated into part of new emily mcpherson college and was used for educational purposes this necessitated changes to prison in 1929 despite poor record keeping of prisoner burials historical evidence suggested remains of approximately 32 executed prisoners including ned kelly were exhumed from old melbourne gaol and buried at mass graves in a quarry at pentridge in 1930 women s cell block walls and several other buildings were demolished and a further four coffins were believed to have been moved to pentridge in

site that needed to be preserved at all costs furthermore in 1965 melbourne junior chamber of commerce floated idea of converting it into a museum for purposes of tourism in 1972 gaol was reopened as a public museum under management of national trust of australia victoria gaol is recognised as victoria s oldest surviving penal establishment and attracts approximately 140 000 visitors per year

a skull believed to be ned kelly s was on display in museum until it was stolen from a glass cabinet in 1978 efforts have been taken by scientists and government to determine location of skull and whether it was authentic to begin with it was reported that members of public may have remains of bones and teeth taken as souvenirs when graves were exhumed in 1929 special interest was directed to finding a photograph of former south melbourne councillor alex talbot holding ned kelly s skull and information on grave exhume contractor lee of lee and dunn or his family who was tasked with delivering kelly s skull to governor in 2009 west australian farmer tom baxter handed a skull to authorities arguing that it was one stolen from gaol while refusing to explain how he obtained it former pentridge prison chaplain father peter norden has stated that he believed skull handed in could not belong to kelly and that it probably belonged to a woman in 2010 there was further speculation that skull actually belonged to frederick bailey deeming with victorian institute of forensic medicine claiming that skull is similar to both kelly s and deeming s death masks references
