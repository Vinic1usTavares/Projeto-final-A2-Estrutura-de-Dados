amx 30e e stands for espana spanish for spain is a spanish main battle tank based on france s amx 30 although originally spanish government sought to procure german leopard 1 amx 30 was ultimately awarded contract due to its lower price and ability to manufacture it in spain 280 units were manufactured by santa barbara sistemas for spanish army between 1974 and 1983 first acquired in 1970 tank was to supplement spain s fleet of m47 and m48 patton united states tanks and to reduce spain s reliance on american equipment in its army first 19 amx 30 tanks were acquired from france in 1970 while another 280 were assembled in spain it was spain s first mass produced tank and developed country s industry to point where government felt it could produce a tank on its own leading to development of lince tank project in 1985 it also offered santa barbara sistemas experience which led to production of leopard 2e in late 2003 although final assembly was carried out by santa barbara sistemas production of amx 30e also included other companies in country total production within spain amounted to as much as 65 of tank spain s amx 30e fleet went through two separate modifications in late 1980s a modernization program and a reconstruction program former named amx 150 tanks sought to modernize and improve vehicle s automotive characteristics while latter or amx 149 tanks resulted in a more austere improvement of tank s power plant by maintaining existing engine and replacing transmission both programs extended vehicle s lifetime spain s fleet of amx 30em1s was replaced in late 1990s by german leopard and amx 30em2s were replaced by centauro wheeled anti tank vehicles in early 21st century although 19 amx 30es were deployed to spanish sahara in 1970 tank never saw combat in

advantages of french vehicle itself that influenced decision rather it was uk s unwillingness to sell their l7 tank gun low cost of amx 30 and french offer to allow spain to manufacture tank that led spanish army to favor french armored vehicle rudnick atlantic relations pp 203 204 production on 22 june 1970 spanish ministry of defense signed an agreement of military cooperation with france which outlined plans for future acquisition of around 200 tanks for spanish army of these 180 were to be manufactured under license in spain and 20 were to be manufactured by france ultimately giat was

upgrades main objectives were to increase power and reliability of power pack an improvement to tank s firepower and accuracy as well as to increase vehicle s ballistic protection and overall survivability a number of modernization packages were proposed including a suggestion to mount amx 30e s turret on a leopard 1 s chassis other options included swapping existing power pack for a new american diesel engine and transmission or exchanging power pack for a new german diesel engine and transmission more austere versions of these same options were offered pairing existing hs 110 engine with already mentioned transmissions another prototype was produced using leopard s more modern tracks and another similar prototype mounted a new 12 7 millimeter 0 5 in machine gun for loader s

several parts of tank such as brakes were renovated in order to bring them up to their original standards cd 850 6a was an automatic transmission with a triple differential providing two forward velocities and one reverse velocity however new transmission resulted in a new problem excessive heat produced by transmission reduced vehicle s range reconstruction of 149 amx 30es began in 1988 and
