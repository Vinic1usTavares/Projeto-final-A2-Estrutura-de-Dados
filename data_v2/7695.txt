1904 atlantic hurricane season featured no tropical cyclones in months of july and august first tropical cyclone was initially observed in southwestern caribbean sea on june 10 after first storm dissipated on june 14 next tropical cyclone was not detected until september 8 sixth and final system transitioned into an extratropical cyclone offshore south carolina on november 4 two of six tropical cyclones existed simultaneously of season s six tropical storms four of those strengthened into a hurricane none of them deepened further into a major hurricane which is a tropical cyclone that reaches at least category 3 on modern day saffir simpson hurricane wind scale atlantic hurricane reanalysis project also indicated but could not confirm presence of four additional tropical depressions throughout season however reanalysis added a previously undetected hurricane in late september and early october to atlantic hurricane database hurdat first and second systems left most significant impacts during this season first storm brought heavy rainfall to eastern cuba causing flooding that left widespread damage and at least 87 deaths in september season s second tropical cyclone produced strong winds along east coast of united states from south carolina northward and into atlantic canada there were at least 18 deaths and 2 5 million 1904 usd in damage season s activity was reflected with an accumulated cyclone energy ace rating of 30 third lowest value at time and lowest since 1864 ace is broadly speaking a measure of power of hurricane multiplied by length of time it existed so storms that last a long time as well as particularly strong hurricanes have high aces it is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 39 mph 63 km h which is tropical storm strength systems hurricane one first storm of season was observed by ships over southwestern caribbean sea on june 10 about 65 miles 105 km east southeast of isla de providencia moving north to north northeast depression strengthened slowly reaching tropical storm intensity by early on june 12 after curving to northeast storm strengthened further it became a category 1 hurricane on modern day saffir simpson hurricane wind scale on june 13 several hours before peaking with winds of 80 mph 130 km h and a minimum barometric pressure of both estimated by ramon perez of cuban institute of meteorology in 2000 shortly thereafter hurricane made landfall near pilon in granma province cuba early on june 14 cyclone weakened to a tropical storm it soon emerged into atlantic ocean but continued weakening falling to tropical depression intensity and dissipating over southeastern bahamas late on june 14 in jamaica slow moving storm brought over of rainfall to western portions of island subsequent flooding inundated a number of roads and washed away several bridges isolating some areas heavy precipitation also fell in eastern cuba with city of santiago de cuba observing about of rainfall in only five hours about 150 homes were damaged or destroyed while many mines and roads and railways were impacted el was also among cities most devastated by storm low lying areas of city were completely destroyed as were bridges railroad bridges and railways at least 87 deaths occurred with some sources estimating that over 250 people were killed hurricane two after a three month lull next tropical storm was first observed about northeast of barbados on september 8 storm moved northwestward for several days and slowly strengthened by 12 00 utc on september 12 system became a hurricane six hours later it peaked with maximum sustained winds of 80 mph 130 km h hurricane made landfall on cedar island south carolina at same intensity around 13 00 utc on september 14 a barometric pressure of was observed at landfall lowest in relation to system about five hours later cyclone weakened to a tropical storm and curved sharply northeastward weakening and losing tropical characteristics it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone over delaware bay early on september 15 remnants briefly restrengthened into a powerful extratropical cyclone equivalent to a category 1 hurricane before dissipating over nova scotia later that day in south carolina three fishing boats sank offshore charleston drowning several people while another ship capsized causing three deaths two additional drownings occurred in north carolina offshore wrightsville beach a tornado spawned by storm destroyed about 20 homes and damaged several other structures including a few ginneries at a cost of 25 000 and downed telephone and electrical poles between mount olive and faison as well as causing a fatal injury two other tornadoes in state caused similar damage some areas of carolinas experienced heavy rainfall with in smiths mills south carolina in maryland strong winds caused extensive damage to trees power lines and crops a death from electrocution occurred in baltimore numerous vessels in chesapeake bay were damaged beached or capsized nine deaths occurred in delaware eight after a tugboat sank and another after a schooner ran aground in lewes strong winds deroofed homes and businesses while telegraph and telephone lines and trees were downed heavy rainfall in philadelphia and new york city inundated many streets and basements winds up to 80 mph 130 km h in new york city shattered hundreds of windows and downed numerous trees and wires one man died after being struck by a cast iron fire escape at new york harbor 19 barges broke loose from their moorings and several smaller ships were washed ashore during storm while 15 vessels suffered damage or were grounded at boston throughout southern new england strong winds resulted in widespread damage to trees and power lines damage in united states reached at least 2 million in atlantic canada powerful winds disrupted telephone and telegraph services a woman was killed in halifax nova scotia when a tree fell on her winds aided firefighters battling a large blaze in which ultimately caused about 500 000 in damage several incidents involving ships being sunk run aground or forced to return to port occurred throughout atlantic canada including in new brunswick newfoundland and nova scotia overall storm killed around 27 people hurricane three based on observations and continuity it is estimated that a tropical depression developed in southwestern caribbean sea about 120 mi 195 km east southeast of isla de providencia at 00 00 utc on september 28 moving slowly northwestward depression intensified into a tropical storm about 24 hours later early on october 1 based on observations from steamship ellis cyclone strengthened into a hurricane shortly thereafter storm began curving west northward and peaked with maximum sustained winds of 80 mph 130 km h however it soon began to weakened and fell to tropical storm early on october 2 around 06 00 utc on following day system made landfall near belize mexico border with winds of 60 mph 95 km h observations from mexico suggest that cyclone weakened to a tropical depression around 00 00 utc on october 4 and dissipated over chiapas about 18 hours later hurricane four next storm was first observed by ships early on october 12 while located about 185 mi 300 km south southeast of morant point jamaica after initially moving westward storm gradually curved northward over next few days it strengthened slowly becoming a hurricane around 12 00 utc on october 15 early on following day cyclone made landfall in cuba near trinidad sancti spiritus with winds of 75 mph 120 km h system weakened to a tropical storm while crossing island before emerging into atlantic ocean near straits of florida late on october 16 however early on october 17 storm re intensified into a hurricane at 05 00 utc hurricane attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 80 mph 130 km h and a minimum barometric pressure of which was observed by a weather station in miami around 08 00 utc on october 17 cyclone struck key largo florida while still at peak intensity it weakened to a tropical storm four hours later storm then drifted slowly northwestward across south florida and began executing a cyclonic loop late on october 18 system emerged into gulf of mexico near boca grande as a minimal tropical storm storm moved southwestward southeastward and then east northeastward it failed to re intensify over gulf of mexico and made landfall in mainland monroe county at 10 00 utc on october 20 with winds of 40 mph 65 km h around 18 00 utc cyclone emerged into atlantic near miami beach and weakened to a tropical depression continuing east northeastward storm crossed northern bahamas striking grand bahama and abaco islands by 18 00 utc cyclone dissipated about northeast of abaco islands in cuba storm dropped heavy rainfall leaving significant damage due to flooding much of impact in florida was concentrated in miami area several homes were unroofed in northern sections of city and in colored town an african american neighborhood today known as a few local hotels were structurally impacted while many businesses were damaged winds also defoliated shrubbery and downed trees and signs trees and electrical poles were downed as far north as fort lauderdale leaving some power outages some citrus and pineapple crops were damaged throughout south florida while low lying vegetables were ruined considerably due to flooding offshore florida three sailing vessels were wrecked in storm british melrose german zion and american james judge crews of zion and james judge reached shore safely but melrose sank offshore in heavy seas with loss of seven crewmen survivors were left clinging to wreckage for nearly four days before being rescued tropical storm five data from ships on october 19 indicated presence of a tropical storm about 1 195 mi 1 925 km northeast of barbuda after initially moving southwestward storm briefly curved west northwestward on october 20 shortly before turning northward around 12 00 utc on october 21 cyclone obtained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph 85 km h and a minimum barometric pressure of latter of which was observed by a ship system then curved northwestward and began accelerating by 00 00 utc storm transitioned into an extratropical cyclone while located about 365 mi 590 km south southeast of sable island extratropical remnants continued rapidly north northeastward until dissipating south of greenland on october 23 tropical storm six final storm of season was detected over bay of campeche based on observations from merida yucatan on october 31 station recorded a barometric pressure of lowest known in relation to system while it was a tropical cyclone initially moving northwestward storm curved northeastward early on november 1 it intensified slightly throughout day peaking with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph 85 km h around 00 00 utc next day thereafter cyclone began weakening while approaching florida panhandle around 12 00 utc on november 3 storm made landfall near fort walton beach florida with winds of 40 mph 65 km h it tracked across florida panhandle southern georgia and coastal south carolina before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone just offshore south carolina extratropical remnants continued rapidly northeast until dissipated near newfoundland late on november 6 winds up to were observed in new orleans louisiana and pensacola florida storm
