300px thumb scheme of uranus s ring moon system solid lines denote rings dashed lines denote orbits of moons rings of uranus are a system of rings around planet uranus intermediate in complexity between more extensive set around saturn and simpler systems around jupiter and neptune rings of uranus were discovered on march 10 1977 by james l elliot edward w dunham and jessica mink william herschel had also reported observing rings in 1789 modern astronomers are divided on whether he could have seen them as they are very dark and faint re study by stuart eves by 1978 nine distinct rings were identified two additional rings were discovered in 1986 in images taken by voyager 2 spacecraft and two outer rings were found in 2003 2005 in hubble space telescope photos in order of increasing distance from planet 13 known rings are designated 1986u2r z 6 5 4 a b e g d l e n and m their radii range from about 38 000 km for 1986u2r z ring to about 98 000 km for m ring additional faint dust bands and incomplete arcs may exist between main rings rings are extremely dark bond albedo of rings particles does not exceed 2 they are probably composed of water ice with addition of some dark radiation processed organics majority of uranus s rings are opaque and only a few kilometers wide ring system contains little dust overall it consists mostly of large bodies 0 2 20 m in diameter some rings are optically thin broad and faint 1986u2r z m and n rings are made of small dust particles while narrow and faint l ring also contains larger bodies relative lack of dust in ring system may be due to aerodynamic drag from extended uranian exosphere rings of uranus are thought to be relatively young and not more than 600 million years old uranian ring system probably originated from collisional fragmentation of several moons that once existed around planet after colliding moons probably broke up into many particles which survived as narrow and optically dense rings only in strictly confined zones of maximum stability mechanism that confines narrow rings is not well understood initially it was assumed that every narrow ring had a pair of nearby shepherd moons corralling them into shape in 1986 voyager 2 discovered only one such shepherd pair cordelia and ophelia around brightest ring e discovery first mention of a uranian ring system comes from william herschel s notes detailing his observations of uranus in 18th century which include following passage february 22 1789 a ring was suspected herschel drew a small diagram of ring and noted that it was a little inclined to red keck telescope in hawaii has since confirmed this to be case at least for n ring herschel s notes were published in a royal society journal in 1797 in two centuries between 1797 and 1977 rings are rarely mentioned if at all this casts serious doubt on whether herschel could have seen anything of sort while hundreds of other astronomers saw nothing it has been claimed that herschel gave accurate descriptions of e ring s size relative to uranus its changes as uranus travelled around sun and its color definitive discovery of uranian rings was made by astronomers james l elliot edward w dunham and jessica mink on march 10 1977 using kuiper airborne observatory and was serendipitous they planned to use occultation of star sao 158687 by uranus to study planet s atmosphere when their observations were analyzed they found that star disappeared briefly from view five times both before and after it was eclipsed by planet they deduced that a system of narrow rings was present five occultation events they observed were denoted by greek letters a b g d and e in their papers these designations have been used as rings names since then later they found four additional rings one between b and g rings and three inside a ring former was named e ring latter were dubbed rings 4 5 and 6 according to numbering of occultation events in one paper uranus s ring system was second to be discovered in solar system after that of saturn rings were directly imaged when voyager 2 spacecraft flew through uranian system in 1986 two more faint rings were revealed bringing total to eleven hubble space telescope detected an additional pair of previously unseen rings in 2003 2005 bringing total number known to 13 discovery of these outer rings doubled known radius of ring system hubble also imaged two small satellites for first time one of which mab shares its orbit with outermost newly discovered m ring general properties thumb uranus s inner rings bright outer ring is epsilon ring eight other rings are visible as currently understood ring system of uranus comprises thirteen distinct rings in order of increasing distance from planet they are 1986u2r z 6 5 4 a b e g d l e n m rings they can be divided into three groups nine narrow main rings 6 5 4 a b e g d e two dusty rings 1986u2r z l and two outer rings n m rings of uranus consist mainly of macroscopic particles and little dust although dust is known to be present in 1986u2r z e d l n and m rings in addition to these well known rings there may be numerous optically thin dust bands and faint rings between them these faint rings and dust bands may exist only temporarily or consist of a number of separate arcs which are sometimes detected during occultations some of them became visible during a series of ring plane crossing events in 2007 a number of dust bands between rings were observed in forward scattered light is light scattered at a small angle relative to solar light phase angle close to 180deg geometry by voyager 2 all rings of uranus show azimuthal brightness variations rings are made of an extremely dark material geometric albedo of ring particles does not exceed 5 6 while bond albedo is even lower about 2 rings particles demonstrate a steep opposition surge an increase of albedo when phase angle is close to zero this means that their albedo is much lower when they are observed slightly off opposition off opposition means that angle between object sun direction and object earth direction is not zero rings are slightly red in ultraviolet and visible parts of spectrum and grey in near infrared they exhibit no identifiable spectral features chemical composition of ring particles is not known they cannot be made of pure water ice like rings of saturn because they are too dark darker than inner moons of uranus this indicates that they are probably composed of a mixture of ice and a dark material nature of this material is not clear but it may be organic compounds considerably darkened by charged particle irradiation from uranian magnetosphere rings particles may consist of a heavily processed material which was initially similar to that of inner moons as a whole ring system of uranus is unlike either faint dusty rings of jupiter or broad and complex rings of saturn some of which are composed of very bright material water ice there are similarities with some parts of latter ring system saturnian f ring and uranian e ring are both narrow relatively dark and are shepherded by a pair of moons newly discovered outer n and m rings of uranus are similar to outer g and e rings of saturn narrow ringlets existing in broad saturnian rings also resemble narrow rings of uranus in addition dust bands observed between main rings of uranus may be similar to rings of jupiter in contrast neptunian ring system is quite similar to that of uranus although it is less complex darker and contains more dust neptunian rings are also positioned further from planet narrow main rings e ring thumb a close up view of e ring of uranus e ring is brightest and densest part of uranian ring system and is responsible for about two thirds of light reflected by rings while it is most eccentric of uranian rings it has negligible orbital inclination ring s eccentricity causes its brightness to vary over course of its orbit radially integrated brightness of e ring is highest near apoapsis and lowest near periapsis maximum minimum brightness ratio is about 2 5 3 0 these variations are connected with variations of ring width which is 19 7 km at periapsis and 96 4 km at apoapsis as ring becomes wider amount of shadowing between particles decreases and more of them come into view leading to higher integrated brightness width variations were measured directly from voyager 2 images as e ring was one of only two rings resolved by voyager s cameras such behavior indicates that ring is not optically thin indeed occultation observations conducted from ground and spacecraft showed that its normal optical depth varies between 0 5 and 2 5 being highest near periapsis equivalent depth of e ring is around 47 km and is invariant around orbit 250px left thumb a close up view of from top to bottom d g e b and a rings of uranus resolved e ring demonstrates optically thin broad component geometric thickness of e ring is not precisely known although ring is certainly very thin by some estimates as thin as 150 m despite such infinitesimal thickness it consists of several layers of particles e ring is a rather crowded place with a filling factor near apoapsis estimated by different sources at from 0 008 to 0 06 mean size of ring particles is 0 2 20 0 m and mean separation is around 4 5 times their radius ring is almost devoid of dust possibly due to aerodynamic drag from uranus s extended atmospheric corona due to its razor thin nature e ring is invisible when viewed edge on this happened in 2007 when a ring plane crossing was observed voyager 2 spacecraft observed a strange signal from e ring during radio occultation experiment signal looked like a strong enhancement of forward scattering at wavelength 3 6 cm near ring s apoapsis such strong scattering requires existence of a coherent structure that e ring does have such a fine structure has been confirmed by many occultation observations e ring seems to consist of a number of narrow and optically dense ringlets some of which may have incomplete arcs e ring is known to have interior and exterior shepherd moons cordelia and ophelia respectively inner edge of ring is in 24 25 resonance with cordelia and outer edge is in 14 13 resonance with ophelia masses of moons need to be at least three times mass of ring to confine it effectively mass of e ring is estimated to be about 1016 kg d ring upright thumb comparison of uranian rings in forward scattered and back scattered light images obtained by voyager 2 in 1986 d ring is circular and slightly inclined it shows significant unexplained azimuthal variations in normal optical depth and width one possible explanation is that ring has an azimuthal wave like structure excited by a small moonlet just inside it sharp outer edge of d ring is in 23 22 resonance with cordelia d ring consists of two components a narrow optically dense component and a broad inward shoulder with low optical depth width of narrow component is 4 1 6 1 km and equivalent depth is about 2 2 km which corresponds to a normal optical depth of about 0 3 0 6 ring s broad component is about 10 12 km wide and its equivalent depth is close to 0 3 km indicating a low normal optical depth of 3 x 10 2 this is known only from occultation data because voyager 2 s imaging experiment failed to resolve d ring when observed in forward scattering geometry by voyager 2 d ring appeared relatively bright which is compatible with presence of dust in its broad component broad component is geometrically thicker than narrow component this is supported by observations of a ring plane crossing event in 2007 when d ring remained visible which is consistent with behavior of a simultaneously geometrically thick and optically thin ring g ring g ring is narrow optically dense and slightly eccentric its orbital inclination is almost zero width of ring varies in range 3 6 4 7 km although equivalent optical depth is constant at 3 3 km normal optical depth of g ring is 0 7 0 9 during a ring plane crossing event in 2007 g ring disappeared which means it is geometrically thin like e ring and devoid of dust width and normal optical depth of g ring show significant azimuthal variations mechanism of confinement of such a narrow ring is not known but it has been noticed that sharp inner edge of g ring is in a 6 5 resonance with ophelia e ring e ring has zero orbital eccentricity and inclination like d ring it consists of two components a narrow optically dense component and a broad outward shoulder with low optical depth width of narrow component is 1 9 2 7 km and equivalent depth is about 0 42 km which corresponds to normal optical depth of about 0 16 0 25 broad component is about 40 km wide and its equivalent depth is close to 0 85 km indicating a low normal optical depth of 2 x 10 2 it was resolved in voyager 2 images in forward scattered light e ring looked bright which indicated presence of a considerable amount of dust in this ring probably in broad component broad component is much thicker geometrically than narrow one this conclusion is supported by observations of a ring plane crossing event in 2007 when e ring demonstrated increased brightness becoming second brightest feature in ring system this is consistent with behavior of a geometrically thick but simultaneously optically thin ring like majority of other rings e ring shows significant azimuthal variations in normal optical depth and width narrow component even vanishes in some places a and b rings after e ring a and b rings are brightest of uranus s rings like e ring they exhibit regular variations in brightness and width they are brightest and widest 30deg from apoapsis and dimmest and narrowest 30deg from periapsis a and b rings have sizable orbital eccentricity and non negligible inclination widths of these rings are 4 8 10 km and 6 1 11 4 km respectively equivalent optical depths are 3 29 km and 2 14 km resulting in normal optical depths of 0 3 0 7 and 0 2 0 35 respectively during a ring plane crossing event in 2007 rings disappeared which means they are geometrically thin like e ring and devoid of dust same event revealed a thick and optically thin dust band just outside b ring which was also observed earlier by voyager 2 masses of a and b rings are estimated to be about 5 kg each half mass of e ring rings 6 5 and 4 rings 6 5 and 4 are innermost and dimmest of uranus s narrow rings they are most inclined rings and their orbital eccentricities are largest excluding e ring in fact their inclinations 0 0 05deg and 0 were large enough for voyager 2 to observe their elevations above uranian equatorial plane which were 24 46 km rings 6 5 and 4 are also narrowest rings of uranus measuring 1 6 2 2 km 1 9 4 9 km and 2 4 4 4 km wide respectively their equivalent depths are 0 41 km 0 91 and 0 71 km resulting in normal optical depth 0 18 0 25 0 18 0 48 and 0 16 0 3 they were not visible during a ring plane crossing event in 2007 due to their narrowness and lack of dust dusty rings l ring thumb a long exposure high phase angle 172 5deg voyager 2 image of uranus s inner rings in forward scattered light dust bands not visible in other images can be seen as well as recognized rings l ring was one of two rings discovered by voyager 2 in 1986 it is a narrow faint ring located just inside e ring between it and shepherd moon cordelia this moon clears a dark lane just inside l ring when viewed in back scattered light back scattered light is light scattered at an angle close to 180deg relative to solar light phase angle close to 0deg l ring is extremely narrow about 1 2 km and has equivalent optical depth 0 1 0 2 km at wavelength 2 2 mm normal optical depth is 0 1 0 2 optical depth of l ring shows strong wavelength dependence which is atypical for uranian ring system equivalent depth is as high as 0 36 km in ultraviolet part of spectrum which explains why l ring was initially detected only in uv stellar occultations by voyager 2 detection during a stellar occultation at wavelength 2 2 mm was only announced in 1996 appearance of l ring changed dramatically when it was observed in forward scattered light in 1986 in this geometry ring became brightest feature of uranian ring system outshining e ring this observation together with wavelength dependence of optical depth indicates that l ring contains significant amount of micrometer sized dust normal optical depth of this dust is 10 4 10 3 observations in 2007 by keck telescope during ring plane crossing event confirmed this conclusion because l ring became one of brightest features in uranian ring system detailed analysis of voyager 2 images revealed azimuthal variations in brightness of l ring variations appear to be periodic resembling a standing wave origin of this fine structure in l ring remains a mystery 1986u2r z ring thumb discovery image of 1986u2r ring in 1986 voyager 2 detected a broad and faint sheet of material inward of ring 6 this ring was given temporary designation 1986u2r it had a normal optical depth of 10 3 or less and was extremely faint it was visible only in a single voyager 2 image ring was located between 37 000 and 39 500 km from centre of uranus or only about 12 000 km above clouds it was not observed again until 2003 2004 when keck telescope found a broad and faint sheet of material just inside ring 6 this ring was dubbed z ring position of recovered z ring differs significantly from that observed in 1986 now it is situated between 37 850 and 41 350 km from centre of planet there is an inward gradually fading extension reaching to at least 32 600 km or possibly even to 27 000 km to atmosphere of uranus these extensions are labelled as zc and rings respectively z ring was observed again during ring plane crossing event in 2007 when it became brightest feature of ring system outshining all other rings combined equivalent optical depth of this ring is near 1 km 0 6 km for inward extension while normal optical depth is again less than 10 3 rather different appearances of 1986u2r and z rings may be caused by different viewing geometries back scattering geometry in 2003 2007 and side scattering geometry in 1986 changes during past 20 years in distribution of dust which is thought to predominate in ring cannot be ruled out other dust bands in addition to 1986u2r z and l rings there are other extremely faint dust bands in uranian ring system they are invisible during occultations because they have negligible optical depth though they are bright in forward scattered light voyager 2 s images of forward scattered light revealed existence of bright dust bands between l and d rings between e and b rings and between a ring and ring 4 many of these bands were detected again in 2003 2004 by keck telescope and during 2007 ring plane crossing event in light but their precise locations and relative brightnesses were different from during voyager observations normal optical depth of dust bands is about 10 5 or less dust particle size distribution is thought to obey a power law with index p 2 5 0 5 in addition to separate dust bands system of uranian rings appears to be immersed into wide and faint sheet of dust with normal optical depth not exceeding 10 3 outer ring system thumb m and n rings of uranus r 2003 u1 and u2 in hubble space telescope images from 2005 in 2003 2005 hubble space telescope detected a pair of previously unknown rings now called outer ring system which brought number of known uranian rings to 13 these rings were subsequently named m and n rings m ring is outermost of pair and is twice distance from planet as bright e ring outer rings differ from inner narrow rings in a number of respects they are broad 17 000 and 3 800 km wide respectively and very faint their peak normal optical depths are 8 5 x 10 6 and 5 4 x 10 6 respectively resulting equivalent optical depths are 0 14 km and 0 012 km rings have triangular radial brightness profiles peak brightness of m ring lies almost exactly on orbit of small uranian moon mab which is probably source of ring s particles n ring is positioned between portia and rosalind and does not contain any moons inside it a reanalysis of voyager 2 images of forward scattered light clearly reveals m and n rings in this geometry rings are much brighter which indicates that they contain much micrometer sized dust outer rings of uranus may be similar to g and e rings of saturn as e ring is extremely broad and receives dust from enceladus m ring may consist entirely of dust without any large particles at all this hypothesis is supported by observations performed by keck telescope which failed to detect m ring in near infrared at 2 2 mm but detected n ring this failure means that m ring is blue in color which in turn indicates that very small dust predominates within it dust may be made of water ice in contrast n ring is slightly red in color dynamics and origin upright thumb an enhanced color schematic of inner rings derived from voyager 2 images an outstanding problem concerning physics governing narrow uranian rings is their confinement without some mechanism to hold their particles together rings would quickly spread out radially lifetime of uranian rings without such a mechanism cannot be more than 1 million years most widely cited model for such confinement proposed initially by and tremaine is that a pair of nearby moons outer and inner shepherds interact gravitationally with a ring and act like sinks and donors respectively for excessive and insufficient angular momentum or equivalently energy shepherds thus keep ring particles in place but gradually move away from ring themselves to be effective masses of shepherds should exceed mass of ring by at least a factor of two to three this mechanism is known to be at work in case of e ring where cordelia and ophelia serve as shepherds cordelia is also outer shepherd of d ring and ophelia is outer shepherd of g ring no moon larger than 10 km is known in vicinity of other rings current distance of cordelia and ophelia from e ring can be used to estimate ring s age calculations show that e ring cannot be older than 600 million years since rings of uranus appear to be young they must be continuously renewed by collisional fragmentation of larger bodies estimates show that lifetime against collisional disruption of a moon with size like that of puck is a few billion years lifetime of a smaller satellite is much shorter therefore all current inner moons and rings can be products of disruption of several puck sized satellites during last four and half billion years every such disruption would have started a collisional cascade that quickly ground almost all large bodies into much smaller particles including dust eventually majority of mass was lost and particles survived only in positions that were stabilized by mutual resonances and shepherding end product of such a disruptive evolution would be a system of narrow rings a few moonlets must still be embedded within rings at present maximum size of such moonlets is probably around 10 km origin of dust bands is less problematic dust has a very short lifetime 100 1000 years and should be continuously replenished by collisions between larger ring particles moonlets and meteoroids from outside uranian system belts of parent moonlets and particles are themselves invisible due to their low optical depth while dust reveals itself in forward scattered light narrow main rings and moonlet belts that create dust bands are expected to differ in particle size distribution main rings have more centimeter to meter sized bodies such a distribution increases surface area of material in rings leading to high optical density in back scattered light in contrast dust bands have relatively few large particles which results in low optical depth exploration rings were thoroughly investigated by voyager 2 spacecraft in january 1986 two new faint rings l and 1986u2r were discovered bringing total number then known to eleven rings were studied by analyzing results of radio ultraviolet and optical occultations voyager 2 observed rings in different geometries relative to sun producing images with back scattered forward scattered and side scattered light analysis of these images allowed derivation of complete phase function geometrical and bond albedo of ring particles two rings e and e were resolved in images revealing a complicated fine structure analysis of voyager s images also led to discovery of eleven inner moons of uranus including two shepherd moons of e ring cordelia and ophelia list of properties this table summarizes properties of planetary ring system
