severe tropical storm kammuri known in philippines as tropical storm lagalag killed hundreds of people in wake of a deadly flood season in china system developed from a large monsoonal system that persisted toward end of july 2002 near philippines on august 2 a tropical depression formed off northwest coast of luzon and moved west northwestward late on august 3 it intensified into tropical storm kammuri off coast of hong kong a weakening ridge turned storm northward toward coast of china storm made landfall with late on august 4 after reaching peak winds of 100 km h 65 mph system dissipated over mountainous coastline of eastern china and merged with a cold front on august 7 high rainfall from kammuri affected large portions of china particularly in guangdong province where it moved ashore in that province over 100 000 people had to evacuate due to flooding and after 6 810 houses were destroyed floods damaged roads railroads and tunnels and left power and water outages across region rainfall was beneficial in alleviating drought conditions in guangdong although further inland rains occurred after months of deadly flooding in hunan province storm s remnants merged with a cold front destroying 12 400 houses across its path floods damaged or destroyed 245 000 houses and destroyed of crop fields kammuri caused 153 deaths most of which were related to remnants and damage was estimated at 509 million y 4 219 billion yuan meteorological history origins of kammuri are uncertain they were possibly related to monsoon trough that moved across philippines toward guam in late july a large area of convection persisted in philippine sea organizing enough for philippine atmospheric geophysical and astronomical services administration pagasa to initiate advisories on tropical depression lagalag on august 1 around that time system had several weak circulations one of which persisted in south china sea this center was located east of an area of thunderstorms due to moderate wind shear early on august 2 japan meteorological agency jma classified system as a tropical depression to north of luzon shortly thereafter joint typhoon warning center jtwc followed suit by initiating advisories on tropical depression and hong kong observatory hko followed suit early on august 3 initially it moved generally to west northwest owing to a mid level ridge over eastern china convection became more concentrated and jma upgraded depression to tropical storm kammuri late on august 3 to south of hong kong an upper level low connected to a trough weakened ridge over china allowing kammuri to move slowly northward continued wind shear initially prevented thunderstorms from being located over center although shear gradually decreased allowing convection to organize kammuri quickly intensified into a severe tropical storm jma estimated peak 10 minute sustained winds of 100 km h 65 mph at 1800 utc on august 4 jtwc estimated storm was weaker with 1 minute winds of 95 km h 60 mph at around 2300 utc on august 4 kammuri made landfall east of hong kong in guangdong province just east of shanwei an approaching mid latitude storm caused it to accelerate over land kammuri quickly weakened to a tropical depression and jtwc discontinued advisories at 1200 utc on august 5 jma continued tracking system until kammuri dissipated on august 7 over central china remnants were absorbed by a cold front preparations impact and aftermath thumb right tropical storm kammuri intensifying in south china sea on august 4 on august 3 when kammuri was located about southeast of hong kong hko issued standby signal no 1 first such signal for a storm that season by that time outer rainbands had begun affecting region kammuri dropped heavy rainfall in hong kong that reached in town of kwai chung most of which fell after storm passed region rains caused one landslide and damaged one road wind gusts in city reached and sustained winds of were reported on waglan island there a storm surge of was also reported in nearby macau outer rainbands delayed airplane flights and there was some flooding in guangdong province where kammuri made landfall rainfall peaked at in and several other stations reported totals of over rains caused flash flooding in province which destroyed 6 810 houses leaving thousands homeless at guangzhou baiyun international airport officials delayed or canceled 56 flights because of storm similarly shantou airport was closed for four hours which delayed or canceled 10 flights heavy damage was reported in three coastal cities two small electrical dams were destroyed by storm causing additional flooding widespread areas lost power or water and floods damaged or destroyed roads tunnels and large areas of crop lands storm killed two people by electrocution in shantou and a landslide killed 10 people in county another landslide disrupted rail traffic between region and beijing about 100 000 people had to evacuate their houses in two cities there were 27 deaths in province and damage was estimated at 109 million y 904 million yuan after storm provincial officials coordinated rescue effort for missing people despite destruction rainfall from kammuri helped alleviate drought conditions in province however elsewhere in china rainfall occurred after months of heavy rainfall had killed 800 people neighboring fujian province to guangdong experienced heavier rainfall peaking at in quanzhou two stations in city reported highest daily total on record in a six hour period a total of was recorded in county wind gusts reached 79 km h 49 mph in putian fujian province experienced river flooding due to heavy rains stream crested at in yongtai county which was above danger flood levels damage in province totaled 131 million y 1 085 billion yuan there were 19 deaths in fujian significant flooding from kammuri occurred inland related to storm s remnants merging with a cold front rainfall reached at a station in jiangxi province in hunan province storms destroyed 12 400 houses leaving over 10 000 people homeless also in province 14 reservoirs surpassed their capacity a total of 107 people were killed in hunan and damage totaled 322 million y 2 665 billion yuan across guangdong fujian and hunan provinces floods forced 394 000 people to evacuate and there were 153 deaths overall 72 000 houses were destroyed and 173 000 sustained damage in three provinces floods destroyed and damaged of crop fields after storm thousands of soldiers in people s liberation army placed sandbags and maintained dykes along dongting lake and by end of august most floods had receded nationwide while kammuri was moving ashore several ships offshore reported winds of over 74 km h 40 mph high rainfall totals spread as far east as taiwan where was reported in taitung county this was station s highest daily total stations in okinawa reported rainfall totals as high as remnants of kammuri spread across south korea with
