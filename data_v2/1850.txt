for publishing company simon schuster prior to his first television job on dawson s creek thomas sold two novel ideas one of these was provisionally titled untitled rob thomas teen detective novel which formed basis for series novel had many elements similar to veronica mars however protagonist was male thomas s father was a vice principal at westlake high school in austin texas and main character attended a thinly disguised version of school as thomas had begun writing for film and television he did not resume his teen detective idea for several years writing a novel could take months for thomas whereas a television script only took several weeks knowing that television scripts paid more thomas wrote television version of teen detective project as a spec script before it became a novel since no studio or network had asked him to write it and he would not get paid unless it sold thomas said that it was never a very pressing project for me tinkering with it from time to time thomas wrote project notes a year before he actually started writing television script most of his original ideas made it into script but some changed drastically thomas wanted to use flashbacks and he had to shorten timeline so that murder could happen in a recent time thomas changed gender of protagonist because he thought a noir piece told from a female point of view would be more interesting and unique casting thumb teddy dunn who portrayed duncan kane originally auditioned for role of logan echolls kristen bell was chosen to portray veronica mars from more than 500 women who auditioned for role on casting lead role thomas later commented when you re casting 20 year old hot girl you see a lot of bad actors bell felt that it was just luck that rob thomas saw that i have some sass to me and that s exactly what he wanted bell thought that it was her cheerleader looks and an outsider s attitude that set her apart from other women who auditioned bell s life shared many similarities with that of her character her father had an investigative bent and her best friend died in high school in a car crash jason dohring who played logan echolls originally auditioned for role of duncan kane teddy dunn originally auditioned for logan but ended up portraying duncan kane dohring felt that his audition for duncan was a little dark and he was told by producers that it was not really right producers asked dohring to read for role of logan which involved reading duncan s lines dohring acted one scene from pilot in which he shattered headlights of a car with a crowbar during final auditions dohring read two times with bell and met with studio and network when reading with bell dohring acted whole scene as if he had raped her and tried to give character an evil and fun feel at time of dohring s audition for logan character was only going to be a guest star in pilot percy daggs iii auditioned for role of wallace fennel twice before being cast and he had to go through three tests with studio and network executives during his first audition daggs read four scenes from pilot before his studio test daggs read with bell and had a great conversation he said that she made me feel comfortable about auditioning and was a big reason why he became more comfortable playing wallace as season went on thomas described amanda seyfried who portrayed murdered lilly kane as biggest surprise of year when casting a series regular he was able to see all best actors in town mainly because they all wanted to be a series regular when casting lilly who would only appear from time to time as dead girl thomas did not receive same level of actors thomas said that he had never had a more cut and dry audition than he did with seyfried she was about 100 times better than anyone else that we saw she was just spectacular he said that she ended up being so good in series that he used her three or four times more than he initially planned filming original pilot script was darker in tone than one filmed thomas intended to take script to fx hbo or showtime but gave upn credit as they only wanted it a bit lighter to match their standards and practices there was also a lengthy debate as to whether veronica could be a rape victim upn eventually consented in aired version of episode lilly kane was found by pool in same spot where she was murdered however thomas stated that lilly s body was originally going to be found in ocean and he had a plan for events which led to lilly s body being dumped when thomas pitched idea to upn network felt that it was too dark and creepy for jake kane to dispose of his daughter s body to protect his son and idea was changed much of series scenes were filmed at stu segall productions in san diego during filming of pilot producer paul kurta said that much of filming would take place in oceanside california kurta liked that it was a seaside town that still feels like middle class people live there most of seaside towns feel resort driven setting of neptune high which was featured in first two seasons was also located in oceanside school oceanside high school was paid 7 750 by stu segall productions for use of campus and extras when thomas watched final cut of scene in which veronica realizes that she has been raped thomas thought that he had cast role correctly i m watching her from monitor and tears start streaming down her face and i m just like holy shit we have a star music we used to be friends by dandy warhols was used as series theme song composer josh kramon was originally going to produce a noir version of an 80s song for theme however rob thomas was pretty much set on finding a song and we used to be friends was chosen right from beginning kramon wrote original background music to convey film noir themes for pilot thomas wanted a really atmospheric kind of modern noir type of vibe and kramon used sounds similar to that of air and zero 7 kramon used traditional sounds for series but also processed and filtered them among instruments used were piano vibraphone and guitar when using an acoustic piano kramon would use compression so that it did not sound like a traditional piano live bass and percussion was also used as kramon did not like to program them main instrument used was guitar but kramon felt that piano was by far most important instrument for working on tv shows especially when you re doing everything yourself a week before choosing sounds for pilot crew had a spotting session where they would discuss with thomas and producers which type of music was going to be featured kramon did not decide songs to be featured but composed and created whole score since there was little orchestral music and kramon could play guitar piano bass and drums he played whole score without hiring a musician other songs heard in this episode la femme d argent by air what you want by insincere because i by dandy warhols sittin on top of world by botany boyz just another by pete yorn white

million american viewers on its original broadcast ranking 108 out of 112 in weekly charts debra and amy amatangelo of washington post praised pilot for relying on strong storytelling and casting but hoped that viewers would be able to follow multiple storylines barry garron of hollywood reporter said that pilot was so cleverly constructed hero so engaging and complicated and story so filled with great dialogue that i wonder how anyone can sustain this level of accomplishment he said that protagonist has all sass strength resolve and ingenuity of any of literature s classic detectives and bell is so convincing in role that it all somehow makes perfect sense he praised pilot and thomas writing saying it had comedy deathly serious drama parody and danger ingredients not typically mixed together and said that if future episodes are half as good this still will be one of tv s bright spots kay mcfadden of seattle times felt that veronica mars was best new series on upn and that title character was potentially this season s most interesting character creation mcfadden described series as alias in its attitude raymond chandler in its writing and o c in its class consciousness phil gallo of variety called veronica mars smartest teen oriented drama since freaks and geeks he enjoyed bell s acting describing her as charismatic as she is tough and intelligent giving a multilayered perf that touches on simple 17 year old insecurity and convincingly incorporates deeper issues concerning family love and disappointment gallo discussed pilot s reliance on flashbacks and voiceover and felt that neither got in way of storytelling or felt too obvious he praised thomas writing of fine script and piznarski s directing robert bianco of usa today felt that veronica mars was more akin to buffy summers than nancy drew with sharp wits steely nerves and a wicked sense of humor bianco praised bell s portrayal of character saying whether you buy idea of teen crime solvers or not there s no questioning bell s credentials as a tv star melanie mcfarland of seattle post intelligencer said that pilot was showing signs of being network television s next buffy emanating from a tough emotionally battered heroine mcfarland found acting to be fantastic and said that bell and colantoni create a wonderful father daughter dynamic samantha bonar of los angeles times thought that writing was clever and praised bell ability to channel charisma smarts and frustration ign rated pilot episode 10th on its list of top ten veronica mars episodes writing that smooth introduction to all things veronica makes you care for her instantly anyone wrestling with creating a female character who is multifaceted and real needs only to study veronica we see many different sides and there isn t any stereotyping they sell her tough exterior so well that even though veronica has been through a pile of crap you don t pity her which is good because she doesn t want it anyway references external
