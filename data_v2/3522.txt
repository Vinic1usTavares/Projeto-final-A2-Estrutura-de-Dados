being tall pomerantz 2005 pp 20 36 7 57 there was little advance excitement about pending warriors knicks game that friday only five games remained in regular season with warriors 46 29 in second

he boarded train to philadelphia at 8am met several friends at philadelphia train station and had a long lunch with them thus almost missing team bus to hershey other players were similarly bored warriors player york larese said biggest thrill in my life was to see that there was nothing exciting about knicks playing warriors in hershey chocolate was more exciting game was played at hershey

spectators paid to see game primarily to see players from philadelphia eagles play an exhibition basketball game against their colleagues from baltimore colts before nba game started arena s capacity

jordon s illness was officially reported as influenza but it was widely suspected he was simply hung over jordon in an early season game had played chamberlain even scoring 33 points to warriors center s 34 pomerantz 2005 p 142 knicks instead started second year player darrall imhoff a strong defensive player in college who led california golden bears to ncaa championship in 1959 and won a gold medal in 1960 summer olympics pomerantz 2005 pp xiii 102 106 new york also had backup center cleveland buckner a better shooter than a defender who chamberlain overpowered for an nba record 28 points in one quarter two days earlier pomerantz 2005 pp xiii 56 7 111 game report first three quarters according to mcguire game did not start with any game plan to get chamberlain 100 points pluto 2000 p 220 after a few minutes warriors led 19 3 and their star center had already scored 13 points and made his first five shots pomerantz 2005 p 37 at end of first quarter knicks trailed 42 26 and in his typical style chamberlain had already scored 23 points making all nine of his free throws pomerantz 2005 p 40 free throws were weakest part of his game making barely more than half in his first seasons he had started shooting free throws underhanded that season per mcguire s suggestion pomerantz 2005 pp 62 81 chamberlain at that point was thinking more about a free throw shooting record than scoring a lot of points nba record was 24 free throws made in a game imhoff was soon benched because of foul trouble charlotte observer elder jeff january 18 2007 page 1e truth about wilt scoring 100 points retrieved on april 14 2007 after one foul he snapped at referee well why don t you just give guy a hundred now and we ll all go home pomerantz 2005 p 38 neither referee had ever been a lead official before and imhoff privately wished a stronger lead was working game pomerantz 2005 pp 37 8 by halftime warriors had lost some of their edge but still led 79 68 chamberlain s point total stood at 41 warriors felt little excitement as he had scored 60 or more points on 15 previous occasions i often came into locker room with 30 or 35 points therefore 41 points was not a big deal chamberlain later explained during halftime warriors guy rodgers said let s get ball to dip let s see how many he can get pomerantz 2005 p 96 mcguire agreed this simple tactic proved unstoppable soon he had surpassed 50 point barrier causing arena speaker dave zinkoff to fire up previously sleepy crowd chamberlain also kept his cool despite getting perpetually triple and quadruple teamed by knicks who did not shy away from hard fouls to distract center mcguire was irate and demanded that referees call more fouls but chamberlain could not be stopped cherry 2004 pp 109 115 he scored another 28 points to lift his warriors to a commanding 125 106 lead by end of third quarter his own total stood at 69 nine shy of his previous scoring record knicks third center dave budd who alternated with foul troubled imhoff at pivot later stated that resistance was futile you couldn t play chamberlain conventionally because he was so big only thing you could attempt to do was either front him and in that case they d try to lob it in to him or beat him down floor and set up where he wanted to get and force him out a couple of extra steps guy weighed 300 or 270 pounds so that wasn t easy either chamberlain now realized he could break his own 73 point scoring record for a regulation 48 minute game or his record 78 points set in triple overtime breaking records dave zinkoff public address announcer began announcing chamberlain s point total after each of his baskets with ten minutes to play in game warriors forward tom meschery sensed team concept breaking down team s offense had shifted to getting chamberlain ball and then stopping and watching instead of cutting and moving without ball pomerantz 2005 pp 147 168 chamberlain needed 25 points with eight minutes remaining to reach 100 a rate equivalent to 150 points in a full game pomerantz 2005 p 153 he scored his 79th point with 7 51 left breaking his own record and sending crowd into a frenzy 4 124 spectators screamed give it to wilt give it to wilt after he reached 80 crowd yelled for 100 chamberlain thought man these people are tough i m tired i ve got 80 points and no one has ever scored 80 warriors continued giving chamberlain ball warrior al attles later explained we wanted that wilt got record because we all liked him attles himself led by example passing up on an easy layup so that chamberlain could score points 88 and 89 five minutes before end with six minutes remaining knicks began intentionally fouling any warrior except chamberlain keeping ball out of center s hands pomerantz 2005 p 2004 p 111 new york also began moving ball slowly and using as much of shot clock as possible to leave fewer opportunities for chamberlain to score pomerantz 2005 p 167 effectively they played opposite of what a normal club would do if they faced a deficit willingly giving up many easy points instead of making attempts to rally back meschery said warriors lobbed ball in from sideline across floor directly to chamberlain who would use his size and strength to get ball pluto 2000 p 221 chamberlain was only warrior to make a field goal in almost four minutes before meschery made a jump shot at 4 15 pomerantz 2005 p 168 philadelphia began quickly fouling new york with around four minutes left reciprocating intentional foul strategy pomerantz 2005 pp 169 172 warriors coach frank mcguire at one point pulled out his entire starting five save chamberlain and replaced them with bench players starters meschery attles rodgers and arizin were replaced by reserves ruklick larese ed conlin and ted luckenbill intention was to foul knicks get ball back after free throws and give chamberlain ball thus each team spent last minutes fouling each other warriors ended with 25 personal fouls and knicks with 32 and lost imhoff and willie naulls with six fouls with 2 12 left chamberlain had 94 points and he scored on a fadeaway for his 96th point his next basket at 1 19 came off a lob pass from york larese for a powerful dunk that was rare for chamberlain gary m pomerantz in his book wilt 1962 night of 100 points and dawn of a new era wrote that chamberlain s usual dipper dunk was a considerably less emphatic basket stuff like a rock that barely ripples pond pomerantz 2005 p 173 with less than a minute left in game chamberlain set up in post ruklick passed to rodgers who passed to chamberlain close to basket but he missed shot ted luckenbill rebounded and passed it back to chamberlain who missed again luckenbill again rebounded and this time passed to ruklick who eschewed an easy layup and instead lobbed a high pass to chamberlain with 46 seconds left chamberlain got free from five knicks jumped high and put ball into basket to hit century mark eyewitness accounts of historic basket differ as to whether chamberlain merely laid ball in february 1 2006 remembering 100 nba com or actually stuffed ball through hoop for an alley oop slam dunk in any event arena exploded in a frenzy and over 200 spectators stormed floor wanting to touch hero of night ruklick immediately ran to scorer s table to ensure that he was officially credited with assist finale for years belief was that final 46 seconds of game were not played after chamberlain scored his 100th point due to celebration on court cherry 2004 p scott march 2 1987 100 astonishing points 25 years ago today wilt

standard practice in those days however a philadelphian had recorded with a dictaphone part of campbell s coverage in fourth quarter but only warriors possessions two years later a reel to reel tape of campbell s entire fourth quarter call surfaced jim trelease then a college student at university of massachusetts had recorded a 3am re broadcast of fourth quarter of game nba merged reel to reel with dictaphone tape which also included a short postgame show pomerantz 2005 p 203 german sports journalist gunter bork specified that interruption resulting from chamberlain s 100th point lasted for nine minutes after which play continued over years harvey pollack who at time was in charge of publicity and statistics for warriors has given conflicting statements on question in a 1992 book he was twice quoted as saying that game ended with 46 seconds remaining but in a 2002 interview quoted by chamberlain biographer robert cherry pollack said that last 46 seconds were played and that chamberlain just stood in middle circle waiting for game to end and not wanting to touch ball as 100 sounded better than 102 maaddi rob march 2 2002 wilt s 100 point game brings back memories associated press game s official box score notes that warrior joe ruklick missed two free throws after break ruklick said he planned to miss second free throw in hopes that chamberlain might rebound it and get 102 points pomerantz 2005 pp 179 80 radio postgame show reported warriors defeating knicks 169 150 however official scorer s report recorded game as 169 147 a discrepancy that has never been explained pomerantz 2005 p 180 chamberlain made 36 of 63 field goals and 28 of 32 free throws latter a far better rate than his roughly 50 career average in two earlier games at hershey that season chamberlain had made a combined 27 of 38 free throws 71 percent basket rims at arena were aged flimsy and forgiving balls would bounce off of typical firm rims whereas balls near rim in hershey were apt to get a good roll and fall in pomerantz 2005 p 116 7 playing all 48 minutes of game chamberlain set nba records for field goals attempted 63 and made 36 free throws made 28 most points in a quarter 31 and half 59 he averaged 73 points in four games that week exceeding 60 in all of them pomerantz 2005 p 195 rodgers finished with a game high 20 assists and later said it was easiest game ever for me to get assists all i had to do was pass it to wilt attles was a defensive specialist who rarely scored yet went 8 8 from field and hit his single free throw he later lamented in game where i literally couldn t miss wilt had to go out and score 100 warriors and knicks combined for a record 316 points philadelphia fell short of boston celtics then record of 173 points in a game cherry 2004 pp 112 3 it was not uncommon for late season nba games to feature little defense celtics guard bob cousy said that level of play in nba decreased as season progressed and defenses are out of gas by end of season pomerantz 2005 p 112 following night chamberlain got permission to travel back to new york with three knicks players according to cherry chamberlain drifted in and out of sleep and got a kick overhearing new york players talk about s o b who scored 100 points on us on march 4 warriors played knicks again in madison square garden and imhoff got a standing ovation for holding chamberlain to 58 points aftermath record was not highly anticipated like four minute mile had been pomerantz 2005 p 193 in philadelphia there was little fanfare in philadelphia inquirer or philadelphia bulletin which both had a box on front page announcing achievement with a story in sports section philadelphia daily news had no mention on its cover bulletin wrote thus was fulfilled a

feat on sunday pomerantz 2005 p 187 new york daily news on sunday wrote basketball is not prospering because most normal sized american youngsters or adults cannot identify themselves with freakish stars you just can t sell a seven foot basket stuffing monster to even most gullible adolescent pomerantz 2005 p 188 in his prime chamberlain was such a dominant scorer that his feat was mostly taken for granted warriors player al attles said that after chamberlain s previous record 78 point game it was only a matter of time until he reached 100 you could wait for it warriors coach frank mcguire initially thought same thing then said i always thought it was inevitable that he would do it but when he did i stopped and thought about it i couldn t believe it chamberlain thanked his teammates it wouldn t even have been close to possible without them they wanted me to get it as much i did pomerantz 2005 p 182 he added they had to do more than just give up open shots they had to avoid fouls and pass me ball in traffic knicks player richie guerin felt warriors broke a code of honor in sports by embarrassing an opponent and setting a record outside normal flow of game pomerantz 2005 p 150 although effusive in his praise of chamberlain guerin nonetheless estimated that if game had played out normally chamberlain would have finished 15 to 20 points shy of 100 chamberlain countered he could have scored 140 if knicks had played straight up basketball new york coach eddie donovan suggested game was a farce they would foul us and we would foul them knicks naulls stated game was not a fluke i thought it was absolutely authentic imhoff said zinkoff s announcements did not help knicks cause johnny kerr of syracuse nationals marveled how about this he s world s worst free throw shooter and he s 28 out of 32 cousy figured game must have gone out of control just as when cousy had 29 assists when celtics scored 173 points against minneapolis boston coach red auerbach laughed he s playing against nobody bill russell smiled and said big fella finally did it pomerantz 2005 p 189 in a conversation with naulls after game chamberlain predicted he would win his nba championships but still be known for his individualism versus russell who was credited for making his team boston celtics great pomerantz 2005 p 186 two days after historic feat chamberlain made a guest appearance on ed sullivan show chamberlain finished season with a record of 50 4 points per game he scored a record 4 029 points more than division winning warriors in 1947 48 scored as a team he played in a record 3 882 minutes including every minute of 79 a record of 80 games cherry 2004 pp 106 117 he averaged 48 5 minutes per game an nba game is 48 minutes but chamberlain played in 10 overtime periods in seven games he was second in league in field goal percentage at 506 and made 61 percent of his free throws a career high pomerantz 2005 p 81 warriors finished season with a 49 31 record they lost in conference finals of playoffs to celtics losing seventh game 109 107 pomerantz 2005 p 201 closest chamberlain came again to 100 was 73 and 72 points next season when he also averaged 44 8 points nba in 1964 widened lane from to to limit chamberlain and he averaged 36 9 that season legacy thumb chamberlain 13 predicted comparisons to bill russell left anniversary of game was not widely commemorated until its silver anniversary in 1987 by that time nba had grown to be a popular sports league with average attendance of 13 000 fans per game and star players such as magic johnson larry bird and michael jordan pomerantz 2005 pp 193 4 warriors pr director harvey pollack said an impossible 40 000 people claimed to have seen game and some even testified it took place in madison square garden chamberlain later stated it was one of his favorite games but not favorite that title belonged to match in which he grabbed an nba record 55 rebounds against perennial rival bill russell he did not want to feed criticism that he was more interested in personal stardom than winning pomerantz 2005 p 199 although chamberlain won two nba championships and was nba s all time leading scorer and rebounder when he retired he was mostly remembered as man who had single handedly scored 100 points in a game chamberlain publicly embraced 100 point game in his final years on a radio show commemorating game s 31st anniversary in 1993 he said as time goes by i feel more a part of that 100 point game pomerantz 2005 p 196 he explained that growing up on streets he would have been derisively labelled a gunner a glory hound for attempting 63 shots pomerantz 2005 pp 159 182 196 you take that many shots on playground and no one ever wants you on their team again pluto 2000 p 223 he said he took shots he normally would not noting that in contests which he considered to be better he scored 50 to 60 points on around 75 percent shooting as opposed to his 57 percent shooting in 100 point game he was proud that people who knew nothing about basketball would point out game to their kids when they saw him i know that it has been my tag i am definitely proud of it but it was definitely a team effort you had to see some of things my teammates did to get me ball it was almost like a circus out there for a while two other participants were profoundly affected firstly knicks center darrall imhoff was branded as player who let chamberlain score 100 on him although he only played 20 of 48 minutes and was not on court when it happened pluto 2000 p 222 on other hand game immortalized little used warriors reserve player joe ruklick as man who gave chamberlain 100 point assist decades later new york times interviewed ruklick and found out that he refers to himself as a walking footnote of one of basketball s greatest moments game also produced famous picture of chamberlain sitting on a bench holding up a paper with a scribbled 100 photograph was actually a matter of improvisation when warriors pr manager harvey pollack entered warriors locker room he took a paper and scribbled number on it and associated press photographer paul who was there at game not for professional reasons but rather because he wanted to give his son a treat took now famous photo cherry calls it ultimate picture of wilt chamberlain chamberlain s 100 points is widely considered one of basketball s greatest records decades after his record many nba teams did not even average 100 points as fewer field goals per game were being attempted closest any player has gotten to 100 points was los angeles lakers kobe bryant who scored 81 in a 122 104 win over toronto raptors on january 22 2006 whereas chamberlain was fed repeatedly by teammates for inside shots in a blowout win bryant created his own shot mostly from outside in a game which lakers trailed at halftime by 14 and did not pull away until fourth quarter chamberlain playing in an era when games were paced faster and scoring opportunities were more plentiful accounted for 59 percent of his team s points compared to bryant scoring 66 percent of lakers 122 points bryant afterwards said chamberlain s record was unthinkable it s pretty exhausting to think about it david thompson broke chamberlain s record for points in a quarter by scoring 32 in first quarter of his 73 point game george gervin broke that record seven hours later by scoring 33 points in a quarter carmelo anthony later tied gervin s record current record of 37 is held by klay thompson adrian tied record of 28 free throws made in a regular season game on january 4 1984 but through 2010 11 season all of chamberlain s other records set that day still stand twenty years after warriors and knicks combined for 316 points san antonio spurs defeated milwaukee bucks 171 166 in triple overtime on march 6 1982 for a total of 337 points that record was broken more quickly as detroit pistons defeated denver nuggets 186 184 also in triple overtime on december 13 1983 for 370 points this date in history nba com retrieved on january 6 2012 pomerantz wrote in his 2005 book that lack of videotape of 100 point game only added to its mystique pomerantz 2005 p 194 for a while nba commissioner david stern s office phone would play campbell s call of 100 point basket to callers on hold he made it he made it he made it a dipper dunk kerry ryman who was 14 years old when he attended game claimed to have left arena with basketball that chamberlain used to score his famous basket ball was auctioned by leland s auction in 2000 for
