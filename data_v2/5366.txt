utility of force art of war in modern world is a treatise on modern warfare written by general sir rupert smith and published in 2005 smith is a retired general who spent 40 years in british army he commanded 1st armoured division in first gulf war and served as general officer commanding northern ireland at end of troubles he was motivated to write book by his experiences in balkans he commanded united nations protection force unprofor in bosnia from 1995 to 1996 during which time srebrenica massacre occurred and capital sarajevo was under siege by serb forces smith was instrumental in lifting of siege by arranging for nato air strikes and an artillery barrage this enabled a ground assault by bosnian and croatian forces that ended siege and led to dayton agreement smith s second involvement with balkans was in 1999 during kosovo war when he was serving as nato s deputy supreme allied commander europe overseeing air strikes against serb targets smith s thesis and central theme of utility of force is that world entered a new paradigm of conflict at end of 20th and beginning of 21st centuries which he calls war amongst people and that western industrialised armies are ill suited to new style of warfare defining characteristics of war amongst people are that conflicts tend to be timeless more political in nature and fought between parties that are part of and in amongst civilian population rather than between uniformed armies on a battlefield to prove his theory smith provides a detailed history starting with napoleon who invented what smith calls industrial warfare paradigm in which entire resources of nation were mustered and which culminated in two world wars in second half of book smith states that advent of nuclear weapons rendered industrial warfare obsolete but that western governments and generals refused to acknowledge new paradigm which led to several significant defeats in second half of 20th century he provides six themes which characterise modern conflicts and proceeds to analyse each in detail before dedicating his final chapter to his reflections on his command in bosnia he concedes that he did not foresee srebenica massacre but criticises unprofor believing that it was not in a position to act even had massacre been foreseen and that it had no strategy for effectively intervening in war in his conclusion smith argues that military force is only part of solution in modern conflicts and that it must be combined with political initiatives which together will subdue but not necessarily end conflict utility of force was broadly praised by reviewers on both sides of atlantic it was compared favourably with carl von clausewitz s treatise on war and american reviewers felt that it contained important lessons for united states military smith was criticised for over emphasising paradigm shift with several reviewers observing that conventional wars are still fought and that threat of such wars still exists and for drawing too clear a distinction between war amongst people and conventional war gal perl finkel how to win a modern war jerusalem post september 07 2016 particularly with his opening sentence war no longer exists reviewers also felt that smith under emphasised extent to which war amongst people has always existed nonetheless reviewers praised smith s analysis of modern war and recommended that utility of force ought to be read by politicians and military officers background general sir rupert smith is a retired career military officer who served in british army for 40 years at height of his career smith held several significant commands in both conventional conflicts and wars amongst people as a major general he commanded 1st armoured division during first gulf war 1990 91 he went on to serve as assistant chief of defence staff for operations and security from 1992 to 1995 during which time he came to conclusion that military force could only achieve one of four things when used to intervene in a political conflict ameliorate contain deter or coerce and destroy smith s decision to write utility of force was prompted by his experience in balkans in late january 1995 smith was appointed to command united nations protection force unprofor sent to intervene in bosnian war smith was based in bosnian capital sarajevo where he devised a strategy for multi national un force that had been deployed effectively to carry out mainly humanitarian tasks but without a plan to bring war to a successful conclusion at time of smith s deployment sarajevo was in middle of a siege which smith was instrumental in lifting after arranging for nato air strikes and an artillery barrage against serb forces commanded by ratko mladic a ground campaign by bosnian and croatian forces eventually led to dayton agreement which brought war to an end it was also during smith s command of unprofor that srebrenica massacre recognised by international criminal tribunal for former yugoslavia as an act of genocide took place historian niall ferguson was adamant that smith bore no responsibility for events at srebrenica and was indeed one of few british officials to emerge with distinction from intervention in bosnia nonetheless ferguson believed that experience illuminates smith s theoretical writings after unprofor smith served as general officer commanding northern ireland from 1996 to 1998 towards conclusion of troubles in 1999 during kosovo war smith was nato s deputy supreme allied commander europe nato commenced air strikes against serb forces led by slobodan milosevic again lacking defined objectives while smith worked to incorporate bombing raids into an overall strategy narrative industrial war book opens with statement that war no longer exists that is war as battle in a field between men and machinery or a massive deciding event in a dispute in international affairs is unlikely to happen again premise of book is that world is experiencing a new paradigm of war in late 20th and early 21st centuries which smith dubs war amongst people in which nebulous open ended conflicts have become norm smith believes that western industrialised armies struggle to win in wars amongst people because their opponents are not uniformed armies he uses term to describe terrorist and guerrilla movements he states his belief that such fighters can adapt much more easily than state institutions and that they exhibit a greater understanding of utility of force rather than being part of a recognisable army fighters are part of civilian population and their objectives are more political than military they seek to win hearts and minds rather than take or hold territory as a consequence wars are no longer confined to a battlefield but theatre of operations is fluid and commanders now operate inside theatre to prove his theory smith provides a detailed history of modern warfare using examples from history to illustrate his contentions throughout book smith analyses use of force in each of examples and how it was used to achieve particular aims discussion of history begins with napoleon who invented paradigm of industrial warfare prior to napoleon wars were mostly fought for territory rather than ideology and did not substantially alter balance of power between nations napoleon s concept of war involved using entire resources of nation with aim of comprehensively defeating his opponent and replacing political order in order to meet new challenge prussian army undertook sweeping reforms napoleon s strategy and prussian response influenced prussian general carl von clausewitz in writing his treatise on war published posthumously in 1832 throughout narrative smith analyses how armies applied force in order to achieve their objectives he also discusses emergence of guerrilla forces during peninsular war which smith believes was first war amongst people irregular forces with no clear leadership structure conducting hit and run attacks on napoleon s forces fighting to preserve ideology of spanish independence rather than for a battlefield victory concept of industrial war culminated in early 20th century with two world wars war amongst people in second half of book smith states that advent of atomic bomb rendered industrial warfare obsolete but that governments clung to concept throughout cold war era cold war itself being last act of old style industrial war belief in industrial war tactics and institutions continued into post cold war era and smith believes that political and military leaders refused to acknowledge new paradigm of war amongst people which resulted in significant defeats such as for france in algeria united states in vietnam and soviet union in afghanistan and caused problems for nato operations in balkans and later for western coalitions in iraq and afghanistan smith also notes that in new paradigm soldiers are frequently being asked to undertake new tasks such as humanitarian operations while still equipped and trained for old paradigm conflicts between massed armies in final third of book smith uses six themes to describe new paradigm of war ends for which we fight are changing from hard objectives that decide a political outcome to those of establishing conditions in which outcome may be decided we fight amongst people not on battlefield our conflicts tend to be timeless even unending we fight so as to preserve force rather than risking all to gain objective on each occasion new uses are found for old weapons and organizations which are products of industrial war sides are mostly non state comprising some form of multinational grouping against some non state party or parties smith then proceeds to discuss each of six themes in detail smith discusses modern guerrilla and insurgency campaigns including various civil wars and ethnic conflicts in balkans middle east and africa conflicts he discusses in second half are almost all wars amongst people and appear intractable to conventional forces smith analyses situations in which countries have adapted their tactics in order to respond to war amongst people such as those used by israeli forces in response to palestinian intifada in which israelis resorted to targeted searches when superior firepower proved ineffective he points out that modern wars are rarely fought between individual nations but parties often consist of supranational coalitions or sub state entities and that western governments in particular fight in such a way as to keep casualties and material losses to a minimum smith is critical of conduct of american led coalition in iraq war during insurgency which followed initial invasion and occupation of iraq in 2003 he opines that soldiers undertaking counter insurgency operations did not have proper skills or equipment for task he believes that commanders were working at a tactical rather than a strategic level and that operations were not sufficiently guided by intelligence relying too heavily on battlefield strength and assessments of insurgents technical capabilities rather than their political objectives smith includes various anecdotes and personal reflections from his own career and final chapter of book is dedicated to smith s reflections on his command of unprofor in bosnia ferguson describes smith as candid in admitting that he did not foresee events at srebenica in summer of 1995 but smith suggests that even had genocide been foreseen unprofor was not in any position to prevent it he described force as reinforced camps of international troops attempting to defend delivery of humanitarian aid and often themselves smith s belief was that none of governments that contributed soldiers to unprofor had any intention of committing them to fight that they had decided to deploy forces with no intention to employ their force having been scared into inaction by inaccurate reporting and a lack of understanding of war in his conclusion smith states his belief that modern politicians and military leaders use force where it has no utility and commit military forces without fully defined political and strategic objectives he believes that politicians and generals remain in mindset of industrial war which leads them to prepare for a decisive confrontation that never happens and he condemns them for failing to recognise shift in way wars are fought discussing humanitarian interventions such as those in balkans smith does not argue against intervention but believes that intervention must be based on a full understanding of conflict and a clear strategy with defined objectives according to smith no act of force will ever be decisive because aim of modern conflicts is to win will of people which will not be achieved by battlefield victory alone he argues that whereas in industrial war paradigm war led to victory and thus to peace in modern paradigm confrontation leads to conflict which then reverts to confrontation he asserts that force is only part of solution to modern conflicts they require complex political and military solutions which will subdue but not necessarily permanently end conflict release and critical reception utility of force was published in november 2005 by allen lane an imprint of penguin books william grimes writing in new york times described utility of force as a closely argued searching textbook on strategy and efficient use of military power in post cold war era grimes also described it as a difficult challenging book saying you can almost hear pointer hit blackboard as he works his way rigorously through each argument and sub arguments a b and c before proceeding to next step at times history lecture becomes a forced march over very familiar terrain but patient readers will discover that there is indeed a final destination in a second review for new york times in 2007 niall ferguson a history professor at harvard university described utility of force as an update of clausewitz s on war for our times ferguson went on to criticise smith for drawing too clear a distinction between war amongst people and war between peoples pointing out that in several conflicts there was no single homogeneous people and that wars amongst people can easily transform into wars between people citing bosnia as an example ferguson was underwhelmed by smith s recommendations for future smith believes that new equipment and strategies are required in order for armies to be effective in new paradigm but does not offer any suggestions ferguson s final criticism was what he described as book s limited historical perspective smith argues that war amongst people emerged in second half of 20th century during proxy wars and de colonisation campaigns of cold war era but ferguson gave examples of similar campaigns which pre dated cold war including first boer war 1880 81 and campaigns fought in eastern europe during second world war nonetheless ferguson concludes that utility of force is an impressive and absorbing work and described smith as clausewitz of low intensity conflict and peacekeeping operations academic eliot a cohen professor of strategic studies at johns hopkins university wrote for washington post that british army had a higher quotient of sophisticated leaders who have thought hard about profession of arms than was found in other armed forces including us military which he believed explained why it produces generals who write serious important books such as utility of force cohen wrote that smith s thesis that world has entered a new era of conflict is of central importance for united states military which cohen believed would have to undergo significant adaptation if smith was correct cohen criticised book for its limited historical perspective noting that conventional wars are still fought for example kargil war in 1999 and that several confrontations in asia threatened to spill over into conventional warfare nevertheless cohen concluded smith has clearly written one of most important books on modern warfare in last decade we would be better off if united states had a few more generals like him guardian martin woollacott reviewed book along with sociologist martin shaw s new western way of war risk transfer war and its crisis in iraq which he believes makes similar arguments to smith s though two reach slightly different conclusions smith that force should only be used as part of a wider political strategy shaw that war should be avoided where at all possible but that use of force is sometimes inevitable woollacott described smith as a soldier trying to wrest some continuing purpose for his profession and described both books as very worthwhile efforts to map difficult ground sir adam roberts professor of international relations at university of oxford was more critical in reviewing utility of force for independent roberts believed that smith over stated transformation into new paradigm of war by playing down extent to which there have always been wars amongst people over emphasised role of technology in shift from industrial warfare and downplayed continuation of industrial war by way of example roberts points to iran iraq war and role of precision bombing used by united states in its campaigns since end of 20th century in conclusion roberts states that it is possible to quibble over many details but that such quibbles miss essential point of book that involvement in today s crises in attempt to stop atrocities and bring wars to an end requires a capacity for clear thought a sensitivity to situation and a talent for acting that armed forces and their officers have not always possessed and now badly need writing in journal of royal united services institute rusi christopher coker professor of international relations at london school of economics gave a detailed analysis of smith s opening sentence war no longer exists he concluded that war had but that war was not over and that smith s eye catching quote detracts from force of his own argument nevertheless coker praises smith for latter s criticism of those who failed to recognise shift in paradigm of war and of lack of strategy in military campaigns of late 20th and early 21st centuries coker concludes with statement smith s experience distilled in a book sometimes too controversial for its own good should become standard reading in every military academy in 2013 general david richards then chief of defence staff included utility of force on a list of publications that he recommended to officers wishing to improve their leadership skills see also art of war by sun tzu references category 2005 non fiction books category
