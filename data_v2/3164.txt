physcia caesia known colloquially as blue gray rosette lichen and powder back lichen is a species of foliose fungus first described by georg franz hoffmann in 1784 it is common across much of europe north america and new zealand and more patchily distributed in south america asia australia and antarctica there are 2 subspecies p c caesia and p c ventosa as well as a number of distinct forms and varieties molecular studies suggest that species as currently defined may be polyphyletic it is typically pale gray shading to darker gray in center though some forms are considerably darker and grows in a small rosette usually some across at maturity it only rarely has apothecia instead reproducing most often vegetatively via soredia which are piled in round blue gray mounds across thallus s upper surface it grows most often on rock principally calcareous but also basaltic and siliceous and also occurs on bone bark and soil it is and is particularly common on substrates where birds perch capable of growing at a multitude of angles on a variety of surfaces physcia caesia also tolerates a wide range of environmental extremes from high temperatures of desert locations to low temperatures of antarctic it grows on both dry stone and that moistened by seepage and can survive being irregularly submerged for extended periods underwater like many lichens that grow on rock physcia caesia is able to extract nutrients from substrate upon which it grows as well as from rainwater and atmospheric dust it is threatened by habitat loss through development as well as trampling or overgrowth of its location a number of lichenicolous species are known parasites taxonomy physcia caesia was first described by georg franz hoffmann in 1784 as lichen caesius other assigned it to various other genera both before and after it was moved into its current genus by georg ernst ludwig in 1839 it has 2 subspecies p c caesia and p c ventosa as well as a number of distinct forms and varieties some of which were thought to be distinct species in past although this species and physcia aipolia have been considered a species pair some molecular studies suggest that they should instead be considered conspecific other molecular studies suggest that both physcia caesia and physcia aipolia are polyphyletic taxa with various forms more closely related to other species than to each other genus name physcia means inflated or sausage like referring to form of type species specific epithet caesia is a latin word meaning blue gray physcia caesia is known colloquially as blue gray rosette lichen and powder back lichen description physcia caesia is a foliose lichen that forms small rosettes typically measuring across at maturity though it can reach diameters of up to thallus is pale gray shading to darker gray in center and adheres closely to substrate on which it grows its convex lobes are linear typically measuring in width though occasionally as wide as forms in some areas including greenland can be considerably darker with a thallus ranging from gray to dark gray they can also have broader or narrower lobes lichen s surface is white spotted though this is not always obvious it has blue gray soredia which are piled in round mounds such aggregations are known as soralia across thallus s upper surface lower surface is white to brown with short dark physcia caesia only rarely has apothecia where present these are black discs measuring up to across with prominent margins which means thallus extends up around edges of apothecia and a grayish pruinescence each ascus contains 8 spores which are thick walled and brown measuring x its photobiont is green algae a species associated with many physcia lichens lichen s cortex and medulla react positively with potassium hydroxide k turning yellow cortex and medulla react positively with para pd as well also turning yellow they produce no reaction with calcium or sodium hypochlorite bleach c nor with kc potassium hydroxide quickly followed by bleach among substances produced by lichen are and similar species physcia caesia was long considered to be a species pair with very similar physcia aipolia latter is regularly covered with black apothecia and typically grows physcia caesia may also be confused with physcia but latter has crateriform hollowed like a bowl or saucer rather than rounded soralia and obviously convex lobes it may also be confused with physcia dubia which like physcia caesia can be quite variable however p dubia has lip shaped soralia which tend to be primarily apical and its thallus does not react with potassium hydroxide distribution and habitat thumb physcia caesia on rock on st paul island alaska physcia caesia is widespread across much of world found in arctic boreal and temperate vegetation zones widely distributed across europe it is one of most common species of physcia in greenland and is abundant throughout britain though found across much of north america it is absent from central and southeastern united states parts of great basin and northern alaska in south america it is found in argentina chile and peru common and widespread in temperate areas it occurs only rarely and only at elevations above in tropical regions it occurs patchily across asia in india bhutan nepal and japan as well as in east africa it is described as cosmopolitan in new zealand has been reported from a number of sites in southeastern australia and tasmania and also occurs in antarctica it is common on calcareous substrates growing on limestone including tufa and concrete it also grows on basaltic and siliceous rock as well as on bone it is particularly common on rocks where birds perch and defecate it is uncommon on bark however in colorado rocky mountains it is one of predominant lichens on juniper trees growing primarily within of ground on northern and eastern side of trunks in antarctica it grows on mosses soil and gravel and may be among species contributing to formation of a soil crust on continent in california it is found in montane and subalpine forests ranging from in elevation ecology physcia caesia tolerates a variety of locations occurring on vertical angled and horizontal surfaces as well as rocky overhangs it is found on both dry stone and stone moistened by seepage and can tolerate being irregularly submerged underwater it survives in hot desert conditions primarily on north side of slopes it also thrives in cold conditions and is able to photosynthesize at temperatures as low as like many lichens that grow on rocky substrates physcia caesia is able to accumulate a number of necessary nutrients including nitrogen phosphorus potassium and iron from substrate upon which it grows as well as from rainwater and atmospheric dust its hyphae can extend into substrate as much as it is a and can tolerate higher levels of atmospheric ammonia than can many other species of lichen because it can survive on substrates with a higher ph it has been recorded growing on a lead surface probably a weathered oxide physcia caesia is known to accumulate high concentrations of heavy metals including chromium zinc copper and iron it is slow growing with an increase in size of only per year for a colony observed in one study foliose lichens such as physcia caesia are intermediate in their response to air pollution less sensitive than lichens but more sensitive than lichens physcia caesia is found in cities though at lower frequencies than more pollution tolerant species in greenland it often grows in association with other lichen species tolerant of enriched environments including arctica xanthoria candelaria xanthoria elegans physcia dubia and in poland it is part of bryophyte communities found on asbestos tile roofs occurring with and others as with most lichens physcia caesia is impacted by habitat loss through development as well as by trampling or overgrowth of its location however retention of old stone walls buildings and bridges can help to support its populations even in cities physcia caesia is attacked by lichenicolous fungi including polycoccum polycoccum and references cited books external links
