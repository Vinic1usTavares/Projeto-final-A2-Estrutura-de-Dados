gravesend and replaced him with a passenger a seaman named john ayers ayers had little experience of thames or of helming a craft such as princess alice between 7 20 pm and 7 40 pm princess alice had passed tripcock point entered gallions reach and come within sight of north woolwich pier where many passengers were to disembark when bywell castle was sighted bywell castle usually carried coal to africa but had just been repainted at a dry dock she was due to sail up to newcastle to pick up coal bound for alexandria egypt harrison was unfamiliar with conditions so employed christopher dix an experienced thames river pilot though he was not obliged to do so as bywell castle had a raised forecastle dix did not have a clear view in front of him so a seaman was placed on lookout thumb upright

manoeuvre his vessel out of a collision course and ordered engines to be put into reverse full speed it was too late princess alice was struck on starboard side just in front of paddle box at an angle of 13 degrees she split in two and sank within four minutes her boilers separating from structure as it sank crew of bywell castle dropped ropes from their deck for passengers of princess alice to climb they also threw anything that would float into water for people to hold other crew from bywell castle launched their lifeboat and rescued 14 people and crews from boats moored nearby did same residents from both banks of thames particularly boatmen of local factories launched vessels to rescue who they could many of passengers from princess alice were unable to swim long heavy dresses worn by women also hindered their efforts to stay afloat princess alices sister ship duke of teck was steaming ten minutes behind her she arrived too late to rescue anyone left in water only two people who had been below decks or in saloon survived collision a diver who later examined saloon reported that passengers were jammed together in doorways mostly still upright about 130 people were rescued from

made their way to london steamboat offices near blackfriars to wait for more news many took train from london bridge to woolwich crowds grew during night and into following day as both relatives and sightseers travelled to woolwich additional police were drafted in to help control crowds and deal with remains that were being landed reports came in of corpses being washed up as far upstream as limehouse and down to when bodies were landed they were stored locally for identification rather than centrally although most ended up at woolwich dockyard relatives had to travel between several locations on both sides of thames to search for missing family members local watermen were hired for ps2 a day to search for bodies they were paid a minimum of five shillings for each one they recovered which sometimes led to fights over corpses one of those picked up was that of grinstead princess alices captain because of pollution from sewage and local industrial output bodies from thames were covered with slime which was found difficult to clean off corpses began to rot at a faster pace than normal and many of corpses were unusually bloated victims clothing also began to rot quickly and was discoloured after immersion in polluted water sixteen of those who survived died within two weeks and several others were ill inquest on 4 september charles carttar coroner for west kent opened inquest for his region that day he took jury to view corpses at woolwich town hall and woolwich pier there were more bodies on northern bank but this lay outside his jurisdiction charles lewis coroner for south essex visited board of trade and home office to try to have remains in his jurisdiction moved to woolwich to allow one inquest that could cover all victims and hear evidence in only one location but law meant that deceased could not be moved until inquest had been opened and adjourned instead he opened his inquest to formally identify bodies under his authority then adjourned proceedings until after carttar s case had come to a conclusion he issued burial orders and remains were then transferred to woolwich left thumb upright 1 2 stern of princess alice beached

identification number which was also attached to clothing and personal items which were retained to aid later identification same day over 150 private funerals of victims took place first two weeks of carttar s inquest were given over to formal identification of bodies and visits to wreck site to examine remains of princess alice from 16 september proceedings began to examine causes of collision carttar began by bemoaning media coverage of event which suggested strongly that bywell castle had been in error and should take blame he focussed his proceedings on william beechey first body to have been positively identified carttar explained to jury that whatever verdict they reached on beechey would apply to other victims numerous thames boatmen appeared as witnesses all who had been active in area at time their stories of path taken by princess alice differed considerably most pleasure craft coming upriver on thames would round tripcock point and head for northern bank to take advantage of more favourable currents had princess alice done that bywell castle would have gone clearly astern of her several witnesses stated that once princess alice rounded tripcock point she had been pushed into centre of river by currents ship then attempted to turn to port which would have kept her close to river s southern bank but in doing so cut across bows of bywell castle several masters of other ships moored nearby who witnessed collision agreed with this series of events princess alices chief mate denied that his ship had changed direction during inquest evidence was taken from george purcell stoker on bywell castle who on night of sinking had told several people that captain and crew of ship were drunk under oath he changed his claims and stated that they were sober and that he had no recollection of claiming that anyone was drunk evidence given by other members of bywell castles crew showed it had been purcell who had been drunk one crewman said that purcell was like generality of firemen he was rather worse for drink but not so bad that he could not take his watch evidence was also taken concerning state of thames at point ship sank and of construction and stability of princess alice on 14 november after twelve hours of discussion inquest released its verdict four members of nineteen member jury refused to sign statement verdict was thumb upright alt smiling middle aged man with a jawline beard captain william r h grinstead master of princess alice who died in collision that death of said william beachey and others was occasioned by drowning in waters of river thames from a collision that occurred after sunset between a steam vessel called bywell castle and a steam vessel called princess alice whereby princess alice was cut in two and sunk such collision not being wilful that bywell castle did not take necessary precaution of easing stopping and reversing her engines in time and that princess alice contributed to collision by not stopping and going astern that all collisions in opinion of jury might in future be avoided if proper and stringent rules and regulations were laid down for all steam navigation on river thames addenda we consider that princess alice was on third of september seaworthy we think princess alice was not properly and sufficiently manned we think number of persons onboard princess alice was more than prudent we think means of saving life onboard princess alice were insufficient for a vessel of her class board of trade inquiry running at same time as coroner s inquest was a board of trade inquiry specific charges were laid against captain harrison two of crew members of bywell castle and against long first mate of princess alice all had their licences suspended at start of hearing board of trade proceedings began on 14 october 1878 and continued until 6 november board found that princess alice had breached rule 29 section d of board of trade regulations and regulations of thames conservancy board 1872 this stated that if two ships are heading towards each other they should pass on port side of each other as princess alice had not followed this procedure board found princess alice to blame and that bywell castle could not avoid collision thumb large coal carrying boat with single funnel seen from port side upright 1 ss bywell castle company that owned princess alice sued owners of bywell castle for ps20 000 compensation owners of bywell castle counter sued for ps2 000 case was heard in admiralty division of high court of justice in late 1878 after two weeks judgment was that both vessels were to blame for collision as no passenger list was kept on princess alice or a record of number of people on board it was not possible to calculate number of people who died figures vary from 600 to 700 times reported that coroner believes that there are from 60 to 80 bodies unrecovered from river total number of lives lost must thus have been from 630 to 650 michael foley in his examination of disasters on thames observes that there was no proof of final death toll however around 640 bodies were eventually recovered sinking was worst inland disaster on

in june 1887 was named bazalgette after joseph bazalgette who had rebuilt london s sewer system practice of dumping at sea continued until december 1998 until princess alice sank marine police force branch of metropolitan police that had responsibility for policing thames relied on rowing boats for their work inquest into sinking of princess alice found that these were insufficient for requirements of role and that they should be replaced by steam launches first two launches entered service in mid 1880s eight were working by 1898 royal albert dock which opened in 1880 helped to separate heavy goods traffic from smaller boats this and global adoption of emergency signalling lights on boats both helped avoid future tragedies after 23 000 people donated to a fund a memorial celtic cross was erected in woolwich cemetery in may 1880 st mary magdalene woolwich local parish church also later installed a stained glass memorial window in 2008 a national lottery grant funded

were salvaged and remainder sent to a ship breaker london steamboat co were bankrupt within six years and their successors went into financial difficulties three years after that according to
