manchester cenotaph is a war memorial in st peter s square manchester england manchester was late in commissioning a first world war memorial compared with most british towns and cities city council did not convene a war memorial committee until 1922 committee quickly achieved its target of raising ps10 000 but finding a suitable location for monument proved controversial preferred site in albert square would have required removal and relocation of other statues and monuments and was opposed by city s artistic bodies next choice was piccadilly gardens an area already identified for a possible art gallery and library but in interests of speedier delivery memorial committee settled on st peter s square area within square had been had been purchased by city council in 1906 having been site of former st peter s church whose sealed burial crypts remained with burials untouched and marked above ground by a memorial stone cross negotiations to remove these stalled so construction of cenotaph proceeded with cross and burials in situ having picked a site it was originally proposed to choose an architect by open competition but memorial committee was criticised in local press when it reserved right to overrule judgement of independent assessor a sub committee therefore approached sir edwin lutyens directly who produced in a matter of weeks a variation of his design for cenotaph in london memorial consists of a central cenotaph and a stone of remembrance flanked by twin obelisks all features characteristic of lutyens works raised steps either side of stone of remembrance provided east facing tribunes for colour party in memorial parades cenotaph is topped by an effigy of a fallen soldier and decorated with relief carvings of imperial crown manchester s coat of arms and inscriptions commemorating dead structures based on classical architecture use abstract ecumenical shapes rather than overt religious symbolism in submitting design lutyens stated that he envisaged crypts and cross as remaining in place as cenotaph could stand on foundations of former church tower and cross would serve to consecrate site while there would be no explicit religious symbolism on cenotaph itself memorial was unveiled on 12 july 1924 by earl of derby assisted by mrs bingle a local resident whose three sons had died in war it cost ps6 940 and remaining funds were used to provide hospital beds thumb cenotaph on its present site looking northwest in 2014 manchester city council dismantled memorial and reconstructed it at northeast corner of st peter s square next to manchester town hall to make room for expanded metrolink tram network it is a grade ii listed structure and in 2015 historic england recognised manchester cenotaph as part of a national collection of lutyens war memorials background in aftermath of first world war and its unprecedented casualties thousands of war memorials were built across britain virtually every village town or city erected some form of memorial to commemorate their dead during war only london provided more recruits to british army than manchester manchester regiment and lancashire fusiliers which largely recruited from city and towns to north were swollen by pals battalions drawn from local employers social groups and neighbourhoods o neil pp 17 18 by end of war over 13 000 men of manchester regiment including more than 4 000 from pals battalions and 13 600 lancashire fusiliers had been killed an estimated 22 000 died and 55 000 were wounded o neil pp 90 91 commissioning thumb right rochdale cenotaph also by lutyens with tower of rochdale town hall in background many towns and cities began to erect war memorials after armistice but manchester did not get underway until 1922 as a result of pressure from local branch of royal british legion city council convened a war memorial committee of 12 persons chaired by mayor and consisting of aldermen and councillors and representative men connected with different aspects of manchester business with military forces and other sections of manchester life to explore options for commemoration skelton p 63 committee limited budget to ps10 000 and very rapidly raised this sum donors being assured that local firms would benefit from construction and resulting employment nonetheless letters pages of local newspapers featured several missives from ex servicemen who felt that cenotaph was a waste of money and that funds would be better spent on survivors and war widows many of whom faced extreme hardship as a result of high levels of unemployment in aftermath of war carden coyne pp 116 117 for a civic memorial to great war ps10 000 was relatively modest sum counterpart public appeal in rochdale had raised nearly ps30 000 and resulting rochdale cenotaph then just completed had cost ps12 611 proprietor of daily dispatch newspaper edward hulton offered to cover entire cost of manchester memorial but committee declined feeling that funding should come from people and city of manchester subsequently committee resisted all suggestions that memorial budget might be increased or that list of donors might be extended constitutionally memorial committee was a committee of city council but acted throughout as having independent discretion and funds three potential sites were considered for memorial albert square piccadilly gardens and st peter s square st ann s square being ruled out as already containing civic monument to boer war with support of royal british legion albert square emerged as favourite site proved controversial as manchester society of architects and manchester art foundation led objections to removal and relocation of statues in square which would have been required to create a suitable space for war memorial king george v had consented to relocation of memorial to his german grandfather prince albert but objections persisted and city architect estimated cost of relocating statues at ps8 400 city council rejected albert square in march 1923 and voted by 71 votes to 30 in favour of piccadilly gardens as site for monument city was already considering building an art gallery at piccadilly on space left after old manchester royal infirmary had been demolished albeit that this was currently filled by temporary huts housing books from manchester central library siting memorial on this land was welcomed by art gallery committee who proceeded to commission designs for a memorial in form of a hall of memory but would be contingent on also funding a new library as nothing was yet decided on these wider schemes any plans for area would have delayed war memorial project further and so in may 1923 memorial committee acting on its own initiative disregarded vote of council and switched attention to st peter s square hartwell 2004 p 332 skelton pp 63 64 square was itself a controversial choice both because it was then much smallest of three options and also due to its being location of former st peter s church demolished in 1907 statutory trustees appointed to administer funds paid over by city council for deconsecrated site of church had been required by manchester churches act of 1906 to erect and maintain a memorial cross on site as well as to protect bodies of dead still interred in vaults underneath and they objected to removal of both dispute was only partially resolved as although trustees consented to construction of cenotaph they refused to allow removal of cross while burials remained in place accordingly discussions proceeded with manchester diocese on basis that burials would need to be removed individually and reburied on separate plots in one of city cemeteries cross being relocated to grounds of manchester cathedral but this would add considerable time and cost to memorial project thumb left lutyens whitehall cenotaph in london more controversy surrounded choice of architect manchester art federation and other bodies petitioned city council to hold an open competition to which council agreed war memorial committee appointed percy worthington a local architect as assessor for competition but attracted severe criticism in local press when it reserved to itself right to veto worthington s choice after further debate a subcommittee approached sir edwin lutyens skelton pp 64 65 and competition collapsed conveniently lutyens assured committee in august 1923 that his design could accommodate cross and crypts remaining in place while clearly distinct and so this whole issue was deferred until after cenotaph had been completed and dedicated architect lutyens described by historic england as leading english architect of his generation was amongst most prominent designers of war memorials in britain before war he had established his reputation designing country houses for wealthy patrons but war had a profound effect on him and from 1917 onwards he dedicated much of his time to memorialising casualties stone of remembrance that he designed in 1917 appears in all large imperial war graves commission iwgc cemeteries and in several of his civic memorials including manchester s his cenotaph on whitehall in london became focus for national remembrance sunday commemorations and one of most influential designs for war memorials in britain manchester s cenotaph a close replica is one of seven in england based on it borg pp 74 75 lutyens designed thiepval memorial to missing of somme largest british war memorial in world for iwgc in 1928 around same time he designed his only other commission in

design with flanking objects recumbent figure and a stone of remembrance set in front of cenotaph is reminiscent of his earlier cenotaph in southampton while other first world war memorials feature sculpture or overt religious symbolism manchester s like many of his memorials uses abstract and ecumenical shapes inspired by classical architecture its effigy of unknown soldier raised high on pylon rather than at eye level is reminiscent of ancient tower tombs sculpture s position high above eye level gives soldier anonymity complementing abstract shapes of structures and allowing an onlooker to project an image of their own choosing onto it winter pp 102 104 borg p 96 amery et al p 148 king p 139 and distances viewer from fact of death and focuses on an idealised sense of self sacrifice carden coyne p 155 pevsner city guide to manchester described cenotaph as one of few impressive war memorials in manchester but in its original site at western end of st peter s square lamented its cluttered setting and proximity to overhead powerlines of metrolink tram system cenotaph obelisks and stone are features typical of lutyens war memorial work although manchester s is one of only two with flanking obelisks northampton s has a similar pair of obelisks flanking a stone of remembrance barnes p 118 borg p 88 brown p 175 history thumb temple moore s memorial cross to former st peter s church which occupied site intended for war memorial surrounded by post wwii garden of remembrance thumb cenotaph in its post 1992 cluttered location in foreground is cross marking site of former st peter s church and in background midland hotel power lines and platforms for metrolink tram system are visible beyond garden of remembrance st peter s square already housed a memorial cross by temple moore marking location of former st peter s church which had been demolished in 1907 statutory trustees had agreed with british legion in recommending albert square as memorial site nevertheless bishop of manchester ex officio chairman of trustees had subsequently indicated approval to relocating cross and burials from st peters square should this be needed to accommodate war memorial a full meeting of trustees did not however endorse him in this lutyens provisionally resolved stand off by stating that he was happy for cross to be retained and issue was adjourned until after cenotaph had been erected hartwell 2002 p 202 skelton p 65 nevertheless impracticality of having a cross obscuring view of cenotaph for spectators became apparent at dedication ceremony and negotiations about relocating cross and burials recommenced but trustees remained reluctant and after further discussion lutyens said he did not object to their remaining according to tim skelton author of lutyens and great war 2008 heated discussions resulted in a compromise that clearly show ed as moore s cross severely impinged on setting of memorial and appear ed to be an integral part of it despite war memorial committee s promise that local labour would be used monument was built by nine elms stone masonry works of london resulting in a sense of betrayal in local community having cost ps6 940 it was unveiled on 12 july 1924 by edward stanley 17th earl of derby derby s family had been involved in politics for generations and he had held various public offices during war including secretary of state for war he was assisted by mrs bingle a local woman from rylance street ancoats who lost three sons in war two years earlier lord derby had unveiled lutyens rochdale cenotaph away carden coyne p 130 mrs bingle represented mothers and wives of manchester who had made sacrifices greater than life itself she wore eight medals awarded to her sons sergeant ernest bingle aged 34 and gunner charles bingle aged 27 of royal garrison artillery and corporal nelson bingle aged 21 of royal engineers all were killed in 1918 nelson in march and ernest and charles in may simpson pp 104 105 unveiling ceremony at manchester took place in front of a large crowd and a guard of honour from manchester regiment and ex servicemen service was led by dean of manchester very reverend gough mccormick and baptist minister reverend john edward roberts of union chapel on oxford road several dignitaries gave speeches including lord mayor and lord derby who remarked that memorial was not only a tribute to dead but a warning as to cost of war after unveiling a procession of women laid flowers around base of memorial remainder of ps10 000 raised by war memorial committee was used to provide hospital beds for ex servicemen and their families controversies that arose during memorial s gestation largely disappeared after its unveiling manchester city news praised design for its simplicity of forms and rhythmic beauty of proportion a marble plaque added nearby and dedicated to was removed during second world war in 1949 dates for world war ii were added as inscriptions on obelisks and surrounding area was laid out as a garden of remembrance designed by city architect l c howitt steps and lawns of garden of remembrance provided space for italian memorial plaque to be restored and over subsequent years further plaques were added later to commemorate dead of korean war and other later conflicts nevertheless by enclosing cross and cenotaph within a single space post wwii memorial complex conflicted with lutyens s intention that cenotaph should be free of explicit religious associations relocation suitability of st peter s square re emerged in 1925 during discussions about proposed art gallery and consideration was given to moving cenotaph to piccadilly over following century square itself changed radically in 1924 square was small and apart from midland hotel most of surrounding buildings were no more than four stories high but then an entire block on north side was cleared in 1930s for construction behind it of manchester central library and then further blocks to northeast were cleared in 1980 to open square to manchester town hall extension and collier street facade of manchester town hall from 1992 st peter s square became location of one of main city centre stops for manchester s metrolink tram system such that stanchions and overhead power lines increasingly intruded on cenotaph and platforms abutted directly onto low wall around post wwii garden of remembrance in march 2011 manchester city council began a public consultation on moving cenotaph to an alternative site within 1980 extension of square to allow for further expansion of tram network plans had a mixed reception some objections were made by public but there was support from veterans church and heritage groups relocation was approved in 2012 and in january 2014 cenotaph was dismantled before it was cleaned and restored burial crypts were to remain beneath new tram lines and so were provided with a concrete lid while memorial cross also cleaned and restored was returned to its original position above crypts in 2014 cenotaph was reconstructed in a new memorial garden on opposite side of square aligned with manchester town hall s southern entrance city council commissioned conservation architects stephen heritage architecture to manage relocation and design new setting which places cenotaph obelisks and stone on a plinth in an oval surrounded by a low wall garden opened to public in september 2014 cenotaph was damaged in first week when skateboarders began using area as a skatepark repair work costing ps4 000 started shortly afterwards and extra security measures including 24 hour cctv were put in place cenotaph was designated a grade ii listed structure on 12 february 1985 listed status provides legal protection from demolition or modification grade ii is applied to about 92 of listed buildings of special interest warranting every effort to preserve them it was upgraded in 1994 to grade ii which is reserved for particularly
