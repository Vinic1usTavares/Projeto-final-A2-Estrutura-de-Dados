cape sparrow passer melanurus or is a bird of sparrow family passeridae found in southern africa a medium sized sparrow at it has distinctive plumage including large pale head stripes in both sexes its plumage is mostly grey brown and chestnut and male has some bold black and white markings on its head and neck species inhabits semi arid savannah cultivated areas and towns and ranges from central coast of angola to eastern south africa and swaziland three subspecies are distinguished in different parts of its range cape sparrows primarily eat seeds and also eat soft plant parts and insects they typically breed in colonies and when not breeding they gather in large nomadic flocks to move around in search of food nest can be constructed in a tree a bush a cavity or a disused nest of another species a typical clutch contains three or four eggs and both parents are involved in breeding from nest building to feeding young cape sparrow is common in most of its range and coexists successfully in urban habitats with two of its relatives native southern grey headed sparrow and house sparrow an introduced species cape sparrow s population has not been recorded decreasing significantly and it is not seriously threatened by human activities so it is assessed as a species of least concern by international union for conservation of nature iucn description thumb left upright a male in western cape seen from front for a sparrow cape sparrow is strikingly coloured and distinctive and is medium sized at long adults range in weight from breeding male has a mostly black head but with a broad white mark on each side curling from behind eye to throat on throat a narrow black band connects black bib of breast to black of head underparts are greyish darker on flanks back of male s neck is dark grey and its back and shoulders are bright chestnut male has a white and a black wing bar below its shoulders and flight feathers and tail streaked grey and black female is plumaged like male but is duller and has a grey head with a different pattern from male though it bears a hint of pale head markings of male juvenile is like female but young males have black markings on head from an early age cape sparrow s calls are chirps similar to those of house sparrow but much more musical and mellow basic call is used in flight and while perching socially and transcribed as chirrup or a loud distinctive call used by male to advertise nest ownership can be written as or this call can be extended into a jerky and repetitive song chip cheerup chip cheerup taxonomy cape sparrow was first taxonomically described by philipp ludwig statius muller in 1776 as loxia some other earlier biologists described cape sparrow in loxia or fringilla but it has otherwise been regarded as a member of genus passer along with house sparrow and other sparrows of old world within this genus morphological comparisons and geography were insufficient to elucidate to which species cape sparrow is most closely related mitochondrial dna phylogenies have strongly suggested that cape sparrow is among most basal members of its genus having diverged from rest of genus during late miocene over 5 million years ago it is genetically closest to southern grey headed sparrow and other grey headed sparrows of africa and sparrow of central asia so these species may be sibling species of cape sparrow or similarly early offshoots cape sparrow s specific epithet comes from greek melas melas black and oura oura tail while name of genus passer comes from a latin word for small birds cape sparrow has three subspecies nominate subspecies passer melanurus melanurus is found in western south africa east to western part of free state subspecies vicinus which is sometimes included in subspecies melanurus occurs from free state east to eastern cape and lesotho subspecies ranges from extreme southern coastal areas of angola into namibia botswana and southern zimbabwe as well as northern south africa distribution and habitat thumb females drinking at a waterhole in namibia cape sparrow inhabits southern africa south of angola and as far east as swaziland northernmost point in its range is benguela in angola and it is found in coastal and central parts of namibia except for driest parts of namib desert it occurs in all of south africa except farthest east in southern botswana and in kalahari basin of central botswana in east it breeds at a small number of localities in southeastern zimbabwe it has been recorded as a vagrant in harare in central zimbabwe eastern limit of its range is reached in wet forests of limpopo and kwazulu natal extending into hills of western swaziland original habitats of this species were semi arid savanna and light woodland typical of southern africa when settled agriculture arrived in its range about a thousand years ago it adapted to cultivated land and since arrival of settlement it has moved into towns cape sparrow prefers habitats with an annual rainfall of less than though in desert areas it is usually found near watercourses or watering holes while it occurs in urban centres it prefers parks gardens and other open spaces and has a low reproductive success in more built up areas in towns cape sparrow competes with both native southern grey headed sparrow and house sparrow which was introduced to southern africa in 19th century since it is more established around humans in its range than either it successfully competes with both species though they may exclude it from nesting in holes a survey by birdwatchers completed in 2000 found cape sparrow increasing in abundance in some suburban areas of south africa northern johannesburg area and pietermaritzburg and decreasing in others southern cape town area house sparrow was reported decreasing in several urban areas as it has in parts of europe declines which are attributed to factors including increasing density of garden plantings and increases in predation behaviour social behaviour thumb left cape sparrows and a southern masked weaver at a bird feeder in johannesburg during winter cape sparrow is social lives in flocks and usually breeds in colonies away from settled areas it spends much of year wandering in flocks of up to 200 birds in cultivated and built up areas smaller flocks form where food is provided for livestock or birds in such places it associates with other seed eating birds such as house sparrow cape weaver and weavers of genus euplectes birds from urban areas form large flocks seasonally and fly out to nearby countryside to feed on ripening grain returning at night to roost cape sparrows prefer to roost in nests and while wandering outside of breeding season birds in uncultivated areas roost socially in old nests or dense bushes in farmland and towns cape sparrows build special nests for roosting lined more poorly than breeding nests but incorporating a greater quantity of insulating material an unusual social behaviour has been described from cape sparrows in johannesburg groups of 20 30 birds separate from larger flocks and stand close together on ground with tails on ground and heads held high these groups sometimes move in an fashion by hopping slowly often birds will fly up and hover above ground during these gatherings birds are silent and are never antagonistic this behaviour s significance is unknown and it is not reported in any other sparrow species feeding thumb male cape sparrow carrying food to feed young cape sparrow mostly eats seeds foraging in trees and on ground larger seeds of cereals wild grasses and other small plants are preferred with wheat and being favourites buds and soft fruits are also taken causing considerable damage to agriculture insects are eaten and nestlings seem to be fed exclusively on caterpillars cape sparrow eats soft shoots of plants and probes in aloes for nectar but these are not important sources of food breeding courtship and colonies thumb a pair in johannesburg cape sparrow usually breeds in loose colonies of 50 100 birds 10 to 20 percent of breeding birds in each population nest away from colonies for unknown reasons cape sparrow is usually monogamous but some records of a male and two females nesting and raising young in one nest have been made in western cape it seems pairs are formed in non breeding flocks but it is not known how pairs are formed or if pair bond is for life once ready to breed newly mated pairs look for a suitable nesting site spending mornings searching and returning to their flock in afternoon once a site has been selected both birds begin to build their nest other pairs seeking a nest site join them and in this manner a colony forms quickly courtship display is poorly recorded ornithologist j denis summers smith observed a display in which male hopped beside female in a tree drooping its wings and ruffling chestnut coloured feathers on its back groups of two or more males have been observed chasing a female in house sparrow a similar display exists in which a female who is not ready to copulate is chased by her mate who is joined by other males it is not known if display in cape sparrow has a similar significance when ready to mate female crouches in solicitation and is mounted by male instances of hybridisation with house sparrow southern grey headed sparrow and captives or escapees of sudan golden sparrow have been reported nesting cape sparrow utilises a variety of nesting sites bushes and trees especially acacias seem to be preferred and many nests may be built in a single tree holes and other covered sites are chosen less frequently nests have been recorded from eaves of buildings on creepers on walls in holes in earth banks and in holes in haystacks sometimes cape sparrow nests in disused nests of other birds such as weavers and swallows pairs that nest away from colonies usually choose low bushes or utility poles as nesting sites nests are placed at least a metre above ground and can be only a few centimetres apart in colonies only nest and its very close vicinity are defended as a territory males defend their territory with threatening postures and sometimes by fighting with bills on ground nests built in open are large and untidy domed structures built of dry grass twigs and other plant materials any leaves or thorns present in a tree may be worked into nest in cavity nests hole is filled with a shapeless mass of grass with a cup of soft material containing eggs on inside when disused domed nests of weavers are used they are given a soft lining nest entrance is on side and is sometimes extended into a short funnel male and female construct nest together keeping close when finding material and weaving it together inside linings of cape sparrow nests can incorporate large portions of aromatic leaves such as helichrysum pumilio thyme thymus vulgaris and camphor cinnamomum this consistent use of aromatics suggests that they have some purpose such as protection against parasites eggs and young thumb a male feeding a fledgeling clutches contain between two and six eggs typically three or four variation in clutch size depends on amount of food available for young birds presumably owing to greater availability of food clutches are larger during peak of breeding season and in more southern latitudes of cape sparrow s range both birds of a pair incubate eggs during day switching every ten or fifteen minutes at night only female incubates eggs while male roosts outside or in nest in pairs breeding outside of colonies birds leave nest to make room for their mates upon hearing their mates approaching among colonial pairs incubating bird waits until its partner arrives in nest to prevent other birds from entering nest incubation seems to begin before clutch is complete and lasts 12 24 days young of a clutch hatch over two or three days and are brooded until their feathers develop and eyes open five days after hatching young are fed on insects until they fledge 16 to 25 typically 17 days after hatching after this they are fed for one or two weeks while feeding nestlings female is dominant over male cape sparrows are among main hosts of brood parasitism by cuckoo in southern africa and sometimes parasitise nests of their own species relationships with humans cape sparrow is an abundant and familiar bird of human habitations and cultivation in most of southern africa it is not believed to be threatened and accordingly is listed as a species of least concern on iucn s red list it can be an agricultural pest especially of grain cultivation and vineyards when vineyards in south west cape started letting weeds grow between vines to conserve moisture around 1956 cape sparrow moved in cape sparrows quickly exhausted seeds and started eating grapes cape sparrow is now a serious pest in vineyards vineyards are not an optimal habitat and some populations have had such a low reproductive success that they could not be maintained without immigration cape sparrow was featured on lowest denomination south african coin from farthing 1 4 cent in 1923 to cent that ceased to be minted in 2002 with designs based on an original by george kruger gray this was said to be because women interned at a concentration camp in during boer war adopted a biblical quotation from matthew 10 as their motto are not two sparrows sold for a farthing and one of them shall not fall on ground without your father it has also been featured on stamps from lesotho
