character of devon was an obvious attempt to a plot device into narrative rogerebert com film critic matt zoller seitz agreed finding skate kitchen hugely appealing on whole but describing plot points with devon and conflict between camille and her mother as conventional and contrived guardian charles also found conflict with devon contrived in comparison to comfortable naturalism between girls and
