dingyuan class consisted of a pair of ironclad warships and built for imperial chinese navy in 1880s they were first ships of that size to be built for chinese navy having been constructed by vulcan ag in germany originally expected to be a class of 12 ships before being reduced to three and then two with was reduced in size to that of a protected cruiser they were prevented from sailing to china during sino french war but first saw combat at battle of yalu river on 17 september 1894 during first sino japanese war they were next in combat during battle of weihaiwei in early 1895 where they were blockaded in harbour dingyuen was struck by a torpedo and was beached where it continued to operate as a defensive fort when fleet was surrendered to japanese she was destroyed while zhenyuan became first battleship of imperial japanese navy as chin en she was eventually removed from navy list in 1911 and was sold for scrap following year design naval conflicts with western powers earlier in 19th century such as first and second opium wars during which european warships decisively defeated china s traditional junk fleets prompted a major rearmament program that began in 1880s under viceroy of zhili province li advisers from british royal navy assisted program and first group of ships several ironclad gunboats and two small cruisers were bought from british shipyards following a dispute with japan over island of formosa chinese navy decided to buy large ironclad battleships to match imperial japanese navy ironclads of and es then under construction britain was unwilling to sell china warships of this size for fear of offending russian empire despite having sold japan similar vessels so li turned to german shipyards german kaiserliche marine imperial navy was completing four s and offered to sell china ships built to a modified design li wanted to buy up to 12 large ironclads but tight finances prevented an order of three ships of which was reduced in size to that of a protected cruiser rather than mounting main guns in a pair of large open barbettes as in sachsen class new design for placed four guns in two rotating barbettes towards front of each ship two ships of class and were built at a cost of around 6 2 million german gold marks equivalent of around 1 million chinese silver taels general characteristics and machinery ships of dingyuan class were long between perpendiculars and long overall they had a beam of and a draught of ships displaced as designed and up to at full load ships hulls were constructed out of steel and were built with a naval ram in bow steering was controlled by a single rudder each vessel had a crew of 363 officers and enlisted men two heavy military masts were fitted one just in front of main battery guns and one behind a hurricane deck covered turrets and ran from foremast to funnels each ship carried a pair of second class torpedo boats astern of funnels along with derricks to unload them dingyuan and zhenyuan were powered by a pair of horizontal three cylinder trunk steam engines each of which drove a single screw propeller steam was provided by eight cylindrical boilers that were ducted into a pair of funnels amidships boilers were divided into four boiler rooms engines were rated at for a top speed of though both ships exceeded these figures on trials with zhenyuan faster of two reaching and ships carried of coal normally and up to this enabled a cruising radius of at a speed of both ships were fitted with sails for voyage from germany to china though they were later removed armament and armour thumb left an overview of layout of a dingyuan class ironclad ships were armed with a main battery of four 25 caliber guns mounted in two barbettes barbettes are sometimes reported to have been in different arrangements on dingyuan and zhenyuan but both ships guns were arranged identically with starboard barbette forward of port one guns themselves were krupp guns secondary battery consisted of two guns mounted individually one on bow and other on stern three torpedo tubes rounded out armament one was mounted in stern and other two were placed forward of main battery all above water belt armour of class was thick while barbettes for main armament were a armoured deck ran entire length of ships leaving ends undefended conning tower had further plating some thick while guns were each in turrets

1884 service history completed in early 1883 and 1884 respectively dingyuan and zhenyuan were to be sailed to china by a german crew but delays primarily from france following outbreak of sino french war in 1884 kept ships in germany a german crew took dingyuan out for a firing test at sea causing glass to shatter around ship along with damage to a funnel after war ended in april 1885 two ironclads were permitted to depart for china along with three ships arrived in china in october and they were formally commissioned into beiyang fleet dingyuan was flagship of new formation and by time of first sino japanese war she was under command of commodore liu pu chan while admiral ding ruchang was also stationed on board zhenyuan was under command of captain lin t ai tseng with war breaking out in 1894 both ships of dingyuan class first saw combat at battle of yalu river on 17 september two ships formed middle of chinese line of battle with orders for them to act in support of each other a shot from dingyuan at a distance of from japanese was first attack of chinese fleet which destroyed its own flying bridge and injured admiral and his staff her signalling mast was also disabled causing chinese fleet to operate purely in preassigned pairs throughout battle during course of battle main part of japanese fleet concentrated fire on two ironclads but two vessels remained afloat following japanese withdrawal as darkness approached each ship had been hit by hundreds of shells but their main armour belts were zhenyuan was damaged on 7 november after hitting an unmarked reef which took her out of active service until following january thumb right zhenyuan in japanese service as chin en both ships were caught in harbour during battle of weihaiwei in early 1895 with zhenyuan only partially seaworthy they were unable to prevent capture of port s fortifications by japanese and underwent nightly attacks by torpedo boats dingyuen was hit by a torpedo and began to sink she was quickly beached where she settled into mud and continued to be used as a defensive fort admiral ruchang s flag was subsequently moved across to zhenyuan following ruchang s suicide surrender of port and fleet was arranged dingyuen was blown up by japanese forces as they were unable to salvage her although there is a suggestion following an eye witness account that she may have been mined by chinese zhenyuan was subsequently recommissioned in imperial japanese navy as chin en becoming first true battleship in fleet she was added to navy list on 16 march and subsequently rearmed as other japanese battleships joined fleet she was re rated as a second class battleship on 21 march 1898 then a first class coastal defence ship on 11 december 1905 during her time under
