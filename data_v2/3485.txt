controversial during engagement he initially refused to allow no 9 squadron to fly ammunition to d company of 6th battalion royal australian regiment after it was heavily engaged and nearly surrounded as he believed that heavy rain at time made flying too dangerous commander of 1st australian task force brigadier david jackson was angered by this decision and argued that risk of losing a few helicopters was unimportant compared to possibility of having 200 infantrymen killed if unit was overrun due to a lack of ammunition and other supplies raw eventually allowed resupply flight to proceed after most experienced of helicopter pilots present stated that mission needed to be flown regardless of its risk stephens 1995 pp 295 296 as a result of his actions during battle of long tan relationship between raw and senior army commanders in 1 atf was most difficult throughout remainder of his time in south vietnam coulthard clark 1995 p 145 nevertheless he eventually managed to

distinguished service order for his role in war clark 2007 p 31 disagreement between jackson and raw during battle of long tan had long term effects on structure of australian defence force raw s initial refusal to commit helicopters contributed to development of a long lasting perception among some army officers that raaf was reluctant to support their service in battle some members of army also wrongly believed that raaf pilots had refused to conduct supply mission and only did so after squadron was threatened with being withdrawn from south vietnam and they were spoken to forcefully by raw influenced by this perception army subsequently advocated for raaf s battlefield helicopters to be transferred to its control and this finally occurred in late 1980s mcaulay 1987 p 159 upon his return to australia raw was appointed director of operational requirements at department of air in 1969 he headed an evaluation team tasked with selecting a heavy lift helicopter for raaf team was faced with a choice between boeing ch 47 chinook and sikorsky ch 53 sea stallion and raw s final report recommended acquiring ch 53s raaf s governing air board and senior army officers rejected this recommendation and ch 47s were purchased instead after air vice marshal charles read also reviewed performance of two helicopters and concluded that chinook better met australia s needs stephens 1995
