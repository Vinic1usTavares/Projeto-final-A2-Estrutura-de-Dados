counties earliest known plank road in area of current day highway dates back to 1810 when a mail postal route was created along current day route 287 from wellsboro to willardsburg later known as tioga mail was delivered once a week on horseback for several years with service discontinued in 1818 that year service was changed to a semi weekly service for delivery two times a week on horseback in 1824 this service was also discontinued when mail route began to be used by coaches three times a week this service was used and then decommissioned by 1835 when a new system which stretched from wellsboro and past willardsburg to community of lawrenceville was established this route followed alignment of route 287 making stops in middlebury center holliday willardsburg and mitchell s creek before ending in lawrenceville this mail route was truncated back to willardsburg in 1840 when nearby corning and blossburg railroad was completed stagecoach lines started working along three day process for about ten years when nearby tioga and wellsboro plank road was completed which made stagecoaches run daily along with numerous competition service was discontinued in 1872 when lawrenceville and wellsboro railroad was completed at that time stagecoach lines has ceased operation by 1883 only piece of mail routes in area of tioga county was a piece near middlebury center but was not as large as process once was although corning and blossburg railroad had served as a good travel connection between wellsboro and lawrenceville tioga valley several communities in crooked creek valley felt they were not well accommodated at that time in locations where railroads were not a feasible option construction of plank roads became a highly popular option in 1848 pennsylvania state legislature approved and chartered construction of a brand new plank road in valley to be called tioga and elmira plank road following alignments of current day route 287 pennsylvania route 328 and new york state route 328 to elmira new york construction was unable to start in 1848 so a supplement to charter was amended on april 5 1849 which extended work period to continue until 1856 yet another supplement was added in 1850 when tioga and lawrenceville plank road was chartered on may 14 this new plank road also had ability to extend their plank road down to wellsboro which repealed acts of 1848 and 1849 plank road was contracted and completed in a timely fashion down to wellsboro from tioga in 1851 plank road was complete from wellsboro to tioga and thoroughfare became highly used by people transporting lumber agriculture and merchandise this helped farmers and producers in communities of middlebury center holliday and delmar now area of wellsboro junction plank road would
