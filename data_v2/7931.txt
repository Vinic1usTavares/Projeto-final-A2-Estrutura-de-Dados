oganesson is a synthetic chemical element with symbol og and atomic number 118 it was first synthesized in 2002 at joint institute for nuclear research jinr in dubna near moscow in russia by a joint team of russian and american scientists in december 2015 it was recognized as one of four new elements by joint working party of international scientific bodies iupac and iupap it was formally named on 28 november 2016 name is in line with tradition of honoring a scientist in this case nuclear physicist yuri oganessian who has played a leading role in discovery of heaviest elements in periodic table it is one of only two elements named after a person who was alive at time of naming other being seaborgium and only element whose namesake is alive today oganesson has highest atomic number and highest atomic mass of all known elements radioactive oganesson atom is very unstable and since 2005 only five possibly six atoms of nuclide 294og have been detected although this allowed very little experimental characterization of its properties and possible compounds theoretical calculations have resulted in many predictions including some surprising ones for example although oganesson is a member of group 18 first synthetic element to be so it may be significantly reactive unlike all other elements of that group noble gases it was formerly thought to be a gas under normal conditions but is now predicted to be a solid due to relativistic effects on periodic table of elements it is a p block element and last one of period 7 history early speculation possibility of a seventh noble gas after helium neon argon krypton xenon and radon was considered almost as soon as noble gas group was discovered danish chemist hans peter jorgen julius thomsen predicted in april 1895 year after discovery of argon that there was a whole series of chemically inert gases similar to argon that would bridge halogen and alkali metal groups he expected that seventh of this series would end a 32 element period which contained thorium and uranium and have an atomic weight of 292 close to 294 now known for first and only confirmed isotope of oganesson niels bohr noted in 1922 that this seventh noble gas should have atomic number 118 and predicted its electronic structure as 2 8 18 32 32 18 8 matching modern predictions following this aristid von grosse wrote an article in 1965 predicting likely properties of element 118 it was 107 years from thomsen s prediction before oganesson was successfully synthesised although its chemical properties have not been investigated to determine if it behaves as heavier congener of radon unconfirmed discovery claims in late 1998 polish physicist robert published calculations on fusion of atomic nuclei towards synthesis of superheavy atoms including oganesson his calculations suggested that it might be possible to make oganesson by fusing lead with krypton under carefully controlled conditions and that fusion probability cross section of that reaction would be close to lead chromium reaction that had produced element 106 seaborgium this contradicted predictions that cross sections for reactions with lead or bismuth targets would go down exponentially as atomic number of resulting elements increased in 1999 researchers at lawrence berkeley national laboratory made use of these predictions and announced discovery of livermorium and oganesson in a paper published in physical review letters and very soon after results were reported in science researchers reported that they had performed reaction following year they published a retraction after researchers at other laboratories were unable to duplicate results and berkeley lab could not duplicate them either in june 2002 director of lab announced that original claim of discovery of these two elements had been based on data fabricated by principal author victor ninov element 118 disappears two years after it was discovered com retrieved on 2 april 2012 newer experimental results and theoretical predictions have confirmed exponential decrease in cross sections with lead and bismuth targets as atomic number of resulting nuclide increases discovery reports first genuine decay of atoms of oganesson was observed in 2002 at joint institute for nuclear research jinr in dubna russia by a joint team of russian and american scientists headed by yuri oganessian a russian nuclear physicist of armenian ethnicity team included american scientists of lawrence livermore national laboratory california discovery was not announced immediately because decay energy of 294og matched that of a common impurity produced in fusion reactions aimed at producing superheavy elements and thus announcement was delayed until after a 2005 confirmatory experiment aimed at producing more oganesson atoms on 9 october 2006 researchers announced that they had indirectly detected a total of three possibly four nuclei of oganesson 294 one or two in 2002 and two more in 2005 produced via collisions of californium 249 atoms and calcium 48 ions 3 thumb left upright 0 9 alt schematic diagram of oganesson 294 alpha decay with a half life of 0 89 ms and a decay energy of 11 65

pathway of isotope oganesson 294 decay energy and average half life is given for parent isotope and each daughter isotope fraction of atoms undergoing spontaneous fission sf is given in green in 2011 iupac evaluated 2006 results of dubna livermore collaboration and concluded three events reported for z 118 isotope have very good internal redundancy but with no anchor to known nuclei do not satisfy criteria for discovery because of very small fusion reaction probability fusion cross section is or experiment took four months and involved a beam dose of calcium ions that had to be shot at californium target to produce first recorded event believed to be synthesis of oganesson nevertheless researchers were highly confident that results were not a false positive since chance that detections were random events was estimated to be less than one part in in experiments alpha decay of three atoms of oganesson was observed a fourth decay by direct spontaneous fission was also proposed a half life of 0 89 ms was calculated decays into by alpha decay since there were only three nuclei half life derived from observed lifetimes has a large uncertainty identification of nuclei was verified by separately creating putative daughter nucleus directly by means of a bombardment of with ions 3 and checking that decay matched decay chain of nuclei daughter nucleus is very unstable decaying with a lifetime of 14 milliseconds into which may experience either spontaneous fission or alpha decay into which will undergo spontaneous fission in a quantum tunneling model alpha decay half life of was predicted to be with experimental q value published in 2004 calculation with theoretical q values from macroscopic microscopic model of gives somewhat lower but comparable results confirmation one atom of heavier isotope 295og may have been seen in a 2011 experiment at gsi helmholtz centre for heavy ion research in darmstadt germany aimed at synthesis of element 120 in reaction 248cm 54cr but uncertainties in data meant that observed chain cannot be definitely assigned to and 295og data indicates for 295og a half life of 181 milliseconds longer than that of 294og which is 0 7 milliseconds in december 2015 joint working party of international scientific bodies international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac and international union of pure and applied physics iupap recognized element s discovery and assigned priority of discovery to dubna livermore collaboration discovery and assignment of elements with atomic numbers 113 115 117 and 118 iupac 30 december 2015 this was on account of two 2009 and 2010 confirmations of properties of granddaughter of 294og 286fl at lawrence berkeley national laboratory as well as observation of another consistent decay chain of 294og by dubna group in 2012 goal of that experiment had been synthesis of 294ts via reaction 249bk 48ca 3n but short half life of 249bk resulted in a significant quantity of target having decayed to 249cf resulting in synthesis of oganesson instead of tennessine from 1 october 2015 to 6 april 2016 dubna team performed a similar experiment with 48ca projectiles aimed at a mixed isotope californium target containing 249cf 250cf and 251cf with aim of producing heavier oganesson isotopes 295og and 296og two beam energies at 252 mev and 258 mev were used only one atom was seen at lower beam energy whose decay chain fitted previously known one of 294og terminating with spontaneous fission of 286fl and none were seen at higher beam energy experiment was then halted as glue from sector frames covered target and blocked evaporation residues from escaping to detectors dubna team planned to repeat this experiment in 2017 2020 production of 293og and its daughter as well as even heavier isotope 297og is also possible using this reaction isotopes 295og and 296og may also be produced in fusion of 248cm with 50ti projectiles a reaction planned at jinr and at riken in 2017 2018 a search beginning in summer 2016 at riken for 295og in 3n channel of this reaction was unsuccessful though study is planned to resume a detailed analysis and cross section limit were not provided these heavier and likely more stable isotopes may be useful in probing chemistry of oganesson naming thumb right upright 1 1 element 118 was named after yuri oganessian a pioneer in discovery of synthetic elements with name oganesson og oganessian and decay chain of oganesson 294 were pictured on a stamp of armenia issued on 28 december 2017 using mendeleev s nomenclature for unnamed and undiscovered elements oganesson is sometimes known as eka radon until 1960s as eka emanation emanation being old name for radon in 1979 iupac assigned systematic placeholder name ununoctium to undiscovered element with corresponding symbol of and recommended that it be used until after confirmed discovery of element although widely used in chemical community on all levels from chemistry classrooms to advanced textbooks recommendations were mostly ignored among scientists in field who called it element 118 with symbol of 118 or even simply 118 before retraction in 2001 researchers from berkeley had intended to name element gh after albert ghiorso a leading member of research team russian discoverers reported their synthesis in 2006 according to iupac recommendations discoverers of a new element have right to suggest a name in 2007 head of russian institute stated team were considering two names for new element in honor of georgy flyorov founder of research laboratory in dubna and in recognition of moscow oblast where dubna is located he also stated that although element was discovered as an american collaboration who provided californium target element should rightly be named in honor of russia since flyorov laboratory of nuclear reactions at jinr was only facility in world which could achieve this result these names were later suggested for element 114 flerovium and element 116 moscovium flerovium became name of element 114 final name proposed for element 116 was instead livermorium with moscovium later being proposed and accepted for element 115 instead traditionally names of all noble gases end in on with exception of helium which was not known to be a noble gas when discovered iupac guidelines valid at moment of discovery approval however required all new elements be named with ending ium even if they turned out to be halogens traditionally ending in ine or noble gases traditionally ending in on while provisional name ununoctium followed this convention a new iupac recommendation published in 2016 recommended using on ending for new group 18 elements regardless of whether they turn out to have chemical properties of a noble gas in june 2016 iupac announced that discoverers planned to give element name oganesson symbol og in honour of russian nuclear physicist yuri oganessian a pioneer in superheavy element research for sixty years reaching back to field s foundation his team and his proposed techniques had led directly to synthesis of elements 107 through 118 name became official on 28 november 2016 oganessian later commented on naming naming ceremony for moscovium tennessine and oganesson was held on 2 march 2017 at russian academy of sciences in moscow characteristics nuclear stability and isotopes thumb upright 1 8 oganesson row 118 is slightly above island of stability white circle and thus its nuclei are slightly more stable than otherwise predicted stability of nuclei quickly decreases with increase in atomic number after curium element 96 whose half life is four orders of magnitude longer than that of any subsequent element all isotopes with an atomic number above 101 undergo radioactive decay with half lives of less than 30 hours no elements with atomic numbers above 82 after lead have stable isotopes this is because of ever increasing coulomb repulsion of protons so that strong nuclear force cannot hold nucleus together against spontaneous fission for long calculations suggest that in absence of other stabilizing factors elements with more than 104 protons should not exist however researchers in 1960s suggested that closed nuclear shells around 114 protons and 184 neutrons should counteract this instability creating an island of stability where nuclides could have half lives reaching thousands or millions of years while scientists have still not reached island mere existence of superheavy elements including oganesson confirms that this stabilizing effect is real and in general known superheavy nuclides become exponentially longer lived as they approach predicted location of island oganesson is radioactive and has a half life that appears to be less than a millisecond nonetheless this is still longer than some predicted values thus giving further support to idea of this island of stability calculations using a quantum tunneling model predict existence of several neutron rich isotopes of oganesson with alpha decay half lives close to 1 ms theoretical calculations done on synthetic pathways for and half life of other isotopes have shown that some could be slightly more stable than synthesized isotope 294og most likely 293og 295og 296og 297og and 302og last reaching n 184 shell closure of these 297og might provide best chances for obtaining longer lived nuclei and thus might become focus of future work with this element some isotopes with many more neutrons such as some located around could also provide longer lived nuclei calculated atomic and physical properties oganesson is a member of group 18 zero valence elements members of this group are usually inert to most common chemical reactions for example combustion because outer valence shell is completely filled with eight electrons this produces a stable minimum energy configuration in which outer electrons are tightly bound it is thought that similarly oganesson has a closed outer valence shell in which its valence electrons are arranged in a configuration consequently some expect oganesson to have similar physical and chemical properties to other members of its group most closely resembling noble gas above it in periodic table radon following periodic trend oganesson would be expected to be slightly more reactive than radon however theoretical calculations have shown that it could be significantly more reactive in addition to being far more reactive than radon oganesson may be even more reactive than elements flerovium and copernicium which are heavier homologs of more chemically active elements lead and mercury respectively reason for possible enhancement of chemical activity of oganesson relative to radon is an energetic destabilization and a radial expansion of last occupied 7p subshell more precisely considerable spin orbit interactions between 7p electrons and inert 7s electrons effectively lead to a second valence shell closing at flerovium and a significant decrease in stabilization of closed shell of oganesson it has also been calculated that oganesson unlike other noble gases binds an electron with release of energy or in other words it exhibits positive electron affinity due to relativistically stabilized 8s energy level and destabilized 7p3 2 level whereas copernicium and flerovium are predicted to have no electron affinity nevertheless quantum electrodynamic corrections have been shown to be quite significant in reducing this affinity by decreasing binding in anion og by 9 thus confirming importance of these corrections in superheavy elements oganesson is expected to have an extremely broad polarizability almost double that of radon by extrapolating from other noble gases it is expected that oganesson has a melting point of approximately 320 k and a boiling point between 320 and 380 k this is very different from previously estimated values of 263 k or 247 k for boiling point it thus seems highly unlikely that oganesson would be a gas under standard conditions and as liquid range of other gases is very narrow between 2 and 9 kelvins this element should be solid at standard conditions nevertheless if oganesson forms a gas under standard conditions it would be one of densest gaseous substances at standard conditions even if it is monatomic like other noble gases because of its tremendous polarizability oganesson is expected to have an anomalously low first ionization energy of 860 1 kj mol similar to that of cadmium and less than those of iridium platinum and gold this is significantly smaller than values predicted for darmstadtium roentgenium and copernicium although it is greater than that predicted for flerovium even shell structure in nucleus and electron cloud of oganesson is strongly impacted by relativistic effects valence and core electron subshells in oganesson are expected to be smeared out in a homogeneous fermi gas of electrons unlike those of less relativistic radon and xenon although there is some incipient delocalisation in radon due to very strong spin orbit splitting of 7p orbital in oganesson a similar effect for nucleons particularly neutrons is incipient in closed neutron shell nucleus 302og and is strongly in force at hypothetical superheavy closed shell nucleus with 164 protons and 308 neutrons moreover spin orbit effects may cause bulk oganesson to be a semiconductor while all lighter noble gases are insulators with a band gap of 1 5 0 6 v predicted that for radon should be 7 1 0 5 v predicted compounds right upright 0 6 alt skeletal model of a planar molecule with a central atom symmetrically bonded to four peripheral fluorine atoms thumb has a square planar molecular geometry right upright 0 6 thumb alt skeletal model of a molecule with a central atom oganesson symmetrically bonded to four peripheral fluorine atoms is predicted to have a tetrahedral molecular geometry only confirmed isotope of oganesson 294og has much too short a half life to be chemically investigated experimentally therefore no compounds of oganesson have been synthesized yet nevertheless calculations on theoretical compounds have been performed since 1964 it is expected that if ionization energy of element is high enough it will be difficult to oxidize and therefore most common oxidation state would be 0 as for noble gases nevertheless this appears not to be case calculations on diatomic molecule showed a bonding interaction roughly equivalent to that calculated for and a dissociation energy of 6 kj mol roughly 4 times of that of most strikingly it was calculated to have a bond length shorter than in by 0 16 a which would be indicative of a significant bonding interaction on other hand compound ogh exhibits a dissociation energy in other words proton affinity of oganesson that is smaller than that of bonding between oganesson and hydrogen in ogh is predicted to be very weak and can be regarded as a pure van der waals interaction rather than a true chemical bond on other hand with highly electronegative elements oganesson seems to form more stable compounds than for example copernicium or flerovium stable oxidation states 2 and 4 have been predicted to exist in fluorides and 6 state would be less stable due to strong binding of 7p1 2 subshell this is a result of same spin orbit interactions that make oganesson unusually reactive for example it was shown that reaction of oganesson with to form compound would release an energy of 106 kcal mol of which about 46 kcal mol come from these interactions for comparison spin orbit interaction for similar molecule is about 10 kcal mol out of a formation energy of 49 kcal mol same interaction stabilizes tetrahedral td configuration for as distinct from square planar one of which is also expected to have this is because is expected to have two inert electron pairs 7s and 7p1 2 as such is expected to be unbound continuing an expected trend in destabilisation of 6 oxidation state is likewise expected to be much less stable than xef6 og f bond will most probably be ionic rather than covalent rendering oganesson fluorides non volatile is predicted to be partially ionic due to oganesson s high unlike other noble gases except possibly xenon and radon oganesson is predicted to be sufficiently electropositive to form an og cl bond with chlorine see also transactinide element transuranic element references
