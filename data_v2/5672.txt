7 independent company 7 coy was a short lived company of francophone volunteers in rhodesian army during rhodesian bush war numbering about 200 men at its peak it was unique in history of rhodesian army as an exclusively expatriate unit it existed between november 1977 and may 1978 as a company in 1st battalion rhodesia regiment and served two counter insurgency tours on operation hurricane in north eastern rhodesia today zimbabwe during bush war rhodesian army augmented its ranks with foreign volunteers who were accepted into regular regiments with same pay and conditions of service as locals most foreign recruits enlisted in rhodesian light infantry rli which launched an overseas recruitment programme in 1974 but required successful applicants to speak good english army attempted to alleviate strain on its troops during late 1977 by recruiting french speakers as well and formed a designated company in rhodesia regiment for them regiment already had six independent companies so francophone unit became 7 independent company company s men a mixture of former french paratroopers ex foreign legionnaires and young adventurers had trouble from start integrating with rhodesian forces and became unsettled by respective ranks they were given in rhodesian army in an attempt to raise their morale and create a strong esprit de corps army issued them beret insignias backed with french tricolour and allowed them to raise flag of france alongside that of rhodesia each morning apparently under impression that they had signed up as highly paid mercenaries many of french troopers returned home after their first bush trip unhappy to have received no more money than a regular rhodesian soldier on operations their performance was generally below par but frenchmen were involved in some successful actions during february and early march 1978 their oppressive treatment of black villagers they encountered made them very unpopular in operational area rhodesians quickly deemed experiment a failure and following a series of disasters for company during latter part of its second tour including two friendly fire incidents and several fatalities it was disbanded in may 1978 forces led by one of its members bob denard later that month executed a coup d etat in comoros with french rhodesian and south african governmental support background thumb upright 1 3 rhodesian security forces defined seven operational areas across country during 1970s starting with operation hurricane in december 1972 alt a map see description following a dispute with british government regarding terms for granting of full independence predominantly white minority government of self governing colony of rhodesia or southern rhodesia led by ian smith unilaterally declared independence on 11 november 1965 britain and united nations refused to recognise this and each imposed economic sanctions on rhodesia meanwhile country s two most prominent communist backed black nationalist groups zimbabwe african national union and zimbabwe african people s union mobilised their respective guerrilla armies zimbabwe african national liberation army zanla and zimbabwe people s revolutionary army zipra for what they called second chimurenga with goal of overthrowing government and introducing black majority rule rhodesian bush war was result beginning in earnest on 21 december 1972 when zanla attacked altena and whistlefield farms near centenary in country s north east rhodesian security forces launched operation hurricane in response and fought back strongly reducing number of guerrillas active within country to under 300 by december 1974 in period october november 1974 they killed more nationalist fighters than in previous two years combined however a south african brokered ceasefire which security forces respected and insurgents ignored helped nationalists to win back ground by 1977 there were 2 500 guerrillas operating in rhodesia with several times that number in training abroad rhodesian army though mostly made up of local men also included some foreign volunteers who were integrated into regular units under same salary and conditions of service almost all of foreigners served in rhodesian light infantry rli a heliborne commando battalion with a glamorous international reputation rli initiated a major overseas recruitment drive in 1974 targeting potential volunteers from europe oceania and americas and requiring successful applicants to speak good english this campaign was bearing considerable fruit by may 1976 when rli s largest ever intake included more foreign volunteers than any before and enlisting of men from overseas into rli would increase yet further by 1977 78 there were around 1 500 foreigners in rhodesian forces however rhodesian army remained stretched and low on manpower formation and training idea for a francophone unit came from a french national francois cramer who had business interests and connections in rhodesia he proposed it to major general sandy maclean then rhodesian army s second in command while they were visiting france together maclean relayed idea to general staff in salisbury which decided in late 1977 to form a french battalion to alleviate strain on its regular units a rhodesian officer of french extraction cyril bernard warned his superiors strongly against scheme but was ultimately himself sent to france to start project on way he stopped in zurich switzerland where maclean gave him final approval for operation and a budget of us 30 000 they resolved to recruit mainly in paris and lyon bernard then entered france and renewed old connections from french military academy at saint cyr recruitment was carried out by a former french paratrooper roger bruni operating from an apartment on rue in central paris advertisements placed in newspapers such as france soir offered a job with a future abroad minimum age 22 former non commissioned officers preferred body of men eventually assembled varied widely in terms of age background and experience but was based largely around ex paratroopers and former foreign legionnaires average age was about 25 french speaking veterans of an assortment of african and middle eastern conflicts spanning previous two decades successfully applied but past service did not prove a necessity some of men accepted had no military experience most of them spoke english only at a basic level if at all thumb unit was allowed to fly french tricolour pictured at its camp alongside flag of rhodesia alt a vertical tricolour with blue white and red stripes flies from a white flagpole before a clear blue sky once signed up each man was instructed to travel to switzerland where appropriate visas were swiftly procured from south african embassy in early november 1977 french recruits flew from zurich to johannesburg on a south african airways liner then to salisbury by air rhodesia already in rhodesia waiting for men were their leaders major roland de l assomption an ex officer of french army s crack 11th shock parachute regiment and a former officer of gabonese president omar bongo s guard and major mario la viola once a non commissioned officer in foreign legion s 2nd parachute regiment beneath them were antillean captain who became first black officer in regular rhodesian army as unit s second in command and colonel bob denard an infamous french soldier of fortune nicknamed le chien de guerre dog of war according to an anonymous veteran of unit it mostly comprised recently discharged servicemen from french forces who were having trouble adapting to civilian life they didn t know how to do anything else only how to jump with a parachute and obey orders he explained and they liked that kind of thing others he said were members of political far right who had joined up to kill commies and blacks and some were criminals hoping to escape attention of french police each signed on for two years french speaking unit was placed in rhodesia regiment rr as an independent company rr already had six of these made up of rhodesians so frenchmen became 7 independent company rhodesian army sought to forge a strong esprit de corps among new recruits and to this end extended them several sentimental allowances for example morale amongst frenchmen rose when they were informed that rhodesian insignia on their berets would be backed with french tricolour in a similar vein their request for permission to raise flag of france alongside that of rhodesia outside their headquarters each morning was approved french speaking men already in army were attached to unit to act as interpreters and assist with coordination and tactical instruction some of these were who by virtue of their upbringing spoke both english and french at a native like level company itself which numbered about 200 men was assigned headquarters near salisbury at cranborne barracks home of rhodesian light infantry it was organised in same manner as a standard rhodesian independent company only exception being its exclusively francophone personnel spirits were high during unit s brief training period as men enjoyed playing sports observing country scenery and experiencing night life of nearby capital they were not adequately trained receiving only a basic medical examination a few days fitness training and a cursory explanation of proper conduct in bush they expressed surprise when instructed to paint stripes of camouflage green on their weapons and combat boots in rhodesian fashion having never before heard of such a practice first dent to morale came after about a week when volunteers were first issued ranks in rhodesian army in eyes of some of french speaking soldiers ranks assigned appeared to have been chosen almost at random by their superiors and did not reflect their actual respective levels of training ability and experience some men who considered themselves to have been overlooked began to have problems with discipline brazen attitude of most of company s soldiers jarred strongly with that of their rhodesian commanders who had high standards regarding presentation and dress which many of frenchmen had little inclination to meet service first bush trip thumb upright 1 2 7 independent company was posted to north eastern rhodesia first to rusambo then to marymount alt a map see description francophone company was first deployed out of its barracks in late november 1977 when it was sent to about north east from salisbury for a few days in bush on operation hurricane army s operational area which covered rhodesia s north east against guerrilla activity after this passed without major incident frenchmen were despatched to rusambo a camp in tribal trust lands near about north east from capital and less than from border with mozambique most insurgents in this area belonged to zanla a company of men from territorial force was already stationed at rusambo advised by a team of intelligence officers sticks of four men three fn fal riflemen and an mag gunner would be sent out into bush from rusambo for periods of up to two weeks equipped with a radio to communicate with base their task while in action was to seek out guerrillas by means of patrolling ambushing and operating observation and listening posts once a group of insurgents was spotted stick leader would report their positions rusambo would then alert army and request a fireforce if fireforce were available it would arrive and engage cadres if not stick in field would have to handle situation itself at first men from 7 independent company were sent out in sticks mixed with territorials but problems soon arose regarding proper regimen and language barrier when frenchmen were then sent out alone their land rovers prominently flying french flag issue of language was resolved but that of indiscipline remained though discretion was paramount if they were to observe enemy movements covertly and effectively men of 7 independent company were found to have difficulty maintaining this and sometimes made careless mistakes which risked revealing their presence moreover when investigations were made of local kraals marked tension soon arose between frenchmen and local black population soldiers ignorance of english or shona made it very difficult for discussions to take place and according to other rhodesian units who came into contact with them french soldiers took out their frustration on villagers often using excessive force in their attempted interrogations police station received a report of a 7 independent company man raping a young in a dense thicket but did not act on it according to one history of rhodesia regiment it was indicated that frenchmen had received instruction that all black people were to be regarded as terrorists rhodesian army quickly deemed french experiment a failure it reassigned 7 independent company in late november to marymount mission a small settlement to east of rusambo where there was a minor police station number of patrols they would embark on was reduced two of company s vehicles were ambushed by cadres between marymount and rusambo on 6 january 1978 resulting in two men being injured one fatally so a week later another truck was surprised on same bush road resulting in one death and three serious casualties company was brought back from bush four days later for rest and recuperation r r in salisbury strike during their 15 day rest periods company s men congregated around belgian owned elizabeth hotel in centre of city at corner of causeway and manica road many of them became seriously disaffected when they first received their salary from rhodesian army having apparently been misled about wages of up to r 1 000 per month 000 by french recruiters they were surprised to find that their basic monthly pay was actually r 245 ff1 800 same as a regular rhodesian soldier moreover some were upset that they had been paid in rhodesian dollars which because of country s international isolation could not easily be exchanged for foreign currencies although it was not as much as they had been expecting one disenchanted veteran of unit afterwards admitted that tax exempt r 245 wage which came with a 10 special unit supplement was still more than enough money for them to live comfortably in salisbury during their time off pay dispute split unit about two thirds went on strike saying they would not return to action unless army upped their wages and paid them in foreign currency meanwhile some of more contented frenchmen made steps to remain permanently buying cars and having their wives join them in salisbury army detained strike s ringleaders for insubordination with neither side willing to budge army refused to give strikers extra pay or special treatment saying this would contravene rhodesia s policy not to engage mercenaries disaffected men were repatriated to france at their own request rhodesian army considered disbanding unit altogether but persevered when major de l assomption convinced his superiors that his remaining men were still loyal and eager to continue serving second bush trip dissolution starting on 11 february 1978 7 independent company spent half a week at mount darwin where there was a major army base company acquitted themselves well during this time but one of their number was badly injured in a motor accident they returned to rusambo where camp was now manned by british south africa police bsap criminal investigation department and special branch guarded by a group of coloured and indian rhodesian soldiers on 26 february frenchmen spotted a group of seven cadres indoctrinating tribespeople at a local kraal and called up fireforce rli men who arrived killed four of seven including one carrying detailed documents next day 7 independent company observed 11 guerrillas entering another kraal but this time fireforce took too long to arrive french company took part in a large contact on 1 march fighting alongside an rli fireforce against 28 cadres 18 insurgents were killed in this contact without loss for rhodesian army soon after this two sticks from 7 independent company were despatched to marymount led by a deputy intelligence officer who began sending them out on more regular night patrols following months were a disaster for locally based rhodesian forces first one stick fired on another causing an injury then a bsap land rover hit a mine killing two members of french company a further frenchman died in an ambush by insurgents before another friendly fire incident on 19 april 1978 resulted in a fatality on several occasions during this bush trip area was frozen regular army units were confined to their camps while selous scouts operated against guerrillas with morale amongst frenchmen plummeting bringing their unit close to collapse its officers at rusambo frantically worked to keep it together company did not last much longer once back in salisbury for r r soon after three of its troopers were placed in detention at barracks unit was formally dissolved in may 1978 only personnel retained by army were interpreters who were returned to their former units legacy thumb rhodesia green and comoros red alt a map see description supported by french rhodesian and south
