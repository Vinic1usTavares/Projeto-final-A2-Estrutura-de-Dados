and theoktistos in 855 he engineered theoktistos s murder and became de facto regent for his nephew michael iii rising to rank of caesar he was effective ruler of byzantine empire for ten years a period which saw military success renewed diplomatic and missionary activity and an intellectual revival that heralded macedonian renaissance he was assassinated in 866 at instigation of michael iii s new favourite basil macedonian who a year later would usurp throne for himself and install his own dynasty on byzantine throne biography early life bardas was born to droungarios marinos and and was elder brother of empress theodora wife of emperor theophilos and of petronas three other sisters maria sophia and irene are recorded by theophanes continuatus family was of armenian origin and had settled in paphlagonia some modern genealogists including cyril toumanoff and nicholas have suggested a link of bardas family with armenian noble clan of mamikonian according to nina garsoian in oxford dictionary of byzantium however a though it is this thesis cannot be proven for want of sources thumb 250px michael iii with theodora and theoktistos from madrid skylitzes in 837 theophilos raised him to rank of patrikios and sent him together with general theophobos in a campaign against abasgians but byzantines were defeated with death of theophilos his son michael iii ascended throne as he was only two years old a regency council was set up headed by theodora bardas and his brother petronas as well as their relative sergios were also members but it was logothete theoktistos who quickly established himself as theodora s chief advisor bardas still played an active role in early days of regency encouraging theodora to abandon iconoclasm for good and taking part in investigations that led to deposition of pro iconoclast patriarch john grammarian and restoration of veneration of icons in 843 bardas was quickly sidelined by theoktistos however according to symeon logothete theoktistos blamed bardas for desertions that led to byzantine defeat in battle of mauropotamos against abbasids in 844 even though logothete himself had led byzantine army as a result of these accusations bardas was exiled from constantinople for an undetermined period of time following bardas s exile and death of sergios theoktistos ruled supreme alongside theodora for a decade in 855 michael iii turned fifteen and thus came nominally of age his mother and theoktistos arranged a bride show and selected eudokia as his bride disregarding michael s attachment to his mistress eudokia ingerina bardas used michael s resentment for high handed manner in which he was treated and began to turn him against regency with michael s backing bardas was allowed to return to capital and on 20 november 855 theoktistos was murdered this was possibly done at emperor s behest for bardas is said to have favoured a more elegant removal of his rival ascendancy and fall with death of theoktistos regency was at an end in early 856 michael proclaimed his assumption of full imperial power and in 857 theodora was forced to retire to monastery nevertheless as michael was more interested in his pleasures and his continuing affair with eudokia ingerina bardas now became de facto regent of empire by he was promoted to highest state offices magistros and tou followed by his promotion to kouropalates according to symeon logothete this happened after a failed assassination attempt masterminded by theodora and finally on 22 or 26 april 862 to caesar dominance of bardas is corroborated by non byzantine sources al tabari records that arab envoys negotiated with bardas rather than emperor and bar hebraeus writes that during an audience with an arab embassy michael did not utter a single word with his cousin most likely bardas speaking on his behalf petronas also emerged from obscurity at same time becoming strategos of thracesian theme and leading a series of successful raids against arabs although later sources are critical of his character describing him as vain avaricious and power hungry his capabilities as an administrator are widely acknowledged thus bardas founded magnaura school with seats for philosophy grammar astronomy and mathematics supported scholars like leo mathematician and promoted missionary activities of cyril and methodius to greater moravia he also scored a number of successes against arabs in east culminating in decisive battle of lalakaon in 863 and enforced christianization of bulgaria by byzantine missionaries patria of constantinople praise him also for his building activity but aside from a church dedicated to saint demetrius outside city itself most of buildings attributed to him were probably work of basil i macedonian in 858 bardas deposed patriarch ignatios and appointed photios well educated but a layman in his stead later chronicles report that ignatios had excluded bardas from communion because he maintained an incestuous relationship with one of his daughters in law but real reason for ignatios s deposition was probably patriarch s staunch refusal to tonsure empress theodora against her will as demanded by bardas irregular elevation of photios however riled with pope nicholas i who refused to recognize it coupled with competition between rome and constantinople over their missionary activities in and jurisdiction over moravia and bulgaria relations with papacy remained tense thumb right 250px assassination of bardas with michael looking on from madrid skylitzes despite his great authority bardas s control over his nephew was not absolute after he managed to persuade him to dismiss his old chamberlain parakoimomenos damian michael appointed to post not one of bardas s own
