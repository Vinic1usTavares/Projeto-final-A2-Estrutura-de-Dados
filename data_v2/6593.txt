magazine described henry petre and eric harrison as fathers of military aviation in australia petre s obituary in times called him an air pioneer who founded australian flying corps though harrison through his longer association with australian service flying as a founding member of royal australian air force in 1921 and his career up until end of world war ii was generally regarded as father of raaf until air marshal richard williams assumed that mantle douglas gillison considered petre equally entitled to such an accolade in his volume on air force for australian centenary history of defence in 2001 alan stephens noted that petre made greater contribution to establishment of point cook and central flying school concluding that perhaps any judgement would not only be moot but also gratuitous as by circumstance and achievement both men properly belong in pantheon of raaf notes references category 1884 births category 1962 deaths category petre family category australian flying
