28th maori battalion more commonly known as maori battalion was an infantry battalion of new zealand army that served during second world war it was formed following pressure on labour government by some maori members of parliament mps and maori organisations throughout country which wanted a full maori unit to be raised for service overseas maori battalion followed in footsteps of maori pioneer battalion that served during first world war with success and was wanted by maori to raise their profile and to serve alongside their pakeha compatriots as subjects of british empire it also gave a generation of people with a well noted military ancestry a chance to test their modern warrior skills raised in 1940 as part of second new zealand expeditionary force 2nzef 28th maori battalion was attached to 2nd new zealand division as an extra battalion that was moved between division s three infantry brigades battalion fought during greek north african and italian campaigns during which it earned a formidable reputation as a fighting force which has subsequently been acknowledged by both allied and german commanders it was also most decorated new zealand battalion during war following end of hostilities battalion contributed a contingent of personnel to serve in japan as part of british commonwealth occupation force before being disbanded in january 1946 history formation 28th maori battalion had its origins before start of second world war in mid 1939 as war in europe began to be seen as inevitable sir ngata started to discuss proposals for formation of a military unit made up of maori volunteers similar to maori pioneer battalion that had served during first world war this proposal was furthered by two maori mps eruera and and from this support within maori community for idea began to grow as it was seen as an opportunity for maori to participate as citizens of british empire and to test their warrior skills at first new zealand government was hesitant but on 4 october decision was announced that proposal would be accepted and that battalion would be raised in addition to nine battalions and support units that had already been formed into three brigades of 2nd new zealand division nevertheless it was decided that battalion s key positions including its officers non commissioned officers ncos and signallers would initially be filled largely by new zealanders of european descent this decision was met with some consternation so assurances were made that over time suitable maori candidates would take over these positions in this regard it was decided that battalion s first commanding officer would be a regular officer major george dittmer later promoted to lieutenant colonel in january 1940 and that his second in command would be a reserve officer lieutenant colonel george bertrand a part maori who would take up position with rank of major both men were veterans of first world war and had considerable experience almost immediately effort was focused upon selecting and identifying officers and ncos to this end volunteers were called for among units that had already formed as part of 2nd new zealand expeditionary force 2nzef and from new recruits at end of november 146 trainees reported to army school at trentham where even serving officers and ncos were required to prove their suitability for positions in new battalion concurrently recruiting of men to fill other ranks positions began in early october and within three weeks nearly 900 men had enlisted process was carried out by recruiting officers who worked closely with tribal authorities and recruits were restricted to single men aged between 21 and 35 although later married men were allowed to join but only if they did not have more than two children of similar ages on 26 january 1940 battalion came together for first time marking its official raising at palmerston north show grounds upon formation it was decided that battalion would be organised upon tribal lines unit consisted of a headquarters company and four rifle companies designated a through d a company kamupene a nga kiri was recruited from northland to auckland b company

maniapoto hawkes bay wellington and south island as well as some pacific islands and chatham and stewart islands february saw issuing of equipment and commencement of training punctuated by medical inspections and dental treatment as well as ceremonial duties surrounding commemoration of treaty of waitangi a lack of previous experience in technical trades also hampered battalion s training as unit was short of men who were able to serve in roles such as clerks drivers and signallers most personnel were drawn from mainly rural backgrounds consequently candidates for these roles had to be trained from scratch organisation of battalion was finally completed in march when men were allocated to their respective companies and on 13 march 1940 28th maori battalion was declared on active service after 14 days leave battalion conducted a five week concentration period before embarking on 1 may 1940 battalion s strength at this time was 39 officers and 642 other ranks united kingdom sailing upon aquitania via fremantle and cape town battalion arrived at gourock scotland after six weeks at sea initially they had been destined to join rest of 2nd new zealand division in middle east but due to concerns about a possible invasion of united kingdom by german wehrmacht decision was made to divert division s second echelon a brigade sized force that included 28th maori battalion to britain to help bolster island s defences in late june or early july 1940 28th maori battalion was attached to a mixed brigade under brigadier harold barrowclough during this time they manned defences in south of england and undertook further training battalion suffered from a lack of equipment largely due to priority given to re equip british units following losses suffered by british expeditionary force in france and consequently training was largely focused upon anti gas procedures and route marching on 6 july they were inspected by king george vi and he was said to have been impressed by smartness of close order and arms drill of maori battalion and by fine physique keenness and determined demeanour of men thumb maori battalion officers arriving at gourock scotland on 17

manoeuvres in earnest as fears of invasion grew in between exercises further training was undertaken and battalion also worked to improve fixed defences throughout july august and into september these exercises varied in size from company to battalion level and involved differing scenarios and enemy forces in september a divisional review was undertaken and amidst massive german air raids upon london new zealanders were declared to be ready for front line service in event of a german landing warning orders for deployment to egypt were cancelled and new zealanders were placed under command of xii corps taking up defensive positions in folkestone dover region in october maori battalion was attached to under dittmer s command along with a squadron of tanks a squadron of cavalry and a medium machine gun company following month with an invasion now considered unlikely battalion returned to aldershot for winter remaining there for two months during this time limited training was undertaken although upon invitation battalion fielded a rugby team against a welsh side at langley park losing 12 3 later in month battalion received order to begin preparing for redeployment to egypt and an advance party was dispatched in mid december on 7 january 1941 rest of battalion left for middle east embarking from liverpool on athlone castle middle east after sailing via freetown cape town and durban athlone castle sailed up east coast of africa and entered suez canal arriving at tewfik harbour on 3 march 1941 in afternoon battalion entrained and two days later they arrived in desert where they were met by motor transport which carried them to camp about from cairo at this point they were met by about 300 reinforcements which were used to replace men who had been laid down with influenza and to bring battalion up to a higher establishment shortly afterwards they were moved to alexandria where they embarked on bound for greece greece on 6 april german invasion of greece and yugoslavia began in order to help defend greece a composite force of three divisions of australian british and new zealand troops were to be deployed and were grouped together under title of w force however by time invasion began only two of three divisions had arrived and new zealanders were consequently spread thin holding a position to north of katerini where they were tasked to defend strategic olympus pass to south during this time 28th maori battalion was attached to 5th infantry brigade which was later grouped with other australian and new zealand units to form anzac corps vastly outnumbered within two days situation for allies was not good as germans had broken through defences along bulgarian border and yugoslav resistance had collapsed as situation worsened orders came down from brigade headquarters that passes would be held to last man and last round thumb left map depicting relative positions on 15 april 1941 alt a map depicting movement of defensive lines

position digging in and constructing defences until 12 april when they were ordered to withdraw behind mavroneri gorge and reposition themselves on western aspect at this time 5th infantry brigade s orders were changed from a holding action to a delay and withdrawal it was in petra pass alongside 22nd battalion that 28th battalion fought its first engagement of war in preparation for coming attack maori built their position running out barbed and concertina wire and digging in while german bombers overhead during night they carried out patrols along mavroneri riverbed but no contact was made following morning divisional cavalry which had been carrying out a rearguard action conducted a withdrawal through battalion s position making maori battalion most forward allied unit as german forces were halted at platamon by 21st battalion thrusts towards larisa once again put battalion s position in doubt and they were again ordered to withdraw meanwhile anzac corps decided to make its last stand south at thermopylae in end maori remained in position until 17 april throughout previous two days battalion worked hard to repel repeated attempts by elements of german 2nd infantry regiment to infiltrate their lines before they finally received order to fall back with isolated platoons still in contact with germans and amidst high winds and a heavy downpour of rain new zealanders had difficulty disengaging withdrawing over difficult terrain towards pass manoeuvre continued into night as germans continued to harass their rearguard units move was carried out with considerable urgency because intention was to blow a bridge up just after battalion had withdrawn across it in order to delay german advance in end battalion only just made it for engineers tasked with carrying out demolition had received order to complete their task and were about to detonate when battalion arrived shortly after 3 00 am after meeting motor transport battalion moved back to ay which they began to prepare to defend in order to help seal off exit of olympus pass withdrawal continued though and on 19 april maori battalion was called upon to conduct a delaying action as rest of 5th infantry brigade pulled back through larisa towards lamia south along roads packed with vehicles and civilian traffic they withdrew amidst considerable confusion upon arrival at thermopylae battalion had had just enough time to dig in before receiving order that they were to move their position in order to make way for 6th infantry brigade they completed this move by 21 april taking up same positions that leonidas and his army had defended against xerxes in 480 bc according to legend here they took up position in a marsh and as they made preparations for its defence on 22 april in athens decision was made that units of british commonwealth forces would be withdrawn from country over course of next two days battalion withdrew towards athens where they arrived in early morning on 24 april they continued on to beach at porto rafti destroying their vehicles and other equipment as they went in confusion of orders and counter orders battalion s carrier and mortar platoons had gotten separated from rest of unit by 9 00 pm on 24 april when final move to beach commenced they still had not arrived operation went according to plan however and by 3 00 am on 25 april transports embarked of various groups that had become detached from battalion some were able to make their own way to embarkation beaches but a number of them were ultimately captured battalion s casualties in greece were 10 killed or died of wounds six wounded 83 captured 11 wounded and captured crete after being evacuated from greece maori battalion embarked upon landing ship infantry and was taken to crete where they formed part of island s hastily formed garrison 5th infantry brigade was allocated to area surrounding airfield and battalion was positioned on north coast at on brigade s right flank on 20 may 1941 germans launched opening stages of their campaign with large scale glider and parachute drops of troops from maleme to canea landings were focused around airfield and no troops landed in area being held by maori nevertheless a small force of glider troops were found to be occupying a house on beach about from them a platoon was dispatched to attack them and after a brief fire fight

commander brigadier j hargest sent one company from 23rd and one from 28th task was given to b company and as company commander only knew direct route they had a night approach march of over to cover during march they came in contact with a platoon sized force of germans which briefly held up company before reinforcements could arrive german force surrendered but in doing so one of their number threw a grenade at new zealanders wounding two men in response maori fixed bayonets and carried out first bayonet charge by a new zealand force during war killing 24 a short while later they killed another eight in a separate engagement continuing on towards 22nd battalion they bumped into a number of small pockets of germans before eventually linking up with 22nd battalion s headquarters where they were told to return to their own lines as decision had been made to withdraw from airfield eleven hours later company reported back to 28th battalion s lines over course of next ten days battalion was involved in a series of engagements as they fought to defend island with most notable probably being bayonet charge that they undertook with australian 2 7th battalion at 42nd street on 27 may in which 280 germans were killed with maori accounting for 100 however it soon became clear that garrison on crete would need to be evacuated and on 28 may bulk of creforce began to disengage germans and begin retreat towards sfakia 5th infantry brigade took turns with two australian battalions and commandos of layforce to carry out a rearguard action to guard pass through which troops had to traverse in order to escape on 30 may final order was received although due to shipping losses it was not possible to evacuate everyone in order to maintain fairness each battalion was allotted a certain number of men who would have to remain and defend embarkation beaches to allow others to get away 28th battalion was allocated 230 men to embark while six officers and 144 men would have to stay behind a large number of men volunteered to remain and at midnight remainder headed down to beach and were taken off on a landing ship two hours later battalion suffered 243 casualties during brief defence of island including 74 men killed and 102 men wounded a further 67 were captured of which 46 were wounded for his leadership of battalion during fighting on crete dittmer received

unfamiliar task of road construction in october brigade received orders to link up with rest of division in preparation for their commitment to battle along frontier on 11 november 1941 5th infantry brigade concentrated near mersa matruh three days later division had assembled and began advance into libya their first task was to capture seaside town of sollum which was taken on 23 november from its italian garrison with only a few casualties follow up artillery inflicted 18 killed and 33 wounded however including commanding officer lieutenant colonel george dittmer and two company commanders two hundred and forty seven italian prisoners were taken following this 5th infantry brigade was placed under command of 4th indian division and 28th battalion took up positions near bardia three days later battalion attacked a column of tanks and motorised infantry before ambushing a column at menastir on 3 december later notable actions were undertaken at gazala and at sidi where over 1 000 italians prisoners were captured following this battalion was deployed to syria before returning to egypt in june 1942 now officially under command of a maori for first time lieutenant colonel eruera love having taken over from dyer in may maori took part in 2nd new zealand division s breakout from minqar qaim undertaking a successful bayonet charge at this time battalion s skills with bayonet earned them a reputation as scalp hunters among german commanders including rommel in september and october battalion took part in important actions as part of offensive in depression and at ridge during second battle of el alamein on 2 november battalion supported final breakthrough by allied forces that decided outcome of battle casualties were high during this time and three of its commanding officers were either killed or wounded between july and november 1942 nevertheless battalion remained in fighting and in march 1943 at medenine it undertook a defensive role before switching to offensive at point 209 in tebaga gap where it was responsible for almost completely destroying a german panzer grenadier battalion it was during this action that second lieutenant moana nui a kiwa ngarimu performed deeds that led to him being posthumously decorated with victoria cross battalion s commanding officer lieutenant colonel charles bennett also received distinguished service order for his leadership during attack two weeks later on night 19 20 april 1943 battalion took part in 5th infantry brigade s attack on tunisian village of takrouna village was situated atop a steep slope and attack stalled due to heavy concentrations of indirect fire and landmines which wounded a number of men including commanding officer nevertheless two sections under command of sergeant haane te manahi managed to scale western side of escarpment and gain a foothold on pinnacle in early dawn following heavy shellfire and hand to hand combat with italian defenders maori were forced off pinnacle twice each time though manahi led his small force in a counterattack in afternoon manahi and two other men captured a number of machine gun and mortar positions encircling italians and forcing them to surrender for these actions manahi was also recommended for a victoria cross but nomination was not approved and he received a distinguished conduct medal instead italy battalion returned to egypt with 5th infantry brigade in late may and underwent a period of refit and retraining during which bulk of original unit was given three months leave and returned to new zealand following evacuation to hospital of lieutenant colonel keiha there were no suitable senior maori officers available and he was replaced as commanding officer by lieutenant colonel monty fairbrother on 11 september having taken no part in allied invasion of sicily in july august 2nd new zealand division was committed to battle again in late 1943 as part of eighth army during italian campaign maori battalion subsequently arrived in italy on 22 october landing at taranto 5th infantry brigade undertook a period of training in close country tactics remaining in camp at taranto until 18 november when it was ordered to move north to join eighth army 2nd new zealand division had moved into front line in november in order to relieve 8th indian division and would take part in advance across sangro planned for end of month brigade subsequently occupied positions around with maori battalion in brigade reserve occupying a series of low hills which formed sangro river valley eighth army s forward units had reached sangro in early november and general harold alexander commander of 15th army group had planned for lieutenant general bernard montgomery to strike across river on its coastal

occupying positions east of meanwhile on 3 december 6th infantry brigade assaulted orsogna and was involved in heavy fighting there first capturing and then losing it following a counter attack by german armour a subsequent attack against orsogna was planned by new zealanders utilising both 5th and 6th infantry brigades attack was scheduled for 7 december with both brigades to advance on a one battalion front maori battalion would lead assault in 5th infantry brigade section up pascuccio spur to cut orsogna ortona road east of 6th infantry brigade s objective fairbrother planned to assault with two companies forward one in depth and one in reserve with support from armour and anti tank guns this could not be provided though as difficult terrain prevented tracked vehicles from moving across moro and up on to pascuccio attack on orsogna began at 3 30 pm following a half hour artillery bombardment and marked battalion s first battle on italian soil although initially some progress was made germans managed to hold orsogna throughout december amidst intense hand to hand fighting finally maori were withdrawn from line on night of 15 16 january 1944 when they were relieved by an indian unit over course of battle they had lost 11 men killed and 222 wounded new zealanders were subsequently transferred to fifth army for its advance up west coast of italy towards rome leaving behind bitter cold on other side of peninsula battalion undertook a period of training and reorganisation near sant angelo d at this time fairbrother was replaced by another pakeha officer major russell young who was promoted to lieutenant colonel and subsequently led battalion until july 1944 as part of fifth army s advance up liri valley maori battalion s next major engagement came in early 1944 when they took part in fighting around monte cassino position at cassino was dominated by an historic benedictine monastery throughout january allies continued their advance but as they were checked by german positions at cassino advance stalled on night of 17 18 february 1944 as part of an attempt to establish a bridgehead into german lines maori were tasked with attacking railway station in cassino they met very stiff resistance and although they managed to reach railway station they were unable to wrest control of it from its defenders lacking armoured support which had failed to arrive they fought through morning and into afternoon but when their position was assaulted by two german tanks they were forced to withdraw two assaulting companies a and b suffered over 60 per cent casualties losing 128 men killed or wounded in march they were again involved in fighting around cassino however it was not until may that position was eventually captured by which time new zealanders had been withdrawn from line and transferred back to eighth army due to these losses battalion did not return to front until july 1944 it subsequently took part in allied advance towards florence and is believed to have been first to reach city on 4 august during this time major arapeta awatere led battalion as its acting commanding officer after young was hospitalised with jaundice although he returned in late august and subsequently led them through fighting around rimini in september in november awatere took over command substantively and in december battalion launched an attack around faenza for which its commanding officer later received a distinguished service order winter snow set in after this and as allied attentions were temporarily focused elsewhere offensive action died down thus throughout january february and into march battalion undertook defensive duties before being withdrawn from line in mid march in april 1945 battalion returned to front line to take part in final stages of war on 1 april battalion entered line near along with rest of 5th infantry brigade and for next month they were involved in five main battles along senio santerno and idice rivers as allies pursued germans back towards trieste it was in trieste that maori battalion s war came to an end their involvement in final stages of fighting in italy had cost them 25 killed and 117 wounded while losses for entire italian campaign were 230 men killed and 887 wounded disbandment on 2 may 1945 news was received that all german forces west of isonzo river had surrendered while this did not officially end fighting in italy it was all but over five days later on night of 7 may battalion received news that germany had surrendered unconditionally to allies and that war in europe was over nevertheless tensions remained high and concerns about intentions of yugoslavia regarding disputed province of istria meant that 28th maori battalion remained on high alert this continued until early june when an agreement was reached and yugoslavia withdrew its troops east of isonzo river following this routine of battalion became more settled and time was found for men of each company to spend a fortnight at a hotel on beach afterwards preparations began for battalion s return to new zealand war with japan continued however and at time it was believed that maori would take part in further operations in pacific new zealand policy at time was that long serving men were to be repatriated and their places taken by men with less time in service in this regard commencing in late may drafts of men departed in order of their arrival at battalion this included commanding officer lieutenant colonel arapeta awatere who was replaced by lieutenant colonel james henare throughout july battalion undertook garrison duties in trieste before 2nd new zealand division was withdrawn to lake trasimene on 15 august 1945 news was received of japan s unconditional surrender ending plans for battalion to take part in further combat in pacific in september it was decided that as part of departure of new zealand troops from theatre memorial services would be held at locations of division s major battles as a part of this program services were held at cassino and sangro and on crete while smaller parties were sent to coriano ridge faenza forli padua monfalcone and udine last batch of long service men had departed shortly after battalion s arrival at lake trasimene and so after this it was decided that battalion would return to new zealand as a formed unit as such their return was to be delayed and so they found winter quarters in florence at this time it was decided that men from battalion would be included within new zealand contribution to occupation of japan in this vein a 270 strong contingent from battalion was sent to japan under designation of d squadron 2nd divisional cavalry battalion under command of major j s baker finally on 6 december battalion entrained at florence and embarked on troopship at taranto on boxing day passing through suez canal they sailed via fremantle arriving in wellington on 23 january 1946 where they were met by acting prime minister walter nash at aotea quay for an official maori welcome home ceremony afterwards men were sent back to their homes and battalion was disbanded throughout course of war 3 600 men served in battalion of these 649 were killed or died of wounds while another 1 712 were wounded another 29 died as a result of service following discharge while two were killed by accident during training in new zealand maori battalion s service against germans in north africa earned them a distinguished reputation such was respect that allied commanders had for maori battalion that they were frequently used as a spearhead unit bernard freyberg general officer commanding of 2nzef commented no infantry had a more distinguished record or saw more fighting or alas had such heavy casualties as maori battalion battalion s reputation was also acknowledged by their opponents some sources state that afrika korps commander erwin rommel remarked give me maori battalion and i will conquer world other sources attribute this comment to rommel s former chief of staff general siegfried westphal who met with former maori battalion chaplain reverend canon wiremu t huata during an afrika korps reunion dinner in mainz germany in 1972 decorations in total maori battalion received more individual bravery decorations than any other new zealand battalion one member of battalion second lieutenant moana nui a kiwa ngarimu was awarded victoria cross during war while another member sergeant haane manahi was also recommended for award during fighting around takrouna in 1943 manahi led a section of men up a sheer limestone escarpment to capture a number of italian positions following day he set out to capture italian outposts four generals including harold alexander bernard freyberg howard kippenberger and bernard law montgomery had recommended that manahi receive victoria cross but this recommendation was downgraded in london to distinguished conduct medal cody 1956 p 502 in 2000 iwi te arawa lodged a claim with waitangi tribunal for haane manahi to have his award of distinguished conduct medal upgraded to a victoria cross in december 2005 waitangi tribunal released their findings supporting claim but in october 2006 new zealand minister of defence announced that award could not be made as king george vi had ruled in 1949 that no further awards from second world war ought to be made instead it was decided that manahi would be recognised by presentation of an altar cloth a personal letter from queen elizabeth ii acknowledging his gallantry and a sword award was presented to manahi s son by duke of york on 17 march 2007 at a ceremony in rotorua other awards to members of 28th maori battalion included seven distinguished service orders one member of order of british empire
