victoria line is a london underground line that runs between in south london and in north east via west end it is coloured light blue on tube map and is one of only two lines on network to run completely underground other being waterloo city line line was constructed in 1960s and was first entirely new underground line in london for 50 years it was designed to reduce congestion on other lines particularly piccadilly line and branch of northern line first section from walthamstow central to opened in september 1968 and an extension to followed in december line was completed to victoria station in march 1969 and was opened by queen elizabeth ii who rode a train from green park to victoria southern extension to brixton opened in 1971 and pimlico station was added in 1972 victoria line is operated using automatic train operation but all trains still carry drivers 2009 tube stock replaced original 1967 tube stock trains line serves 16 stations and all but pimlico provide interchanges with other underground lines or national rail services line most intensively used on underground is used by over 200 million passengers each year history thumb 400px geographically accurate map of victoria line alt geographically accurate map of victoria line planning first proposal for a railway in this area appeared in county of london plan published in 1943 in 1948 a working party set up by british transport commission btc proposed a tube railway from victoria to walthamstow largely based on a 1946 plan for a croydon to finsbury park line its main purpose was to relieve congestion in central area which had been a problem since 1930s other benefits were linking key railway stations at and and improving connections between north east london and city in early 1949 btc committee looked at feasibility of building a deep level tube to fulfil these requirements for first time cost benefit analysis was used to ensure line would be built within budget and be profitable private bill was introduced in parliament in 1955 it described a line from victoria to walthamstow next to british rail station another proposal not in bill supported an extension from victoria to fulham broadway on district line terminating at edmonton instead of walthamstow proposals were made to extend line north to south woodford or woodford to provide interchange with central line in 1961 it was decided to terminate line at walthamstow hoe street station which was renamed on 6 may 1968 in anticipation of line s opening line was planned to have cross platform interchanges at oxford circus euston and with bakerloo northern bank and piccadilly lines respectively and at walthamstow central to provide a quick and easy connection between new line and existing services name victoria line dates from 1955 other suggestions were line walthamstow victoria viking line victoria king s cross mayfair line and west end line during planning stages it was known as route c and named victoria line after station by david mckenna whose suggestion was seconded by sir john elliot board decided that victoria line sounded just right walthamstow victoria initial construction began in january 1960 when two test tunnels were started from tottenham to manor house under seven sisters road tunnels were excavated using an experimental drum digger rotary shield powered by hydraulic rams that could cut more than per day work was completed in july 1961 with expectation it would be used for completed victoria line after line gained parliamentary approval on 20 august 1962 with a budget of ps56 million construction began following month economic boom of mid to late 1950s had faded leading to a rise in unemployment in london and government had hoped that building victoria line would stop this work began adapting oxford circus station to link to new line a cross platform interchange was provided with bakerloo line and a subway link with central line a steel umbrella was erected over junction in august 1963 so that a new ticket hall could be built without disrupting existing traffic rolling stock on line was fitted with automatic train operation ato which allowed self driving of train based on automatic electrical signals along track in march 1964 a ps2 25 million contract was awarded to metro cammell for victoria line fleet that october northern city line closed between and so that latter station could be redesigned for a cross platform interchange between victoria and piccadilly lines all major contracts had been awarded by 1965 and construction was on track to be completed in 1968 new stations were constructed at walthamstow central and station at blackhorse road was built on opposite side of mainline station serving kentish town to barking line and was not an interchange line opened from walthamstow central to on 1 september 1968 there was no opening ceremony instead normal timetable started first train left walthamstow central for highbury islington at 7 32 a m line proved to be popular more than 1 000 tickets were purchased at highbury islington within its first hour of opening next section to warren street opened on 1 december 1968 again without ceremony line was formally opened by queen elizabeth ii on 7 march 1969 when it had been completed to victoria at 11 00 a m queen made first trip from green park to victoria on a 5d 2 08p ticket where she unveiled a plaque in so doing she was first reigning monarch to ride on underground line was open to general public by 3 00 p m trains from walthamstow to victoria took around 24 minutes victoria brixton thumb pimlico station was last part of victoria line to open and is line s only station that is not an interchange extension from victoria to brixton with stations at and stockwell was approved in march 1966 preparatory work had started at gardens near vauxhall bridge road in may 1967 contract was awarded on 4 august 1967 a proposal to build pimlico tube station received government approval on 28 june 1968 in july prince of wales and duke of edinburgh visited tunnel workings under vauxhall park brixton extension was bored using older greathead shield although slower use of tunnelling shield allowed easier digging through gravel strata south of thames it was opened by princess alexandra on 23 july 1971 who made a journey from brixton to on opening it was first new section of underground to open south of thames since extension of city and south london railway from clapham common to morden in 1926 final piece of victoria line pimlico station opened on 14 september 1972 london transport considered extensions to streatham dulwich and crystal palace to provide a connection to southeast london and kent but no construction work was undertaken post opening kentish town barking line did not close as expected and both stations at blackhorse road remained open mainline was connected to victoria line on 14 december 1981 when surface line platforms and a connecting overbridge were built on same side as tube station original station was then closed and demolished london underground victoria act 1991 allowed for construction of a underground pedestrian link at victoria station between victoria line platforms and sub surface circle line platforms above london underground victoria station upgrade order 2009 came into force in september that year authorising construction of a second ticket hall at victoria on 23 january 2014 during upgrade work at victoria construction workers accidentally penetrated signalling room of victoria line and flooded it with quick drying concrete leading to suspension of services south of warren street services resumed following day after using sugar to slow setting of concrete and make it easier to shovel out a 24 hour night tube service on friday and saturday nights due to start in september 2015 on entire line was delayed because of strike action service started in august 2016 with trains running at 10 minute intervals on whole line design every victoria line station apart from pimlico and blackhorse road was built as an interchange and several stations were rearranged to allow for cross platform interchange with line in some stations victoria line platforms were built on either side of existing arrangement in others victoria line uses older platforms and existing line was diverted onto a new alignment all platforms on line are long line has hump backed stations to allow trains to store gravitational potential energy as they slow down and release it when they leave a station providing an energy saving of 5 and allowing trains run 9 faster stations were originally tiled in blue and grey each decorated with tiled motifs in seating recesses for identification some motifs were puns e g image for brixton was a ton of bricks during construction of first stage of jubilee line in 1979 motifs on green park station were replaced by others matching design for jubilee line platforms in late 2010 and 2011 platform humps were installed on all victoria line stations except pimlico to provide step free access to trains project was in accordance with rail vehicle accessibility non interoperable rail system regulations 2010 and disability discrimination act 1995 victoria line humps resemble harrington hump a type of ramp being installed on some mainline stations but are of a masonry construction service and rolling stock thumb left line s original 1967 stock was used until mid 2011 it is seen here at on a farewell tour alt 1967 stock at holborn about 200 million passengers a year use victoria line it is sixth most heavily used line on network in absolute figures but in terms of average number of journeys per mile it is by far most intensively used from may 2017 trains run every 100 seconds during peak periods providing 36 trains per hour all trains run from brixton to seven sisters and some continue to walthamstow central when line opened services were operated by a fleet of eight car trains of 1967 tube stock trains in early planning stages an articulated type of rolling stock was considered but not progressed because of difficulties transferring stock to acton works for heavy overhauls after acton works closed this no longer applies 2009 tube stock has a wider profile and slightly longer carriages which precludes it from running on other deep level tube lines 1967 stock was supplemented by 1972 mark i tube stock transferred from northern line and converted to be compatible with 1967 stock thumb 2009 tube stock at victoria line s

transportation testing first prototypes began in 2008 trains began to be introduced in 2009 and most were in operation by following year last of 1967 stock trains ran on 30 june 2011 after which service was provided by 2009 stock on opening line was equipped with a fixed block automatic train operation system ato train operator closed train doors and pressed a pair of start buttons and if way ahead was clear ato drives train at a safe speed to next station at any point driver could switch to manual control if ato failed system which operated until 2012 made victoria line world s first full scale automatic railway victoria line runs faster trains than other underground lines because it has fewer stops ato running and modern design train speeds can reach up to a popular way for locals in north london to visit west end is to take northern line to bank change platforms at euston and continue on faster victoria line trains original signalling has been replaced with a more modern ato system from westinghouse rail systems incorporating distance to go radio and more than 400 track circuits track operator london underground limited claimed it is world s first ato on ato upgrade new system allowed a revised timetable to be introduced in february 2013 allowing up to 33 trains per hour instead of 27 in combination with new faster trains line s capacity increased by 21 equivalent to an extra 10 000 passengers per hour facilities step free access thumb right 250px notice explaining about step free access this can be found inside every victoria line train alt wheelchair symbol and text stations with step free access from victoria line platforms to street are shown with this symbol when line was built budget restrictions meant that station infrastructure standards were lower than on older lines and on later extension projects examples include narrower than usual platforms and undecorated ceilings at walthamstow central blackhorse road and tottenham hale affecting lighting levels line was built with fewer escalators than other lines as a cost saving exercise lack of a third escalator linking station entrances to platforms at some stations can cause severe congestion at peak times stations have closed temporarily for safety reasons when escalators have been unserviceable step free routes are available between victoria line and other lines at most interchanges tottenham hale king s cross st pancras green park victoria vauxhall and brixton have step free access from street to train platform humps have been installed at all stations except pimlico to provide

permitted development depot depot at northumberland park service and storage area for trains is only part of victoria line above ground trains access depot via a branch line in a tunnel to north of seven sisters depot opened with first stage of line in september 1968 it is next to northumberland park railway station on tottenham marshes in london borough of haringey over a mile from victoria line when built it was long and had working space for 22 eight car trains as part of transport for london s tube upgrade scheme depot has been expanded and upgraded to accommodate all 2009 tube stock trains future tottenham hotspur f c and its supporters have campaigned for a surface station next to northumberland park station adjacent to depot to improve stadium s transport links which are essential for club to redevelop its ground and increase capacity plans require co operation with local council and network rail to minimise disruption it was announced by haringey council in its 2012 a plan for tottenham report that there was potential for a victoria line extension to northumberland park crossrail 2 also known as chelsea hackney line is a planned line across central london between victoria and king s cross st pancras tube station to increase capacity in central london by 270 000 passengers per day it is be intended to relieve congestion on victoria line a key line connecting several important london termini proposals have been made to extend line one stop southwards from brixton to herne hill a significant interchange in south london providing access to kent and latter station would be on a large reversing loop with a single platform removing a critical capacity restriction eliminating need for trains to reverse at brixton and provide a more obvious route for
