captivating voice acting gamesradar s leon hurley like schaefer found mechanic of testing reid s morality compelling calling characters well realised and integral also approved of was atmospheric victorian london setting brandin tyrrel writing for ign termed vampyr a fresh and genuine take on vampire mythology he was generally satisfied with how choices turned out and said recreation of london as a gloomy somber city was bolstered by authentic characters whose writing and performances he also enjoyed tyrrel welcomed story and enjoyed citizen mechanics something andy kelly at pc gamer also appreciated hoping that more video games would follow suit he called dialogue driven storytelling compelling and setting atmospheric alice bell of videogamer com wrote vampyr serves delicious ladles of angst and drama with a hearty slice of excellent morally grey choice system that will genuinely surprise you all wrapped up in a wonderfully gloomy london conversely mersereau scolded overall narrative for its threadbare contribution he called combat a low grade witcher knockoff complaining about its lack of precision and sloppy mechanics lengthy loading screens and constant hangings were also cited as a source of annoyance schaefer lambasted animations for being a little wonky and unpolished nature of game to utley vampyr failed to impress in particular its character development and impact of choice he also had technical problems low resolution choppy performance and lengthy loading times already frustrated with combat clark said frame rate drops and frequent loading screens
