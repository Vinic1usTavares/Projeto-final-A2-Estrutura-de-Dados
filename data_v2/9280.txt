huich on staging area of rok ii corps for offensive to north onjong is linked to town of kojang which is located at away from yalu river because of hilly terrain at sino korean border onjong is one of few access points into yalu river area terrain also limits troop movements while providing ideal grounds for ambushes forces and strategy on 24 october rok 6th infantry division of ii corps advanced westward from huich on and onjong was captured on same day from onjong rok 7th infantry regiment 6th infantry division turned north and advanced towards kojang while rok 2nd infantry regiment 6th infantry division planned to advance northwest from onjong towards pukchin because un command expected no opposition from destroyed kpa advances were not coordinated between un units as a result rok 7th infantry regiment managed to wander into enemy territory without much opposition completely oblivious to new threats surrounding them while rok were advancing towards yalu river pva were also trying to deploy their units for upcoming first phase campaign as pva commander peng dehuai scrambled to set up his new command post at planned advance by rok 2nd infantry regiment threatened to overrun his position without any kpa units nearby to hide presence of pva peng was forced to start first phase campaign early by moving pva 40th corps to intercept rok 2nd infantry regiment near

ambush any rescue forces passing through onjong on october 27 pva 118th division isolated rok 7th infantry regiment by cutting road between kojang and onjong but rok 7th infantry regiment did not reach roadblock due to lack of fuel upon realizing that rok ii corps had not fallen for deception peng ordered 119th and 120th divisions to destroy rok 10th and 19th infantry regiments on night of 28 october ambush by two pva divisions quickly decimated advancing rok regiments at east of onjong and pva roadblocks in rear areas forced rok soldiers to abandon all vehicles and artillery in order to
