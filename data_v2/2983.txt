mirror s edge is a first person action adventure platform video game developed by ea dice and published by electronic arts it was released for xbox 360 and playstation 3 in november 2008 and in january 2009 for microsoft windows mirror s edge is powered by unreal engine 3 with addition of a new lighting solution developed by illuminate labs in association with dice mirror s edge is set in a quasi futuristic dystopian society in which a network of runners including main character faith connors act as couriers to transmit messages while evading government surveillance in style of a three dimensional platform game player guides faith over rooftops across walls through ventilation shafts and otherwise within urban environments negotiating obstacles using movements inspired by parkour game has a brightly colored minimalist style and differs from most previous first person perspective video games in allowing for a greater freedom of movement with regard to its 3d environment this allows for a wider range of actions such as sliding under barriers tumbling wall running and shimmying across ledges in having no heads up display and in allowing a range of vision which incorporated legs arms and torso of character as frequently visible elements on screen mirror s edge received positive reviews from critics who praised its uniqueness and its expansive environments while criticism has centred on its weakness of plot trial and error gameplay and short length game won annual interactive achievement award for adventure game of year and spawned a side scroller mobile game also titled mirror s edge which was released for ipad in april 2010 for iphone in september 2010 and for windows phone in july 2012 a reboot titled mirror s edge catalyst was released in june 2016 gameplay thumb left 256px alt a uniformed soldier standing on a rooftop falls back after being kicked two arms and a leg belonging to player s character are visible mirror s edge features a realistic first person view with character s limbs visible during hand to hand combat in mirror s edge player controls protagonist faith from a first person perspective as she is challenged to navigate across a gleaming city by jumping between rooftops running across walls and gaining access to buildings through ventilation shafts this is accomplished by use of techniques and movements inspired by discipline of parkour according to senior producer owen o brien mirror s edge aims to convey strain and physical contact with environment with goal of allowing a freedom of movement previously unseen in first person genre in order to achieve this camera movement pays more attention to character movement for example as faith s speed builds up while running rate at which camera bobs up and down increases as well when a roll is executed camera spins with character faith s arms legs and torso are prominent and their visibility is used to convey movement and momentum character s arms pump and length of her steps increase with her gait and her legs cycle and arms flail during long jumps in gameplay character s momentum becomes an asset player must attempt to conserve it through fluidity of physical actions encouraging creation of chains of moves if faith does not have momentum required to traverse an object she will fall off or short of it controls are simplified by being context sensitive upwards movement button will cause faith to traverse an obstacle by passing over it i e by jumping vaulting climbing or grabbing set pieces like zip lines while downwards movement button will cause her to perform other manoeuvres like sliding rolling or crouching to assist player in creating these chains of moves game employs a system called runner vision which emphasizes environmental pieces useful for progression certain pipes ramps and doors are highlighted in red as faith approaches allowing player to instantly recognize paths and escape routes further along in game number of these visual hints is reduced to only end goal and player can opt to turn off this hint system entirely it is also used to create puzzles in which player must figure out how to combine highlighted set pieces into a chain of moves in order to reach target another means of assistance to player is a system called reaction time a form of bullet time activated by player slowing down time and allowing player to plan and time their next move without losing momentum or tactical advantage player character can hold weapons but o brien stressed that this is an action adventure we re not positioning this as a shooter focus isn t on gun it s on person gameplay in mirror s edge focuses on finding best route through game s environments while combat takes a secondary role completing game without shooting a single enemy unlocks an achievement for player consequently guns may be obtained by disarming an enemy but when magazine is empty it will need to be discarded additionally carrying a weapon slows faith down heavier gun more it hinders her movement this introduces an element of strategy in determining when to trade agility for short term firepower along with campaign mode mirror s edge features a time attack mode where player must try to complete one of a set of special maps in shortest amount of time best times can be uploaded to online leaderboards where players can also download ghosts of other players to compete against maps are unlocked by playing through campaign mode according to producer tom ferrer time trial portions of mirror s edge are bite sized and short so you can grind them and play them and get faster and faster it s not like playing an entire level mobile phone port includes many parkour moves from pc and console versions however perspective is shifted from first person to third person game does not feature cutscenes and plot is explained with scrolling text in between levels ios version has since been removed from app store due to problems with game on ios 8 plot setting mirror s edge takes place in a utopian city where life is comfortable and crime almost non existent but city s state of bliss is achievement of a domineering and totalitarian military regime which monitors all communication controls media spies on its citizens and has policies which include outright prohibition of smoking and alcohol city also operates show trials and runs on a sham democracy eighteen years before events of game they had opened fire on a protest against their rule killing many civilians as story begins mayoral elections are near and a new candidate robert pope is challenging incumbent mayor callaghan on a platform of deregulation themes according to senior producer owen o brien mirror s edge asks how much of your personal freedom are you willing to give up for a comfortable life it s not one girl against this police state dictatorship it s more subtle than that american tv series firefly and film spin off serenity were cited by o brien as inspirations our other theme is you can t force other people to live by your rules and your society even if your society is better he said in serenity operative actually says this is not an evil empire we just don t understand why you don t want to be part of our happy club obviously they take it too far and that s kind of what happens in our game as well writer rhianna pratchett has said that game s story examined why citizens would accept a life in a society where their personal choices were very limited it also looked at reasons people might have for attempting to live outside system and what could result from this society portrayed in game was somewhere between what george orwell described as an anti utopia and a nanny state characters protagonist of mirror s edge is 24

black shirt is visible in right hand side of image she has tattoos around her left eye and on her right arm white buildings and a red construction crane are visible in background beneath a dark blue sky instead of pre rendered or live action cutscenes mirror s edge uses animated sequences to move its story along reviewers were divided in their opinions about this stylistic choice edge gave game 5 out of 10 stating that levels felt contrived and that there was no true freedom through levels merely multiple preordained paths guardian noted game s short length and many reviews criticised trial and error nature of play despite giving game a score of 8 out of 10 eurogamer dismissed storyline as rambling adding that mirror s edge is going to divide audiences down middle some will be able to overlook gaping flaws but others will never appreciate its moments of brilliance and both positions are justifiable other issues raised were stylistic choice of animated cutscenes and cramped feel of
