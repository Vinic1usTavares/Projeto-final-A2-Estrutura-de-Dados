crisis in 1975 station did not open until 1989 originally station was intended to be a transfer point for sixth avenue queens boulevard and broadway second avenue services as such station was designed to allow for cross platform interchanges on both levels however construction of second avenue subway was halted in 1975 during station s construction as a result north side of station intended for service to second avenue was hidden with a temporary orange brick wall and space intended for an exit at third avenue was left unused while south side of station opened for service in 1989 north side was only used for storing trains in 2007 construction resumed on second avenue subway and north side of station was renovated so it could be used orange wall on platform was removed while beige white wall tiles were installed on station walls adjacent to tracks unopened entrance at third avenue was fitted with multiple elevators and station s false ceiling was removed first phase of second avenue

queens boulevard line to second and sixth avenue lines which date back to ind second system of 1920s and 1930s second system was a plan to expand city owned and operated independent subway system ind which often ran in direct competition with two privately owned subway companies in city interborough rapid transit irt and brooklyn manhattan transit corporation bmt as a result plan for line only had it connect to two planned ind lines second and sixth avenue lines project for expanded rapid transit facilities new york city transit system dated july 5 1939 in 1940 subway system was unified with irt and bmt coming under city control consequently plans for proposed line were modified current plans were drawn up in 1960s under metropolitan transportation authority s program for action under this plan line was to connect to ind sixth avenue and bmt broadway lines ind line was to be built on upper portion of bi level 63rd street tunnel which would run under east river as such tracks connecting to ind sixth avenue line comprise ind 63rd street line on south side of station while tracks connecting to bmt broadway line comprise bmt 63rd street line on north side of station construction on 63rd street line including lexington avenue 63rd street station began on november 25 1969 station was built using a combination of cut and cover construction and tunneling machines however after construction of second avenue subway ceased in 1975 due to city s severe fiscal crisis bmt 63rd street line side northern tracks basically led to a non existent subway line so bmt side was abandoned and walled off with a temporary orange brick wall and a false ceiling was placed on upper level s ind 63rd street line side southern side finishing touches were only applied to ind side of station tracks on closed off bmt side were used only to store trains outside of rush hour original station opens thumb left upper platform in 2008 before reconstruction for a connection to second

society of civil engineers however it did not open for passenger service until october 29 1989 due to delays in construction of multi level 63rd street tunnel caused by financial crisis of 1970s upon station s opening it operated as a typical one track one side platform station on each level with only ind side in use while bmt side of each level was hidden beyond an orange tiled false wall

would allow future service from queens towards midtown and downtown manhattan also to east eastbound track of ind line rises to upper level of tunnel as both ind tracks are located on upper level of 63rd street tunnel for trip under east river two tracks on lower level of that tunnel are being connected to long island rail road lirr via east side access project project will bring trains from lirr s main line to grand central terminal but as of december 2016 lower level is currently unused east of this station on bmt side planned track connections to second avenue subway curved slightly north
