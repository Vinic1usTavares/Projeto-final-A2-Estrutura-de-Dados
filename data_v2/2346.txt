classmate and they have been friends since junior high school he is somewhat of a playboy but never gets far development norio tsukudani based himegoto on an earlier four panel manga she drew for fun during her time as a student at that time main characters that make up student council were instead members of drama club however tsukudani decided to change this when developing himegoto to be serialized in ichijinsha s waai magazine and she decided it would be easier to manage a cross dressing character if he was in student council before creating himegoto tsukudani read various works of fiction that featured cross dressing boys but many of them featured boys being paired with other boys when she proposed idea of himegoto she wanted to pair a cross dressing boy with girls which tsukudani herself wanted to read in this way she thought that a variety of different people would enjoy it when drawing manga tsukudani aimed to write scenes that were easy to read something she felt she was unable to do well when manga s serialization began what she felt was most important was depicting characters as cute as possible when developing characters she based female members of student council and tadokoro on friends she had in drama club when she was a student however hime was created from scratch using tsukudani s ideals for a cross dressing boy as a basis for character including his pink hair side pigtails and him being forced to cross dress when developing members of public morals committee tsukudani had already decided on having a pair of cross dressing brothers which led to kaguya s development tsukudani s editor suggested making kaguya protagonist of spin off manga himegoto and she wanted to give kaguya a partner so she created no 1 and thought she might as well make her into a cross dressing girl for mitsunaga and hiro she wanted them to cross dress due to some preconceived issue tsukudani was careful to design characters to maintain a balance between them including what hair color they would have although tsukudani kept a notebook with story ideas she admitted that on many occasions theme of a chapter was born out of her own daydreams once she decided on a theme she had characters move around in her head and then worked out plot and storyboard since she had a solid grasp on who characters were she noted that they moved around for her on their own conversely if characters were stiff with a given theme tsukudani could not develop an interesting story and moved on to another idea theme developed for manga serialized in febri had to do with bonus aspects to story that she was unable to draw in main serialization as well as events that occurred between chapters in main story media manga himegoto is written and illustrated by norio tsukudani it

reception reviewer chris beveridge described anime s short episode format as offering more direct comedy quicker hits and more playfulness and abuse when it comes to gender issues he initially called premise familiar yet fun with enough off kilter material to amuse audience by end of series beveridge noted that its approach focused on humiliation and shame and went on to say that it works one gag and does its best to run it into ground as much as possible tim jones at them anime reviews heavily panned series calling treatment of student council girls towards hime as sinister and tasteless jones pointed out his frustration with every episode going on to heavily pan characters and use of a terrible one joke premise notes and references notes tankobon volumes combine chapters serialized
