thumb right 200px reverse side of great seal of united states 1776 latin phrase novus ordo seclorum appearing on reverse side of great seal since 1782 and on back of u s one dollar bill since 1935 translates to new order of ages lewis and short a latin dictionary and alludes to beginning of an era where united states of america is an independent nation state conspiracy theorists claim this is an allusion to new world order new world order or nwo is claimed to be an emerging clandestine totalitarian world government by various conspiracy theories common theme in conspiracy theories about a new world order is that a secretive power elite with a globalist agenda is conspiring to eventually rule world through an authoritarian world government which will replace sovereign nation states and an all encompassing propaganda whose ideology hails establishment of new world order as culmination of history s progress many influential historical and contemporary figures have therefore been alleged to be part of a cabal that operates through many front organizations to orchestrate significant political and financial events ranging from causing systemic crises to pushing through controversial policies at both national and international levels as steps in an ongoing plot to achieve world domination before early 1990s new world order conspiracism was limited to two american primarily militantly anti government right and secondarily that part of fundamentalist christianity concerned with end time emergence of antichrist skeptics such as michael barkun and chip berlet observed that right wing populist conspiracy theories about a new world order had not only been embraced by many seekers of stigmatized knowledge but had seeped into popular culture thereby inaugurating a period during late 20th and early 21st centuries in united states where people are actively preparing for apocalyptic millenarian scenarios those political scientists are concerned that mass hysteria over new world order conspiracy theories could eventually have devastating effects on american political life ranging from escalating lone wolf terrorism to rise to power of authoritarian ultranationalist demagogues history of term general usage pre cold war during 20th century political figures such as woodrow wilson and winston churchill used term new world order to refer to a new period of history characterised by a dramatic change in world political thought and in global balance of power after world war i and world war ii interwar and post world war ii period were seen as opportunities to implement idealistic proposals for global governance by collective efforts to address worldwide problems that go beyond capacity of individual nation states to resolve while nevertheless respecting right of nations to self determination such collective initiatives manifested in formation of intergovernmental organizations such as league of nations in 1920 united nations un in 1945 and north atlantic treaty organization nato in 1949 along with international regimes such as bretton woods system and general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt implemented to maintain a cooperative balance of power and facilitate reconciliation between nations to prevent prospect of another global conflict these cosmopolitan efforts to instill liberal internationalism were regularly criticized and opposed by american paleoconservative business nationalists from 1930s on progressives welcomed international organizations and regimes such as united nations in aftermath of two world wars but argued that these initiatives suffered from a democratic deficit and were therefore inadequate not only to prevent another world war but to foster global justice as un was chartered to be a free association of sovereign nation states rather than a transition to democratic world government thus cosmopolitan activists around globe perceiving as too ineffectual for global change formed a world federalist movement british writer and futurist h g wells went further than progressives in 1940s by appropriating and redefining term new world order as a synonym for establishment of a technocratic world state and of a planned economy garnering popularity in state socialist circles usage as reference to a conspiracy cold war era during second red scare both secular and religious right american agitators largely influenced by work of canadian conspiracy theorist william guy carr increasingly embraced and spread dubious fears of freemasons illuminati and jews as alleged driving forces behind an international communist conspiracy threat of godless communism in form of an atheistic bureaucratic collectivist world government demonized as red menace became focus of apocalyptic millenarian conspiracism red scare came to shape one of core ideas of political right in united states which is that liberals and progressives with their welfare state policies and international cooperation programs such as foreign aid and open borders supposedly contribute to a gradual process of global collectivism that will inevitably lead to nations being replaced with a communistic collectivist one world government right wing populist advocacy groups with a paleoconservative world view such as john birch society disseminated a multitude of conspiracy theories in 1960s claiming that governments of both united states and soviet union were controlled by a cabal of corporate internationalists greedy bankers and corrupt politicians who were intent on using un as vehicle to create a one world government this anti globalist conspiracism fueled campaign for u s withdrawal from un american writer mary m davison in her 1966 booklet profound revolution traced alleged new world order conspiracy to establishment of u s federal reserve in 1913 by international bankers whom she claimed later formed council on foreign relations in 1921 as a shadow government at time booklet was published many readers would have interpreted international bankers as a reference to a postulated international jewish banking conspiracy masterminded by rothschild family arguing that term new world order is used by a secretive global elite dedicated to eradication of sovereignty of world s nations american writer gary allen in his books none dare call it conspiracy 1971 rockefeller campaigning for new world order 1974 and say no to new world order 1987 articulated anti globalist theme of contemporary right wing conspiracism in u s after fall of communism in early 1990s de facto subject of new world order conspiracism shifted from crypto communists perceived to be plotting to establish an atheistic world communist government to globalists perceived to be plotting to generally implement a collectivist unified world government ultimately controlled by an untouchable oligarchy of international bankers corrupt politicians and or alternatively united nations itself shift in perception was inspired by growing opposition to corporate internationalism on american right in 1990s in his speech toward a new world order delivered on 11 september 1990 during a joint session of us congress president george h w bush described his objectives for post cold war global governance in cooperation with post soviet states he stated new york times observed that progressives were denouncing this new world order as a rationalization of american imperial ambitions in middle east at time while conservatives rejected any new security arrangements altogether and fulminated about any possibility of a un revival chip berlet an american investigative reporter specializing in study of right wing movements in u s wrote that christian and secular far right were especially terrified by bush s speech fundamentalist christian groups interpreted bush s words as signaling end times while more secular theorists approached it from an anti communist and anti collectivist standpoint and feared for a hegemony over all countries by united nations post cold war usage thumb upright american televangelist pat robertson wrote 1991 best selling book new world order american televangelist pat robertson with his 1991 best selling book new world order became most prominent christian of conspiracy theories about recent american history he describes a scenario where wall street federal reserve system council on foreign relations bilderberg group and trilateral commission control flow of events from behind scenes nudging people constantly and covertly in direction of world government for antichrist it was observed that throughout 1990s galvanizing language used by conspiracy theorists such as linda thompson mark and robert k spear led to militancy and rise of militia movement mark institute for intergovernmental research camouflage and conspiracy militia movement from ruby ridge to y2k american behavioral scientist vol 44 no 6 pages 957 981 sage publications 2001 militia movement s anti government ideology was and is spread through speeches at rallies and meetings books and videotapes sold at gun shows shortwave and satellite radio fax networks and computer bulletin boards it has been argued that it was overnight am radio shows and propagandistic viral content on internet that most effectively contributed to more extremist responses to perceived threat of new world order this led to substantial growth of new world order conspiracism with it retroactively finding its way into previously apolitical literature of numerous kennedy ufologists lost land theorists and partially inspired by fears surrounding satanic panic occultists from mid 1990s onward amorphous appeal of those subcultures transmitted new world order conspiracism to a larger audience of seekers of stigmatized knowledge with common characteristic of disillusionment of political efficacy from mid 1990s to early 2000s hollywood conspiracy thriller television shows and films also played a role in introducing a general audience to various fringe and esoteric theories related to new world order conspiracism which by that point had developed to include black helicopters fema concentration camps etc theories which for decades previously were confined to largely right wing subcultures 1993 2002 television series x files 1997 film conspiracy theory and 1998 film x files fight future are often cited as notable examples following start of 21st century and specifically during late 2000s financial crisis many politicians and pundits such as gordon brown and henry kissinger used term new world order in their advocacy for a comprehensive reform of global financial system and their calls for a new bretton woods taking into account emerging markets such as china and india these public declarations reinvigorated new world order conspiracism culminating in talk show host sean hannity stating on his fox news channel program hannity that conspiracy theorists were right progressive media watchdog groups have repeatedly criticized fox news in general and its now defunct opinion show glenn beck in particular for not only disseminating new world order conspiracy theories to mainstream audiences but possibly agitating so called lone wolf extremism particular from radical right in 2009 american film directors luke meyer and andrew neel released new world order a critically acclaimed documentary film which explores world of conspiracy theorists such as american radio host alex jones who consistently expose and vigorously oppose what they perceive as an emerging new world order growing dissemination and popularity of conspiracy theories has also created an alliance between right wing agitators and hip hop music s left wing rappers such as krs one professor griff of public enemy and immortal technique illustrating how anti elitist conspiracism can create unlikely political allies in efforts to oppose a political system conspiracy theories there are numerous systemic conspiracy theories through which concept of a new world order is viewed following is a list of major ones in roughly chronological order end time upright thumb john nelson darby since 19th century many apocalyptic millennial christian eschatologists starting with john nelson darby have predicted a globalist conspiracy to impose a tyrannical new world order governing structure as fulfillment of prophecies about end time in bible specifically in book of ezekiel book of daniel olivet discourse found in synoptic gospels and book of revelation they claim that people who have made a deal with devil to gain wealth and power have become pawns in a supernatural chess game to move humanity into accepting a utopian world government that rests on spiritual foundations of a syncretic messianic world religion which will later reveal itself to be a dystopian world empire that imposes imperial cult of an unholy trinity of satan antichrist and false prophet in many contemporary christian conspiracy theories false prophet will be either last pope of catholic church groomed and installed by an alta or jesuit conspiracy a guru from new age movement or even leader of an elite fundamentalist christian organization like fellowship while antichrist will be either president of european union secretary general of united nations or even caliph of a pan islamic state some of most vocal critics of end time conspiracy theories come from within christianity in 1993 historian bruce barron wrote a stern rebuke of apocalyptic christian conspiracism in christian research journal when reviewing robertson s 1991 book new world order another critique can be found in historian gregory s camp s 1997 book selling fear conspiracy theories and end times paranoia religious studies scholar richard t hughes argues that new world order rhetoric libels christian faith since new world order as defined by christian conspiracy theorists has no basis in bible whatsoever furthermore he argues that not only is this idea unbiblical it is positively anti biblical and fundamentally anti christian because by misinterpreting key passages in book of revelation it turns a comforting message about coming kingdom of god into one of fear panic and despair in face of an allegedly approaching one world government progressive christians such as preacher theologian peter j gomes caution christian fundamentalists that a spirit of fear can distort scripture and history through dangerously combining biblical literalism apocalyptic timetables demonization and oppressive prejudices while camp warns of very real danger that christians could pick up some extra spiritual baggage by credulously embracing conspiracy theories they therefore call on christians who indulge in conspiracism to repent freemasonry freemasonry is one of world s oldest secular fraternal organizations and arose during late 16th early 17th century britain over years a number of allegations and conspiracy theories have been directed towards freemasonry including allegation that freemasons have a hidden political agenda and are conspiring to bring about a new world order a world government organized according to masonic principles or governed only by freemasons esoteric nature of masonic symbolism and rites led to freemasons first being accused of secretly practising satanism in late 18th century original allegation of a conspiracy within freemasonry to subvert religions and governments in order to take over world traces back to scottish author john robison whose reactionary conspiracy theories crossed atlantic and influenced outbreaks of protestant anti masonry in united states during 19th century in 1890s french writer leo taxil wrote a series of pamphlets and books denouncing freemasonry and charging their lodges with worshiping lucifer as supreme being and great architect of universe despite fact that taxil admitted that his claims were all a hoax they were and still are believed and repeated by numerous conspiracy theorists and had a huge influence on subsequent anti masonic claims about freemasonry some conspiracy theorists eventually speculated that some founding fathers of united states such as george washington and benjamin franklin were having masonic sacred geometric designs interwoven into american society particularly in great seal of united states united states one dollar bill architecture of national mall landmarks and streets and highways of washington d c as part of a master plan to create first masonic government as a model for coming new world order thumb right 220 px a masonic lodge room freemasons rebut these claims of a masonic conspiracy freemasonry which promotes rationalism places no power in occult symbols themselves and it is not a part of its principles to view drawing of symbols no matter how large as an act of consolidating or controlling power furthermore there is no published information establishing masonic membership of men responsible for design of great seal while conspiracy theorists assert that there are elements of masonic influence on great seal of united states and that these elements were intentionally or unintentionally used because creators were familiar with symbols in fact all seeing eye of providence and unfinished pyramid were symbols used as much outside masonic lodges as within them in late 18th century therefore designers were drawing from common esoteric symbols latin phrase novus ordo seclorum appearing on reverse side of great seal since 1782 and on back of one dollar bill since 1935 translates to new order of ages and alludes to beginning of an era where united states of america is an independent nation state it is often mistranslated by conspiracy theorists as new world order although european continental branch of freemasonry has organizations that allow political discussion within their masonic lodges masonic researcher trevor w mckeown argues that accusations ignore several facts firstly many grand lodges are independent and sovereign meaning they act on their own and do not have a common agenda points of belief of various lodges often differ secondly famous individual freemasons have always held views that span political spectrum and show no particular pattern or preference as such term masonic government is erroneous there is no consensus among freemasons about what an ideal government would look like illuminati thumb upright adam weishaupt founder of illuminati an 18th century bavarian liberal and secular secret society order of illuminati was an enlightenment age secret society founded by university professor adam weishaupt on 1 may 1776 in upper bavaria germany movement consisted of advocates of freethought secularism liberalism republicanism and gender equality recruited from german masonic lodges who sought to teach rationalism through mystery schools in 1785 order was infiltrated broken up and suppressed by government agents of charles theodore elector of bavaria in his preemptive campaign to neutralize threat of secret societies ever becoming hotbeds of conspiracies to overthrow bavarian monarchy and its state religion roman catholicism there is no evidence that bavarian illuminati survived its suppression in 1785 in late 18th century reactionary conspiracy theorists such as scottish physicist john robison and french jesuit priest augustin barruel began speculating that illuminati had survived their suppression and become masterminds behind french revolution and reign of terror illuminati were accused of being subversives who were attempting to secretly orchestrate a revolutionary wave in europe and rest of world in order to spread most radical ideas and movements of enlightenment anti clericalism anti monarchism and anti and to create a world and cult of reason during 19th century fear of an illuminati conspiracy was a real concern of european ruling classes and their oppressive reactions to this unfounded fear provoked in 1848 very revolutions they sought to prevent during interwar period of 20th century fascist propagandists such as british revisionist historian nesta helen webster and american socialite edith starr miller not only popularized myth of an illuminati conspiracy but claimed that it was a subversive secret society which served jewish elites that supposedly propped up both finance capitalism and soviet communism in order to divide and rule world american evangelist gerald burton winrod and other conspiracy theorists within fundamentalist christian movement in united states which emerged in 1910s as a backlash against principles of enlightenment secular humanism modernism and liberalism became main channel of dissemination of illuminati conspiracy theories in u s right wing populists such as members of john birch society subsequently began speculating that some collegiate fraternities skull and bones gentlemen s clubs bohemian club and think tanks council on foreign relations trilateral commission of american upper class are front organizations of illuminati which they accuse of plotting to create a new world order through a one world government protocols of elders of zion protocols of elders of zion is an antisemitic canard originally published in russian in 1903 alleging a judeo masonic conspiracy to achieve world domination text purports to be minutes of secret meetings of a cabal of jewish masterminds which has co opted freemasonry and is plotting to rule world on behalf of all jews because they believe themselves to be chosen people of god soviet jewry hearing before subcommittee on human rights and international organizations united states congress house committee on foreign affairs commission on security and cooperation in europe 1984 p 56 protocols incorporate many of core conspiracist themes outlined in robison and barruel attacks on freemasons and overlay them with antisemitic allegations about anti tsarist movements in russia protocols reflect themes similar to more general critiques of enlightenment liberalism by conservative aristocrats who support monarchies and state religions interpretation intended by publication of protocols is that if one peels away layers of masonic conspiracy past illuminati one finds rotten jewish core upright thumb cover of a 1920 copy of jewish peril numerous polemicists such as irish journalist philip graves in a 1921 article in times and british academic norman cohn in his 1967 book warrant for genocide have proven protocols to be both a hoax and a clear case of plagiarism there is general agreement that russian french writer and political activist matvei fabricated text for secret police of russian empire as a work of counter revolutionary propaganda prior to 1905 russian revolution by plagiarizing almost word for word in some passages from dialogue in hell between machiavelli and montesquieu a 19th century satire against napoleon iii of france written by french political satirist and legitimist militant maurice joly responsible for feeding many antisemitic and anti masonic mass hysterias of 20th century protocols has been influential in development of some conspiracy theories including some new world order theories and appears repeatedly in certain contemporary conspiracy literature for example authors of 1982 controversial book holy blood and holy grail concluded that protocols was most persuasive piece of evidence for existence and activities of priory of sion they speculated that this secret society was working behind scenes to establish a theocratic united states of europe politically and religiously unified through imperial cult of a merovingian great monarch supposedly descended from a jesus bloodline who occupies both throne of europe and holy see this holy european empire would become hyperpower of 21st century henry lincoln michael baigent richard leigh holy blood and holy grail corgi 1982 although priory of sion itself has been exhaustively debunked by journalists and scholars as a hoax some apocalyptic millenarian christian eschatologists who believe protocols is authentic became convinced that priory of sion was a fulfillment of prophecies found in book of revelation and further proof of an anti christian conspiracy of epic proportions signaling imminence of a new world order skeptics argue that current gambit of contemporary conspiracy theorists who use protocols is to claim that they really come from some group other than jews such as fallen angels or alien invaders although it is hard to determine whether conspiracy minded actually believe this or are simply trying to sanitize a discredited text skeptics argue that it does not make much difference since they leave actual antisemitic text unchanged result is to give protocols credibility and circulation round table during second half of britain s imperial century between 1815 and 1914 english born south african businessman mining magnate and politician cecil rhodes advocated british empire united states of america and reforming itself into an imperial federation to bring about a hyperpower and lasting world peace in his first will written in 1877 at age of 23 he expressed his wish to fund a secret society known as society of elect that would advance this goal thumb upright magnate and colonist cecil rhodes advocated a secret society which would make britain control earth in 1890 thirteen years after his now famous will rhodes elaborated on same idea establishment of england everywhere which would ultimately lead to cessation of all wars and one language throughout world only thing feasible to carry out this idea is a secret society gradually absorbing wealth of world and human minds of higher order to be devoted to such an object rhodes also concentrated on rhodes scholarship which had british statesman alfred milner as one of its trustees established in 1902 original goal of trust fund was to foster peace among great powers by creating a sense of fraternity and a shared world view among future british american and german leaders by having enabled them to study for free at university of oxford milner and british official lionel george curtis were architects of round table movement a network of organizations promoting closer union between britain and its self governing colonies to this end curtis founded royal institute of international affairs in june 1919 and with his 1938 book commonwealth of god began advocating for creation of an imperial federation that eventually u s which would be presented to protestant churches as being work of christian god to elicit their support curtis lionel civitas dei commonwealth of god london 1938 macmillan sons commonwealth of nations was created in 1949 but it would only be a free association of independent states rather than powerful imperial federation imagined by rhodes milner and curtis council on foreign relations began in 1917 with a group of new york academics who were asked by president woodrow wilson to offer options for foreign policy of united states in interwar period originally envisioned as a group of american and british scholars and diplomats some of whom belonging to round table movement it was a subsequent group of 108 new york financiers manufacturers and international lawyers organized in june 1918 by nobel peace prize recipient and u s secretary of state elihu root that became council on foreign relations on 29 july 1921 first of council s projects was a quarterly journal launched in september 1922 called foreign affairs trilateral commission was founded in july 1973 at initiative of american banker david rockefeller who was chairman of council on foreign relations at that time it is a private organization established to foster closer cooperation among united states europe and japan trilateral commission is widely seen as a counterpart to council on foreign relations in 1960s right wing populist individuals and groups with a paleoconservative worldview such as members of john birch society were first to combine and spread a business nationalist critique of corporate internationalists networked through think tanks such as council on foreign relations with a grand conspiracy theory casting them as front organizations for round table of anglo american establishment which are financed by an international banking cabal that has supposedly been plotting from late 19th century on to impose an oligarchic new world order through a global financial system anti globalist conspiracy theorists therefore fear that international bankers are planning to eventually subvert independence of u s by subordinating national sovereignty to a strengthened bank for international settlements research findings of historian carroll quigley author of 1966 book tragedy and hope are taken by both conspiracy theorists of american old right w cleon skousen and new left carl oglesby to substantiate this view even though quigley argued that establishment is not involved in a plot to implement a one world government but rather british and american benevolent imperialism driven by mutual interests of economic elites in united kingdom and united states quigley also argued that although round table still exists today its position in influencing policies of world leaders has been much reduced from its heyday during world war i and slowly waned after end of world war ii and suez crisis today round table is largely a ginger group designed to consider and gradually influence policies of commonwealth of nations but faces strong opposition furthermore in american society after 1965 problem according to quigley was that no elite was in charge and acting responsibly larry mcdonald second president of john birch society and a conservative democratic member of united states house of representatives who represented 7th congressional district of georgia wrote a foreword for allen s 1976 book rockefeller file wherein he claimed that rockefellers and their allies were driven by a desire to create a one world government that combined super capitalism with communism and would be fully under their control he saw a conspiracy plot that was international in scope generations old in planning and incredibly evil in intent mcdonald lawrence p introduction rockefeller file by gary allen seal beach ca 76 press 1976 in his 2002 autobiography memoirs david rockefeller wrote barkun argues that this statement is partly facetious claim of conspiracy and treason and partly serious desire to encourage trilateral cooperation among u s europe and japan for example an ideal that used to be a hallmark of internationalist wing of republican party known as rockefeller republicans in honor of nelson rockefeller when there was an internationalist wing statement however is taken at face value and widely cited by conspiracy theorists as proof that council on foreign relations uses its role as brain trust of american presidents senators and representatives to manipulate them into supporting a new world order in form of a one world government in a 13 november 2007 interview with canadian journalist benjamin fulford rockefeller countered that he felt no need for a world government and wished for governments of world to work together and collaborate he also stated that it seemed neither likely nor desirable to have only one elected government rule whole world he criticized accusations of him being ruler of world as nonsensical some american social critics such as laurence h shoup argue that council on foreign relations is an imperial brain trust which has for decades played a central behind scenes role in shaping u s foreign policy choices for post world war ii international order and cold war by determining what options show up on agenda and what options do not even make it to table others such as g william domhoff argue that it is in fact a mere policy discussion forum which provides business input to u s foreign policy planning domhoff argues that i t has nearly 3 000 members far too many for secret plans to be kept within group all council does is sponsor discussion groups debates and speakers as far as being secretive it issues annual reports and allows access to its historical archives however all these critics agree that h studies of cfr show that it has a very different role in overall power structure than what is claimed by conspiracy theorists open conspiracy thumb upright h g wells wrote books open conspiracy and new world order in his 1928 book open conspiracy british writer and futurist h g wells promoted cosmopolitanism and offered blueprints for a world revolution and world brain to establish a technocratic world state and planned economy wells warned however in his 1940 book new world order that wells s books were influential in giving a second meaning to term new world order which would only be used by state socialist supporters and anti communist opponents for generations to come however despite popularity and notoriety of his ideas wells failed to exert a deeper and more lasting influence because he was unable to concentrate his energies on a direct appeal to who would ultimately have to coordinate new world order new age british neo theosophical occultist alice bailey one of founders of so called new age movement prophesied in 1940 eventual victory of allies of world war ii over axis powers which occurred in 1945 and establishment by allies of a political and religious new world order she saw a federal world government as culmination of wells open conspiracy but favorably argued that it would be because it was guided by masters of ancient wisdom intent on preparing humanity for mystical second coming of christ and dawning of age of aquarius according to bailey a group of ascended masters called great white brotherhood works on inner planes to oversee transition to new world order but for now members of this spiritual hierarchy are only known to a few occult scientists with whom they communicate telepathically but as need for their personal involvement in plan increases there will be an externalization of hierarchy and everyone will know of their presence on earth thumb upright new age author alice bailey s writings have been condemned by christian right conspiracy theorists bailey s writings along with american writer marilyn ferguson s 1980 book aquarian conspiracy contributed to conspiracy theorists of christian right viewing new age movement as false religion that would supersede christianity in a new world order skeptics argue that term new age movement is a misnomer generally used by conspiracy theorists as a catch all rubric for any new religious movement that is not fundamentalist christian by this logic anything that is not christian is by definition actively and willfully anti christian paradoxically since first decade of 21st century new world order conspiracism is increasingly being embraced and propagandized by new age occultists who are people bored by rationalism and drawn to stigmatized knowledge such as alternative medicine astrology quantum mysticism spiritualism and theosophy thus new age conspiracy theorists such as makers of documentary films like esoteric agenda claim that globalists who plot on behalf of new world order are simply misusing occultism for machiavellian ends such as adopting 21 december 2012 as exact date for establishment of new world order for purpose of taking advantage of growing 2012 phenomenon which has its origins in fringe mayanist theories of new age writers jose arguelles terence mckenna and daniel pinchbeck skeptics argue that connection of conspiracy theorists and occultists follows from their common fallacious premises first any widely accepted belief must necessarily be false second stigmatized knowledge what establishment spurns must be true result is a large self referential network in which for example some ufo religionists promote anti jewish phobias while some practice peruvian shamanism fourth reich thumb upright american writer jim marrs claimed that former nazis and their sympathizers have been continuing nazi policies worldwide especially in united states conspiracy theorists often use term fourth reich simply as a pejorative synonym for new world order to imply that its state ideology and government will be similar to germany s third reich conspiracy theorists such as american writer jim marrs claim that some ex nazis who survived fall of greater german reich along with sympathizers in united states and elsewhere given haven by organizations like odessa and die have been working behind scenes since end of world war ii to enact at least some principles of nazism e g militarism imperialism widespread spying on citizens corporatism use of propaganda to manufacture a national consensus into culture government and business worldwide but primarily in u s they cite influence of ex nazi scientists brought in under operation paperclip to help advance aerospace manufacturing in u s with technological principles from nazi ufos and acquisition and creation of conglomerates by ex nazis and their sympathizers after war in both europe and u s this neo nazi conspiracy is said to be animated by an iron dream in which american empire having thwarted judeo masonic conspiracy and overthrown its zionist occupation government gradually establishes a fourth reich formerly known as western imperium a pan aryan world empire modeled after adolf hitler s new order which reverses decline of west and ushers a golden age of white supremacy skeptics argue that conspiracy theorists grossly overestimate influence of ex nazis and neo nazis on american society and point out that political repression at home and imperialism abroad have a long history in united states that predates 20th century some political scientists such as sheldon wolin have expressed concern that twin forces of democratic deficit and superpower status have paved way in u s for emergence of an inverted totalitarianism which contradicts many principles of nazism alien invasion since late 1970s extraterrestrials from other habitable planets or parallel dimensions such as greys and from hollow earth such as reptilians have been included in new world order conspiracy in more or less dominant roles as in theories put forward by american writers stan deyo and milton william cooper and british writer david icke thumb british writer david icke claims that shapeshifting aliens called reptilians control earth common theme in these conspiracy theories is that aliens have been among us for decades centuries or millennia but a government cover up enforced by men in black has shielded public from knowledge of a secret alien invasion motivated by speciesism and imperialism these aliens have been and are secretly manipulating developments and changes in human society in order to more efficiently control and exploit human beings in some theories alien infiltrators have into human form and move freely throughout human society even to point of taking control of command positions in governmental corporate and religious institutions and are now in final stages of their plan to take over world a mythical covert government agency of united states code named majestic 12 is often imagined being shadow government which collaborates with alien occupation and permits alien abductions in exchange for assistance in development and testing of military flying saucers at area 51 in order for united states armed forces to achieve full spectrum dominance skeptics who adhere to psychosocial hypothesis for unidentified flying objects argue that convergence of new world order conspiracy theory and ufo conspiracy theory is a product of not only era s widespread mistrust of governments and popularity of extraterrestrial hypothesis for ufos but of far right and ufologists actually joining forces barkun notes that only positive side to this development is that if conspirators plotting to rule world are believed to be aliens traditional human scapegoats freemasons illuminati jews etc are downgraded or exonerated brave new world and neo luddite conspiracy theorists emphasize technology forecasting in their new world order conspiracy theories they speculate that global power elite are reactionary modernists pursuing a transhumanist agenda to develop and use human enhancement technologies in order to become a posthuman ruling caste while change accelerates toward a technological singularity a theorized future point of discontinuity when events will accelerate at such a pace that normal humans will be unable to predict or even understand rapid changes occurring in world around them conspiracy theorists fear outcome will either be emergence of a brave new world like dystopia a brave new world order or extinction of human species democratic such as american sociologist james hughes counter that many influential members of united states establishment are strongly opposed to human enhancement as demonstrated by president bush s council on bioethics s proposed international treaty prohibiting human cloning and germline engineering furthermore he argues that conspiracy theorists underestimate how fringe transhumanist movement really is postulated implementations just as there are several overlapping or conflicting theories among about nature of new world order so are there several beliefs about how its architects and planners will implement it gradualism conspiracy theorists generally speculate that new world order is being implemented gradually citing formation of u s federal reserve system in 1913 league of nations in 1919 international monetary fund in 1944 united nations in 1945 world bank in 1945 world health organization in 1948 european union and euro currency in 1993 world trade organization in 1998 african union in 2002 and union of south american nations in 2008 as major milestones an increasingly popular conspiracy theory among american right wing populists is that hypothetical north american union and amero currency proposed by council on foreign relations and its counterparts in mexico and canada will be next milestone in implementation of new world order theory holds that a group of shadowy and mostly nameless international elites are planning to replace federal government of united states with a transnational government therefore conspiracy theorists believe borders between mexico canada and united states are in process of being erased covertly by a group of globalists whose ultimate goal is to replace national governments in washington d c ottawa and mexico city with a european style political union and a bloated e u style bureaucracy skeptics argue that north american union exists only as a proposal contained in one of a thousand academic and policy papers published each year that advocate all manner of idealistic but ultimately unrealistic approaches to social economic and political problems most of these are passed around in their own circles and eventually filed away and forgotten by junior staffers in congressional offices some of these papers however become touchstones for conspiracy minded and form basis of all kinds of unfounded xenophobic fears especially during times of economic anxiety for example in march 2009 as a result of late 2000s financial crisis people s republic of china and russian federation pressed for urgent consideration of a new international reserve currency and united nations conference on trade and development proposed greatly expanding i m f s special drawing rights conspiracy theorists fear these proposals are a call for u s to adopt a single global currency for a new world order judging that both national governments and global institutions have proven ineffective in addressing worldwide problems that go beyond capacity of individual nation states to solve some political scientists critical of new world order conspiracism such as mark c partridge argue that regionalism will be major force in coming decades pockets of power around regional centers western europe around brussels western hemisphere around washington d c east asia around beijing and eastern europe around moscow as such e u shanghai cooperation organisation and g 20 will likely become more influential as time progresses question then is not whether global governance is gradually emerging but rather how will these regional powers interact with one another coup d etat thumb upright american militia movement claim that a coup d etat will be launched by a secret team in black helicopters american right wing populist conspiracy theorists especially those who joined militia movement in united states speculate that new world order will be implemented through a dramatic coup d etat by a secret team using black helicopters in u s and other nation states to bring about a totalitarian world government controlled by united nations and enforced by troops of foreign u n peacekeepers following rex 84 and operation garden plot plans this military coup would involve suspension of constitution imposition of martial law and appointment of military commanders to head state and local governments and to detain dissidents these conspiracy theorists who are all strong believers in a right to keep and bear arms are extremely fearful that passing of any gun control legislation will be later followed by abolishment of personal gun ownership and a campaign of gun confiscation and that refugee camps of emergency management agencies such as fema will be used for internment of suspected subversives making little effort to distinguish true threats to new world order from pacifist dissidents before year 2000 some survivalists wrongly believed this process would be set in motion by predicted y2k problem causing societal collapse since many left wing and right wing conspiracy theorists believe that 11 september attacks were a false flag operation carried out by united states intelligence community as part of a strategy of tension to justify political repression at home and preemptive war abroad they have become convinced that a more catastrophic terrorist incident will be responsible for triggering executive directive 51 in order to complete transition to a police state skeptics argue that unfounded fears about an imminent or eventual gun ban military coup internment or u n invasion and occupation are rooted in siege mentality of american militia movement but also an apocalyptic millenarianism which provides a basic narrative within political right in u s claiming that idealized society i e constitutional republic jeffersonian democracy christian nation white nation is thwarted by subversive conspiracies of liberal secular humanists who want big government and globalists who plot on behalf of new world order mass surveillance conspiracy theorists concerned with surveillance abuse believe that new world order is being implemented by cult of intelligence at core of surveillance industrial complex through mass surveillance and use of social security numbers bar coding of retail goods with universal product code markings and most recently rfid tagging by microchip implants claiming that corporations and government are planning to track every move of consumers and citizens with rfid as latest step toward a 1984 like surveillance state consumer privacy advocates such as katherine albrecht and liz mcintyre have become christian conspiracy theorists who believe must be resisted because they argue that modern database and communications technologies coupled with point of sale data capture equipment and sophisticated id and authentication systems now make it possible to require a associated number or mark to make purchases they fear that ability to implement such a system closely resembles number of beast prophesied in book of revelation in january 2002 information awareness office iao was established by defense advanced research projects agency darpa to bring together several darpa projects focused on applying information technology to counter asymmetric threats to national security following public criticism that development and deployment of these technologies could potentially lead to a mass surveillance system iao was defunded by united states congress in 2003 second source of controversy involved iao s original logo which depicted all seeing eye of providence atop of a pyramid looking down over globe accompanied by latin phrase scientia est potentia knowledge is power although darpa eventually removed logo from its website it left a lasting impression on privacy advocates it also inflamed conspiracy theorists who misinterpret eye and pyramid as masonic symbol of illuminati an 18th century secret society they speculate continues to exist and is plotting on behalf of a new world order american historian richard landes who specializes in history of apocalypticism and was co founder and director of center for millennial studies at boston university argues that new and emerging technologies often trigger alarmism among millenarians and even introduction of gutenberg s printing press in 1436 caused waves of apocalyptic thinking year 2000 problem bar codes and social security numbers all triggered end time warnings which either proved to be false or simply were no longer taken seriously once public became accustomed to these technological changes civil libertarians argue that privatization of surveillance and rise of surveillance industrial complex in united states does raise legitimate concerns about erosion of privacy however skeptics of mass surveillance conspiracism caution that such concerns should be disentangled from secular paranoia about big brother or religious hysteria about antichrist occultism conspiracy theorists of christian right starting with british revisionist historian nesta helen webster believe there is an ancient occult conspiracy started by first of gnosticism and perpetuated by their alleged esoteric successors such as kabbalists cathars knights templar rosicrucians freemasons and ultimately illuminati which seeks to subvert judeo christian foundations of western world and implement new world order through a one world religion that prepares masses to embrace imperial cult of antichrist more broadly they speculate that globalists who plot on behalf of a new world order are directed by occult agencies of some sort unknown superiors spiritual hierarchies demons fallen angels or lucifer they believe that these conspirators use power of occult sciences numerology symbols eye of providence rituals masonic degrees monuments national mall landmarks buildings manitoba legislative building and facilities denver international airport to advance their plot to rule world for example in june 1979 an unknown benefactor under pseudonym r c christian had a huge granite megalith built in u s state of georgia which acts like a compass calendar and clock a message comprising ten guides is inscribed on occult structure in many languages to serve as instructions for survivors of a doomsday event to establish a more enlightened and sustainable civilization than one which was destroyed georgia guidestones have subsequently become a spiritual and political rorschach test onto which any number of ideas can be imposed some new agers and neo pagans revere it as a ley line power nexus while a few conspiracy theorists are convinced that they are engraved with new world order s anti christian ten commandments should guidestones survive for centuries as their creators intended many more meanings could arise equally unrelated to designer s original intention skeptics argue that demonization of western esotericism by conspiracy theorists is rooted in religious intolerance but also in same moral panics that have fueled witch trials in early modern period and satanic ritual abuse allegations in united states population control conspiracy theorists believe that new world order will also be implemented through use of human population control in order to more easily monitor and control movement of individuals means range from stopping growth of human societies through reproductive health and family planning programs which promote abstinence contraception and abortion or intentionally reducing bulk of world population through genocides by mongering unnecessary wars through plagues by engineering emergent viruses and tainting vaccines and through environmental disasters by controlling weather haarp etc conspiracy theorists argue that globalists plotting on behalf of a new world order are neo who engage in overpopulation and climate change alarmism in order to create public support for coercive population control and ultimately world government agenda 21 is condemned as people into urban areas and rural ones even generating a dystopian novel by glenn beck where single family homes are a distant memory skeptics argue that fears of population control can be traced back to traumatic legacy of eugenics movement s war against weak in united states during first decades of 20th century but also second red scare in u s during late 1940s and 1950s and to a lesser extent in 1960s when activists on far right of american politics routinely opposed public health programs notably water fluoridation mass vaccination and mental health services by asserting they were all part of a far reaching plot to impose a socialist or communist regime their views were influenced by opposition to a number of major social and political changes that had happened in recent years growth of internationalism particularly united nations and its programs introduction of social welfare provisions particularly various programs established by new deal and government efforts to reduce inequalities in social structure of u s opposition towards mass vaccinations in particular got significant attention in late 2010s so much so world health organization listed vaccine hesitancy as one of top ten global health threats of 2019 by this time people that refused or refused to allow their children to be vaccinated were known colloquially as anti though citing new world order conspiracy theory or resistance to a perceived population control agenda as a reason to refuse vaccination were few and far between mind control social critics accuse governments corporations and mass media of being involved in manufacturing of a national consensus and paradoxically a culture of fear due to potential for increased social control that a mistrustful and mutually fearing population might offer to those in power worst fear of some conspiracy theorists however is that new world order will be implemented through use of mind control a broad range of tactics able to subvert an individual s control of his or her own thinking behavior emotions or decisions these tactics are said to include everything from manchurian candidate style brainwashing of sleeper agents project mkultra project monarch to engineering psychological operations water fluoridation subliminal advertising silent sound spread spectrum medusa and parapsychological operations stargate project to influence masses concept of wearing a tin foil hat for protection from such threats has become a popular stereotype and term of derision phrase serves as a byword for paranoia and is associated with conspiracy theorists skeptics argue that paranoia behind a conspiracy theorist s obsession with mind control population control occultism surveillance abuse big business big government and globalization arises from a combination of two factors when he or she 1 holds strong individualist values and 2 lacks power first attribute refers to people who care deeply about an individual s right to make their own choices and direct their own lives without interference or obligations to a larger system like government but combine this with a sense of powerlessness in one s own life and one gets what some psychologists call agency panic intense anxiety about an apparent loss of autonomy to outside forces or regulators when fervent individualists feel that they cannot exercise their independence they experience a crisis and assume that larger forces are to blame for usurping this freedom alleged conspirators according to domhoff many people seem to believe that united states is ruled from behind scenes by a conspiratorial elite with secret desires i e by a small secretive group that wants to change government system or put country under control of a world government in past conspirators were usually said to be crypto communists who were intent upon bringing united states under a common world government with soviet union but dissolution of ussr in 1991 undercut that theory domhoff notes that most conspiracy theorists changed their focus to united nations as likely controlling force in a new world order an idea which is undermined by powerlessness of u n and unwillingness of even moderates within american establishment to give it anything but a limited role although skeptical of new world order conspiracism political scientist david rothkopf argues in 2008 book superclass global power elite and world they are making that world population of 6 billion people is governed by an elite of 6 000 individuals until late 20th century governments of great powers provided most of superclass accompanied by a few heads of international movements i e pope of catholic church and entrepreneurs rothschilds rockefellers according to rothkopf in early 21st century economic clout fueled by explosive expansion of international trade travel and communication rules nation state s power has diminished shrinking politicians to minority power broker status leaders in international business finance and defense industry not only dominate superclass they move freely into high positions in their nations governments and back to private life largely beyond notice of elected legislatures including u s congress which remain abysmally ignorant of affairs beyond their borders he asserts that superclass disproportionate influence over national policy is constructive but always self interested and that across world few object to corruption and oppressive governments provided they can do business in these countries viewing history of world as history of warfare between secret societies conspiracy theorists go further than rothkopf and other scholars who have studied global power elite by claiming that established upper class families with old money who founded and finance bilderberg group bohemian club club of rome council on foreign relations rhodes trust skull and bones trilateral commission and similar think tanks and private clubs are illuminated conspirators plotting to impose a totalitarian new world order implementation of an authoritarian world government controlled by united nations and a global central bank which maintains political power through of economy regulation and restriction of speech through concentration of media ownership mass surveillance widespread use of state terrorism and an all encompassing propaganda that creates a cult of personality around a puppet world leader and world government as culmination of history s progress marxists who are skeptical of right wing populist conspiracy theories also accuse global power elite of not having best interests of all at heart and many intergovernmental organizations of suffering from a democratic deficit but they argue that superclass are plutocrats only interested in brazenly imposing a neoliberal or neoconservative new world order implementation of global capitalism through economic and military coercion to protect interests of transnational corporations which systematically undermines possibility of a socialist one world government arguing that world is in middle of a transition from american empire to rule of a global ruling class that has emerged from within american empire they point out that right wing populist conspiracy theorists blinded by their anti communism fail to see is that what they demonize as new world order is ironically highest stage of very capitalist economic system they defend criticism skeptics of new world order conspiracy theories accuse its proponents of indulging in furtive fallacy a belief that significant facts of history are necessarily sinister conspiracism a world view that centrally places conspiracy theories in unfolding of history rather than social and economic forces and fusion paranoia a promiscuous absorption of fears from any source whatsoever domhoff a research professor in psychology and sociology who studies theories of power wrote in 2005 an essay entitled there are no conspiracies he says that for this theory to be true it required several wealthy and highly educated people to do things that don t fit with what we know about power structures claims that this will happen goes back decades and have always been proved wrong partridge a contributing editor to global affairs magazine diplomatic courier wrote a 2008 article entitled one world government conspiracy theory or inevitable future he says that if anything nationalism which is opposite of a global government is rising he also says that attempts at creating global governments or global agreements have been categorical failures and where supranational governance exist they are noted for their bureaucracy and inefficiency although some cultural critics see theories about a new world order as postmodern that may be politically empowering a way of giving ordinary people a narrative structure with which to question what they see around them skeptics argue that conspiracism leads people into cynicism convoluted thinking and a tendency to feel it is hopeless even as they denounce alleged conspirators alexander zaitchik from southern poverty law center wrote a report titled patriot paranoia a look at top ten conspiracy theories in which he personally condemns such conspiracies as an effort of radical right to undermine society concerned that improvisational millennialism of most conspiracy theories about a new world order might motivate lone wolves to engage in leaderless resistance leading to domestic terrorist incidents like oklahoma city bombing barkun writes that danger lies less in such beliefs themselves than in behavior they might stimulate or justify and warns should they believe that prophesied evil day had in fact arrived their behavior would become far more difficult to predict warning of threat to american democracy posed by right wing populist movements led by demagogues who mobilize support for mob rule or even a fascist revolution by exploiting fear of conspiracies berlet writes that right wing populist movements can cause serious damage to a society because they often popularize xenophobia authoritarianism scapegoating and conspiracism this can lure mainstream politicians to adopt these themes to attract voters legitimize acts of discrimination or even violence and open door for revolutionary right wing populist movements such as fascism to recruit from reformist populist movements hughes a professor of religion warns that no religious idea has greater potential for shaping global politics in profoundly negative ways than new world order he writes in a february 2011 article entitled revelation revolutions and tyrannical new world order that crucial piece of this puzzle is identity of antichrist tyrannical figure who both leads and inspires new world order this has in turn been soviet union and arab world he says that inspires believers to welcome war with islamic world and opens door to nuclear holocaust criticisms of new world order conspiracy theorists also come from within their own community despite believing themselves to be freedom fighters many right wing populist conspiracy theorists hold views that are incompatible with their professed libertarianism such as white supremacism and even this paradox has led icke who argues that christian patriots are only americans who understand truth about new world order which he believes is controlled by a race of reptilians known as babylonian brotherhood to reportedly tell a christian patriot group i don t know which i dislike more world controlled by brotherhood or one
