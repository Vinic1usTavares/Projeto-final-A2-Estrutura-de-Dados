themes in novel include independence redemption and friendship stead also wanted to demonstrate possibilities that she saw in time travel author hoped to show her children what new york was like in her childhood and demonstrate how in an earlier time children were more independent when you reach me was inspired by a man suffering from amnesia and by parts of her childhood and her favorite book a wrinkle in time after completing much of novel stead gave draft to her editor wendy lamb who liked it they expanded on initial concepts and published when you reach me on july 14 2009 under wendy lamb

los angeles times and usa today in addition to receiving 2010 newbery medal when you reach me won several best book of year awards concept and development two main characters are miranda and marcus stead began writing when you reach me in 2007 after an article in new york times gave her an idea for a novel about traveling in time to save someone s life article was about a man who woke up in denver suffering from amnesia having forgotten who he was or why he was there many people worked with man to help him regain his memory under hypnosis he spoke about his apparent wife penny and two daughters who died in a car crash however when he and penny reunited man found out she was only his fiancee and they had no children upon reading this stead wondered if somehow man had returned to past to prevent an accident but lost his memory along way in addition article reminded stead of a strange old man called laughing man who lived near her house as a child all along goal was to be certain that logic would stand up to merciless scrutiny of a smart kid someone might finish book and then go right back and start again reading so closely that she or he would spot any inconsistency we didn t want to let reader down editor wendy lamb while news story initially inspired stead she also tied in parts of her childhood into novel besides laughing man she included her primary school her apartment and a sandwich store where she used to work stead also added memories of herself acting mean without reason slowly novel became more and more about these ordinary mysteries of life and less about fantastic time travel y one after developing basic idea stead began researching science behind time travel to make sure her ideas would be logical she asked her father for help with science and complicated technical aspects since he enjoyed mathematical puzzles as they talked about time travel stead just kept falling into same hole with logic and he really helped me straighten it out when stead was only halfway done she hit a wall she wondered if she had focused novel too much on her own personal life and problems by her 40th birthday in january 2007 she had stopped writing one week after her birthday celebration stead went to a writers conference where presenter advised attendees to stop thinking and just write this speech worked as an antidote to stead s writer s block she started working on when you reach me again after she had written two thirds of novel stead sent draft to her editor wendy lamb at random house perusing script lamb found herself absorbed and wanted to help develop book unlike stead s debut novel first light which lamb heavily edited lamb modified nothing on first draft of when you reach me throughout process stead helped lamb understand complicated concepts in book and had drafts read by others to make sure revision hadn t created any holes or contradictions in plot a wrinkle in time throughout story main character miranda is often reading madeleine l engle s a wrinkle in time stead s favorite book as a child she read and reread it multiple times she recalls that l engle was only author she met in her childhood stead described novel as a talisman for miranda she included it in first draft and planned to remove it because you can t just toss a wrinkle in time in there casually her editor suggested leaving it in if it could be better tied into story stead was aware that she did not want a wrinkle in time to have too big an influence on when you reach me keeping this in mind she reread a wrinkle in time through perspective of different characters which enabled her to develop new connections and ideas in her own work setting when you reach me takes place during 1978 1979 school year of miranda main character stead placed miranda s home in upper west side new york city where stead grew up many parts of novel explore same streets where stead grew up and riffs on some of her experiences stead was inspired to use this setting because she moved into an apartment near her childhood home early in development of story there she had experienced her first independence while exploring streets only to find a scary man near her house wondering why he was there stead later used this encounter as anchor as she wrote when you reach me plot summary m this is hard harder than i expected even with your help but i have been

is of science fiction and time travel genres quattlebaum found that unlike usual time travel stories when you reach me does not involve cheesy time travel machines and rock em sock em action but

science fiction devices setting was still firmly rooted in reality retrieved november 2 2010 retrieved october 31 2010 some reviewers have placed parts novel in mystery genre edinger found that despite broad genres novel is mainly a thrilling puzzle she relates pieces slowly clues are found in story itself on map in words and chapter titles at end of book everything is tied together and makes sense ann crewdson of school library journal found that each note miranda receives foreshadows next event each note is skillfully integrated into novel along with subsequent clues until climax is reached and all clues come together retrieved november 2 2010 stead s editor lamb agreed with mystery genre in that there s plenty to wonder about after you finish book just as we wonder why our feelings change so suddenly or why someone like laughing man appears on corner one day gurdon of wall street journal concurred with lamb adding that although novel is clearly a mystery mystery itself is not revealed until end where last note comes and where everything ties together themes aaron mead found that novel addresses question of how to hold on to old friendships without stifling them and it brings out stabilizing effect that new friendships can have in effort to preserve or reclaim old ones he noted that novel deeply helps children in middle school crewdson opined that book deals with

discovers that alice is an insecure girl stead finds that kids today are much less independent since her childhood she wrote f rom age nine my friends and i were on streets walking home going to each other s houses going to store i really wanted to write about that independence that s a little bit scary but also a really positive thing in a lot of ways and i m not sure that most kids have that today throughout novel miranda and her friends often walk around town without any adults they are even found working in a sandwich store at lunch and walking home from school while trying to avoid laughing man while writing novel stead hoped to show her sons time period in which she lived send ing them on a little time travel journey of their own laura miller of new yorker found that this lack of independence in today s youth is mainly due to fact that kids now grow up with adults constantly watching them miller noted how despite lower crime rate in current times characters middle class middle school students routinely walk around upper west side by themselves a rare freedom in today s city time travel julianna helt from pittsburgh post gazette found that time travel forms a central theme as miranda constantly wonders how time travel could be possible in when you reach me marcus helps miranda realize that three old ladies from a wrinkle in time lied to meg by promising they would return five minutes before they left marcus explains so garden is where they appear when they get home at end of book remember they land in broccoli so if they had gotten home five minutes before they left like those ladies promised they would then they would have seen themselves get back before they did roger sutton from horn book magazine felt that moment marcus explains this flaw to miranda is first exchange that shows novel to be complicated and mysterious quattlebaum noted story s structure an expert interweaving of past present and future brilliantly contradicts miranda s belief that end can t happen before middle stead explained her view of time travel in her novel where going back in time is fulfilling future rather than changing it she hoped to make time travel element logical to
