area new station will have a single platform an accessible footbridge and a car park with trains running between and bristol history thumb a train crosses pill viaduct in 1960 this is a service from portishead which has just left pill pill railway station was opened on 18 april 1867 by bristol and portishead pier and railway company when services began on their line from bristol and exeter railway at portishead junction to a pier on severn estuary at station served village of pill on south bank of river avon line was built as broad gauge and was largely single track station was sited in a cutting close to old centre of pill from line s terminus at portishead from and from great western railway s terminus at railways in united kingdom are for historical reasons measured in miles and chains there are 80 chains to mile to east railway passed through village and crossed a valley on brick built pill viaduct while to west line was largely through flat open countryside station was initially second along line from portishead junction after and before station at pill was aligned roughly north west south east with line bridged to east by station road and myrtle hill there were two platforms separated by two running lines forming a passing loop southern down platform was for trains towards portishead northern up platform for trains towards bristol each platform was provided with a brick shelter and steps up to station road station building was sited on station road west of platforms there were initially six trains per day in each direction on weekdays and one on sundays operated by bristol and exeter railway great western took over bristol and exeter in 1876 and in 1884 took over ownership of bristol and portishead services increased to nine trains per day on weekdays by 1889 line was relaid as standard gauge in 1880 coinciding with a lengthening of platforms and by 1909 there were 13 trains per day on weekdays and two trains on sundays double track loop through station was extended at both ends in march 1912 with platforms also extended a small goods yard and coal depot was built at north west end of station at same time a signal box was built on southern platform at end of first world war by 1929 services had increased to 21 trains per day on weekdays and eight per day on sundays this allowed a train every half hour with one train per hour running to bristol temple meads and other terminating at passenger traffic was mainly commuters to both bristol and portishead as well as people who wished to use pill ferry across river to shirehampton during second world war many evacuees from bristol commuted into city from pill station staff at this time consisted of a station master two porters and two female signallers when railways were nationalised in 1948 pill came under aegis of western region of british railways passenger services had reduced by 1949 to 13 trains per day on weekdays and seven on sundays in 1963 beeching report suggested complete withdrawal of services along line as a cost saving measure and so goods services at pill were ended on 10 june 1963 with station closing completely on 7 september 1964 in final year of operation there were only six trains on weekdays and none on sundays freight trains continued to pass through station but their number decreased over time and line fell out of regular use after 30 march 1981 line however was kept intact by british rail with occasional freight trains and in 2002 a single track was relaid to allow rail access to royal portbury dock which brought regular freight traffic at this time remnants of both platforms could be seen and station buildings were in commercial use future thumb a computer rendering of how a reopened pill railway station would look as seen from south portishead branch line is to be reopened as part of metrowest scheme a rail transport plan which aims to enhance transport capacity in bristol area scheme was given go ahead in july 2012 as part of city deal whereby local councils would be given greater control over money by government there had been calls for line to reopen primarily due to traffic congestion on a369 which is only route from portishead to bristol a consultation on reopening plans was held between 22 june and 3 august 2015 to gather views from community and stakeholders before moving on to detailed designs due to additional capital costs line will not be electrified however design will include passive provision for future electrification in april 2019 department for transport committed ps31 9m to cover shortfall in finance for metrowest phase 1 meaning that funding has now been secured in november 2019 north somerset council submitted a development consent order dco application to planning inspectorate which seeks powers to build and operate disused section of railway from portishead to pill gain environmental consent to undertake works to existing freight railway through avon gorge and obtain powers for compulsory acquisition of land secretary of state for transport is expected to make a decision within 18 months subject to final business case approval construction work is expected to start on line in december 2021 and then take around two years to complete as part of works pill station will be reopened trains both to and from will use southern platform which will be resurfaced and provided with a waiting shelter lighting passenger information displays and audible announcements northern platform adjacent to current single track line to royal portbury dock will not be reinstated however track will be retained for freight trains two tracks will have a junction east of station initial plans for station were for access to be from monmouth road which runs parallel to railway north of line there was to be a fully accessible footbridge across line with both ramp and stairs as well as a pedestrian crossing across monmouth road and a lit 50 space car park on old goods yard at eastern end of monmouth road very end of goods yard would be maintained for network rail access these plans were changed following an agreement to acquire a property on station road new plans have entrance to be on station road at east end of site meaning there would be no need for a footbridge there would be disabled parking and a pick up drop off point adjacent to entrance although exact design of this area is still under consideration noise mitigation options are to be investigated and there will be improvements to local footpaths it is expected that reopening station will result in reduced car usage to and from pill and surrounding villages most station users will walk to station with next largest share being car drivers and car passengers being dropped off followed by cyclists and bus users some parking restrictions are proposed to prevent rail users parking on local streets which are narrow and not suitable for widening trains along reopened line will operate between portishead and with two trains per hour in each direction services would call at pill and with aspirations to also call at and a reopened trains could also be extended on to severn beach line trains used will be diesel multiple units likely three carriages long line will be operated as part of greater western passenger franchise great western railway a subsidiary of firstgroup currently operate greater western franchise however their present contract expires before services to portishead are likely to start see also metrowest notes references notes
