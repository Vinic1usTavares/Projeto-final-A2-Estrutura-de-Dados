with same line bach led first performance on 1 june 1727 work at bach digital website librettist of cantata is unknown a central contemplative aria for alto accompanied by two flutes and muted strings is framed by recitatives while two outer movements are performed by chorus and a festive baroque instrumental ensemble of three trumpets timpani two oboes strings and continuo last movement quotes conclusion of psalm 128 peace upon israel themes of eternal fire love dwelling together and peace suit both occasions wedding and pentecost history and text thumb upright 1 18 nikolaikirche in leipzig where cantata was first performed bach adapted movements 1 3 and 5 of this cantata for pentecost sunday in a later wedding cantata formerly it was believed that as bwv34 2 was then called was older work in bach s leipzig readings for pentecost were from acts of apostles on holy spirit and from gospel of john in which jesus announces spirit who will teach in his farewell discourse workload of composer and his musicians was high for christmas easter and pentecost because in leipzig they were all celebrated for three days texts are of unknown authorship christoph wolff eds die welt der bach kantaten metzler barenreiter stuttgart und kassel 3 bande 2006 beginning of text of wedding cantata could be kept unchanged because image of flames and spirit of love suit pentecostal events as well as a wedding author had only to replace reference to paar united couple with a reference to gospel movement 5 quotes conclusion of psalm 128 peace upon israel this quote was already part of movement 4 of wedding cantata which quotes in movement 3 verses 4 6a from same psalm bach led first performance on 1 june 1727 in nikolaikirche bach scholar klaus hofmann notes that a printed libretto for congregation was recently found in russian national library in st petersburg containing texts for three feast days of pentecost and trinity of 1727 until then work had been dated much later such as 1746 when a revival took place for which performance material exists as music of 1727 version is lost timing of bach s revisions to wedding cantata is not known it is likely that he revised it further in 1740s because he wrote a new score structure and scoring bach structured cantata in five movements with two choral movements framing a sequence of recitative aria recitative bach scored work for three vocal soloists alto tenor bass a four part choir and a baroque instrumental ensemble of three trumpets tr timpani ti two flauti traversi ft two oboes ob two violins vl viola va and basso continuo bach scholar christoph wolff describes large scale instrumental scoring as suited to festive occasion in following table of movements scoring follows neue bach ausgabe continuo playing throughout is not shown music 1 opening chorus o eternal fire o source of love illustrates two contrasting subjects ewig eternal and feuer fire while ewig appears as long notes held for more than one measure flames or tongues of fire are set in lively figuration from strings and agile coloraturas from voices instrumental ritornello comprises a sustained trumpet entry active strings and flickering oboes drums and trumpets unlike in most da capo movements this ritornello appears only at beginning and end basses enter first holding a top d for most of five bars to symbolise eternal other three parts with fiery embellishments as john eliot gardiner notes middle section develops these themes in minor keys in dance like vocal pairings before ritornello returns one more time to reprise first section 2 a tenor recitative lord our hearts keep your word of truth fast adopts an authoritative tone is in minor mode and begins with a bass pedal it expands concept of god abiding with his people as outlined in gospel 3 an alto aria it is well for you you chosen souls whom god has designated for his dwelling conveys images of contentment by incorporating a lilting berceuse like rhythm with an obbligato melody played by muted violins and flutes in octaves and tenths it is accompanied by a tonic pedal in continuo aria is in adapted ternary form pastoral character suited original text wohl euch ihr schafe it is well for you you chosen sheep which alludes to bridegroom a pastor or shepherd of souls gardiner notes tender sensuousness of pastoral writing pairings of thirds and sixths blending of flutes and muted strings and satisfying textures and calm enchantment disturbed only momentarily by modulation and considers that piece possibly had some deeper personal significance 4 bass recitative if god chooses holy dwellings that he inhabits with salvation is quite similar in character to tenor recitative last two measures form an introduction to closing movement 5 closing chorus peace upon israel opens with a solemn rendering of psalm text marked adagio violins and oboes first play an ascending figure gardiner notes that section is reminiscent of and equivalent in grandeur to opening exordium to b minor mass slow music on psalm text is contrasted by a spirited and very secular sounding march setting thank exalted wondrous hands both sections appear first as instrumental and are then repeated by chorus hofmann notes that this music is reminiscent of bach s works for kothen court composed for leopold prince of anhalt kothen gardiner concludes selected
