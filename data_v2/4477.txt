dedicated to his own patron saint michael archangel one reason for building church may have been svyatopolk s recent victory over nomadic as michael archangel was considered a patron of warriors and

of his father monastery was regarded as a family cloister of svyatopolk s family it was there that members of svyatopolk s family were buried this is in contrast to monastery patronized by his rival vladimir cathedral domes were probably first in kievan rus to be gilded a practice that became regular with passage of time and acquired for monastery nickname of golden domed or golden roofed depending on translation during mongol invasion in 1240 monastery is believed to have been damaged seriously mongols damaged cathedral and removed its gold plated domes cloister subsequently fell into disrepair and there is no documentation of it for following two and a half centuries by 1496 monastery had been revived and its name was changed from st demetrius monastery to st michael s after

monastery in early 1900s monastery enjoyed patronage of hetmans and other benefactors throughout years chief magnet for pilgrims were relics of saint barbara alleged to have been brought to kiev from constantinople in 1108 by sviatopolk ii iziaslavych s wife and kept in a silver reliquary donated by hetman ivan mazepa although most of monastery grounds were secularized in late eighteenth century as many as 240 monks resided there in nineteenth and twentieth centuries monastery served as residence of bishop of chernigov after 1800 a precentor s school was located on monastery grounds many prominent composers such as kyrylo stetsenko and yakiv either studied or taught at school in 1870 about 100 000 pilgrims paid tribute to st barbara at st michael s monastery before russian revolution in 1917 rings manufactured and blessed at st michael s monastery known as st barbara s rings were very popular among citizens of kiev they usually served as good luck charms and according to popular beliefs occasionally protected against witchcraft but were also effective against serious illnesses and sudden death these beliefs reference facts that monastery was not affected by plague epidemics in 1710 and 1770 and cholera epidemics of nineteenth century demolition of cathedral and belltower during first half of 1930s various soviet publications questioned known historical facts regarding age of cathedral publications stressed that medieval building had undergone major reconstructions and that little of original byzantine style cathedral was preserved this wave of questioning led to demolition of monastery and its replacement with a new administrative centre for ukrainian soviet socialist republic previously located in city of kharkiv before its demolition 8 june 9 july 1934 structure was carefully studied by t m and k from recently purged and re organized institute of material culture of ukrainian academy of sciences on basis of their survey cathedral was declared to belong primarily to ukrainian baroque style rather than to twelfth century as was previously thought and thus did not merit preservation due to its lack of historical and artistic value this conclusion backed up soviet authorities plans to demolish entire monastery local historians archaeologists and architects agreed to monastery s demolition although reluctantly only one professor mykola refused to sign demolition act he later died in a soviet prison in mid 1930s after transfer of ukrainian capital from kharkov to kiev a decision was made to demolish cathedral and build administrative buildings in its place for this purpose in 1934 soviet authorities have decided to hold a competition for project of governmental center with a place for parades in all of projects submitted for location in area of bogdan khmelnitsky square st michael s golden domed cathedral was demolished except for one project of joseph karakis was only one of four projects submitted for competition with location of center in this place in which st michael s golden domed cathedral and monument to bogdan khmelnitsky were preserved however at end of first round project of architect peter yurchenko was selected by authorities as most appropriate this project according to architect b was repeating general scheme of karakis but was done in a more frontal approach with liquidation of st michael s golden domed cathedral and if location of main volumes of karakis is asymmetric in march 1934 authorities decided to abandon previous decision and announce a new competition and at end to choose project of architect joseph langbard meanwhile according to oleg s research based on archive documents it is clear that although there is no cathedral in projects of j langbard and p yurchenko that was not reason for demolition since decision to demolish monastery was adopted by resolution of politburo of central committee of communist party in february 1934 and dismantling of mosaics began to be produced already in 1933 on 26 june 1934 work began on removal of twelfth century byzantine mosaics it was conducted by mosaic section of leningrad academy of fine arts specialists were forced to work in haste on account of impending demolition and were thus unable to complete entire project despite care and attention shown during removal of mosaics from cathedral s walls relocated mosaics cannot be relied upon as being absolutely authentic remaining mosaics covering an area of 45 square metres 485 sq ft were apportioned among state hermitage museum tretyakov gallery and state russian museum other remaining mosaics were installed on second floor of saint sophia cathedral where they were not on display for tourists those items that remained in kiev were seized by nazis during world war ii and taken to germany after war ended they fell into american hands and were later returned to moscow during spring of 1935 golden domes of monastery were pulled down cathedral s silver royal gates mazepa s reliquary weighing two poods of silver and other valuables were sold abroad or simply destroyed master hryhoryi s five tier iconostasis was removed and later destroyed from cathedral as well st barbara s relics were transferred to church of tithes and upon that church s demolition to st volodymyr s cathedral in 1961 during spring summer period of 1936 shell of cathedral and belltower were blown up with dynamite monastery s economic gate and monastic walls were also destroyed after demolition a thorough search for valuables was carried out by nkvd on site resulting empty plot was joined with square renamed square governmental square and was designated as new city center and parade grounds soviet authorities then commissioned a competition how to best fill empty plot most architects including yakiv suggested a huge lenin statue square itself was planned as a rectangle with huge governmental buildings on perimeter four pillars were planned with statues of workers peasants and revolutionaries with flags standing on them some architects suggested to demolish statue of bohdan khmelnytsky in front of saint sophia cathedral and cathedral itself only building completed on former monastery grounds before world war ii currently houses ministry of foreign affairs construction of second building capital center planned to be built on site where cathedral had once stood was delayed in spring of 1938 as authorities were not satisfied with submitted design this building failed to materialize some time after demolition site where former

in 1108 1113 at behest of sviatopolk ii iziaslavych cathedral was largest of three churches of st demetrius monastery ancient cathedral was modeled on assumption cathedral of kiev monastery of caves it used greek cross plan prevalent during time of kievan rus six pillars and three apses a miniature church likely a baptistery adjoined cathedral from south there was also a tower with a staircase leading to choir loft it was incorporated into northern part of narthex rather than protruding from main block as was common at time it is likely that cathedral had a single dome although two smaller domes might have topped tower and baptistery interior decoration was lavish as its high quality shimmering mosaics probably finest in kievan rus still testify when medieval churches of kiev were rebuilt in late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries in ukrainian baroque style cathedral was enlarged and renovated dramatically by 1746 it had acquired a new baroque exterior while maintaining its original byzantine interior six domes were added to original single dome but added pressure on walls was counteracted by construction of buttresses remaining medieval walls characterised by alternative layers of limestone and flat brick were covered with stucco ivan was responsible for window surrounds and stucco ornamentation inside church an intricate five tier icon screen funded by hetman pavlo skoropadsky and executed by hryhoryi from chernigov was installed in 1718 during eighteenth and nineteenth centuries almost all of original byzantine mosaics and frescoes on interior walls were painted over some restoration work on mosaics and frescoes that remained unpainted was carried out towards end of nineteenth century however there were no major and serious investigations of walls done so it is possible that medieval frescoes or mosaics were preserved under newer coats of plaster refectory of st john divine refectory of monastery is a rectangular brick building which contains a dining hall for brethren as well as several kitchens and pantries church of john theologian adjoins it from east outside is segmented by pilasters and displays window surrounds reminiscent
