match between balls mahoney and matt striker sabu was depicted as being injured backstage and unable to compete in extreme elimination chamber match in reality however it was rumored that sabu had animosity surrounding him backstage and was said to be uninterested at television tapings rumors evolved stating that wwe viewed sabu as being useless in normal matches and that he could only perform in matches that included stunts and tables and they wwe don t respect him because of that this was reportedly part of reason he had been scripted to be easily defeated by umaga on an episode of raw a few weeks earlier wwe chairman vince mcmahon wanted to put holly in sabu s place so lashley would have more villains to overcome heyman was legitimately unhappy with decision saying that sabu s high flying wrestling would be ideal showcase inside extreme elimination chamber fans inside james brown arena chanted bullshit during segment in second tag team match of night elijah burke and sylvester terkay defeated f b i members little guido maritato and tony mamaluke burke pinned mamaluke after performing a forward russian legsweep on him and gaining pinfall after match terkay performed a muscle

headed backstage next match of night was an intergender tag team match with kevin thorn and ariel against mike knox and kelly kelly before match began kelly kelly was shown wishing cm punk her on screen crush luck for main event end of match came when knox abandoned kelly kelly in ring and ariel performed a legsweep a variation of a takedown on kelly kelly before covering her for win following match ariel and thorn attempted to attack kelly kelly before sandman interrupted and hit thorn repeatedly with a kendo stick main event match thumb right elimination chamber structure main event was extreme elimination chamber for ecw world championship after a segment earlier in event showed an injured sabu was unable to compete in match it was decided that hardcore holly would take his spot in ecw championship match before match began paul heyman announced rules of match and explained that each superstar had a weapon with them in each of their pods before entering ring heyman had a conversation backstage with big show that was unseen by television viewers with him revealing that for first time in his professional career he was not motivated to give promo rob van dam and hardcore holly were first superstars to begin match and one of other four competitors were then released from their pod every five minutes afterward first person to be released from his pod was cm punk who entered match with a steel chair in hand test then followed five minutes after him with a crowbar punk was first eliminated from match after van dam performed a five star frog splash from top turnbuckle and covered him for 3 count moments later test charged and delivered a big boot to holly eliminating him van dam was third person eliminated after test delivered a diving elbow drop from top of a pod and pinned him when it was bobby lashley s turn his pod wouldn t open he could not exit it because heyman s security force had bolted door shut lashley then used table that was with him to smash through pod allowing him to escape he then delivered a spear to test to eliminate him big show was final man to exit his pod and had a baseball bat wrapped in barbed wire in tow lashley was able to block big show s swing of barbed wire bat with a folding chair and then threw him into pod causing him to bleed lashley managed to reverse a chokeslam into a ddt and then delivered a spear to win match and become new ecw champion aftermath not long after december to dismember big show was offered a long term contract extension by wwe reported to be around 1 million a year he declined offer however reasoning he was burned out and hurting physically on first episode of ecw to air after december to dismember show and lashley would compete in a rematch for ecw championship big show lost thus ending their storyline feud and he announced his retirement from wrestling although he made his return in 2008 at no way out after storyline feud with big show ended lashley entered a short program with rob van dam which led to van dam earning a title match on january 2 2007 episode of ecw match between two ended in a no contest after test interfered during bout test s interference led to a storyline with champion leading to a title match at royal rumble which lashley won reception less than 24 hours after pay per view wwe announced on their official website that vince mcmahon had sent heyman home citing slumping television ratings and a disgruntled talent roster as causes for mr heyman s dismissal heyman and mcmahon clashed on plane to north charleston coliseum and after a producers meeting heyman was escorted from coliseum and sent home he was also immediately pulled from ecw s creative team after altercation mcmahon was attempting to put blame on heyman for poorly received pay per view and after a meeting with vince and stephanie mcmahon heyman legitimately left world wrestling entertainment but remained under contract heyman was against decision of lashley being booked to win ecw championship and instead wanted to have cm punk win it a decision mcmahon disliked this situation was cited by punk in his controversial shoot promo in 2011 in which he referred to idea as one in which heyman saw something in punk that nobody else wanted to admit in an early 2008 interview with sun heyman gave more details on how he would have booked extreme elimination chamber main event which included having punk enter first and quickly eliminating big show via submission according to interview mcmahon nixed idea but big show liked direction heyman was heading and was eager for opportunity to make a rising star like punk he also stated that he kept going to mcmahon on night of pay per view to say that people are going to throw this back in our face upset at how event turned out tommy dreamer and stevie richards both asked after event to be released from their contracts both requests were refused by mcmahon and wwe s vice president of talent relations john laurinaitis critics had a negative reaction to pay per view with only match that received praise being hardy boyz versus mnm tag team match slam sports rated pay per view 4 out of 10
