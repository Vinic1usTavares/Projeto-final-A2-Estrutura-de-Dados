deutschland class cruiser deutschland class was a series of three panzerschiffe armored ships a form of heavily armed cruiser built by reichsmarine officially in accordance with restrictions imposed by treaty of versailles ships of class and were all stated to displace in accordance with treaty though they actually displaced at standard displacement despite violating weight limit design for ships incorporated several radical innovations to save weight they were first major warships to use welding and all diesel propulsion due to their heavy armament of six guns and lighter weight british began referring to vessels as pocket battleships deutschland class ships were initially classified as panzerschiffe but kriegsmarine reclassified them as heavy cruisers in february 1940 three ships were built between 1929 and 1936 by deutsche werke in kiel and reichsmarinewerft in wilhelmshaven seeing much service with german navy all three vessels served on non intervention patrols during spanish civil war while on patrol deutschland was attacked by republican bombers and in response admiral scheer bombarded port of almeria in 1937 admiral graf spee represented germany at coronation review for britain s king george vi for rest of their peacetime careers ships conducted a series of fleet maneuvers in atlantic and visited numerous foreign ports in goodwill tours before outbreak of world war ii deutschland and admiral graf spee were deployed to atlantic to put them in position to attack allied merchant traffic once war was declared admiral scheer remained in port for periodic maintenance deutschland was not particularly successful on her raiding sortie during which she sank or captured three ships she then returned to germany where she was renamed lutzow admiral graf spee sank nine vessels in south atlantic before she was confronted by three british cruisers at battle of river plate although she damaged british ships severely she was herself damaged and her engines were in poor condition coupled with false reports of british reinforcements state of ship convinced hans langsdorff her commander to scuttle ship outside montevideo lutzow and admiral scheer were deployed to norway in 1942 to join attacks on allied convoys to soviet union admiral scheer conducted operation wunderland in august 1942 a sortie into kara sea to attack soviet merchant shipping though it ended without significant success lutzow took part in battle of barents sea in december 1942 a failed attempt to destroy a convoy both ships were damaged in course of their deployment to norway and eventually returned to germany for repairs they ended their careers bombarding advancing soviet forces on eastern front both ships were destroyed by british bombers in final weeks of war lutzow was raised and sunk as a target by soviet navy and admiral scheer was partially broken up in situ with remainder of hulk buried beneath rubble development following germany s defeat in world war i size of german navy renamed reichsmarine was limited by treaty of versailles navy was permitted a force of six pre dreadnought battleships and six light cruisers ships could not be replaced until they were twenty years old to replace battleships new vessels were to displace at most germany s potential rivals were at this time limited to building vessels of by washington naval treaty and subsequent agreements gun caliber of any new ship was not regulated by treaty itself though naval inter allied commission of control niacc created by treaty did have authority to regulate armament of all new warships allies assumed that with these limitations only coastal defense ships similar to those operated by scandinavian navies could be built oldest battleship was laid down in 1902 and could therefore be replaced legally in 1922 design studies were considered starting in 1920 with two basic options navy could build a heavily armored slow and small warship similar to a monitor or a large fast and lightly armored vessel similar to a cruiser actual design work on new type of armored ship began in 1923 but german economy collapsed in 1924 forcing a temporary halt to work admiral hans zenker commander in chief of reichsmarine pushed hard for navy to resume design work and in 1925 three new proposals were drafted in addition to two sketches prepared in 1923 this totaled five different designs of first two designs i 10 was a cruiser armed with eight guns while ii 10 was a heavily armored ship armed with four guns three designs prepared in 1925 ii 30 iv 30 and v 30 were armed with six guns with varying levels of armor protection reichsmarine eventually opted for guns to avoid provoking allies and to ease pressures on design staff reichsmarine held a conference to evaluate designs in may 1925 though results were inconclusive of particular importance was continued french occupation of ruhr industrial area which prevented germany from quickly building large caliber artillery nevertheless design staff prepared another set of designs i 35 a heavily armored ship with a single triple turret forward and viii 30 a more lightly armored ship with a pair of twin turrets reichsmarine initially intended to lay down first armored ship in 1926 but design had not yet been finalized 1926 maneuvers informed design staff that greater speed was desirable and that year a further two designs were submitted to zenker initial design for deutschland ordered as panzerschiff a was prepared in 1926 and finalized by 1928 zenker announced on 11 june 1927 that navy had settled on one of several proposals for new warships reichsmarine had decided that new ships would be armed with two triple turrets mounting 28 cm guns political opposition to new ships was significant reichsmarine therefore decided to delay ordering ship until after reichstag elections in 1928 question over whether to build new ships was a major issue in elections particularly with social democrats who strongly opposed new ships and campaigned with slogan food not panzerkreuzer in may 1928 elections were concluded and enough of a majority in favor of new ships was elected this included twelve seats won by adolf hitler s nazi party an october 1928 attempt by communist party of germany to initiate a referendum against construction failed first of new ships was authorized in november 1928 when particulars of design became known by allies they attempted to prevent germany from building them reichsmarine offered to halt construction on first ship in exchange for admittance to washington treaty with a ratio of to britain s allotment of of capital ship tonnage in doing so this would effectively abrogate clauses in treaty of versailles that limited germany s naval power britain and united states favored making concessions to germany but france refused to allow any revisions to treaty of versailles since ships did not violate terms of treaty allies could not prevent germany from building them after a negotiated settlement proved unattainable design general characteristics thumb recognition drawing of lutzow as she appeared in 1942 it indicates that armoured belt is 4 inches thick instead of its actual 3 1 inches three deutschland class ships varied slightly in dimensions all three ships were long at waterline and as built long overall deutschland and admiral scheer had clipper bows installed in 1940 1941 their overall length was increased to deutschland had a beam of admiral scheers beam was while admiral graf spees was deutschland and admiral scheer had a standard draft of and a full load draft of admiral graf spees draft was and respectively displacement of three ships increased over class standard displacement grew from for deutschland to for admiral scheer and for admiral graf spee ships full load displacements were significantly higher at for deutschland for admiral scheer and for admiral graf spee ships were officially stated to be within limit of treaty of versailles however ships hulls were constructed with transverse steel frames over 90 percent of hulls used welding instead of then standard riveting which saved 15 percent of their total hull weight this savings allowed armament and armor to be increased hulls contained twelve watertight compartments and were fitted with a double bottom that extended for 92 percent of length of keel as designed ship s complement comprised 33 officers and 586 enlisted men after 1935 crew was dramatically increased to 30 officers and 921 1 040 sailors while serving as a squadron flagship an additional 17 officers and 85 enlisted men augmented crew second flagship had an additional 13 officers and 59 sailors ships carried a number of smaller boats including two picket boats two barges one launch one pinnace and two dinghies kriegsmarine considered ships to be good sea boats with a slight roll as built they were wet in a head sea though this was significantly improved by installation of a clipper bow in 1940 1941 ships were highly maneuverable particularly when maneuvering setting for diesel engines was used in which half of engines for each shaft were run in reverse ships heeled over up to 13 degrees with rudder hard over low stern was wet in a stern sea and equipment stored there was frequently lost overboard machinery deutschland class ships were equipped with four sets of 9 cylinder double acting two stroke diesel engines built by man adoption of an all diesel propulsion system was a radical innovation at time and contributed to significant savings in weight each set was controlled by transmissions built by ag vulcan engines were paired on two propeller shafts which were attached to three bladed screws that were in diameter deutschland was initially fitted with diameter screws though they were replaced with larger screws engines were rated at and a top speed of they did not meet expected shaft horsepower on trials though they did exceed their design speeds deutschlands engines reached and and admiral scheers engines reached and horsepower figures for admiral graf spee are not recorded though her top speed on trials was deutschland could carry up to of fuel oil which provided a maximum range of at a speed of an increase in speed by one knot reduced range slightly to at a higher speed of range fell to admiral scheer carried and had a correspondingly shorter range of at 20 kn admiral graf spee stored of fuel which enabled a range of electricity was supplied by four electric generators powered by two diesel engines their total output was 2 160 kw for deutschland 2 800 kw for admiral scheer and 3 360 kw for admiral graf spee all at 220 volts steering was controlled by a single rudder armament thumb lutzows rear gun turret three deutschland class ships were armed with a main battery of six 28 cm sk c 28 guns mounted in two triple turrets one on either end of superstructure turrets were drh lc 28 type and allowed elevation to 40 degrees and depression to 8 degrees this provided guns with a maximum range of they fired a projectile at a muzzle velocity of guns were initially supplied with a total 630 rounds of ammunition and this was later increased to 720 shells secondary battery comprised eight 15 cm sk c 28 guns each in single 28 mountings arranged amidships these mountings allowed elevation to 35 degrees and depression to 10 degrees for a range of they were supplied with a total of 800 rounds of ammunition though later in their careers this was increased to 1 200 rounds these shells weighed and had a muzzle velocity of ships were also equipped with eight torpedo tubes placed in two quadruple launchers mounted on their stern as built ships anti aircraft battery consisted of three 8 8 cm sk l 45 anti aircraft guns in single mounts these were replaced in 1935 with six 8 8 cm sk c 31 guns in twin mounts admiral graf spee and deutschland were rearmed in 1938 and 1940 respectively with six 10 5 cm l 65 guns four 3 7 cm sk c 30 guns and initially ten 2 cm flak guns number of 2 cm guns on deutschland was eventually increased to 28 admiral scheer had been rearmed by 1945 with six guns eight 3 7 cm guns and thirty three 2 cm guns armor ships main armored belt was thick amidships and reduced to on either end of central citadel bow and stern were unarmored at waterline this belt was inclined to increase its protective qualities and supplemented by a longitudinal splinter bulkhead upper edge of belt on deutschland and admiral scheer was at level of armored deck on admiral graf spee it was extended one deck higher deutschlands underwater protection consisted of a thick torpedo bulkhead admiral scheers and admiral graf spees bulkheads were reduced to deutschland had a thick upper deck and a main armored deck that ranged in thickness from 18 40 mm admiral scheer and admiral graf spee had main decks and armored decks that ranged in thickness from 17 45 mm armored deck in deutschland and admiral scheer did not extend over entire width of ship due to weight this matter was rectified in admiral graf spee likewise torpedo bulkheads for deutschland and admiral scheer stopped at inside of double bottom but in admiral graf spee extended to outer hull ships forward conning tower had thick sides with a thick roof while aft conning tower was less well protected with 50 mm thick sides and a thick roof main battery turrets had thick faces and thick sides their roofs ranged in thickness from 15 cm guns were armored with gun shields for splinter protection admiral scheer and admiral graf spee had some improvements in armor thickness barbettes 100 mm thick in deutschland became 125 mm for two sisters admiral scheer had belt somewhat improved and admiral graf spee had a much more improved 100 mm belt instead of 50 80 mm armored deck was improved as well and some places had up to 70 mm thickness ref whitley m j german capital ships of world war two arm and armour press london 1989 ref classification kriegsmarine initially classified ships as panzerschiffe armored ships but in february 1940 it reclassified two survivors of class as heavy cruisers due to their heavy armament of six 28 cm 11 in guns high speed and long cruising range class was more capable of high seas operation than old pre dreadnought battleships they replaced for this reason they were referred to as pocket battleships particularly in british press in 1938 jane s fighting ships stated deutschland class a re officially rated as armoured ships panzerschiffe and popularly referred to as pocket battleships actually they are equivalent to armoured cruisers of an exceptionally powerful type construction thumb deutschland at her was laid down at deutsche werke shipyard in kiel on 5 february 1929 under contract name panzerschiff a as a replacement for old battleship preussen work began under construction number 219 ship was launched on 19 may 1931 at her launching she was christened by german chancellor heinrich bruning ship accidentally started sliding down slipway while bruning was giving his christening speech after completion of fitting out work initial sea trials began in november 1932 ship was commissioned into reichsmarine on 1 april 1933 serious political opposition to ships continued after authorization for deutschland and a political crisis over second ship admiral scheer was averted only after social democrats abstained from voting as a result of opposition panzerschiff b was not authorized until 1931 a replacement for old battleship her keel was laid on 25 june 1931 at reichsmarinewerft shipyard in wilhelmshaven under construction number 123 ship was launched on 1 april 1933 at her launching she was christened by marianne daughter of admiral reinhard scheer after whom ship was named she was completed slightly over a year and a half later on 12 november 1934 day she was commissioned into german fleet admiral graf spee third and final member of class was also ordered by reichsmarine from kriegsmarinewerft shipyard in wilhelmshaven she was ordered under contract name panzerschiff c to replace battleship her keel was laid on 1 october 1932 under construction number 125 ship was launched on 30 june 1934 at her launching she was christened by daughter of admiral maximilian von spee after whom ship was named she was completed slightly over a year and a half later on 6 january 1936 day she was commissioned into german fleet possible conversion after hitler had given order in late january 1943 for two remaining ships to be scrapped possibility of instead converting them into aircraft carriers was discussed hulls would have been lengthened by approximately which would have used 2 000 tons of steel and employed 400 workmen conversion time was estimated at two years their flight deck would have been only shorter than that of hipper class heavy cruiser which had been prepared for conversion in 1942 and they would still have attained 28 knots this plan was not pursued ships in class shipnamesakebuilderlaid as lutzow 15 february werke february may 19311 april in weapons tests july reinhard june 19311 april november following air attack 9 april maximilian graf von october june january following surface action 17 december 1939 deutschland thumb deutschland in saw significant action with kriegsmarine including several non intervention patrols during which she was attacked by republican bombers at outbreak of world war ii she was cruising north atlantic prepared to attack allied merchant traffic bad weather hampered her efforts and she sank or captured only three vessels before returning to germany after which she was renamed lutzow she then participated in operation weserubung invasion of norway damaged at battle of drobak sound she was recalled to germany for repairs while en route she was torpedoed by a british submarine and seriously damaged repairs were completed by march 1941 and in june lutzow steamed to norway while en route she was torpedoed by a british bomber necessitating significant repairs that lasted until may 1942 she returned to norway to join forces arrayed against allied shipping to soviet union she ran aground during a planned attack on convoy pq 17 which necessitated another return to germany for repairs she next saw action at battle of barents sea with heavy cruiser which ended with a failure to destroy convoy jw 51b engine problems forced a series of repairs culminating in a complete overhaul at end of 1943 after which ship remained in baltic sunk in in april 1945 by royal air force raf bombers lutzow was used as a gun battery to support german troops fighting soviet army until 4 may 1945 when she was disabled by her crew raised by soviet navy in 1947 she was reportedly broken up for scrap over next two years according to western works that did not have access to soviet documents at time historian hans georg prager examined former soviet archives in early 2000s and discovered that lutzow actually had been sunk in weapons tests in july 1947 admiral scheer thumb admiral scheer in scheer saw heavy service with german navy including several deployments to spain during spanish civil war to participate in non intervention patrols while off spain she bombarded port of almeria following republican attack on her sister deutschland at outbreak of world war ii she remained in port for a periodic refit her first operation during world war ii was a commerce raiding operation into southern atlantic ocean that started in late october 1940 while on operation she also made a brief foray into indian ocean during raiding mission she sank of shipping making her most successful capital ship surface raider of war following her return to germany she was deployed to northern norway to interdict shipping to soviet union she was part of abortive attack on convoy pq 17 with battleship operation was broken off after surprise was lost she also conducted operation wunderland a sortie into kara sea after returning to germany at end of 1942 ship served as a training ship until end of 1944 when she was used to support ground operations against soviet army she was sunk by british bombers on 9 april 1945 and partially scrapped remainder of wreck lies buried beneath a quay admiral graf spee thumb admiral graf spee in graf spee conducted extensive training in baltic and atlantic before participating in five non intervention patrols during spanish civil war in 1936 1938 she also represented germany during coronation review for king george vi in may 1937 admiral graf spee was deployed to south atlantic in weeks before outbreak of world war ii to be positioned in merchant sea lanes once war was declared between september and december 1939 ship sank nine ships totaling in response british and french navies formed several hunter killer groups to track her down these forces included four aircraft carriers two battleships and one battlecruiser admiral graf spee operated in concert with supply ship admiral graf spee was eventually confronted by three british cruisers off uruguay at battle of river plate on 13 december 1939 she inflicted heavy damage on british ships but suffered damage as well and was forced to put into port at montevideo convinced by false reports of superior british naval forces approaching his ship and poor state of his own engines hans langsdorff commander of ship ordered vessel to be scuttled langsdorff committed suicide three days after scuttling ship was partially broken up in situ
