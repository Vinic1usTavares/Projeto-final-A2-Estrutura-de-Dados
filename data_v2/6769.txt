bottle pool set up at start of bottle pool shake bottle is placed inverted neck down on at geographic center of of a pool table two object balls used are 1 ball and 2 ball viewed from racker s vantage point 1 ball is to on immediately adjacent to right corner pocket and 2 ball to diamond on foot rail immediately adjacent to left corner pocket player breaking starts with from behind and must contact either of two object balls in order to complete a legal break object of game is to score exactly 31 points before any opponents with a draconian penalty for overshooting that benchmark scoring points are scored in bottle pool in following ways 1 ball scores 1 point pocketing 2 ball scores 2 points cue ball off both object balls scores 1 point caroming cue ball off one or both object balls and then into bottle knocking it onto its side scores 5 points caroming cue ball off one or both object balls and then into bottle knocking onto its base results in an automatic win all of above scoring possibilities can be combined meaning maximum number of points available on a single stroke is nine accomplished by caroming into and pocketing both object balls combined with knocking over bottle with cue ball winning shot in game other than one which rights shake bottle must bring a player s score to exactly 31 if a player overshoots that benchmark known as a burst in game s terminology number of points 31 is overshot by becomes player s new score this means for example that if a player has 30 points and then scores 5 points instead of requisite 1 point by caroming cue ball off an object ball and into bottle knocking it on its side player s score resets to 4 points when a player reaches exactly 31 points he must announce this feat to all participants before next player shoots a shot in order to be victorious if this is not done player may not again invoke his winning score until his turn comes up again in rotation if another player in interim successfully scores exactly 31 and properly announces it that player wins game illegal shots and fouls any legally made scoring shot entitles a player to continue shooting penalty for a in game is a loss of turn any point scoring acts made on same stroke are not counted and 1 point is deducted from player s total score incoming player after a foul accepts table in position except if cue ball is jumped off table or a occurs in which case incoming player has from three consecutive fouls in bottle pool results in a loss of game in addition to standard fouls defined in general rules for pocket billiards such as scratches and others following are specifically defined fouls peculiar to bottle pool cue ball fails to touch an object ball cue ball touches bottle before contacting an object ball bottle is knocked over by an object ball and an object ball is pocketed on same stroke as an illegal shot illegal shots which are not fouls unless a ball is pocketed on same stroke thus resulting in a loss of turn no score but not a loss of points include causing an to touch bottle at all before cue ball touches it without knocking it over and causing bottle to go into a pocket or off table as a result of action by cue ball after it has off an object ball thumb montage showing how is righted upside down as close as possible to its knocked over resting position as judged by mouth of bottle bottle and ball spotting rules whenever shake bottle is knocked over it is immediately stood up open end down as close as possible to position on table at which it came to rest after being upset as judged from mouth of bottle when shake bottle is knocked into a pocket off table or where open end of bottle intrudes over a pocket opening such that it is impossible to replace it to its upset resting position shake bottle is replaced to table s center spot if center spot is occupied by any ball then it is placed on if both center and head spots are occupied then it is placed on if none of listed spots are available then it remains off table until such time as center spot becomes unobstructed as in games of snooker english billiards cowboy pool and others pocketed balls are immediately to their starting position where second object ball cue ball or bottle makes ball there impossible it is spotted to center spot if center spot is occupied ball is spotted to head spot where both object balls have been on a shot they are spotted with same dictates for just one ball first spotting 1 ball followed by 2 ball thus if starting positions for two object balls are each occupied respectively by cue ball and shake bottle 1 ball would be placed on center spot and 2 ball on head spot variations game is sometimes played with larger and heavier and unnumbered carom billiard balls instead of pocket billiard balls such is case at union club and was also at university of michigan billiards games room where faculty devoted most of their time to bottle pool not incidentally three cushion billiards which uses these larger balls was also a mainstay in that room and touring three cushion professional carl conlon was a fixture there until his death in 1997 in this variation a solid yellow or dotted second cue ball is used in place of 1 ball and red ball known traditionally as is used in place of 2 ball use of such balls makes scoring by easier but makes pocketing balls and scratching more difficult because larger balls must still be made in ordinarily sized pool pockets rules promulgated by manhattan athletic club in 1890s diverge in a number of ways from modern rules published by bca though they do use numbered 1 and 2 balls rather than carom billiards balls those provide that when a player bursts his score is set to zero rather than to number of points 31 is overshot pocketed object balls are replaced on red ball spot foot spot or if occupied frozen to foot rail in original position of 1 ball and if occupied of 2 ball and no foul rules whatever are preferred one further variation places a 6 sided die although other sided die could also be used on top of bottle if bottle is knocked over and die knocked onto table player is awarded points equal to whatever side of die lies facing upward when die comes to a stop this adds a random effect to hitting bottle and in practice often results in players only striking bottle in combination with other point scoring shots references category carom
