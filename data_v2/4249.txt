inspect it aircraft was intact but pilot was dead johnson took pilot s identification card and gun and rode back to base identification card identified pilot as an oberstleutnant lieutenant colonel however card actually belonged to oberleutnant august engel of 8 staffel further research has revealed more detail german records confirmed specht flew a fw 190 not a bf 109 and that he was a major at time confirming johnson s victim was most likely to have been engel johnson s claim form revealed he had claimed a bf 109 not an fw 190 id card of johnson s victim was passed on to a member of ground crew who spoke german this individual stated that rank was given as lieutenant colonel incorrect identification was most likely a language error and misunderstanding of german ranks this may have caused belief that johnson had killed specht johnson died in october 1976 and aviation historians were unable to secure his version of events manrho putz 2004 pp 148 149 specht was officially listed
