history background in 1874 new york state legislature passed a bill allowing for creation of a rapid transit commission in new york city which was formed in 1875 this commission mapped out elevated railway routes that would be built by private companies but did not plan any underground lines in 1889 mayor hugh j grant created a five member rapid transit board to lay out lines in city in 1891 state legislature passed rapid transit act allowing government of new york city and all cities with a population of over one million to create a board of rapid transit railroad commissioners which would dictate expansion of rapid transit facilities within city government could issue bonds in order to fund rapid transit for city that year a five member rapid transit board was created for city called board of rapid transit railroad commissioners board received bids for a municipal underground rail line but no bids were selected board was abolished in 1894 by state legislature due to its failure to create a subway line it was replaced by a new board whose members included mayor of new york city that year new york city government issued a referendum stating that future rapid transit lines should be municipally operated as opposed to issuing franchises to private operators in spite of this initial subway lines to be operated in city first subway opened in 1904 and initial portion of centre street loop to essex street opened in 1908 were privately operated by interborough rapid transit company irt and brooklyn rapid transit company brt respectively initial 1890s transit board was replaced in 1907 by state run new york public service commission psc this agency would oversee dual contracts subway expansion which led to construction of new lines for irt and brt creation and subway unification until 1924 municipal public transportation actions originated primarily from state controlled agencies including 1891 and 1894 rapid transit boards psc and most recently new york state transit commission which was created in march 1921 following creating of state transit commission and reelection of al smith as governor of new york in 1922 then mayor john francis hylan and future mayors jimmy walker then a state senator and john p o brien city s corporation counsel sought to establish a city controlled transit commission hylan had been both an opponent of private transit operation particularly that of brooklyn manhattan transit corporation bmt successor to brt and a political opponent of smith hylan also had his own plans for a city operated subway system in 1924 new york city board of transportation was created by new york city board of estimate following a bill passed by new york state legislature board of transportation would responsible for mapping and constructing new rapid transit lines carrying out powers dictated in 1891 rapid transit act while state transit commission would continue to oversee privately operated systems bill had been deadlocked in state assembly for two years until a compromise bill was introduced in february 1924 and passed on april 11 of that year governor smith signed bill into law on may 2 and bot assumed power on june 1 board s first chairman was john hanlon delaney one of hylan s top advisers who had been transit construction commissioner since 1919 bot would release initial plans for what would become independent subway system ind on december 9 1924 based largely off of mayor hylan s plans first ind subway line and system s trunk line ind eighth avenue line broke ground on march 14 1925 and was opened on september 10 1932 on august 29 1929 bot released its first major plans for expansion of city owned system still under construction board of transportation of city of new york engineering department proposed additional rapid transit lines and proposed vehicular tunnel dated august 23 1929 a revision of this proposal was released almost ten years later on july 5 1939 project for expanded rapid transit facilities new york city transit system dated july 5 1939 these plans would later be called ind second system and would go largely unbuilt due to great depression and world war ii beginning on june 1 1940 under mayoral administration of fiorello h la guardia board of transportation took over assets of irt and bmt for municipal operations in an event referred to as unification event placed three rapid transit systems irt bmt ind under a single operator bot also inherited bmt s extensive surface transit network in brooklyn and queens which consisted primarily of streetcar lines along with a few electric trolley coach and diesel powered bus routes bot proceeded to close irt operated second and ninth avenue elevated lines in manhattan and bmt operated third and fifth avenue elevateds in brooklyn on december 15 1940 ind s second manhattan trunk line ind sixth avenue line was completed in 1941 bot began motorizing former bmt streetcar lines in brooklyn and queens into diesel bus routes or trolley coach routes further of surface lines and completion of ind system however was delayed due to world war ii unification made board of transportation largest public transit operator in north america in addition to being one of few systems under public ownership at time following end of world war ii bot resumed subway construction on february 23 1947 board of transportation assumed bus routes of isle transportation in staten island on march 30 1947 bot took over north shore bus company in queens both companies could not operate on mandated five cent fare and went bankrupt this gave city control of majority of surface transit in brooklyn queens and staten island it also created three distinct surface transit divisions brooklyn bus and trolley division staten island bus division and queens bus division new york times queens bus routes taken over by city september 19 1926 page 24 on september 24 1948 bot took over east side omnibus corporation and comprehensive omnibus corporation in manhattan at this time bot resumed motorizing trolley lines and proceeded to construct new storage and repair facilities it also purchased new buses to either replace streetcars or dilapidated buses inherited from private operators decline thumb left a gm old look transit bus bearing original green and white color scheme of board of transportation and a white circular bot logo color scheme would be inherited by transit authority following an artificial operating surplus during world war ii brought on by gas and rubber rations leading to increased mass transit usage board of transportation had its first operational deficit in 1947 amounting to 18 million on march 30 1948 governor thomas e dewey signed legislation to allow bot to increase fares with approval of new york city mayor on july 1 1948 board of transportation raised fare for its rapid transit system from five cents to ten cents with approval of mayor william o dwyer nickel fare had been in place in subway system since october 27 1904 a period of 45 years and was one of main provisions of dual contracts new york city was last major city to have a five cent fare bot also created 14 new free transfers between formerly separate subway divisions fare increase was put forward due to increasing debt inflation in post war period expenditure on new subway routes equipment and facilities and maintenance of existing system which was in disrepair in addition city planner robert moses pushed for fare increase to allow more city funding to go towards highway development while transport workers union of america leader michael j quill supported fare hike in order to give transit workers a 30 cent per hour wage increase in 1950 fare of bot surface transit was also raised to ten cents upon initial 1948 increases a twelve cent fare had been put in place for a combined trip on subway and either bus or trolley but this was eliminated on july 1 1952 fare hikes did not effectively increase revenue for board of transportation to offset increasing operation costs while system ridership plateaued due to american car culture and increasing migration to suburbs after two years of financial surplus bot experienced a 1 2 million deficit in 1950 and a 24 8 million deficit in 1952 bot was also criticized due to influence of politics on organization direct control over board by mayor and use of city s operating budget to subsidize transit operations in march 1953 new york state legislature created new york city transit authority nycta a public authority without direct control from a political office with members appointed by both governor and mayor governor dewey signed bill approving creation of ta into law on march 20 1953 on june 15 1953 operation of new york city transit system was turned over to transit authority with board of estimate leasing system to ta for a period of ten years board of transportation meanwhile was dissolved new
