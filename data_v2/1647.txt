detzner named few villages or streams and stated that valleys he discovered were thinly populated whereas they actually contained large populations at least by new guinea standards he also stated that highest point in range was a miscalculation which for a and a surveyor needed to be explained linke p 11 detzner made attempts to explain away specific ambiguities contradictions and errors in 1915 he
