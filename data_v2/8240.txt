as sergeant cooper chakraborty as vinayak s mistress mohammad samad as pandurang production development director rahi anil barve said title is derived from shripad narayan s marathi novel khot he wrote first draft in 1997 when he was 18 years old from 2009 to 2010 he created a 700 page storyboard within eight months which he said was anchor on which everything was based barve wrote script based on a story his friend had told when they were in wildlife sanctuary in 1993 which made him crap his pants it was a story by marathi writer narayan dharap years later when he revisited dharap s story he found it utterly bland mundane and forgettable he realised it was my friend s narration that left an indelible print no scar on my psyche which kept story alive barve took story s basic premise about a scheming moneylender and another of his works about a girl left alone with her grandmother who is possessed by a demon and began writing a screenplay he managed to find a producer but they backed out in 2008 he obtained financing and principal photography began in monsoon of 2012 sohum shah was cast in role of vinayak rao for which he gained since production took six years he maintained his character s look for entire period shah said that he was surprised after hearing story for time because he hadn t seen anything like this in indian cinema he found it similar to vikram baital and panchatantra barve said story s main theme was greed and that first half hour of film is in universe of dharap s stories film shows hastar who according to mythology stated in movie was banished to womb of mother goddess for being greedy for food and gold film is divided in three chapters which barve said was also a metaphor for journey of india as we see it today it had gone on floor three times and was optioned by seven production companies who backed out barve feels this was because he had no frame of reference for them nothing like tumbbad had even been tried before shah worked on his marathi diction and accent since character of vinayak was a marathi anand gandhi served as co writer creative director and executive producer barve s initial idea was to tell three different stories of tumbbad village in film gandhi and mitesh turned it into one person s story myth of hastar was last addition to story to serve as a backstory screenplay was written by barve prasad gandhi and mitesh shah filming and post production tumbbad first went into production in 2008 with nawazuddin siddiqui in lead role but was quickly shelved as producer backed out it was then shot in 2012 after shah and gandhi came on board film has minimal dialogue and was shot with constant physical movement with few cuts barve said we shot in rain at age old locations where no human had ventured for at least a hundred years for me tumbbads locations feel of its stuffy air and lonely rainy atmosphere that defies feeling of time s passage is as central as its characters after editing barve and shah realised film was not able to achieve what it set out to do it was then re written and re shot and filming completed in may 2015 mutha river in area was taken as a reference for set creation in three weeks set of small town around temple was recreated a doppelganger set of an old pune city was created for film sohum shah wore typical attire worn by brahmans in maharashtra it was shot in natural light some scenes were also shot in and tumbbad village visual effects were produced by sean s team at filmgate films who were also co producers pankaj kumar served as director of photography and sanyukta kaza edited film kumar had shot barve s short film manjha in 2006 and learned of tumbbads story from barve barve created a story book for reference kumar called filming process long strong and intense it was decided film s look would be moody and gloomy village had to look timeless without a clear demarcation between day and night shooting was done without any sunlight on red camera in digital format kumar said that film s entire shooting schedule revolved around lighting noting constant rain and grey tone gave a constant sense of gloom and dread he wanted film to be shot only during monsoon with its constant rain as he wanted a feeling of wetness at all times we wanted audience to feel drenched when they came out of theatres however due to a shortage of rainfall that year kumar did not get sufficient rain crew used artificial rain for scenes and had to wait for hours for cloud cover tumbbad was shot in several locations across maharashtra including and villages of satara district some scenes were shot on constructed sets in mumbai including womb sequence kumar said that team did extensive recce for a few years as they were looking for large landscapes without modern infringements without towers and structures they also did not have budget for visual effects to erase contemporary architectural elements film had four colour schemes including blue cold grey red and gold 50 lanterns and lamps were used for several scenes to avoid modern day lighting techniques since it was a period film scenes inside womb took 15 to 20 days to shoot without any visual effects character of hastar was created with heavy prosthetic makeup that required six to seven hours to prepare shah wore contact lenses throughout film for grey eyes entire film was shot over 100 to 120 days with four shooting schedules in 2012 and 2015 after shoot team felt that film was halfway there to becoming something that audiences hadn t seen before after that script went through re writing some scenes were added and story was enhanced sets were rebuilt and womb was added film s production designers were nitin choudhary and rakesh yadav for their research they used photograph s from 18th and 19th century during british raj interiors of cave were shot at purandare wada near pune it was made to look old and consumed by earth crew spread moss all over site an entire market was created at satara that included several shops but it was not used very often in film alive breathing heart in one scene was created using special effects film s post production took two and a half years to complete kaza had asked prasad to write dialogues again after she re arranged grandmother s tree scene while editing it she used only usable stable shots and put them in a certain order and then called adesh and asked him to re write dialogues according to edit its initial runtime was close to 200 minutes which was edited to 100 minutes film s climax inside womb was shot with only one source of light an oil lamp film was produced by film i vast and filmgate films along with eros international and aanand l rai s colour yellow productions music

film an ambitious one artistic and attentively made reminding me of trippy stylings of filmmaker tarsem singh indian shubhra gupta called it highly unusual visually stunning richly atmospheric concoction of genres and themes sanjukta sharma of scroll in felt film subverts genres astutely without any gimmicks it has been a while since a horror film spoke so eloquently about something as primal as greed and remained true to its indian setting mints udita jhunjhunwala cited film as eerie imaginatively designed stunningly filmed and well directed anupama chopra felt film was nothing like you have seen before in hindi cinema calling it most visually stunning film i ve seen since padmaavat subhash k jha praised visuals and wrote if you think cinema is predominantly a visual medium

gave a positive review and wrote atmosphere landscape and themes in tumbbad are accentuated by a sense of gothic dread and an eerie expectancy of diabolical suparna sharma of deccan chronicle noted that film has beauty and horror of imagination and it stalks you gently long after you ve left theatre reuters shilpa jamkhandikar said that true star here is barve who takes what could have been a regular horror film and elevates it to another level ghosh of quint wrote it excels is in its ability to weave together a formidable canvas with fear fantasy and folklore blending in seamlessly to give us an unrelenting ominous journey anna m m vetticad wrote joy of watching tumbbad comes from fact that barve and his co writers offer no answers making this a delightfully intriguing film rajeev masand called it a wildly original film with a look and feel that is of highest standard jai arjun singh called film spooky majestic and affecting and these qualities come from set design use of music and evocation of a place that is like a breathing thing corroding thoughts and actions of people in it international lee marshall of screen international called it an initially atmospheric yarn let down by weak stock characters and a long veer into fright free period drama in its over long middle section hollywood reporters deborah young called film atmospheric heavy on mythology and scary as hell j hurtado of screen anarchy had a positive response and wrote a slow burn whose finale is wonderfully unexpected and yet fitting tumbbad is a great film and hopefully start of a new trend in india he also included it on his list of 14 favorite indian films of 2018 dread central s jonathan barkan wrote that film is more focused on horror of human behavior than it is on creaking doors and terror of what lurks in dark he also felt that film s second half was overly drawn out matt donato of film wrote mad creature feature designs academy worthy blends of color and pristine optical packaging despicable character work meant to provoke heartlessness traded for materialistic grandiosity tumbbad is a full genre package seasoned with a pungent foreign kick trace thurman of bloody
