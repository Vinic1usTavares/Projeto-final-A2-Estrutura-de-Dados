township mifflinburg buffalo township kelly township and lewisburg its watershed has an area of it is in ridge and valley province of appalachian mountains some streams and parts of streams in creek s watershed are high quality cold water fisheries there are ten types of rock formations and eight types of soil series in watershed forests in buffalo creek watershed are mostly deciduous hardwood hemlock and pine waters of buffalo creek are slightly acidic with a ph ranging between 5 0 and 6 7 metals such as magnesium have been observed in waters nonmetals in water include dissolved oxygen calcium carbonate suspended solids and phosphorus etymology of buffalo creek is unknown no buffalo have ever been definitely observed on creek although there are rumors about old buffalo wallows buffalo township buffalo valley and buffalo mountain are all named after creek historical industries in watershed included mills and timbering but livestock raising and agriculture are more common in 21st century course thumb left buffalo creek looking downstream near its mouth buffalo creek begins in hartley township in union county near union county centre county border it flows east and slightly north between buffalo mountain and branch mountain before falling steeply through two geographical features known as gooseneck and buffalo gap creek then turns southeast and flows out of hartley township upon leaving hartley township creek enters lewis township and meanders eastward south of jones mountain it passes through mifflinburg reservoir creek then flows into southern west buffalo township and northern mifflinburg shortly before exiting west buffalo township buffalo creek picks up its tributary north branch buffalo creek and briefly turns northwards before turning eastward again and leaving township upon leaving west buffalo township buffalo creek flows into buffalo township it then turns northeast and passes by community of cowan and under pennsylvania route 192 creek then picks up its tributary stony run before passing community of cameron and picking up spruce run at this point buffalo creek flows along border between buffalo township and kelly township buffalo creek then meanders in an eastward direction passing near a quarry community of kelly point and lewisburg federal penitentiary after leaving buffalo township creek flows briefly along border between kelly township and lewisburg before discharging into west branch susquehanna river buffalo creek joins west branch susquehanna river upriver of its mouth tributaries buffalo creek has six named tributaries little buffalo creek spruce run beaver run stony run rapid run and north branch buffalo creek little buffalo creek joins buffalo creek upstream of its mouth and its watershed has an area of while spruce run joins buffalo creek upstream of its mouth and its watershed has an area of beaver run joins buffalo creek upstream of its mouth and its watershed has an area of while stony run joins buffalo creek upstream of its mouth and its watershed has an area of rapid run joins buffalo creek upstream of its mouth and its watershed has an area of while north branch buffalo creek joins buffalo creek upstream of its mouth and its watershed has an area of hydrology ph of waters of buffalo creek at three sites ranges from 5 0 to 6 7 out of six times that ph of waters of creek was measured in springs and summers of 2010 and 2012 lowest ph 5 0 occurred at location bc 6 on july 27 2012 highest ph 6 7 occurred at location known as bc 5 on june 15 2010 average ph during that time was approximately 5 on same six times that creek s ph was measured its water temperature was also measured lowest temperature was and it occurred on may 12 2012 at location known as bc 7 highest temperature was and it occurred on june 15 2010 at bc 5 water temperature of buffalo creek has been measured to steadily increase from to nearly between creek s source and its mouth ph of waters of creek ranges from slightly over 4 to 8 lowest ph occurs near headwaters within a few miles ph rises to nearly 6 it fluctuates between 7 and 8 for final two thirds of creek concentration of dissolved oxygen in waters of buffalo creek ranges between approximately 8 5 milligrams per liter and close to 11 milligrams per liter lowest concentration occurs near headwaters of creek concentration rises for first few miles before declining to under 10 milligrams per liter in lower reaches of creek concentration of magnesium in waters of buffalo creek ranges from nearly 0 to almost 15 milligrams per liter concentration is close to 0 for first third of creek s course but then rises to two or three milligrams per liter magnesium concentration reaches its peak around halfway between source and mouth then steadily declines to slightly under ten milligrams per liter at mouth however one of buffalo creek s tributaries has a magnesium concentration of nearly 35 milligrams per liter concentration of calcium carbonate in waters of buffalo creek ranges from less than 10 milligrams per liter to 100 milligrams per liter in upper half of creek concentration is less than 50 milligrams per liter around mifflinburg it rises to its peak of 100 milligrams per liter concentration declines to 70 milligrams per liter at confluence with spruce run but rises to about 80 milligrams per liter at mouth of buffalo creek one tributary of creek has a concentration of 250 milligrams per liter calcium concentration in creek ranges from virtually 0 milligrams per liter to over 40 milligrams per liter concentration is under 10 milligrams per liter until point where hoover road goes over buffalo creek at which point it rises to about 15 milligrams per liter at mifflinburg concentration rises to its peak before dropping to around 30 milligrams per liter between mifflinburg and susquehanna river concentration of phosphorus in waters of buffalo creek ranges from about 0 milligrams per liter to over 0 2 milligrams per liter in most of upper part of creek concentration is very low under 0 05 milligrams per liter however it is over 0 2 milligrams per liter where buffalo flat road passes over creek concentration in mifflinburg is 0 06 or 0 07 milligrams per liter it steadily declines to about 0 03 milligrams per liter near mouth total amount of suspended solids in waters of buffalo creek ranges from approximately 2 milligrams per liter to about 17 milligrams per liter for first few miles of creek it increases steadily before jumping to about 7 milligrams per liter where aikey road passes over creek for rest of way downstream concentration fluctuates largely highest concentrations are at mifflinburg where concentration is 17 milligrams per liter and at lewisburg near mouth where concentration is almost 15 milligrams per liter sediment of sediment flowing through buffalo creek and all its tributaries in 2000 and 2008 was approximately per year concentration of ammonium in waters of buffalo creek ranges from 0 01 milligrams per liter to almost 0 12 milligrams per liter not far from headwaters concentration is at its lowest but it rises to its peak at buffalo flat road concentration then falls to 0 02 milligrams per liter at aikey road before rising to 0 05 milligrams per liter at johnson mill road near confluence of spruce run and buffalo creek concentration then fluctuates slightly between there and mouth of buffalo creek amount of nitrogen flowing through buffalo creek and all its tributaries in 2000 and 2008 was approximately per year ph and calcium carbonate concentration have both increased in upper reaches of buffalo creek since september 2009 as has water temperature phosphorus concentration at point where buffalo flat road passes over buffalo creek has increased by at least tenfold since september 2009 parts of coal run rapid run beaver run and muddy run are impaired or possibly impaired by agriculture geography geology and climate thumb buffalo creek looking upstream near its mouth elevation of mouth of buffalo creek is between above sea level elevation of creek s source is between above sea level between upstream of its mouth and it mouth a distance of creek s gradient is between mifflinburg and lewisburg gradient is topography of creek s watershed is mountainous in its upper reaches however in its lower reaches creek flows through a wide valley bordered by steep ridges creek s channel is sinuous and flows through rock formations consisting of sandstone and limestone with some iron ore all of creek s watershed is located in ridge and valley physiographic province it contains fractured faulted and folded sedimentary rocks while there is some young bedrock in watershed parts of it have eroded away to reveal older bedrock which is more resistant to weathering than younger bedrock old bedrock formations in watershed include tuscarora formation juniata formation and bald eagle formation visible portions of these formations are sandstones and conglomerates floor of buffalo creek valley is home to younger carbonates belonging to keyser formation and tonoloway formation undivided keyser and tonoloway formations occur in southern and southeastern parts of buffalo creek watershed hamilton group occurs in a small portion of southeastern part of watershed undivided onondaga and old port formations also occur here but take up a bigger area in watershed bald eagle formation occurs in small parts of western and northwestern areas of watershed juniata formation occurs in same areas as bald eagle formation as well as part of northern part of watershed however it takes up more area than bald eagle formation formation also occurs in western and northwestern parts of watershed undivided bloomsburg and formations occur in a zigzagging band that goes from northeastern to southwestern part of watershed clinton group occurs in a zigzagging band immediately north of bloomsburg and mifflinville formations it also occurs in a few scattered areas in northeastern and western parts of watershed tuscarora formation occurs in a zigzagging band immediately north of clinton group wills creek formation occurs in parts of southern and northeastern areas there are a number of soil associations that occur in significant amounts in buffalo creek watershed these include allenwood alvira dekalb hazelton edom hagerstown washington holly basher monongahela calvin meckesville buchanan meckesville and berks soil associations there are four different types of soils by levels of permeability and runoff potential in buffalo creek watershed these are rated from a to d with a type soils having highest level of permeability and lowest runoff potential and d having lowest level of permeability and highest runoff potential c type soils are most common and occur in eastern and central parts of watershed b type soils primarily occur in western part of watershed d type soils are scattered throughout watershed and a type soils occur in areas of southern and southeastern parts of watershed near mifflinburg buffalo creek is tiny and twisting and its path is interrupted by fences and logs there are also some strainers along its length creek is shallow for much of its length even in stream pools it mainly descends via gentle riffles however there is a weir with a height of

watershed s area creek is near us route 15 and interstate 80 headwaters of buffalo creek are acidic due to geological formations that occur there also federal government states that there are 3945 acres of flood plains in watershed there are 800 acres of wetlands in watershed buffalo creek watershed contains two reservoirs for water supply one which is situated on north branch buffalo creek belongs to mifflinburg borough other which is situated on spruce run belongs to pennsylvania american water company main highways in buffalo creek watershed are pennsylvania route 45 and pennsylvania route 192 which run east to west through central part of watershed u s route 15 also passes briefly through watershed near creek mouth population of watershed is approximately 15 000 but it may increase to 20 000 by 2020 and 27 000 by 2030 history etymology of buffalo creek s name is unknown in 1700s it was one of eight streams named buffalo creek in pennsylvania despite almost total absence of buffalo in state in that century except for legends there is virtually no evidence that any buffalo ever lived in buffalo creek area however some residents of nearby village of cowan claim that depressions on northern bank of buffalo creek are buffalo wallows buffalo valley and buffalo mountain may have been named after buffalo creek until middle or end of 1700s much of buffalo creek watershed was on frontier during this time there were many forts such as fort in watershed in 1769 northern side of buffalo creek was surveyed in same year area in vicinity of creek was opened to settlers john sierer was among first to arrive settling on creek in 1769 prominent revolutionary war veteran colonel john kelly built an estate on northern bank of buffalo creek in 1780 there was an indian attack near mouth of creek sawmills and gristmills were built in watershed in early 1800s and there was a mill on creek by 1788 a large number of small mills producing grist cider woolens and lumber were once on north branch buffalo creek there was a log school on buffalo creek in 1830s by late 1800s there was a significant lumbering industry this also caused railroads to be built in watershed lumbering industry became less prominent in early 1900s in late 1800s area along north branch buffalo creek was heavily settled and known as jonestown a county road paralleled creek here in late 1800s or early 1900s a locomotive crashed into buffalo creek while crossing it a gauging station was constructed on buffalo creek near lewisburg in september 1913 in early 1900s main industries in creek s watershed included agriculture furniture factories flour mills and brick works tributary spruce run was also used as a water supply by white deer mountain water company and main stem was used as power for some small gristmills during this time period major communities in watershed included lewisburg people mifflinburg 1559 people mazeppa 185 people cowan 150 people buffalo roads 142 people and kelly point 97 people pennsylvania railroad also went through southern part of watershed during early 1900s in modern times population of watershed of buffalo creek has been rising unlike surrounding areas production of timber was once a major industry in watershed however farming and livestock production are more common biology drainage basin of buffalo creek upstream of state route 3005 is designated as a high quality coldwater fishery and a migratory fishery between state route 3005 and rapid run drainage basin is designated as a coldwater fishery and a migratory fishery downstream of this point watershed is designated as a trout stocked fishery and a migratory fishery wild trout naturally reproduce in creek from headwaters downstream 8th street bridge in mifflinburg a distance of half of pennsylvania fish and boat commission approved trout waters in union county are in watershed of buffalo creek birds in buffalo creek watershed include raptors waterfowl songbirds and wild turkeys mammals in watershed include rodents foxes raccoons opossums skunks white tailed deer and black bears colder streams in watershed contain brook trout and brown trout while warmer streams contain suckers and smallmouth bass forest that make up much of buffalo creek watershed consist mostly of deciduous hardwood trees however there are some hemlock and pine trees in watershed as well a total of 134 taxa of macroinvertebrates have been observed on tributary north branch buffalo creek as of may 11 2012 average shannon index in watershed is 2 2 s evenness of watershed is 0 77

contamination in creek recreation lower of buffalo creek from mifflinburg downstream to lewisburg are navigable by canoe during snowmelt and within four days of hard rain creek s difficulty rating is 1 and its scenery is described as good in edward gertler s book keystone canoeing two of buffalo creek s tributaries spruce run and rapid run are high quality cold water fisheries upper portion of buffalo creek itself also has this rating raymond b winter state park is near headwaters of rapid run bald eagle state forest is also in watershed creek is commonly visited by anglers and birdwatchers in watershed other common recreational activities include driving cross country skiing horseback riding mountain biking camping swimming and canoeing levels of bacteria in buffalo creek are higher than maximum levels considered safe for swimming however number of pathogens in stream that are caused by farm animals could be reduced by 80 percent see also limestone run union county pennsylvania
