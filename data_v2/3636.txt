interview for down beat in 2011 taborn described his improvising style particularly for solo piano when playing he often adopts a modular approach using small units of melody and rhythm and then developing them this can begin from as little as three notes with structure being built around referring back to elements of units he starts simply using basic elements such as major and minor thirds varies them in turn and then continues to expand to create larger structures he uses a combination of his attack and piano s sustain pedal to draw attention to upper of a note this allows a heightened contrast between notes to be perceived taborn has commented on similarities and differences in his playing on piano and electronic instruments comparing his accompaniments on piano and fender rhodes he said that i play some of same chords on piano but there are definitely things i would do on piano because it s a more transparent instrument that i wouldn t do on rhodes rhodes is so strong that when you play something on it it really can dictate because it s louder and timbre is much more opaque so you leave more holes on piano i would maybe play more sustain chords jon november 21 27 2003

an audience when playing electronic instruments he links his instruments to his own amplifier and then has venue take its feed from that amplifier guitarist david torn commented that taborn is rare musician who takes approach what can i do with this instrument rather than playing through its book of techniques he is able to eschew technological aspect in order to get out sounds that he feels are suitable for music compositions taborn incorporates requirements to improvise within his compositions commenting on his writing for trio and quartet taborn stated that i like multiple kinds of rhythmic things on their own they re not so complicated but when you fit them together it sounds a little mysterious a lot of that writing extends from my trio writing where i m writing things that are playable in real time there s a certain orchestration you can get out of a four piece how far can we suggest a larger ensemble i want to create illusion of a larger ensemble his compositions
