entertainments which begin in month of may are continued every night they bring together persons of all ranks and conditions and amongst these a considerable number of females whose charms want only that cheerful air which is flower and quintessence of beauty these places serve equally as a rendezvous either for business or intrigue they form as it were private coteries there you see fathers and mothers with their children enjoying domestic happiness in midst of public diversions english assert that such entertainments as these can never subsist in france on account of levity of people certain it is that those of vauxhall and ranelagh which are guarded only by outward decency are conducted without tumult and disorder which often disturb public diversions of france i do not know whether english are gainers thereby joy which they seem in search of at those places does not beam through their countenances they look as grave at vauxhall and ranelagh as at bank at church or a private club all persons there seem to say what a young english nobleman said to his governor am i as joyous as i should be new name vauxhall gardens long in popular use was made official in 1785

then we saw for first time that entrance if there had been any magic about it at all was now decidedly disenchanted being in fact nothing more nor less than a combination of very roughly painted boards and sawdust we glanced at orchestra and supper room as we hurried past we just recognised them and that was all we bent our steps to firework ground there at least we should not be disappointed we reached it and stood rooted to spot with mortification and astonishment that moorish tower that wooden shed with a door in centre and daubs of crimson and yellow all round like a gigantic watch case that place where night after night we had beheld undaunted mr blackmore make his terrific ascent surrounded by flames of fire and peals of artillery and where white garments of madame somebody we
