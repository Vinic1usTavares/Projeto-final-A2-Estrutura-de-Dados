manner of surrealist street performers to appear in video on october 11 2009 thirty seconds to mars shut down santa monica pier and filmed a segment of short film along with a group of cyclists leto got inspiration behind video after some of his friends did critical mass and crank mob groups of riders that get together and kind of reclaim public spaces and take over streets in several cities around america and he thought that it would be perfect backdrop for music video of kings and queens during shooting crew had some problems in filming some scenes leto told mtv news it s been an incredible adventure but it s also been really difficult because there are so many people and we re shutting down streets of los angeles he further said that they were really worried about a scene regarding a lone horse running down a los angeles street we only had three takes that we had time to do first take it went sideways second take it went other way third take perfect leto described experience of filming music video saying it s a lyrical and slightly metaphorical surreal journey through city of angels from downtown los angeles to santa monica pier we like to create an adventure
