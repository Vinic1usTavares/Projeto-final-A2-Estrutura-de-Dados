bros records music was written by guitarist john frusciante and bassist flea during a jam session months prior to album recording sessions vocalist anthony kiedis wrote song s most prevalent lyrical refrain in response to an experience he shared with former girlfriend nina hagen regarding altruistic behavior and value of selflessness give it away went on to achieve international fame reaching number one on billboard modern rock tracks in late 1991 giving band their first ever number one single in 1992 single charted inside top 75 of us hot 100 in wake of huge success of record s second single under bridge give it away also became band s first top ten hit in united kingdom where it peaked at number nine on uk singles chart this didn t occur until february 1994 nearly 2 and a half years after it was first released in us accompanying music video which was directed by french film maker stephane sednaoui was put into heavy rotation on music television stations such as mtv and added to band s success since its release give it away has gone on to receive numerous accolades including a grammy award for best hard rock performance with vocals in 1992 steve huey of allmusic noted that while single didn t achieve massive pop success of its follow up under bridge it did become one of band s most instantly recognizable songs origins and recording guitarist john frusciante and bassist flea wrote much of give it away during jam sessions in early 1990s apter 2004 p 229 following chili peppers tour in support of mother s milk 1989 duo spent time in a side project called h a t e with members of fishbone during their tenure in group guitarist and bassist created main riff and accompanying bassline for give it away rhythm was played at several h a t e performances shortly thereafter but when side project disbanded frusciante and flea believed track would be appropriate for chili peppers upcoming record vocalist anthony kiedis agreed and upon hearing rest of chili peppers play song he began chanting give it away give it away give it away now phrase had been something vocalist intended to incorporate into a song for band s new record but it was not until he heard bassline that lyrics fit kiedis said i was so struck by flea s bass part which covered whole length of instrument s neck that i jumped up and marched over to mic my notebook in tow i always had fragments of songs and ideas or even specific isolated phrases in mind kiedis 2004 p 272 song was recorded between april and june 1991 at mansion in los angeles california give it away single liner notes through recording of give it away came a practice of crafting songs that band would continue to use on every album following blood sugar sex magik kiedis 2004 p 273 when group encountered difficulty in composing a bridge for song it developed a tool members colloquially termed face offs flea and frusciante were unable to come to an agreement on guitar or bass progressions but separately crafted part of song band then reconvened at a later time and chose most appropriate inclusion with give it away a chorus and verse had already been written but a bridge was lacking so thus they partook in a face off lyrics and meaning lyrical meaning behind give it away is centered on philosophy of selflessness and altruistic behavior song is titled after its most prevalent lyrical phrase give it away which is taken from an experience kiedis had with his former girlfriend punk rock singer nina hagen in early 1980s hagen was several years kiedis senior and became a role model during his drug addiction to heroin she realized how young and inexperienced i was then so she was always passing on gems to me not in a preachy way just by seizing on opportunities when kiedis was looking through her closet he came across a jacket he liked and commented to hagen that it was really cool upon expressing this hagen immediately told him to keep it her reasoning behind this selflessness was due to an attempt to constantly make her life more enjoyable and explained to kiedis that if you have a closet full of clothes and you try to keep them all your life will get very small but if you have a full closet and someone sees something they like if you give it to them world is a better place act was something that affected kiedis significantly because he had never before experienced such an enlightening ideology on life growing up in los angeles he had always thought differently from hagen instead of giving material possessions away and being free thinking vocalist believed one must take what one wants as no one else will provide instead he now adopted hagen s philosophy it was such an epiphany that someone would want to give me her favorite thing that stuck with me forever every time i d be thinking i have to keep i d remember no you gotta give away instead when i started going regularly to drug and alcohol meetings one of principles i had learned was that way to maintain your own sobriety is to give it to another suffering alcoholic every time you empty your vessel of that energy fresh new energy comes flooding in flea s bassline for song allowed kiedis to recall this incident and he believed music paired perfectly with lyrics during verses kiedis departs from idea of unselfishness and sings about a variety of topics including long time friend river phoenix musician bob marley and various sexual themes including fertility and lust apter 2004 p 230 music and composition give it away is performed in time signature of 4 4 time blood sugar sex magik guitar book hal leonard 1995 track begins with a distinctively dry guitar tone that is similar in style to rest of record gore joe october 1991 red hot chili peppers gods of sex funk guitar player producer rick rubin had a considerable influence on sound of blood sugar sex magik by removing much of reverb and guitar layering that epitomized band s previous album mother s milk this caused record to contain simpler and dryer guitar and bass chords that were not filtered through guitar effects those that did however were made with vintage electronics from 1960s and 70s di perna alan november 1991 free spirits in material world guitar world for give it away along with rest of album rubin sought to achieve a sense of atmosphere that was similar to 60s records that were made without commercialism or viability in mind and to downplay on big sounds what you hear is what you get there s not a lot of trickery a lot of people want biggest sound with walls of guitar and huge drums but i don t think those things matter song follows a traditional verse chorus verse structure when kiedis begins singing frusciante jumps into a funk oriented riff that is repeated throughout verse while flea plays a complex bass line that makes use of virtually entire fretboard during chorus kiedis sings give it away give it away give it away now repeatedly over a more rapid guitar riff before frusciante provides according to steve huey of allmusic a sudden contrast to kiedis hyperactivity in form of a languid solo pre recorded and dubbed backwards over rhythm track solo was recorded in one take because frusciante had developed a preference towards speedy execution and a raw feeling according to flea we did very little fix up stuff john s philosophy was that he would only play a solo twice he d play it once and if he didn t like it or we didn t like it he d play it again completely different and that was it give it away also makes use of other instruments like jew s harp which was played by band friend pete weiss song continues through several verses and choruses before reaching a bridge that introduces outro which consists of a hard rocking riff that according to huey strongly resembles main riff from black sabbath s sweet leaf from their 1971 record master of reality kiedis repeats give it away now for several measures before guitar bass and drums drop out release and reception give it away was released as lead single from blood sugar sex magik in early september 1991 shortly before record went on sale warner bros sought to premiere song on a popular rock radio station in texas but were turned down when format refused to air track they told employees at label to come back to us when you have a melody in your song kiedis 2004 p 280 band then embarked on a short press tour through europe in order to promote record it was during this time that kroq fm a los angeles based modern rock station began to place give it away on heavy rotation according to kiedis that was beginning of infusion of those songs into mass consciousness kiedis 2004 p 281 critical reception to song much like album was highly positive jeff vice of deseret news noted this dynamic first single that pays homage to bob marley may start a new musical trend with its brilliant rasta funk vice jeff march 14 1992 releases show continuing evolution of punk rock deseret news patrick macdonald of seattle times commented that blood sugar sex magik includes one of best songs peppers have done give it away first single hook is irresistible and message about material excess is delivered simply and straightforwardly macdonald patrick january 3 1992 rock rapped in funk red hot chili peppers are giving it away tonight along with pearl jam seattle times steve huey of allmusic felt song was enhanced by kiedis lyrics which were a free associative mixture of positive vibes tributes to musical heroes and free love and their literal meaning was often as difficult to understand as kiedis nasal staccato enunciation but that distinctive vocal style helped make most comprehensible lines even catchier and more memorable greatly enhancing song s appeal he continued by praising track s music john frusciante s guitar should not be underappreciated either his noisy scratchy funk rock work add s depth and texture to powerhouse rhythm section of flea and chad smith jay clarke of richmond times dispatch felt give it away was a journey into funky world of kiedis and flea this song invigorates better than heaviest metal or most hard core rap clarke jay december 24 1991 chili

pants in music video for give it away music video for give it away was made by french fashion photographer and director stephane sednaoui kiedis wanted video to be visually distinct and readily identifiable but disliked much of material warner bros sent for him to choose from i started viewing reels and reels and reels of video directors but nothing looked good to me everything was same boring homogenized contrived shit kiedis 2004 p 279 upon finding sednaoui s reel however kiedis noticed it was like nothing else it was slower and poetic shot in black and white it seemed like authentic art not something shot for mtv he and flea met with sednaoui to talk about video for which director proposed a very desolated and very graphic landscape while heavily focusing on band members with little to no outside influence making of give it away red hot chili peppers greatest hits and videos 2003 it was decided that video would be filmed in black and white while sednaoui took idea of painting band members with silver acrylic from previous photo shoots he had done sednaoui recalls that he was amazed by what band gave me because they went far far far beyond what i was expecting and i think that s one of my best experiences in that regard overall mood of video was intended to be a personification of song which is upbeat and lively sednaoui experimented with a variety of cinematography techniques including wide angle lenses shots from below subjects superimposition vertically cut screens displaying different angles of same shot reverse film effects multiple lighting situations and flashy clothing to convey his concept frusciante noted feeling of video to be extremely vibrant and over top when it was us just painting ourselves silver and wearing these big silver boots and stuff i mean it felt like glam rock or something video begins with a wide angle shot of flea in a desert setting wearing pants with several gold colored horns protruding from each leg bassist is standing in a meditative stance and brings his arms together above his head when music begins to play video then transitions between a variety of shots edited together that consist of four band members standing with their eyes closed band dancing around in a dimly lit setting a ground view of frusciante playing a reflective silver fender stratocaster in between his legs while wearing pants made up entirely of small pieces of mirror band members moving around with full makeup on and band members dancing kiedis adopted a deliberately outlandish wardrobe which incorporated gold lipstick thinly braided hair revealing meshed shorts and bright silver boots during backwards guitar solo frusciante was filmed waving a large aluminum ribbon kiedis was initially apprehensive about sednaoui s desire for guitarist to do so believing he would tell director fuck you and take that dancing ribbon and shove it up your french ass buddy but frusciante gladly went off and made love to air with this dancing ribbon he would have danced around for hours with that thing footage was edited in reverse to complement solo while some of scenes in video were planned with a storyboard much of it was improvised or made up on spot over two day shoot during a particular scene kiedis began to move his tongue flamboyantly to dramatically accentuate lyrics which sednaoui believed was extremely beneficial to exuberant nature of video where video begins in what appears to be daytime it concludes at dusk with silhouettes of band members running into setting sun video which cost an estimated 140 000 to produce was completed while kiedis and frusciante were on a promotional trip through europe in support of blood sugar sex magik van bram 1992 red hot chili peppers hit of shit dutch television show vpro when vocalist first saw it he was more hysterically ecstatic about that piece of visual footage than anything band had ever done warner bros executives however were worried that content would be too weird or too artsy for general public and favored a more traditional premise in contrast to experimental approach sednaoui took video was ultimately released without being edited by record label since then it has been widely credited as being a considerable factor in red hot chili peppers success and greatly increased their international popularity apter 2004 p 234 journalist jeff apter noted video s funky brew of goofy looks a subtle invasive hook flea s spindly fingered baseline and kiedis crotch hugging shorts made clip essential viewing across mtv throughout last few months of 1991 steve huey of allmusic commented in his review of song that mtv jumped all over visually distinctive video it was nominated for three awards best alternative video breakthrough video
