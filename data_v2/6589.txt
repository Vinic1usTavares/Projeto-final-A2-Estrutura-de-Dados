follo line is a planned high speed railway between oslo and ski norway running parallel to ostfold line it will be engineered for terminal stations will be oslo central station and ski station most of line will be in a single tunnel which will be longest railway tunnel in country construction started in 2014 and is estimated to be completed by december 2022 follo line will increase capacity from twelve to forty trains per hour along south corridor and will allow express and regional trains to decrease travel time from ski to oslo from 22 to 11 minutes line was prospected to cost over 26 billion norwegian krone nok in 2014 project is a continuation of norwegian national rail administration s plan to build four tracks along three main corridors out of oslo gardermoen line was completed in 1998 and asker line was completed in 2011 between 1989 and 1996 ostfold line south of ski to moss was upgraded to double track and higher speeds to take full advantage of this and allow rest of ostfold line to be upgraded for high speeds it is necessary to increase capacity through bottleneck from oslo to ski first plans for follo line were launched in 1995 and also included an intermediate station at vevelstad and kolbotn new line is predicted to increase rush hour rail ridership 63 and increased freight on rail would remove 750 trucks daily from european route e18 background first railway in follo district was ostfold line of norwegian state railways nsb that opened on 2 january 1879 between oslo east station and halden later same year line was extended to swedish border where it connected to norway vanern line importance of ski station increased on 24 november 1882 when it became station where eastern ostfold line split and went via inner ostfold to sarpsborg where two lines reconnected electrification of section from oslo to kolbotn was completed on 18 january 1937 and section to ski finished in 1939 whole ostfold line was completed in 1940 between 1924 and 1939 nsb built double track along route between ski and oslo from 1989 to 1996 nsb upgraded track to double track from ski to just north of moss this section is capable of speeds of however maximum is due to short distances between stops and limitations of rolling stock in 1992 norwegian parliament decided to build first high speed railway in norway from oslo via new oslo airport gardermoen to eidsvoll this line would run parallel to hoved line increasing speed and capacity along route fast express and regional trains could run along new section while slower commuter trains used old tracks and could make many stops without disturbing other traffic projects were launched during 1990s to create similar high speed bypasses from oslo to ski and from skoyen west of oslo to asker construction of latter christened asker line started in 2001 and first section from asker to sandvika opened in 2005 while second section is expected to open in 2011 ostfold line between oslo and ski remains largest bottle neck on norwegian railway network line restrains track to twelve trains per hour six per direction and hinders freight trains from using it during rush hour bottleneck occurs because there are up to four trains each hour making stops at all stations and these stops delay all express and regional trains that follow travel time is 22 minutes for direct trains to ski and 31 minutes for commuter trains with a speed limit of along most of line capacity on upgraded double track from ski to moss cannot be fully utilized due to limitations along section from ski to oslo and further growth in number of freight trains along south corridor to sweden and continental europe is impossible without reducing number of passenger trains despite existing double track all way from oslo to moss a further upgrade southwards will not be able to increase capacity past current single train per hour to fredrikstad sarpsborg and halden most optimistic plans involve finishing first upgrades of track south of moss simultaneously with follo line rail administration and ministry of transport is working on proposals for a high speed railway between oslo and gothenburg in sweden this line would most likely use follo line for initial distance from oslo route thumb map of existing and new line initial plan from 1995 involved two intermediate stations at vevelstad and kolbotn plans also suggested building line in two phases first between ski and kolbotn and then from kolbotn to oslo in 2008 national rail administration announced two possible plans for right of way both predominantly in tunnel one proposal included kolbotn other did not both excluded vevelstad as a station on new line since station could not develop as a hub and would still keep services along existing commuter line a report from det norske veritas published in 2008 and ordered by rail administration concluded that neither a station at vevelstad or at kolbotn could support extra cost of construction a direct line with no intermediate stops is estimated to cost nok 11 billion while a line via kolbotn would cost 13 5 billion report also argued that intermediate stops would decrease capacity and increase travel time for all passengers departing south of ski and traveling north exclusion of kolbotn would also increase importance of ski as a regional public transport hub in 2009 rail administration abandoned plans to build line via kolbotn stating that it was more important to secure a fast connection to ski at same time they promised to upgrade existing station at kolbotn rail line is planned for at least although faster speeds are being considered earliest possible construction start is 2014 which could allow completion by 2020 21 2011 av til oslo s skal language norwegian ski station will also be upgraded as part of project and will be expanded to six tracks plans to connect eastern ostfold line to slower line were considered where eastern ostfold line diverges from ostfold line at ski however this has changed so local trains from eastern ostfold can travel to oslo faster along new tracks just south of oslo central station each of two tracks will diverge and follow different routes inbound track will hook up with ostfold line at while outbound track will diverge at loenga an additional connection to ostfold line will be made at nordstrand ostfold line connects to hoved line and loenga line before reaching oslo central station oslo s if kolbotn alternative for follo line is chosen ostfold line will be rebuilt to follow a similar path to kolbotn station which will require a new station building to accommodate two lines for this alternate route two lines will enter kolbotn station at two levels with follo line running in a tunnel below and ostfold line running at grade above impact follo line will allow capacity in south corridor from oslo to increase from about twelve to forty trains per hour local and freight trains will use ostfold line while regional and express trains will use follo line travel time will be reduced from 22 to 11 minutes with a new line there will be 11 000 more public transport trips through corridor this includes a 67 increase during rush hour and 43 rest of day this allows a reduction of 5 800 car trips per day and reduces carbon dioxide emissions of 5 474 tonnes rush hour capacity would be eight trains per hour to kolbotn with four continuing to ski along old line new line would be served by four trains to moss two to and two to halden there would be half frequency during off peak hours ostfold line is railway that connects norway to continental europe and 80 of all land based international freight transport goes through ostfold until follo line opens there cannot be a capacity increase on international freight trains to norway rail administration has set a goal of tripling amount of rail freight by 2040 which for south corridor is equal to removal of 750 trucks per day from european route e18 follo line will also allow freight trains to pass during rush hour references external links official site category railway lines in akershus category railway lines in oslo category high speed railway lines in norway
