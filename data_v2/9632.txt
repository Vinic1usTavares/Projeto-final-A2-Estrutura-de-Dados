right thumb alt cricketer donald bradman sits on a bench in a sports stadium and displays a cricket bat with his brand name on it he wears a 1940s style double breasted suit and has his hair parted and slicked back with haircream he is smiling and posing rather awkwardly australian captain don bradman scored a century in australia s first test win first test of 1948 ashes series was one of five tests in a cricket series between australia and england match was played at trent bridge in nottingham from 10 to 15 june with a rest day on 13 june australia won match by eight wickets to take a 1 0 series lead australians started match as firm favourites having won previous series against england 3 0 in lead up to 1948 series they had won 10 of their 12 tour matches in england mostly by large margins this included a crushing innings defeat in a match over marylebone cricket club a team consisting almost entirely of test capped and current england players england captain norman yardley won toss and elected to bat on a cloudy day after first morning was interrupted by inclement weather australian fast bowlers quickly made inroads into english batting despite loss of leading australian paceman ray lindwall with a groin injury hosts had difficulty against his colleagues and fell to be 74 runs for loss of eight wickets 74 8 however a rearguard action by tail enders alec bedser and jim laker saw england reach 165 bill johnston taking five wickets for 36 runs 5 36 for australia while compatriot keith miller took 3 38 laker top scored for hosts with 63 tourists then reached 17 without loss by stumps on second day yardley attempted to slow australian batsmen by employing leg theory a defensive strategy that sought more to contain opposition than to attack as england had batted poorly in first innings allowing australia to take lead quickly home team sought to slow tourists momentum and force a drawn match despite tactics australia reached 293 4 at end of day s play captain donald bradman having registered his 28th test century although bradman and his batsmen made gestures indicating frustration at england s stifling tactics they remained patient as there was still much time left in match for them to convert their dominance into a victory next morning bradman departed for 138 first in a series of dismissals in leg trap but his vice captain lindsay hassett continued making 137 and putting on a century partnership with lindwall as australia were eventually out for 509 giving them a 344 run first innings lead laker was leading bowler taking 4 138 england reached 121 2 by stumps on third day which ended with a hostile crowd reaction to miller who bowled a large amount of bouncers at len hutton and denis compton after rest day play resumed in poor visibility with frequent interruptions due to rain and bad light england s batsmen progressed steadily as australia struggled in lindwall s absence which forced his fellow bowlers to bear a greater workload hutton made 74 and compton batted through entire day to be unbeaten on 154 with england one run ahead at close of play on 345 6 compton s innings in difficult conditions was highly praised and his team still had a chance of hanging on for a draw if lower order could bat for a large part of final day next day australia out remaining wickets and england were dismissed for 441 with compton out for 184 after falling on his stumps miller and johnston had both taken four wickets australia then made 98 runs required for victory with loss of two wickets opener sid barnes made his second half century for match in pursuit background prior to first test australia had played 12 first class matches since arriving in england and starting their campaign in late april winning ten and drawing two eight of victories were by an innings and another was by eight wickets one of drawn matches against lancashire was rain affected with first day washed out entirely one of tour matches was against marylebone cricket club mcc which fielded a team composed almost entirely of test players in what was effectively a dress rehearsal for tests australia fielded their full strength team and won by an innings perry 2005 p 228 difference in australia s team for first test was omission of leg spinner colin mccool who had been struggling from a torn callus on his spinning finger which prevented him from bowling long spells it was thought that bradman would play another leg spinner doug ring in mccool s place but australian captain changed his mind on first morning when rain was forecast bill johnston was played in hope of exploiting a wet wicket fingleton p 82 in previous rain affected matches on tour johnston had been highly effective taking match figures of 10 40 and 11 117 against yorkshire and hampshire respectively fingleton p 54 bill brown reserve opener played out of position in middle order as he had against worcestershire and mcc aside from brown and johnston s inclusion australia s team was same as that which started previous ashes series in 1946 47 which they won 3 0 perry 2005 p 186 england lost their leg spinner doug wright before match to lumbago so off spin of jim laker was brought in at late notice laker had struggled when he had played for surrey and mcc against australia in lead up matches taking 1 137 and 3 127 respectively in mcc match australians had attacked him taking nine sixes from his bowling in one 82 minute passage of play fingleton p 73 of team that took to field for mcc len hutton bill edrich denis compton captain norman yardley laker and jack young were also selected for first test hutton scored 52 and 64 in mcc match but nobody else managed to pass 26 in either innings young had bowled 55 2 overs in australia s only innings taking 4 155 opener jack robertson was left out after scoring six and a duck and cyril washbrook who had played against australia in 1946 47 series partnered hutton joe hardstaff junior had scored 107 for nottinghamshire only century made against australia in lead up matches fingleton p 77 earning himself test selection paceman alec bedser did not play in mcc match but had been a regular during england s last series against australia in 1946 47 and had taken 4 104 for surrey in their match against tourists godfrey evans who kept wickets in previous ashes series also gained test selection perry 2005 pp 175 189 according to former england bowler bill bowes england went into match with intention of securing a draw through selection of defensive bowlers home team s bowlers would tie down australians forcing batsmen to take risks to score runs and thereby increasing chances of dismissal however if rain produced a sticky wicket england attack might be able to dismiss australia relatively easily bowes p 189 as such england filled their team with batsmen and only played three frontline bowlers laker bedser and young and relied on yardley edrich and charlie barnett to support them with their occasion seam bowling it was speculated that england would use only two specialist bowlers all rounder george pope was in squad and it was thought he would be used in place of one of bowlers but in end he was omitted as was reg simpson latter had made 74 and 70 for nottinghamshire against australia and had impressed observers with his display and was made twelfth man before start of match much of attention was placed on weather forecast and prospects of rain in their 12 tour matches leading up to tests australia had been almost completely untroubled by opposition except in two matches against yorkshire and hampshire on rain affected pitches in these two matches they came close to defeat after heavy batting collapses before recovering to victory it was thus thought that toss could be of great importance especially if team batting first had accumulated a substantial total by time rain came o reilly pp 30 31 match was first ashes test to be played on english soil since end of world war ii

elected to bat despite dull light trent bridge had reputation for being favourable to batsmen and in previous test between australia and england at ground in 1938 four englishmen scored centuries as hosts made 658 before stan mccabe of australia made 232 runs himself first innings set pattern of series as english top order struggled against australia s pace attack only twenty minutes of play was possible before lunch on first day due to inclement weather and opening pair of washbrook and hutton had to deal with contrasting bowling actions of lindwall with a low somewhat round arm action and miller who extracted more bounce from a higher arm at point of delivery fingleton p 83 in first two overs australian pairing extracted little bounce and it seemed as though hosts would be in a strong position to make a large score on a placid track if they made a solid start lindwall bowled first ball of match at a moderate pace and hutton pushed it square of wicket on off side for a single to start proceedings gradually australian bowlers got into their rhythm and began to raise their pace miller induced an edge from washbrook in his first over but it bounced before reaching a fielder in his second over miller bowled hutton for three with a faster ball that skidded off pitch to leave england at 9 1 ball went between bat and pads as hutton moved forward onto his front foot o reilly p 31 journalist and former australian test leg spinner bill o reilly criticised hutton for not moving his leg across to pitch of ball thereby leaving a gap between bat and pad o reilly p 32 during lunch interval heavy rain fell before sun began to dry pitch making ball skid through upon england s resumption at 13 1 fingleton p 84 miller beat washbrook s bat twice in one over soon after resumption but was unable to extract an edge o reilly p 33 lindwall reached his peak speed and edrich edged to first slip where ian johnson got both hands to ball above his head but failed to hold on edrich was on four at time and this was part of a 20 minute passage of play during which england was unable to score arlott p 31 next ball from lindwall washbrook was caught on run by brown on fine leg boundary after attempting to hook a bouncer pitched on line of leg stump it was to be first of several times that washbrook was dismissed while hooking attracting substantial criticism washbrook s fall left england at 15 2 after 41 minutes of batting and brought compton to crease to join edrich compton square drove miller to boundary for four which prompted a retaliatory bouncer and a negative crowd reaction fingleton p 85 edrich was not scoring quickly but he defied bowling of miller and lindwall as english pair took score to 46 likewise compton was restraining his natural inclination to attack in an attempt to rebuild innings after two early wickets during this period brown made a series of one handed run saving stops in field rain had also softened up pitch and as a result playing surface did not offer much bounce o reilly p 34 bradman then made a double change and brought on two left arm pacemen bill johnston and ernie toshack in his first over johnston bowled edrich with a delivery that knocked off stump out of ground as batsman leaned forward on front foot two balls later johnston removed hardstaff for a duck caught by miller in slips after attempting a cut wisden described catch as dazzling miller dived and balanced himself on his spine as he caught ball heels over head fingleton p 86 o reilly said johnston had trimmed and embroidered efforts of his opening bowlers and had swung fortunes of game completely in australia s favour bradman then decided to bring miller back in place of toshack fingleton p 87 two runs later compton was bowled attempting a leg sweep against miller his leg stump knocked out of ground as he moved across his wickets five english wickets had fallen with only 48 runs on board after 100 minutes of play three batsmen had been dismissed in just ten minutes o reilly said there was nothing whatsoever to suggest that pitch had been instrumental in english debacle it was purely and simply an exhilarating display of splendid bowling fit to be classed with any match winning bowling performance in story of test cricket o reilly p 35 collapse left barnett and captain yardley as new men at crease both players attacked bowling but could not get their shots through field for runs soon after lindwall was forced to leave field due to a groin injury and did not bowl again pollard 1990 p 9 barnett hit one four before johnston bowled him for eight off inside edge as he leaned onto front foot this brought evans to crease with score at 60 6 and he attempted to disrupt australians line and length by counter attacking with a series of shots in front of wicket he drove ball forward of point to boundary for four and was then given two lives he hit johnston hard to cover but catch went through bradman for another boundary second chance of a catch went through bradman s hand and struck australian captain in abdomen however missed opportunities cost tourists little evans hit a ball strongly but it was caught at close range at short leg by morris without further addition to score toshack trapped yardley who had lingered at crease for 26 minutes in accumulating three runs leg before wicket lbw with a ball that straightened after pitching leaving score at 74 8 arlott p 32 england was facing prospect of setting a new record for lowest test innings score at trent bridge worse than 112 made by england against warwick armstrong s australians in 1921 however a late fightback averted unwanted record laker and bedser both from surrey joined forces and scored more than half of england s total adding 89 runs in only 73 minutes laker s innings was highlighted by hooking and driving while bedser defended stoutly and drove in front of wicket much to delight of nottingham crowd who had appeared to have become depressed by collapse of england s batsmen at first bradman did not appear concerned by partnership between two bowlers from surrey it was thought australian captain may have been happy for england to continue batting so his top order would not have to bat in fading light towards end of afternoon but he became anxious as total continued to mount and both bedser and laker appeared comfortable o reilly speculated that both players had batted confidently as their home ground in surrey oval had a reputation for being batsman friendly and that as they would have had to contend with opposition batsmen who had benefit of consistently favourable conditions then they should also prepare so they too could capitalise on their opportunities with willow o reilly p 36 according to english commentator john arlott playing surface was easier for batting than it had been at start of day but difference was not such as to cause hesitation in best batsmen in england eventually australia was forced to take second new ball and bedser was finally removed by johnston and miller had laker caught behind two runs later ending england s innings at 165 laker top scored with 63 in 101 minutes with six boundaries having reached his first 50 in only 60 minutes o reilly said there was nothing about his batting to suggest that luck was going his way or that he was short of batting experience johnston ended with 5 36 a display characterised with his accuracy and variations in pace and swing miller took 3 38 and a catch while lindwall and toshack took one wicket each spin was not used in abundance as johnson bowled five overs and morris three following england s struggles in first innings many pundits criticised yardley s decision to bat first fingleton pp 82 88 australia had less than 15 minutes of batting before scheduled close of play barnes made an appeal against light after first ball of innings which was a wide by edrich barnes walked down pitch and reportedly muttered to umpire frank chester in a casual tone eh light which allegedly shocked arbiter during previous ashes series in australia barnes had continuously made time wasting appeals against light which forced cricket administrators to limit batting team to one appeal if this was declined it would be up to umpires to offer an adjournment fingleton p 88 despite appeal against light australians showed little desire to be watchful against edrich s bowling scoring 11 runs from his two overs arlott pp 33 34 morris and barnes successfully negotiated new ball bowling of edrich and bedser they reached stumps at 17 without loss with morris on 10 and barnes on six barnes had been fortunate edging both edrich and bedser through slip cordon and yardley s decision to place his bowlers young and bedser in that region raised surprise bowlers tend to lack agility and reflexes needed for such positions at this stage following their tail end resistance england were in a good position with runs on board if rain struck overnight and caused a sticky wicket forcing australians to bat in hostile conditions following day 11 june day two ideal batting conditions and clear weather greeted players on second day after only four overs had been bowled in total previous afternoon edrich was relieved of new ball which was given to barnett who accompanied bedser both bowlers swung ball into right handed barnes and away from left handed morris arlott p 34 not a frontline bowler barnett focused on bowling defensively at medium pace and australians wanted to make a safe start so they decided to play him watchfully this prompted some commentators to claim barnett had allowed australians to settle into their rhythm by not trying to pressure them arlott p 35 barnes batted assuredly while morris was hesitant and shuffled around crease at one stage morris scored only seven runs in 55 minutes barnes was involved in some interplay with umpire chester when umpire failed to evade a drive from morris and stopped it with his foot barnes picked ball off ground and handed it to bowler prompting a finger wagging from chester to which barnes responded by admonishing umpire for blocking ball fingleton pp 88 89 morris unnecessarily played at a ball outside off stump from bedser and edged it to wicket keeper evans who dropped catch batsman recomposed himself and hit young s first ball a full toss for runs as australia passed 50 without loss after wayward start young began to bowl with consistent accuracy barnes and morris took score to 73 before latter was bowled for 31 by laker after two hours of batting morris tried to force a ball from laker away but hit it from middle of his bat into his back pad and ball rebounded onto stumps o reilly p 37 bradman came in and yardley set a defensive field employing leg theory to slow scoring english leader packed leg side with fielders including two short legs and ordered bedser to bowl at leg stump bradman almost inside edged second ball onto his stumps before defending uneasily for a period with laker stopping scoring at other end bradman managed only four runs in his first 20 minutes of batting fingleton p 90 australian captain regarded bedser as finest seam bowler he faced in his career and he batted in a circumspect manner as he sought to establish himself o reilly p 38 at other end bradman misjudged a ball from laker and an incorrectly executed cut shot narrowly went wide of slip fielder now aged 40 bradman s reflexes had slowed and he no longer started his innings as confidently as he had done in past barnes then reached his half century after 135 minutes pulling barnett for four fingleton p 91 and australians passed 100 before lunch after 125 minutes of batting at adjournment tourists were 104 1 arlott p 36 score had progressed to 121 when barnes tried to cut laker but only edged it onto thigh of wicket keeper evans ball bounced away and gloveman turned around and took a one handed diving catch to dismiss barnes for 62 umpire cooke was unsure of whether barnes had hit ball into ground before evans took catch and consulted with chester who had been standing at point on other side of field before ruling batsman out miller came in and was dismissed for a duck in laker s next over without further addition to australia s total he failed to pick laker s arm ball which drifted away and went straight on instead of turning inwards thereby clipping outside edge of his bat ball flew to slip where edrich completed catch perry 2005 p 235 hard hitting miller had come in at no 4 a position usually occupied by vice captain lindsay hassett a more sedate batsman indicating that bradman may have been looking to attack but change in batting order failed o reilly p 39 laker to this point had taken 3 22 from 12 4 overs having also top scored in first innings all while australia had been scoring slowly as they would for most of day brown came in at no 5 but he had played most of his career as an opening batsman and looked unaccustomed to playing in middle order but bradman brought him in ahead of hassett as new ball was due and brown was used to starting his innings against pace bowlers and a new ball australian captain decided to hasten new ball by using his feet to get to pitch of ball to attack spinners hitting them through off side yardley removed laker who was bowling effectively from attack and took second new ball bringing back bedser and edrich however this move backfired as bradman struck his first boundary in over 80 minutes and in first 40 minutes after lunch 43 runs were added yardley brought back his two spinners arlott p 37 and australia passed england s total before english captain brought himself on to bowl trapping brown who was attempting to push ball to mid on lbw with an off cutter in his first over this ended a 64 run stand in 58 minutes and hassett came in at 185 4 australian vice captain came close to being caught when he knocked a ball from bedser into air narrowly evading grasp of evans following departure of brown australian scoring slowed as bradman changed team strategy to one of attempting to bat only once yardley continued to employ a leg side field as he and barnett bowled outside leg stump during one over bradman did not attempt a single shot and then put his hands on his hips to express his displeasure at england s tactics during 15 minutes before tea australian captain did not add a single run and was heckled by crowd bradman reached tea on 78 and 55 minutes after resumption of play he cover drove bedser to reach his century in 218 minutes fingleton p 92 it was his 28th test century and his 18th in ashes tests last 29 runs took 70 minutes to accumulate and it was one of bradman s slower innings as yardley focused on stopping runs rather than taking wickets nevertheless bradman had appeared comfortable after early stages of his innings and patiently scored most of his runs between mid off and mid on often from back foot arlott pp 37 38 after bradman had reached his milestone many of spectators began to leave ground content with what they had seen arlott p 38 bradman added a further 30 in last hour to end with 130 hassett also batted patiently with one period of 20 minutes during which his score remained on 30 australia batted to stumps on second day without further loss ending at 293 4 a lead of 128 with hassett on 41 young had bowled 32 overs to a leg side field conceding only 53 runs fingleton described afternoon day s play as a very shrewd display of tactics and said that although proceedings and progress of australian batsmen had been slow they were never dull he added bradman was on top by virtue of facts that his side was well ahead of england his own score was 130 and he was also unconquered however o reilly disagreed and said australians had not made enough progress as they should or could have he said batsmen failed to capitalise on fatigue of bowlers late in day by not going on attack in search of quick runs instead of their monotonously dull strategy of patient attrition o reilly claimed that in containing opposition batsmen english attack had shared honours of day with if they did not actually steal them from bradman bradman and hassett had made physical gestures indicating their displeasure at england s tactics but o reilly felt yardley had no choice after his team had squandered initiative with their poor batting and claimed it was up to australians to turn their advantage into a decisive match winning position o reilly p 40 arlott disagreed with o reilly and said australia had time to build without risk or hurry on a gentle and accommodating wicket given a winning opportunity it is characteristic of australians that they will never dissipate it by over anxiety or by carelessness after day s play o reilly a former teammate of bradman who was covering tour as a journalist consulted bedser on his use of leg theory during his career o reilly had often attacked leg stump and had devised a plan to ensnare bradman fingleton p 93 12 june day three right 130px thumb hassett pictured left in late 1930s scored 137 for australia alt two men in cricket uniforms walk along a paved path wearing white shirts trousers and shoes man on left has his sleeves rolled up while his taller colleague is wearing a woolly sweater both have dark hair manicured grass is to their left and a pavilion is behind them on third morning amid sunshine bradman resumed on 130 before progressing to 132 and becoming first player to pass 1 000 runs for english season australian captain was not aware of reason for spontaneous crowd applause until being notified by wicket keeper evans bedser was bowling and he soon implemented o reilly s plans hutton was moved from leg slip to a squarer position at short fine leg around 11 metres from bat two short legs and a mid on were put in place bradman drove bedser through cover for a boundary but on next ball his innings terminated at 138 when he glanced an inswinger from bedser straight to hutton at short fine leg who caught ball without having to move bradman had batted for 290 minutes and faced 321 balls and as johnson walked in to replace him with australia at 305 5 bedser waved to o reilly in press box when former australian test opener jack fingleton a teammate of both bradman and o reilly who was also working as a journalist reported what his colleague had done there was some debate as to whether o reilly s actions were treacherous johnson made 21 including an edge over slips cordon before being bowled by laker he inside edged ball onto his foot and it rolled back into his stumps fingleton p 94 at same time yardley pinned hassett down with more leg theory laker bowled with one slip while young had none and had all of his fielders evenly spread in a circular formation tallon came in and took 39 minutes to compile 10 before hitting a return catch to left arm orthodox spin of young scoring was very slow during this passage of play young delivered 11 consecutive maiden overs and his 26 over spell conceded only 14 runs hassett conducted himself in a humorous way and arlott said only his grace and concealed humour made his innings tolerable he mainly scored from deflections and was for most part prepared to take his time arlott p 39 injured lindwall came out to bat at 365 7 without a runner to join hassett and appeared to be able to run twos and threes without significant difficulty o reilly p 42 hassett who had scored only 30 runs in first 75 minutes of day swept laker for four and then hit him for first six of match australian vice captain added 53 in two hours of morning session to reach lunch at 94 tourists were unhurried and remained patient as they had bowled england out quickly on first day and there was still sufficient time to force a result with less than half playing time elapsed after break hassett reached his century after 305 minutes of batting his first in tests in england he then accelerated adding a further 37 runs in 49 minutes before being bowled by bedser having struck 20 fours and a six fingleton p 95 dismissal ended an eighth wicket partnership of 107 with lindwall who was caught by evans down leg side four runs later having scored 42 with seven fours australia s last wicket pair of johnston and toshack wagged a further 33 runs in only 18 minutes batting in a carefree and freewheeling manner arlott pp 40 41 before bedser trapped toshack to end innings at 509 leaving tourists with a 344 run lead australia had batted for 216 2 overs longest innings in terms of overs and highest total in series yardley placed majority of bowling load on his spinners young 1 79 and laker 4 138 delivered 60 and 55 overs respectively bedser bowled 44 2 overs taking 3 113 part time seam bowlers edrich barnett and yardley bowled 18 17 and 17 overs respectively australia had scored slowly but they had no need to take risks when there was so much time remaining yardley s leg theory tactics failed to coax them into losing their patience england thus started their second innings still 344 runs in arrears although lindwall was able to run between wickets he did not take to field in second innings and 12th man neil harvey took his place fingleton called harvey by far most brilliant fieldsman of both sides fingleton p 96 yardley was sceptical as to whether lindwall was sufficiently injured to be forced from field but did not formally object to harvey s presence on field o reilly said lindwall had demonstrated his mobility during his innings was in no way incapacitated and that english captain must be condemned for carrying his concepts of sportsmanship too far when no substitute was justified o reilly decried benefit australia derived through substitution agreeing with fingleton s judgement of harvey was tourists best fielder by far arlott went further calling harvey best fielder in world arlott p 41 four of first five runs were leg byes miller then removed washbrook for one from a top edged hook shot that was caught by tallon batsman was displeased with umpire s decision and gestured to a red mark on his shirt indicating he felt ball had touched his body and not bat o reilly p 44 edrich came in and while he continued to struggle he defiantly held up his end of pitch after scoring 13 from 43 minutes edrich was caught behind attempting a cut from off spin of johnson he did not read arm ball which went straight on and took outside edge leaving england 39 2 fingleton p 97 johnson was extracting a substantial amount of spin from surface o reilly p 43 this brought together england s leading batsmen hutton and compton latter coming in upon fall of edrich ran down pitch before ball was bowled and had to quickly play a defensive shot on run he clipped next ball to leg side for two runs before surviving a confident leg before wicket appeal from johnson when he was on eight compton appeared ready to walk off but umpire chester declined appeal much to his surprise england reached 50 in 65 minutes and with lindwall missing bradman had difficulties in spreading workload among his depleted bowling resources part time leg spin of barnes was brought on as fifth bowling option to give others some time to rest and miller resumed bowling late in day delivering slow off spin to conserve energy hutton and compton exploited depleted bowling attack and began to score freely using their placement to bisect gaps between fielders o reilly p 45 pair did not give a chance apart from when compton aimed an square drive from johnston that flew in air wide of cover point hutton then leg glanced miller before cover driving and square cutting him in another over all three shots went for four and he reached his fifty in 110 minutes miller responded to spate of boundaries with a series of bouncers fingleton p 98 including five in last over of day one of these struck hutton high on his left arm batsmen survived but miller received a hostile reaction from crowd throughout his short pitched barrage including shouts of bodyline original practitioners of bodyline harold larwood and bill voce were both from nottinghamshire and played at trent bridge and were later excluded from selection for england after being blamed for ill feeling caused by bodyline nottinghamshire supporters were still angry with how their players had been removed and were not happy that miller was able to do something they saw to be equivalent for his part miller appeared to be amused by crowd reaction and revelled in it grinning and flicking his hair arlott p 42 however hutton had last word glancing miller down to fine leg for a four from final ball of day england were 121 2 with hutton and compton on 63 and 36 respectively miller was widely jeered and heckled as he walked off field and crowded surged towards him as he walked up steps into dressing room arlott p 43 o reilly defended miller s use of short pitched deliveries pointing out that he had not employed a packed leg side field and had allowed batsman opportunity to score from hook and pull shots if he was willing to try in contrast packed bodyline field meant batsmen would find little reward for such shots and defensive play would only lead to dismissal o reilly pp 45 47 14 june day four third day was followed by a rest day on sunday and play resumed on fourth morning a monday with england still 223 runs in arrears before start of play nottinghamshire county cricket club nccc secretary h a brown broadcast an appeal to gallery over public address system to refrain from their heckling of miller crowd responded by clapping as australians took to field chairman of nccc reportedly apologised to bradman in private for crowd reaction to miller fingleton p 99 as new ball was due soon after start of play johnson and toshack opened attack as bradman saved johnston and miller in his first over johnson extracted sharp turn from one delivery that pitched outside off stump not expecting much spin compton did not play a shot and was hit on pads but umpire rejected loud appeal for lbw otherwise hutton and compton progressed steadily before light deteriorated although johnson and toshack were able to make ball deviate regularly despite this bradman opted to have miller take new ball in fifth over of day as soon as it was available mindful of recent events miller refrained from bouncers during morning in overcast conditions miller bowled a relatively full length and swung ball one of his deliveries beat hutton and narrowly missed his stumps o reilly p 48 at other end johnston was also able to make ball move sideways arlott p 45 meanwhile compton appeared to be untroubled by bowling after half an hour of play an unsuccessful appeal against light was made as dark clouds hovered overhead rejection of appeal made little difference as a thunderstorm stopped proceedings for five minutes soon after shortly after resumption miller bowled hutton with an off cutter in dark conditions ending 111 run partnership at 150 3 hutton had made 74 runs in 168 minutes with 11 fours and as in first innings he played forward to a ball without getting his front foot close to bat resulting in delivery moving through gap into stumps o reilly p 49 wicket prompted entrance of hardstaff and on third ball he aimed a cut at a wide miller delivery and it again went low to second slip as in first innings however this time morris was in position and catch was dropped it was part of an eventful over during which hardstaff had many near misses he played and missed at one ball inside edged another into his pads and edged another through slips for two runs fingleton p 100 hardstaff had a reputation for being an uncertain starter especially as he had a tendency to poke at deliveries outside his off stump and poor visibility further hindered him at 12 35 bad light stopped proceedings and after two inspections umpires resumed play although arlott claimed that visibility was barely more than a half candle power better hardstaff then batted aggressively walking towards bowling and hitting three cover drives for four from miller and johnston in one period in which he outscored compton 23 to four he then edged through slips for another boundary before compton swept toshack to fence in final over before lunch break hardstaff square drove johnston for four off back foot and england adjourned at 191 3 with compton on 63 and hardstaff 31 still 153 in arrears fingleton p 101 during session bradman used miller for 11 overs in a row in an attempt to pressure englishmen while toshack bowled defensively from other end o reilly p 50 after lunch light was again poor but england did not appeal to umpires for an adjournment yardley wanted to bat now in poor visibility in order to eradicate deficit and build a lead so that if a shower came later and turned pitch into a sticky wicket australia would have to chase a target on an erratic surface bradman anticipated rain so he utilised toshack and johnson to bowl defensively to slow england s progress in hope that hosts would not have a lead by time a sticky wicket materialised as umpires were obliged to not call off play unless light was so poor as to endanger batsman lack of pace of johnson and toshack forced play to continue as they posed no physical threat to batsmen in foggy and misty conditions hardstaff brought up england s 200 with a strongly hit hook that almost hit barnes compton then hit a boundary from toshack prompting bradman to further stack leg side with fielders in defensive positions scoring was slow as toshack pinned down batsmen with an effective leg stump line innings was interrupted by bad light and upon resumption of proceedings poor visibility intervened for a second time with compton on 97 after 55 minutes of delay umpires called players back onto field wisden said rarely can a test match have been played under such appalling conditions as on this day fingleton said conditions were pitiable and lamented utmost gloom in which batsmen and fieldsmen had intense difficulty in sighting ball fingleton p 103 o reilly said it was without doubt worst light under which he had seen a first class match proceed compton brought up his third consecutive century at trent bridge by hitting a single to square leg a lovely century of stroke play and patience according to fingleton fingleton p 102 innings had taken 227 minutes and included 12 fours and compton had regularly hit ball in middle of his bat despite poor visibility which meant batsmen could not see ball once it was close to boundary o reilly described innings as one of greatest batting efforts in story of anglo australian tests o reilly p 51 adding that his hundred runs was but a poor measure by which to estimate value of his magnificent innings deeming compton s innings equivalent to a double century under normal conditions arlott said in its manner its style and its context it must rank with any innings he has ever played his innings will remain a test classic arlott p 46 soon after compton edged to slips from bowling of miller but johnson spilled catch hardstaff fell for 43 lofting toshack to hassett on leg side having put on 93 with compton ball looped up in air and travelled half way to square leg boundary but hassett managed to keep track of its trajectory through fog barnett came in and together with compton added 21 runs in 33 minutes before edging johnston to miller who completed a difficult catch in slips yardley came out to bat at 264 5 and compton drove miller square for four provoking bowler s first bouncer of day compton hooked it away for two and miller s next delivery slipped out of his hand and cleared compton s head on full to some jeering in crowd such a ball is known as a beamer and is illegal because of physical danger it poses to batsman compton and yardley put on a 57 run partnership in 66 minutes before johnston held a return catch to dismiss yardley for 22 england reached stumps at 345 6 just one run ahead of australia with compton on 154 and evans on 10 during day johnston bowled most overs 30 arlott pp 44 47 15 june day five thumb barnes pictured here in a photo at age of 16 top scored as australia reached their target alt a teenage boy leans over his bat in front of stumps in readiness to face a ball he is wearing a white shirt trousers and a cap compton and evans continued to resist australians on final morning latter being more aggressive arlott p 48 and proceedings were briefly interrupted by rain less than 30 minutes after start of play at time it appeared downpour might cause match to end in a draw fingleton p 104 after half an hour of stoppages play resumed and evans attacked hitting two fours in quick succession england s wicket keeper played johnston and johnson confidently but bradman nevertheless persisted in giving compton easy singles in order to bring evans on strike so he could be targeted o reilly p 52 for his part compton thought his partner could be relied upon and accepted runs gifted to him by australian captain while evans continued to attack bowling batsmen appealed against light after first stoppage of day but were turned down australia took new ball but home team s batsmen continued to proceed steadily evans being particularly aggressive arlott p 49 after a second interruption for poor light this time for ten minutes play resumed and england had added a further 60 runs to their overnight total to reach 405 6 miller bowled a fast and very short bouncer at compton who moved into position to hook before changing his mind and attempting to evade ball he lost balance and threw his legs apart trying to avoid stepping onto his stumps however he was unsuccessful and was out hit wicket for 184 having batted for 413 minutes and hit 19 fours wisden said no praise could be too high for manner in which compton carried side s responsibilities and defied a first class attack in such trying circumstances fingleton said it was a most depressing end to an innings that will live always o reilly described it as an unsavoury ending to one of greatest fighting knocks in test history compton s fall at 405 7 exposed english tail and australia quickly finished off rest of batsmen in 36 minutes miller bowled laker who played outside line of ball for four evans reached 50 and was caught behind from johnston who then castled young for nine england were all out for 441 after 183 overs leaving australia a target of 98 in three hours lindwall s absence throughout england innings meant remaining four australian frontline bowlers had bowled more than 32 overs each johnston delivered 59 and ended with 4 147 while miller took 4 125 from 44 overs toshack and johnson took a wicket each from 33 and 42 overs respectively australia progressed quickly at start of chase barnes took 13 runs including three boundaries from opening over bowled by bedser while morris again lacked fluency however barnes continued to score quickly and 24 runs came from first four overs yardley tried to stop run scoring by bringing on young but morris hit him for four and bowler was promptly taken off arlott p 50 tourists proceeded steadily to 38 from 32 minutes before bedser bowled morris for nine fingleton p 105 after bowling several balls that moved away bedser caught out morris with an inswinger morris had developed a habit of trying to defend ball to leg side while shuffling towards off and was not in a position to deal with a ball that hurried off pitch bradman came to crease and batted for 12 minutes without getting off mark from 10th ball he faced australian skipper was out for a duck again caught by hutton at short fine leg in bedser s leg trap bradman showed obvious displeasure at allowing himself to be dismissed by same trap in consecutive innings o reilly p 53 and his departure left australia at 48 2 it was first time in four tours to england that bradman had made a duck in a test arlott p 51 upon bradman s dismissal dark clouds began to close in on ground and rain appeared to be a possible saviour for england however it never came and meanwhile hassett joined barnes pair attacked hassett twice driving bedser over infield for boundaries and later pulling another ball in air for another four barnes gave young an opportunity for a return catch but ball was dropped pair reached target without further loss after 87 minutes of batting barnes ended on 64 with 11 boundaries having been prolific on square cut he tied scores with a swept boundary and having taken a stump as souvenir ran off ground believing match was over barnes tossed his souvenir back into playing arena and returned to field after noticing reaction of amused crowd and hassett promptly hit winning run aftermath first test was a continuation of trend of english batsmen being largely unable to cope with australia s pacemen hutton was only englishman to pass 50 in mcc match and at trent bridge only he and compton managed this feat apart from hardstaff none of remaining batsmen passed 25 wisden s verdict was that england fought back very well but that avoiding defeat was almost impossible after their poor batting on first day bowes considered defensive english bowling display worthy of a draw and blamed first innings batting for failure to prevent defeat however he believed english tactics to be justified and should have been continued bowes pp 188 89 australia s success came at a cost with lindwall injured and unable to bowl in lead up to second test missing intervening matches against northamptonshire and yorkshire heavy workload on miller caused by lindwall s breaking down mid test generated severe back pain and he was still not fully recovered by start of second test at lord s lindwall was subjected to a thorough fitness test on first morning of lord s test bradman was not convinced of lindwall s fitness but bowler s protestations were sufficient to convince his captain to risk his inclusion australia won toss and elected to bat allowing lindwall further time to recover from his injury perry 2001 p 233 miller also played but still nursing his back was unfit to bowl perry 2005 p 239 content with their convincing win at trent bridge australia made no changes to their team while england made three omitting barnett hardstaff and young due to a combination of injury and poor form barnett and hardstaff never played another test despite his injury lindwall played a key role in a heavy 409 run australian victory taking eight wickets his bowling also led to controversial omission of hutton who performed poorly at lord s for third test reason was said to be hutton s struggles with lindwall s short pitched bowling perry 2001 p 224 this decision pleased australians who regarded hutton as their most formidable opponent with bat on field australians continued to flourish third test was a rain affected draw and between first and fourth tests they won four of their five county matches drawing other on final day of fourth test australia s batsmen set a world test cricket record by scoring 404 to win match thereby taking a series winning 3 0 lead after historic win in fourth test australia had five tour matches before final test they won three while two ended in rain curtailed draws fingleton pp 190 210 australia then completed series with an innings victory in fifth test at oval to complete a 4 0 result fifth test was last international match of tour and tourists had seven further matches to negotiate in order to fulfil bradman s aim of going through english season undefeated apart from two washed out matches bradman s men had little difficulty winning remaining five fixtures by an innings they thus became first touring test team to complete an english season undefeated earning themselves sobriquet invincibles harte and whimpress p 405 see also notes references
