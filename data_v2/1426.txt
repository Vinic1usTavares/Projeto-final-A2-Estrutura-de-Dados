levinson said show would maintain its realistic visual style claiming we want a camera that s almost a participant in show homicide was ultimately renewed but producers slightly toned down show s bleak visual style and hand held photography motif and focused more strongly on single stories rather than multiple subplots fontana said we were experimenting with our first nine episodes whenever you try something new you tend to err on side of breaking ground but we d rather have more people watching so colors and lighting are slightly brighter and camera movements are not as jarring however both levinson and fontana insisted changes were not entirely due to network pressure but rather were evolutionary developments for series kalat p 127 nbc ordered a four episode second season which would be broadcast in january 1994 as a mid year replacement a decision about whether to renew show for a third season would then be made based on how those four episodes performed in ratings kalat p 125 david p kalat author of homicide life on street unofficial companion credited nbc entertainment president warren littlefield with that move although levinson claimed nbc west coast president don ohlmeyer was behind decision ohlmeyer said he believed a better timeslot less dense stories and less hand held photography would attract more viewers and help show succeed better for it to succeed long term there s a humanity that needs to be brought to characters there s more here than there was last year littlefield said of homicide it s a show we think has tremendous potential that was not fully realized in first nine episodes and that s why we want to make more thumb left 190px homicide executive producer barry levinson said nbc s decision to evaluate series after a four episode season

on thursdays at 10 p m levinson and other series producers considered this an extremely positive move for show as homicide suffered greatly in ratings on wednesdays due to competition from highly rated abc comedy block featuring home improvement and coach even during first season levinson often said series was truly designed for a 10 p m timeslot homicide took timeslot previously held by legal drama l a law which was placed on a six week hiatus from december 23 until early february with some critics claiming l a law had declined in quality hiatus led to speculation that it would be canceled and homicide would replace it this led to some tension during an nbc reception when l a law star corbin bernsen approached homicide actor richard belzer and shouted expletives at him yelling you stole our timeslot producers of homicide said decision to evaluate series after a four episode season placed tremendous pressure on staff of show fontana said one hour dramas need time to fully develop and allow audiences to become familiar with characters fontana expressed frustration with nbc in some news interviews claiming networks seemed to lack courage to either cancel or renew it they will run it in a 10 p m time period for a month and then they ll kiss us goodbye i m used to this kind of treatment from nbc i m a little surprised they d treat barry levinson same way they d treat me in other interviews however fontana said he saw decision as a sign of support this is not just a casual action on nbc s part it s a real statement to me that we have a possibility to return levinson said he believed four shots are better than nothing adding what i learned is that it is very hard for a network to make a real commitment a hit and run sensibility is prevalent in all fairness to nbc this is a tougher kind of show than any other show they carry it is different and no one is going to endorse different in this world no one celebrates different crew thumb right 190px second season marked debut of jean de segonzac as homicide s director of photography alt a bald man wearing glasses and a gray t shirt looks off screen homicide was produced by levinson s company baltimore pictures which had partnered with reeves entertainment during first season however reeves entertainment went out of business after first season concluded so nbc bought into show and formally became a co producer which gave network more latitude to demand creative changes kalat p 126 second season marked debut of jean de segonzac as director of photography he replaced wayne ewing who levinson felt was too inexperienced and did not trust with responsibility of managing show s cinematography among segonzac s film credits was laws of gravity 1992 which was directed by nick gomez who directed homicide

blythe her absence was never explained on screen while rest of cast was contractually obliged to return many of them had offers for other films television shows or plays and logistics of arranging their schedules so all of them could return for show was difficult in an interview fontana claimed cast was contractually entitled to be paid for 13 episodes but they all agreed to take less money and come back for shortened season uncertainty over whether homicide would be renewed or not created a great deal of stress for some cast members polito said of feeling where is limbo it s in baltimore kalat p 128 baldwin in particular expressed frustration with nbc for failing to renew show for a full season and said he feared uncertainty could hurt his film career for two years now i ve been walking around thinking why did i do this why did i subject myself to this nonsense i will never ever do another series ever ever ever ever there is no justice in television where s confidence why aren t i here talking about being picked up for 22 episodes i want to say to warren littlefield can you read can you read i ve never seen this kind of critical response to a show before thumb right

light gray hair wearing a black suit jacket and purple striped tie smiles and looks directly ahead likewise beatty said he enjoyed actual filming of episodes but hated television business end of it claiming i can t think of anything i would less rather do than television at this moment he said process left him pretty much burnt and said his enthusiasm for show had eroded as time goes on it was initially reported that beatty would not return for second homicide season at all because he had accepted a starring role in boys a cbs comedy series also featuring christopher meloni polito said he did not believe beatty s departure would hurt show because of ensemble nature of cast i love ned s work but show won t fall apart because of one character beatty ended up appearing in both shows and boys was canceled after six episodes although belzer said he and rest of cast returned to filming with guarded emotions he credited his role as john munch with giving him credibility as an actor while he previously had to vigorously pursue roles he was receiving unsolicited offers by time of second season including a recurring role in abc television series lois clark new adventures of superman polito however was terminated from cast after second season ended reportedly because nbc officials were unhappy with his weight and physical appearance and did not believe he appealed to audiences kalat p 142 after his dismissal polito became publicly critical of direction homicide had recently taken saying it changed to a parody of itself and claiming he had repeatedly voiced problems with show s recent scripts to fontana and chris menaul polito said it would have killed me to come back show went from art to mediocrity i m relieved that they ve freed me legally i didn t want to go back to another six months of indecision and hurt i m shocked that other actors re signed brilliance of show under levinson was lost this season it s like watching sinking of titanic problem is that iceberg is guys who built ship producers you can never trust producers they would have said to van gogh nice painting a little lighter on colors and we can sell it several notable actors made guest appearances throughout second season of homicide robin williams appeared in bop gun as robert ellison husband of a slain woman tourist levinson previously directed williams in films good morning vietnam 1987 and toys 1992 although williams was primarily known for his comedic work homicide producers and williams himself consciously decided to remain true to original script rejecting idea of adding humor or jokes to episode bop gun also featured a 13 year old jake gyllenhaal son of episode s director stephen in one of his earliest acting performances he played matt young son of robert ellison wilford brimley portrayed bed ridden and suicidal harry prentice in see no evil isaiah washington played murder suspect lane in black and blue kalat p 136 and adrienne shelly portrayed s m fashion store owner tanya quinn in a many splendored thing julianna margulies appeared in last two episodes of season as linda a waitress who starts dating bolander fontana was so impressed with margulies that he offered her a recurring role on homicide but she turned it down in favor of medical drama series er production writing by time first season ended four additional scripts for second season had already been written but before approving second season nbc asked for refinements both in visual style and in scripts from a screenwriting perspective nbc asked that scripts place more emphasis on single storylines rather than multiple subplots during first season some episodes included as many as four separate storylines season premiere bop gun was first homicide episode to revolve entirely around a single plot murder of a tourist and its aftermath fontana said by focusing on one story he believed it allows show to tell that story better adding in some places there wasn t enough time for story bop gun script also differed from previous homicide episodes by focusing more strongly on a murder victim rather than on detectives other three episodes of season continued to focus on multiple stories but switched from four different subplots to three thumb left 180px bop gun was co written by david simon author of homicide a year on killing streets from which series was adapted alt a bald man wearing a black denim jacket and red shirt looking sideways and opening his mouth to speak bop gun was written by david mills and david simon latter of whom wrote 1991 non fiction book homicide a year on killing streets from which television series was adapted it was first television script written by mills who previously worked as a reporter and became friends with simon while studying journalism at university of maryland college park writing script inspired mills to quit journalism and start writing for television full time simon felt script s dialogue was faithful to reality especially detectives use of dark humor as a coping mechanism for dealing with horrors of homicide unit this was particularly embodied by a scene in which murdered tourist s husband becomes angry after overhearing detectives talk about how much overtime they would get from case which simon claimed was a conversation real life detectives would really have see no evil was written by series creator paul attanasio who had not penned a homicide script since series premiere gone for goode attanasio deliberately wrote see no evil script so that it would be morally questionable whether police handling of both main subplots assisted suicide and suspected police shooting were done in an ethically correct way kalat p 134 black and blue was written by james yoshimura who continued working on homicide throughout entire life of show but considered that episode his favorite script kalat p 135 a story arc in see no evil and black and blue featured pembleton investigating a suspected police related shooting this was based on a real life 1988 shooting and subsequent investigation by baltimore police department detective donald worden featured in david simon s book homicide a year on killing streets several members of baltimore police department publicly criticized homicide for its negative portrayal of police in storyline and 22 detectives wrote a formal letter of protest to levinson over matter kalat p 131 a many splendored thing was written by noel behn who became consulting producer with series that episode featured a subplot about a man who killed another man over a pen which was inspired by a real life murder in anne arundel county maryland in which a 23 year old man shot another man 10 times in a doughnut shop when victim refused to sell shooter his pen since nbc had not decided on whether to renew homicide until after four episodes aired screenwriters did not start working on any scripts for third season until after second season concluded as a result once nbc was committed to renewal scripts had to be written later and homicide producers were not able to turn around new shows until fall additionally fontana was working on other projects including philly heat an abc miniseries about members of philadelphia fire department some media outlets criticized nbc for not commissioning fontana and levinson to write back up scripts which prevented homicide from starting earlier once show was renewed alan pergament of buffalo news wrote understandably fontana didn t sit by idly and wait for nbc to make its decision on homicide filming four second season episodes were filmed during summer of 1993 last of them bop gun was filmed in late september 1993 with fontana just having returned from accepting an emmy award for outstanding writing for a drama series for script of first season episode three men and adena like first season they were filmed on location in baltimore levinson was not present for filming and development of episodes because he was in los angeles shooting jimmy hollywood 1994 a comedy film starring joe pesci and christian slater fontana said levinson remained involved in development of scripts and production of shows among visual changes during homicide s second season were brighter colors while colorist drexel williams previously drained footage of color value to create a gritty style cinematographer jean de segonzac directed williams to make colors less muted and more lively segonzac also sought a more restrained visual style as he believed previous cinematographer wayne ewing tended to get a little too wild and someone could complain they got a little dizzy levinson praised what he described as a subtler and more effective style under segonzac bop gun was originally meant to serve as second season finale but nbc decided to make it season premiere with hopes of getting increased ratings from williams guest appearance scenes with williams were filmed over three days fontana said of shooting williams worked like a dog it was quite a special event for all of us it s very intense music chris tergesen became music coordinator during second season and more music is featured than in previous episodes as a result first scene of bop gun for example featured song killer by seal and adamski over a brief montage of images just before a murder took place in that same episode buddy guy blues song feels like rain plays just after howard speaks with a suspect in jail other songs were integrated into show itself one suspect listens to public enemy song gett off my back on headphones just before he was arrested various songs are featured in other second season episodes including gerry goffin and carole king song up on roof in black and blue and soul asylum song whoa and donna summer song bad girls in a many splendored thing black and blue ended with bolander and linda on cello and violin respectively performing a movement of passacaglia a classical music piece composed by george frideric handel cellist zuill bailey served as a body double for beatty in scenes with bolander playing cello reception reviews second season received generally positive reviews bop gun was particularly acclaimed it was named one of ten best episodes of series by baltimore sun and star tribune called williams performance one of ten best guest star moments in television history performance of andre braugher was also particularly praised especially for his scene in black and blue in which pembleton persuades a suspect to confess to a murder he did not commit gail pennington of st louis post dispatch said second season was an improvement over first which she said was excellent but tended to demand an awful lot from viewers pennington said toned down visual style and stronger emphasis on single stories better focused show adding homicide is great tv and nbc believes in it enough to give it what may be network s best time slot bob langford of news observer called homicide absolutely brilliant and praised it for focusing not on crimes but on effects of it as well as realistic themes regarding race such as concerns in bop gun that murder would deter white tourists from visiting baltimore langford said it was occasionally preachy but said sometimes a good sermon is what we need amazing that one this powerful can come from a tv show rick kogan television critic with chicago tribune called show wholly original and an example of how good television entertainment can be he praised ensemble cast and interesting characters and said show would be renewed if there s any justice in tv ray richmond of los angeles daily news praised nbc for giving homicide a second chance comparing it to days when nbc stuck with comedy series cheers even though it ranked last in ratings during its first season richmond said of homicide this is also one of final opportunities to see a television network stick with a struggling show for no better reason than it deserves to be stuck with in bottom line driven 1990s that s become as rare as quality itself steven cole smith with fort worth star telegram said of evaluation period during homicide s second season if you don t watch it you may lose your right to complain that there s never anything good on tv he called it a gritty atmospheric police series and complimented it for showing not only gratuitous violence but consequences of it robert bianco of pittsburgh post gazette praised show and said decision to focus on fewer subplots might help bianco said let s hope changes work because homicide is too good to lose and its vision of civilization is too troubling to shunt aside washington post television reviewer tom shales called homicide achingly even painfully brilliant best cop show i have ever seen david zurawik of baltimore sun called it best police drama ever made for television besides hill street blues baltimore sun reporter david bianculli praised show s writers for being willing to place their characters in ethically questionable positions adding please watch this series it s so good i don t mind pleading tom jicha of south florida sun sentinel called it an hour about as fine as there is on tube with great writing and camera work jicha said it would be a senseless act of violence against superb tv for those who claim to appreciate fine drama to kill this show by turning dial hal boedeker television critic with miami herald strongly praised series particularly bop gun which he called highest order for network tv boedeker called writing direction and acting first rate and declared homicide better choice over nypd blue because it did not resort to gimmicks like nudity featured in latter show nypd blue second season of homicide drew several comparisons to nypd blue an abc police drama series that had debuted in september 1993 it received a large amount of publicity and better ratings than homicide which some reviewers attributed to violence and nudity featured in show like homicide nypd blue featured an ensemble cast and intertwined subplots and commentators suggested its success may have encouraged nbc to support homicide levinson said he was not deterred by comparisons to nypd blue because homicide debuted before that series in a news article fontana quoted a friend who described nypd blue as television version of homicide baldwin was even more critical of show and said in an interview ultimate compliment that can ever be paid is to be mimicked by someone else so thank you nypd blue because it s knockoff of homicide nypd blue co creator steven bochco took exception to that characterization saying he believed his reputation and experience in television proved he was capable of conceiving his own material bochco said i don t think it s a knock off it was conceived as its own show i wish homicide best and they should be so lucky as to do as well as we re doing right now pete schulberg of oregonian wrote forget all commotion about nypd blue homicide delivers without lewd language and skin shots it depicts violence in a most compelling way you don t see it you just feel it bob of sacramento bee said bottom line is that while nypd blue is a fine show it was on my 10 best list for 1993 homicide is better there s been nothing like it since heyday of hill street blues elaine liner television critic with corpus christi caller times who called homicide as rewarding an hour of serious quality television as you could ask for praised it for highlighting quality writing rather than gimmicks like nudity from nypd blue and praised it for fleshing out not only detectives and victims but suspects too like in bop gun ed siegel of boston globe wrote if nudity is what it took to get you to watch nypd blue and you decided to stay because it was grittier better written directed and acted than any other drama on tv be advised that homicide is so far superior to nypd blue in all those categories that if you re not watching it you re missing best hour of episodic television since hill street blues and st elsewhere left air ratings nbc heavily advertised second season especially guest appearance by williams in season premiere bop gun levinson baldwin belzer and fontana all participated in multiple media interviews about show bop gun was seen by 16 3 million viewers a higher than usual homicide life on street rating in large part to interest in williams appearance it received a 17 3 nielsen rating and a 28 share highest rating for a 10 p m drama series since january 1992 rating placed homicide among top ten network television nielsen ratings for week and outperformed ratings of l a law which normally filled 10 p m thursday timeslot warren littlefield said ratings far exceeded expectations and said he expected series to return for a third season if viewership remained strong littlefield said of homicide ratings these are outstanding numbers for a dramatic television series if we can keep a reasonable level of audience we believe in work we believe in creative team we think we have perhaps most outstanding ensemble cast in all of television we just would like to see continued signs of life other three episodes of season did not match viewership of bop gun but they were nevertheless considered strong ratings for show better than past homicide episodes and average rating for l a law kalat p 129 homicide s improved ratings in thursday night timeslot fueled speculation that l a law might be canceled and homicide would take its place warren littlefield denied such claims believing success of one series did not necessarily have to mean cancellation of other despite homicide s improvement in ratings nbc did not immediately commit to a third season until producers agreed to even more changes including more prominent guest stars more women in cast and more life affirming storylines kalat p 130 outgoing cast member polito publicly decried these changes claiming show was going to change from a drama into a soap opera to cut down on costs network also pressured levinson to relocate filming to california rather than baltimore which would reduce costs for travel lodging and meals maryland governor william donald schaefer sent a telegram to levinson encouraging him to remain in city i wanted you to know that we are proud of having this exceptional series shot in your native state and stand ready to help toward a positive decision for additional production of series levinson and fontana considered leaving baltimore not only for cost savings but also because of letters of outrage by city s detectives over see no evil as well as a report in associated press that show was giving baltimore a bad image by drawing attention to its murder rate ultimately however levinson decided to remain in baltimore on february 15 1994 day options of cast contracts expired nbc decided at midnight to sign for a third season but ordered only 13 episodes instead of a full 22 episode season opting to wait and see how ratings performed before committing to final nine awards robin williams received an emmy award nomination for guest actor in a drama series for his role in bop gun it was only emmy
