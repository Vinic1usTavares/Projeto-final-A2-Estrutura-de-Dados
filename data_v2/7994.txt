tupolev tu 85 usaf dod reporting name type 31 nato reporting name barge was a soviet prototype strategic bomber based on tu 4 an unlicensed reverse engineered copy of boeing b 29 superfortress it was ultimate development of b 29 family being over 50 heavier than its ancestor and had nearly double range only two prototypes were built before program was cancelled in favor of tupolev tu 95 bomber which was much faster and had same range development neither tu 4 nor tupolev tu 80 were true intercontinental strategic bombers as they both lacked range to attack united states from bases in soviet union and return tu 85 was designed to achieve necessary range by use of more powerful and fuel efficient engines a redesigned wing to increase lift drag ratio and addition of more fuel a large number of engines were considered before settling on shvetsov ash 2k essentially two air cooled ash 82 radial engines paired together and liquid cooled dobrynin vd 4k six bank inline engine similar in configuration to failed german junkers jumo 222 for a format of engine airframe proposed much earlier during world war ii s later phases in late july 1943 for heinkel firm s never built contract contender both proposed engine designs for tu 85 were given and power recovery turbines which converted them into turbo compound engines shvetsov design was preferred but was not yet mature enough for use and vd 4k was selected a lot of effort was put into refining design of wing in collaboration with tsagi it had an aspect ratio of 11 745 and a taper of 2 93 for optimum lift at high altitudes gordon p 115 tu 85 carried of fuel in 48 flexible tanks gunston p 146 much of armament and equipment was derived from those of late model tu 4 including four remotely controlled dorsal and ventral turrets and tail turret each with two nudelman rikhter nr 23 cannon but tu 85 s tail turret had argon ranging radar and each of two bomb bays was enlarged to hold a fab 9000 bomb actual design work began in august 1948 and was ratified by a directive from council of ministers dated 16 september that required first prototype to be ready for manufacturer s tests in december 1950 construction of first aircraft began in july 1950 and was completed in september gordon p 116 it first flew on 9 january 1951 and manufacturer s tests lasted until october 1951 on 12 september first prototype flew with a bombload of landing with enough fuel remaining to have covered second prototype sometimes referred to as or 85 2 incorporated lessons learned from first aircraft including revision and reinforcement of airframe and a variety of changes to its equipment and systems it was first flown on 28 june 1951 and its trials lasted until november 1951 series production was approved on 23 march 1951 at three factories where it would succeed tu 4 on production line but this was reversed later in year and program was cancelled during korean war soviet mig 15s brought down many us b 29 bombers showing that there was no future for piston aircraft in combat use priority was given to higher performance turboprop tu 95 bear as its own turboprop powerplants tv 12 prototype series for kuznetsov nk 12 turboprops that power tu 95 to this day were already generating 12 000 shp as early as 1951 kuznetsov nk 12 russian federation jane s aero engines specifications tu 85 1 see also references notes bibliography external links tu 85 by a n tupolev nato barge category 1950s soviet bomber aircraft tu category four engined tractor aircraft tu 85 category mid wing aircraft category aircraft first flown in 1951 category four engined piston aircraft
