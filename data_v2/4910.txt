please fans of gym class heroes background in early 2010 gym class heroes vocalist travie mccoy announced that he would be pursuing a solo career he denied rumors that gym class heroes had broken up asserting that since inception of gym class in 1997 every member has had another musical outlet if not three or four this is just another one of those mccoy began writing new material while gym class was on road promoting quilt 2008 he had originally prepared to record an introspective album of sad and somber acoustic songs reflective of his state of mind following his breakup with katy perry and his addiction to painkillers however he decided to scrap his early material and start over calling it too personal and saying i didn t want that to be my first look as a solo artist comparing album to kanye west s 808s heartbreak 2008 he relocated to miami florida to record new material and recover from his addiction which helped him to create a more upbeat album because he want ed to do something positive mccoy decided to officially call himself travie on album instead of travis he explained that he has been called travie by friends and family for as long as he can remember he believes that new name allows listeners to become that much closer to him and to feel much more comfortable with calling him travie and being part of family recording and production lazarus was released after being in works for a year and a half mccoy calls album longest i think i ve spent on a record in my whole career he wished to keep number of collaborations on album kinda tight but he plans to work with other artists on remixes of album producers on album include bruno mars t pain smeezingtons stereotypes lucas secon oligee and josh abraham mars t pain and cee lo green provide guest vocals lazarus is mainly influenced by hip hop although at same time his love for live instrumentation is still reflected on record billionaire album s first single was first song mccoy began work on after abandoning original material for album working on more uptempo music helped put him in a different headspace he also credits his really awesome friends and collaborators on album for helping him recover from his depressed state during recording process mccoy felt uncomfortable with his singing voice as he was more accustomed to rapping however t pain encouraged him to sing more on album and overcome his insecurities mccoy took a lot of time with track listing of album to make sure album was cohesive and felt like a ride he said of album s writing process with any project i just go in and blindly start writing songs and then find out which way we want to go with it this one took a bit longer to find lane despite album s long gestation period mccoy was able to write some of songs at a very rapid pace song after midnight was written recorded and mixed in less than a half an hour he began by recording himself humming song s melody and creating a constant loop that repeated throughout song and then recorded his verses over track mccoy also selected guest appearances for album quickly after writing individual parts of songs choosing artists he felt would work best with musical style he had in mind hook of dr feel good was written by bruno mars and upon hearing mars sing it mccoy decided that cee lo green would be a good candidate to sing hook as mccoy had idolized green since his teenage years after listening to him on song git up git out from outkast s debut album southernplayalisticadillacmuzik 1994 composition music with lazarus mccoy intended to create an album of mostly uptempo positive songs during his time in miami he was exposed to edm genres which influenced lazarus sound mccoy stated if you re looking for an introspective in depth look into my personal life or my deepest emotions this is definitely not record it s just a record you can put on turn up roll windows down and drive around to he intended to save more personal themes for gym class heroes subsequent release papercut chronicles ii 2011 album s opening track dr feel good which features cee lo green has been referred to as a top down summer anthem and features hip hop beats and funk inspired guitar riffs emily zemler of alternative press opined that superbad 11 34 sounds like t pain covering linkin park song was inspired by an inside joke between mccoy and a friend which involved superstition that looking at a digital clock at 11 34 is bad luck as it reads hell upside down he added to me it s really anthemic and it s a confidence booster as well when you listen to this song it gets you prepared to do anything billionaire album s lead single displays reggae influences gregory heaney of allmusic compared song to sublime need you has been described as an r b tinged pop rocker comparable to work of justin timberlake mccoy noted contrast between song s subject matter and musical style as song touches upon failed relationships in an uptempo manner and explodes as it reaches chorus in same vein of need you mccoy described critical featuring tim william as really personal introspective subject matter put into an upbeat pop song it s kind of like a rock song but at same time it has this really shimmery cute vibe to it akidagain features a children s choir and samples ahmad s back in day we ll be alright which mccoy refers to as a party anthem samples alright by supergrass he described album s closer don t pretend as probably most personal song on album during recording of song he suffered from allergies and had difficulty breathing which added to emotional vibe of song lyrics thumb left upright bruno mars wrote lyrics to billionaire while producing an album for sugababes in london mccoy drew from various lyrical inspirations on album subject matter often deals with topics such as partying personal insecurities and overcoming grief mccoy explained that opening song dr feel good is about escapism through music and that it expresses how he felt about recovering from drug addiction and depression superbad 11 34 is about mccoy s experiences on road considering song to be his theme song bruno mars came up with lyrical concept for during a trip to london in which he was given ps250 350 by his record label to spend for 11 days he found amount of money to be insufficient and explained we were like is this biggest mistake we ve ever made we thought we were broke in california what are we going to do here so we ve got no money and i m walking streets and came up with i wanna be a billionaire so frickin bad with song mccoy intended to avoid superficial lyrics in wake of an economic recession and added there s something to sing about here if i was in position to have a ridiculous amount of money would i be selfish or selfless i just took that concept and ran with it need you describes a situation in which a person wants to start a new relationship but still needs time to heal critical is an apocalyptic themed song inspired by natural disasters such as hurricane katrina mccoy explained that song discusses these subjects in a tongue in cheek way basically if world was to end tonight fuck it lets have a beer and watch it all go down akidagain is reflective of mccoy s childhood and pop culture shifts that influenced his life featuring three verses in first verse he discusses his early childhood second verse is about his teenage years and final verse meditates on his life as an adult we ll be alright shares lyrical themes with michael jackson s off wall mccoy says that song is about not caring about what people think and just ignoring your insecurities mccoy was given idea for manual after reading music blogs that were critical of his music he explained it s so easy to get online and lose all your inhibitions and complain and nag about what s wrong with music but if you re going to do that offer some way to change things or make music a lot of people aren t even artists title of manual is asking if there is a manual out there on how to do things right way then please show it to me and i ll read it five times over after midnight was inspired by movie gremlins and idea that seeing gremlins after midnight means trouble packaging and title mccoy chose name for album which is also his middle name after his experiences in charity work in hiv awareness in south africa india and philippines in summer of 2009 that really changed his outlook on life lazarus of bethany is subject of a miracle in new testament of bible in which jesus restores him back to life after being dead for four days mccoy said of name i never really thought about how synonymous it was with biblical reference with fact that my middle name is lazarus i feel like i ve been dead and resurrected on many occasions i went public with a lot of dark things that people usually keep in closet like drug addiction and what not album was originally titled lazarus project but name had to be changed due to 2008 drama film of same name album s artwork designed by brent rollins and alex r kirzhner features a recurring theme of clouds and city skylines amber mcdonald of daily loaf felt that artwork accurately portrayed album s key themes this convincingly fun record is filled with lyrical introspection and in spite of all its hip hop pop hook pay it forward ness there are gray clouds that work to keep mood of album realistic and relatable to worlds of listeners after all album cover art is of a gray backdrop with clouds not sunshine and blue skies thumb 260px mccoy performing on march 18 2011 in montreal as part as sgt

night party gems and referred to manual as album s true keeper and praised song s introspective lyrics melanie bertoldi of billboard agreed with shriver about manual and praised album s relatable themes further commenting that 10 track album s inclusion of reggae influenced beats and dance jams may polarize listeners but its snappy wordplay and deep introspection will appeal to a wide demographic of music lovers emily zemler of alternative press awarded album four out of five stars and deemed mccoy s singing to be most engaging thing about album not only are tracks incredibly catchy but mccoy belts out his choruses like he s just discovered his voice nathan slavik of djbooth com called lazarus a smile inducing high quality hip pop album from a distinctly creative and original voice praising record s uptempo yet dark songs entertainment weekly s brad wete gave album a b and commended mccoy for keeping with gym class s hip hop rock style calling album a summery set that serves as a nice break from class drew beringer of absolutepunk enjoyed album s upbeat songs and noted a departure from mccoy s earlier work commenting full of summer time jams it s hard to imagine this is same guy who rapped about desolate times and experiences in his band s second album papercut chronicles 2005 this is not a world beater by any means but it shows some growth in mccoy as an artist and lets him get out his ideas before recording and releasing next gym class heroes album however not all reviews were positive jon dolan of rolling stone gave album 2 1 2 out of 5 stars calling his crooning style rapping more unctuous than charming blare magazine criticized over abundance of guest appearances and likened album to a newborn child forced out of a hip hop womb by 13 different fathers while opining that mccoy still demonstrates musical potential mike diver of bbc was highly critical of disc noting that mccoy employs too many disparate styles for lazarus to hold any attention for more than a fleeting period although diver praised cee lo green s spotlight stealing contribution to dr feel good he referred to we ll be alright as repulsive and reggae stylings of billionaire as horribly dated andy gill of independent felt that although disc had songs with potential to be hits such as dr feelgood and we ll be alright remainder of songs expose mccoy s shortcomings and album is unlikely to make him a household name commercial performance on week of june 26 2010 lazarus debuted at number 25 on us billboard 200 chart with sales of 15 000 copies in its
