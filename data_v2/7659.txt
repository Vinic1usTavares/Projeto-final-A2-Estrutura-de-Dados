in december 1166 probably on 27th and was buried in lincoln cathedral historical background after king henry i s death in 1135 succession was disputed as king s only legitimate son william had died in 1120 main contenders were king s daughter matilda dowager empress of holy roman empire and his nephews stephen count of boulogne and theobald ii count of champagne after matilda was widowed in 1125 she returned to her father in england who then secured her marriage to geoffrey count of anjou all magnates of england and normandy were required to declare fealty to matilda as henry s heir but after henry i s death in 1135 stephen rushed to england and had himself crowned before theobald or matilda could react norman barons accepted stephen as duke of normandy and theobald contented himself with his possessions in france but matilda was less patient she secured support of king of scotland david i her maternal uncle and support of her half brother robert earl of gloucester an illegitimate son of henry i in 1138 huscroft ruling england pp 71 73 stephen was initially secure on his throne but by 1139 stresses had appeared david i invaded england in 1138 and some of english nobles rebelled but stephen had dealt with both threats by april 1139 later that year he arrested roger bishop of salisbury and his nephews nigel bishop of ely and alexander bishop of lincoln who were not only powerful ecclesiastics but important royal administrators in september 1139 matilda landed in england to contest throne supported by her half brother robert stephen himself was captured in february 1141 by matilda s forces but robert s subsequent capture by forces loyal to stephen later that year allowed his exchange for stephen in november 1141 result was an effective stalemate with stephen controlling parts of country and others under control of matilda s supporters during 1140s matilda s husband geoffrey of anjou wrested normandy from stephen huscroft ruling england pp 73 75 early life chesney s

steward to earl of huntingdon agnes and robert were probably parents of gilbert foliot later bishop of hereford and bishop of london although it is a surmise that foliot s mother was a sibling of chesney it is certain that chesney was gilbert s uncle barrow fasti ecclesiae anglicanae 1066 1300 volume 8 hereford bishops of hereford chesney probably attended schools in either oxford or paris as

consecrated by theobald of bec at canterbury cathedral on 19 december day after his ordination as a priest gilbert foliot s letters provide some background to chesney s election showing that king stephen of england and stephen s brother henry of blois bishop of winchester attempted to secure lincoln for one of their relatives royal candidates were abbots of fecamp westminster and st benet s of hulme they were rejected by pope eugene iii paving way for chapter to elect chesney foliot relates that electors from chapter travelled to london where they proceeded to elect chesney in front of foliot theobald and some other bishops that account is contradicted by chesney s profession of obedience to theobald which claims that election took place on 13 december 1148 at westminster henry of huntingdon and ralph de diceto both medieval chroniclers approved of election and mentioned unanimous nature of chesney s selection saltman theobald pp 106 107 that chesney s brother william was a firm supporter of stephen s probably helped reconcile stephen and his brother to chesney s election chesney returned to lincoln on 6 january 1149 where he received a letter from arnulf bishop of lisieux in normandy congratulating him on his appointment arnulf also asked chesney to help cause of henry fitzempress empress matilda s eldest son and a contender for english throne chibnall empress

law saltman theobald p 175 and footnote 6 some of archbishop theobald s letters written to chesney and recorded in john of salisbury s collection of letters contain earliest recorded quotations from gratian s decretum in an english source they were part of a letter sent by theobald to chesney discussing difficult legal cases and giving advice on how to resolve them saltman theobald p 177 shortly after his consecration chesney was presented with a copy of newly updated version of henry of huntingdon s historia anglorum huntingdon had been a fellow archdeacon matthew king stephen pp 128 129

when stephen died next year this became a lasting peace in last year of stephen s reign in mid 1154 chesney acquired right to operate a mint in town of newark granted in perpetuity but as there are no surviving coins it seems that mint was not in operation for long chesney also acquired right of justice in city of lincoln king king stephen p 297 and was involved in commercial life of his diocese

from him by repeatedly charging his wife with adultery and fining her dean s actions were contrary to a royal decree but although he appeared before a royal court he escaped secular penalties because he was a clerk result of case a precursor to later becket dispute aroused king henry s anger but death of king s brother geoffrey and king s subsequent travel to continent to deal with that issue meant that matter was eventually dropped saltman theobald pp 160 161 in 1161 chesney became embroiled in a dispute with st albans abbey resulting from his efforts to enforce his right as bishop to supervise religious houses within his diocese although pope alexander iii sent a papal bull to england ordering case to be heard by a panel of two bishops king henry ii felt that papal order infringed on his royal rights and had case decided at royal court instead saltman theobald p 159 in 1155 1156 st albans had secured papal privileges from english pope adrian iv who had previously been a monk there that exempted abbey from diocesan supervision and it was these privileges that chesney challenged chesney secured not only papal bull but a royal commission to investigate rights of abbey as they were in time of king henry i final disposition of case took place in 1163 at a royal council at westminster where abbey produced both papal privileges and a forged charter of offa of mercia in support of their case as chesney was unable to produce any documents in support of his own position king and council told bishop that they favoured abbey s cause king also ruled that abbey was a royal proprietary church and thus had special exemptions knowles monastic order pp 587 588 in end a compromise was reached whereby abbey compensated bishopric with some land in return for bishop renouncing his claims richardson and sayles governance of mediaeval england pp 292 293 early in 1162 chesney was summoned to normandy by king along with roger archbishop of york hugh de puiset bishop of durham

demonstrating how active he was in his diocese more than 240 of his acta have survived many of them concerning religious houses within his jurisdiction chesney was appointed a papal judge delegate at least once and it was in his court that case of philip de broy a canon in bedfordshire accused of murdering a knight was heard case was one of those that contributed to king henry s determination that clerks should be subject to royal justice not just ecclesiastical justice in addition to judicial affairs chesney worked to ensure good relations with his cathedral chapter and allowed them exemptions from episcopal jurisdiction he also permitted clergy of his diocese to remit payment of chrism money and forwent traditional annual payment from archdeacons of diocese to bishop he suppressed

monastic and religious orders pp 98 99 in 1161 he bought old temple in london as a house for himself these expenditures contributed to his financial difficulties along with royal demands which led to complaints about chesney s spending another cause for complaint was that he gave away some of his estates as marriage portions for his nieces chesney also was a benefactor to town of banbury to which he granted right to hold a fair some time before 1154 death and legacy thumb ruins of bishop s palace in lincoln which chesney helped construct exact date of chesney s death is uncertain it may have

not a man of strong character or decided opinions chesney left at least ten books to lincoln cathedral of which seven survive five of seven show a uniformity of handwriting leading to speculation that there may have been a scriptorium at lincoln cathedral during chesney s tenure but other surviving books that were in cathedral library at same time do not share any handwriting or other characteristics chesney may simply have commissioned books at same time from same scribes catalogue of manuscripts p xv in addition to foliot brothers gerard a canon of lincoln and martin treasurer of lincoln were also chesney s nephews he may also have been related to fulk de chesney another canon at lincoln chesney helped to further career of richard barre who became a writer and a royal judge
