views were often contentious he promoted eugenics and alphabet reform and opposed vaccination and organised religion he courted unpopularity by denouncing both sides in first world war as equally

apologise to universe for my connection with such a body in years after 1906 election shaw felt that fabians needed fresh leadership and saw this in form of his fellow writer h g wells who had joined society in february 1903 wells s ideas for reform particularly his proposals for closer cooperation with independent labour party placed him at odds with society s old gang led by shaw according to cole wells had minimal capacity for putting his ideas across in public meetings against shaw s trained and practised virtuosity in shaw s view old gang did not extinguish mr wells he annihilated himself wells resigned from society in september 1908 shaw remained a member but left executive in april 1911 he later wondered whether old gang should have given way to wells some years earlier god

ponderously acted except for edith evans as lady shaw s largest scale theatrical work was back to methuselah written in 1918 20 and staged in 1922 weintraub describes it as shaw s attempt to fend off bottomless pit of an utterly discouraging pessimism this cycle of five interrelated plays depicts evolution and effects of longevity from garden of eden to year 31 920 ad critics found five plays strikingly uneven in quality and invention original run was brief and work has been revived infrequently shaw felt he had exhausted his remaining creative powers in huge span of this pentateuch he was now sixty seven and expected to write no more plays this mood was short lived in 1920 joan of arc was proclaimed a saint by pope benedict xv shaw had long found joan an interesting historical character and his view of her veered between half witted genius and someone of exceptional sanity he had considered writing a play about her in 1913 and canonisation prompted him to return to subject he wrote saint joan in middle months of 1923 and play was premiered on broadway in december it was enthusiastically received there and at its london premiere following march in weintraub s phrase even nobel prize committee could no longer ignore shaw after saint joan citation for literature prize for 1925 praised his work as marked by both idealism and humanity its stimulating satire often being infused with a singular poetic beauty he accepted award but rejected monetary prize that went with it on grounds that my readers and my audiences provide me with more than sufficient money for my

international statesmanship as against old foreign office diplomacy but thought that it had not yet become federation of world shaw returned to theatre with what he called a political extravaganza

june 1928 and first british production was two months later at sir barry jackson s inaugural malvern festival other eminent creative artist most closely associated with festival was sir edward elgar with whom shaw enjoyed a deep friendship and mutual regard he described apple cart to elgar as a scandalous burlesque of democratic politics with a brief but shocking sex interlude during 1920s shaw began to lose faith in idea that society could be changed through fabian gradualism and became increasingly fascinated with dictatorial methods in 1922 he had welcomed mussolini s accession to power in italy observing that amid indiscipline and muddle and parliamentary deadlock mussolini was right kind of tyrant shaw was prepared to tolerate certain dictatorial excesses weintraub in his odnb biographical sketch comments that shaw s flirtation with authoritarian inter war regimes took a long time to fade and beatrice webb thought he was obsessed about mussolini 1930s shaw s enthusiasm for soviet union dated to early 1920s when he had hailed lenin as one really interesting statesman in europe having turned down several chances to visit in 1931 he joined a party led by nancy astor

too fantastic no slander is too stale for employment by more reckless elements of british press shaw s admiration for mussolini and stalin demonstrated his growing belief that dictatorship was only viable political arrangement when nazi party came to power in germany in january 1933 shaw described hitler as a very remarkable man a very able man and professed himself proud to be only writer in england who was scrupulously polite and just to hitler his principal admiration was for stalin whose regime he championed uncritically throughout decade shaw saw 1939 molotov ribbentrop pact as a triumph for stalin who he said now had hitler under his thumb shaw s first play of decade was too true to be good written in 1931 and premiered in boston in february 1932 reception was unenthusiastic brooks atkinson of new york times commenting that shaw had yielded to impulse to write without having a subject judged play a rambling and indifferently tedious conversation correspondent of new york herald tribune said that most of play was discourse unbelievably long lectures and that although audience enjoyed play it was bewildered by it thumb shaw in 1936 aged 80 during decade shaw travelled widely and frequently most of his journeys were with charlotte she enjoyed voyages on ocean liners and he found peace to write during long spells at sea shaw met an enthusiastic welcome in south africa in 1932 despite his strong remarks about racial divisions of country in december 1932 couple embarked on a round world cruise in march 1933 they arrived at san francisco to begin shaw s first visit to us he had earlier refused to go to that awful country that uncivilized place unfit to govern itself illiberal superstitious crude violent anarchic and arbitrary he visited hollywood with

enthusiastic about cinema and in middle of decade wrote screenplays for prospective film versions of pygmalion and saint joan latter was never made but shaw entrusted rights to former to unknown gabriel pascal who produced it at pinewood studios in 1938 shaw was determined that hollywood should have nothing to do with film but was powerless to prevent it from winning one academy award oscar he described his award for best written screenplay as an insult coming from such a source he became first person to have been awarded both a nobel prize and an oscar in a 1993 study of oscars anthony holden observes that pygmalion was soon spoken of as having lifted movie making from illiteracy to literacy shaw s final plays of 1930s were cymbeline refinished 1936 geneva 1936 and in good king charles s golden days 1939 first a fantasy reworking of shakespeare made little impression but second a satire on european dictators attracted more notice much of it unfavourable in particular shaw s parody of hitler as herr battler was considered mild almost sympathetic third play an historical conversation piece first seen at malvern ran briefly in london in may 1940 james agate commented that play contained nothing to which even most conservative audiences could take exception and though it was long and lacking in dramatic action only witless and idle theatregoers would object after their first runs none of three plays were seen again in west end during shaw s lifetime towards end of decade both shaws began to suffer ill health charlotte was increasingly incapacitated by paget s disease of bone and he developed pernicious anaemia his treatment involving injections of concentrated animal liver was successful but this breach of his vegetarian creed distressed him and brought down condemnation from militant vegetarians second world war and final years although shaw s works since apple cart had been received without great enthusiasm his earlier plays were revived in west

play and he concentrated on prolific journalism a second shaw film produced by pascal major barbara 1941 was less successful both artistically and commercially than pygmalion partly because of pascal

war over and demanded a peace conference nevertheless when he became convinced that a negotiated peace was impossible he publicly urged neutral united states to join fight london blitz of 1940 41 led

play for children became a study of nature of religion and how to put christian precepts into practice pygmalion 1912 is a shavian study of language and speech and their importance in society and in

although two works differ greatly in their themes first presents politics of a nation with a brief royal love scene as an interlude and second in judith evans s words is concerned with social mores of

political comedy with a clear plot was followed by an introspective drama first play portrays a british prime minister considering but finally rejecting establishment of a dictatorship second is

feebleness of league of nations compared with dictators of europe in good king charles s golden days 1939 described by weintraub as a warm discursive high comedy also depicts authoritarianism but less satirically than geneva as in earlier decades shorter plays were generally comedies some historical and others addressing various political and social preoccupations of author ervine writes of shaw s later work that although it was still astonishingly vigorous and vivacious it showed unmistakable signs of his age best of his work in this period however was full of wisdom and beauty of mind often displayed by old men who keep their wits about them music and drama reviews music shaw s collected musical criticism published in three volumes runs to more than 2 700 pages it covers british musical scene from 1876 to 1950 but core of collection dates from his six years as music critic of star and world in late 1880s and early 1890s in his view music criticism should be interesting to everyone rather than just musical elite and he wrote for non specialist avoiding technical jargon mesopotamian words like dominant of d major he was fiercely partisan in his columns promoting music of wagner and decrying that of brahms and those british composers such as stanford and parry whom he saw as brahmsian he campaigned against prevailing fashion for performances of handel oratorios with huge amateur choirs and inflated orchestration calling for a chorus of twenty capable artists he railed against opera productions unrealistically staged or sung in languages audience did not speak drama in shaw s view london theatres of 1890s presented too many revivals of old plays and not enough new work he campaigned against melodrama sentimentality stereotypes and worn out conventions as a music critic he had frequently been able to concentrate on analysing new works but in theatre he was often obliged to fall back on discussing how various performers tackled well known plays in a study of shaw s work as a theatre critic e j west writes that shaw ceaselessly compared and contrasted artists in interpretation and in technique shaw contributed more than 150 articles as theatre critic for saturday review in which he assessed more than 212 productions he championed ibsen s plays when many theatregoers regarded them as outrageous and his 1891 book quintessence of ibsenism remained a classic throughout twentieth century of contemporary dramatists writing for west end stage he rated oscar wilde above rest our only thorough playwright he plays with everything with wit with philosophy with drama with actors and audience with whole theatre shaw s collected criticisms were published as our theatres in nineties in 1932 shaw maintained a provocative and frequently self contradictory attitude to shakespeare whose name he insisted on spelling shakespear many found him difficult to take seriously on subject duff cooper observed that by attacking shakespeare it is shaw who appears a ridiculous pigmy shaking his fist at a mountain shaw was nevertheless a knowledgeable shakespearian and in an article in which he wrote with single exception of homer there is no eminent writer not even sir walter scott whom i can despise so entirely as i despise shakespear when i measure my mind against his he also said but i am bound to add that i pity man who cannot enjoy shakespear he has outlasted thousands of abler thinkers and will outlast a thousand more shaw had two regular targets for his more extreme comments about shakespeare and actors and directors who presented insensitively cut texts in over elaborate productions he was continually drawn back to shakespeare and wrote three plays with shakespearean themes dark lady of sonnets cymbeline refinished and shakes versus shav in a 2001 analysis of shaw s shakespearian criticisms robert pierce concludes that shaw who was no academic saw shakespeare s plays like all theatre from an author s practical point of view shaw helps us to get away from romantics picture of shakespeare as a titanic genius one whose art cannot be analyzed or connected with mundane considerations of theatrical conditions and profit and loss or with a specific staging and cast of actors political and social writings shaw s political and social commentaries were published variously in fabian tracts in essays in two full length books in innumerable newspaper and journal articles and in prefaces to his plays majority of shaw s fabian tracts were published anonymously representing voice of society rather than of shaw although society s secretary edward pease later confirmed shaw s authorship according to holroyd business of early fabians mainly under influence of shaw was to alter history by rewriting it shaw s talent as a pamphleteer was put to immediate use in production of society s manifesto after which says holroyd he was never again so succinct thumb shaw speaking in 1930s about what to do with unproductive after turn of twentieth century shaw increasingly propagated his ideas through medium of his plays an early critic writing in 1904 observed that shaw s dramas provided a pleasant means of proselytising his socialism adding that mr shaw s views are to be sought especially in prefaces to his plays after loosening his ties with fabian movement in 1911 shaw s writings were more personal and often provocative his response to furore following issue of common sense about war in 1914 was to prepare a sequel more common sense about war in this he denounced pacifist line espoused by ramsay macdonald and other socialist leaders and proclaimed his readiness to shoot all pacifists rather than cede them power and influence on advice of beatrice webb this pamphlet remained unpublished intelligent woman s guide shaw s main political treatise of 1920s attracted both admiration and criticism macdonald considered it world s most important book since bible harold laski thought its arguments outdated and lacking in concern for individual freedoms shaw s increasing flirtation with dictatorial methods is evident in many of his subsequent pronouncements a new york times report dated 10 december 1933 quoted a recent fabian society lecture in which shaw had praised hitler mussolini and stalin t hey are trying to get something done and are adopting methods by which it is possible to get something done as late as second world war in everybody s political what s what shaw blamed allies abuse of their 1918 victory for rise of hitler and hoped that after defeat fuhrer would escape retribution to enjoy a comfortable retirement in ireland or some other neutral country these sentiments according to irish philosopher poet thomas duddy rendered much of shavian outlook passe and contemptible creative evolution shaw s version of new science of eugenics became an increasing theme in his political writing after 1900 he introduced his theories in revolutionist s handbook 1903 an appendix to man and superman and developed them further during 1920s in back to methuselah a 1946 life magazine article observed that shaw had always tended to look at people more as a biologist than as an artist by 1933 in preface to on rocks he was writing that if we desire a certain type of civilization and culture we must exterminate sort of people who do not fit into it critical opinion is divided on whether this was intended as irony in an article in american magazine liberty in september 1938 shaw included statement there are many people in world who ought to be liquidated many commentators assumed that such comments were intended as a joke although in worst possible taste otherwise life magazine concluded this silliness can be classed with his more innocent bad guesses fiction shaw s fiction writing was largely confined to five unsuccessful novels written in period 1879 1885 immaturity 1879 is a semi autobiographical portrayal of mid victorian england shaw s own david copperfield according to weintraub irrational knot 1880 is a critique of conventional marriage in which weintraub finds characterisations lifeless hardly more than animated theories shaw was pleased with his third novel love among artists 1881 feeling that it marked a turning point in his development as a thinker although he had no more success with it than with its predecessors cashel byron s profession 1882 is says weintraub an indictment of society which anticipates shaw s first full length play mrs warren s profession shaw later explained that he had intended an unsocial socialist as first section of a monumental depiction of downfall of capitalism gareth griffith in a study of shaw s political thought sees novel as an interesting record of conditions both in society at large and in nascent socialist movement of 1880s shaw s only subsequent fiction of any substance was his 1932 novella adventures of black girl in her search for god written during a visit to south africa in 1932 eponymous girl intelligent inquisitive and converted to christianity by insubstantial missionary teaching sets out to find god on a journey that after many adventures and encounters leads her to a secular conclusion story on publication offended some christians and was banned in ireland by board of censors letters and diaries thumb alt caricature of middle aged bearded man at his

letters of which about ten per cent have survived 2 653 letters are printed in laurence s four volumes among shaw s many regular correspondents were his childhood friend edward mcnulty his theatrical colleagues and amities mrs patrick campbell and ellen terry writers including lord alfred douglas h g wells and g k chesterton boxer gene tunney nun laurentia mclachlan and art expert sydney cockerell in 2007 a 316 page volume consisting entirely of shaw s letters to times was published shaw s diaries for 1885 1897 edited by weintraub were published in two volumes with a total of 1 241 pages in 1986 reviewing them shaw scholar fred crawford wrote although primary interest for is material that supplements what we already know about shaw s life and work diaries are also valuable as a historical and sociological document of english life at end of victorian age after 1897 pressure of other writing led shaw to give up keeping a diary miscellaneous and autobiographical through his journalism pamphlets and occasional longer works shaw wrote on many subjects his range of interest and enquiry included vivisection vegetarianism religion language cinema and photography on all of which he wrote and spoke copiously collections of his writings on these and other subjects were published mainly after his death together with volumes of wit and wisdom and general journalism despite many books written about him holroyd counts 80 by 1939 shaw s autobiographical output apart from his diaries was relatively slight he gave interviews to newspapers gbs confesses to daily mail in 1904 is an example and provided sketches to would be biographers whose work was rejected by shaw and never published in 1939 shaw drew on these materials to produce shaw gives himself away a miscellany which a year before his death he revised and republished as sixteen self sketches there were seventeen he made it clear to his publishers that this slim book was in no sense a full autobiography beliefs and opinions throughout his lifetime shaw professed many beliefs often contradictory this inconsistency was partly an intentional provocation spanish scholar statesman salvador de describes shaw as a pole of negative electricity set in a people of positive electricity in one area at least shaw was constant in his lifelong refusal to follow normal english forms of spelling and punctuation he favoured archaic spellings such as shew for show he dropped u in words like honour and favour and wherever possible he rejected apostrophe in contractions such as won t or that s in his will shaw ordered that after some specified legacies his remaining assets were to form a trust to pay for fundamental reform of english alphabet into a phonetic version of forty letters though shaw s intentions were clear his drafting was flawed and courts initially ruled intended trust void a later out of court agreement provided a sum of ps8 300 for spelling reform bulk of his fortune went to residuary legatees british museum royal academy of dramatic art and national gallery of ireland most of ps8 300 went on a special phonetic edition of androcles and lion in shavian alphabet published in 1962 to a largely indifferent reception thumb upright alt middle aged man with bushy beard shaw in 1905 shaw s views on religion and christianity were less consistent having in his youth proclaimed himself an atheist in middle age he explained this as a reaction against old testament image of a vengeful jehovah by early twentieth century he termed himself a mystic although gary sloan in an essay on shaw s beliefs disputes his credentials as such in 1913 shaw declared that he was not religious in sectarian sense aligning himself with jesus as a person of no religion in preface 1915 to androcles and lion shaw asks why not give christianity a chance contending that britain s social order resulted from continuing choice of over christ in a broadcast just before second world war shaw invoked sermon on mount a very moving exhortation and it gives you one first rate tip which is to do good to those who use you and persecute you in his will shaw stated that his religious convictions and scientific views cannot at present be more specifically defined than as those of a believer in creative revolution he requested that no one should imply that he accepted beliefs of any specific religious organisation and that no memorial to him should take form of a cross or any other instrument of torture or symbol of blood sacrifice shaw espoused racial equality and inter marriage between people of different races despite his expressed wish to be fair to hitler he called anti semitism hatred of lazy ignorant fat headed gentile for jew who schooled by adversity to use his brains to utmost outdoes him in business in jewish chronicle he wrote in 1932 in every country you can find rabid people who have a phobia against jews jesuits armenians negroes freemasons irishmen or simply foreigners as such political parties are not above exploiting these fears and jealousies in 1903 shaw joined in a controversy about vaccination against smallpox he called vaccination a peculiarly filthy piece of witchcraft in his view immunisation campaigns were a cheap and inadequate substitute for a decent programme of housing for poor which would he declared be means of eradicating smallpox and other infectious diseases less contentiously shaw was keenly interested in transport laurence observed in 1992 a need for a published study of shaw s interest in bicycling motorbikes automobiles and planes climaxing in his joining interplanetary society in his nineties shaw published articles on travel took photographs of his journeys and submitted notes to royal automobile club shaw strove throughout his adult life to be referred to as bernard shaw rather than george bernard shaw but confused matters by continuing to use his full initials g b s as a by line and often signed himself g bernard shaw he left instructions in his will that his executor public trustee was to license publication of his works only under name bernard shaw shaw scholars including ervine judith evans holroyd laurence and weintraub and many publishers have respected shaw s preference although cambridge university press was among exceptions with its 1988 cambridge companion to george bernard shaw legacy and influence theatrical shaw did not found a school of dramatists as such but crawford asserts that today we recognise him as second only to shakespeare in british theatrical tradition proponent of theater of ideas who struck a death blow to 19th century melodrama according to laurence shaw pioneered intelligent theatre in which audience was required to think thereby paving way for new breeds of twentieth century playwrights from galsworthy to pinter crawford lists numerous playwrights whose work owes something to that of shaw among those active in shaw s lifetime he includes noel coward who based his early comedy young idea on you never can tell and continued to draw on older man s works in later plays t s eliot by no means an admirer of shaw admitted that epilogue of murder in cathedral in which becket s slayers explain their actions to audience might have been influenced by saint joan critic eric bentley comments that eliot s later play confidential clerk had all earmarks of without merits

contemporaries alan ayckbourn henry livings and peter nichols thumb left shaw s complete plays shaw s influence crossed atlantic at an early stage bernard dukore notes that he was successful as a dramatist in america ten years before achieving comparable success in britain among many american writers professing a direct debt to shaw eugene o neill became an admirer at age of seventeen after reading quintessence of ibsenism other shaw influenced american playwrights mentioned by dukore are elmer rice for whom shaw opened doors turned on lights and expanded horizons william saroyan who empathised with shaw as embattled individualist against philistines and s n behrman who was inspired to write for theatre after attending a performance of caesar and cleopatra i thought it would be agreeable to write plays like that assessing shaw s reputation in a 1976 critical study t f evans described shaw as unchallenged in his lifetime and since as leading english language dramatist of twentieth century and as a master of prose style following year in a contrary assessment playwright john osborne castigated guardians theatre critic michael billington for referring to shaw as greatest british dramatist since shakespeare osborne responded that shaw is most fraudulent inept writer of victorian melodramas ever to gull a timid critic or fool a dull public despite this hostility crawford sees influence of shaw in some of osborne s plays and concludes that though latter s work is neither imitative nor derivative these affinities are sufficient to classify osborne as an inheritor of shaw in a 1983 study r j kaufmann suggests that shaw was a key forerunner godfather if not actually finicky paterfamilias of theatre of absurd two further aspects of shaw s theatrical legacy are noted by crawford his opposition to stage censorship which was finally ended in 1968 and his efforts which extended over many years to establish a national theatre shaw s short 1910 play dark lady of sonnets in which shakespeare pleads with queen elizabeth i for endowment of a state theatre was part of this campaign writing in new statesman in 2012 daniel janes commented that shaw s reputation had declined by time of his 150th anniversary in 2006 but had recovered considerably in janes s view many current revivals of shaw s major works showed playwright s almost unlimited relevance to our times in same year mark lawson wrote in guardian that shaw s moral concerns engaged present day audiences and made him like his model ibsen one of most popular playwrights in

severn suite 1930 substance of shaw s political legacy is uncertain in 1921 shaw s erstwhile collaborator william archer in a letter to playwright wrote i doubt if there is any case of a man so widely
