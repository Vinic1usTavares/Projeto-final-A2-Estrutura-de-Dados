work background and composition initially song everyone s at it was announced to be released as lead single from album but it was ultimately decided on fear while discussing it s not me it s you allen stated that her intention was to make bigger sounding more ethereal songs real songs i think i ve grown up a bit as a person and i hope it reflects that she released a demo version of song which was then called i don t know onto her myspace account along with another song i could say in april 2008 singer declared about inspiration for song which has to do with materialism and pressures of being rich and famous i ll tell you where inspiration for it came from i was walking down this street in this village in middle of countryside in u k and there was this little girl who must have been eight or nine walking down street with her mum in like high waisted hot pants and a little crop top and i just thought that s not really right and i could tell she was kind of girl that would be trying out for pop idol in five years time and wants to be famous when she grows up and there s definitely whole culture of that where i come from and it s not necessarily a culture that i think is particularly healthy but at same time i m very aware that i am a part of that culture but it s not something that i feel particularly comfortable with musically allen adopts a more mature electropop groove for song which has been described to have a pulsing sleekly modern electro dance backing while coming through a flood of soft synths and being eminently danceable and slightly trancey it is set in common time and in key of f major and has a metronome of 134 beats per minute allen s voice spans from f3 to a4 lyrically song is a satire of materialism sung in voice of a would be starlet and tackles societal consumerism and overnight fame hunting it also makes reference through line i ll look at sun and i ll look in mirror at daily british tabloid national newspapers sun and daily mirror which often report on allen synthesiser parts were written by greg kurstin using apple s logic studio using its built in instruments critical reception thumb upright left kurstin produced and co wrote song with allen michael menachem from billboard commented on song saying it packs another lyrical punch while complimenting allen s vocals lucy davies of bbc described song as e danceable and slightly trancey neil mccormick from daily telegraph suggested that song confirms that singer s pithy observational skills and sweet musicality remain intact as she has been a bit bruised by her encounter with 21st century fame clash reporter natasha arico concluded that fear is somewhat trite though sickeningly catchy and dance friendly while rolling stone magazine failed to detect song s sarcasm and criticised song for being a cliche delivered by allen with sneer james montgomery of mtv gave a good review saying it is a relatively scathing indictment of today s glossy celeb culture ryan dombal from pitchfork media described song to have a part admission part brag part apocalyptic vision and suggested that for almost any other artist lines would be barbed sarcastic and ultimately uppity and bland indictments but not for loudmouth allen other reviews were also positive sal cinquemani from slant magazine suggested that fear is proof of pop singer s self awareness but given her own personal tabloid history song possesses a trail of irony i ll look at sun and i ll look in mirror i m on right track yeah we re onto a winner leah greenblatt of entertainment weekly liked song in which allen makes fun of her own material girl id and went on to say that it is in fact a tale of two naughty in rearview mirror and fully realized female coming around bend chris buckle from skinny gave fear three stars commenting that it is a potent reminder that she s more than just gobby gossip fodder but also disliked a few lyrics which in particular are a clumsy attempt to inject politics amongst celeb woe naval gazing while about com praised song for being a pop masterpiece allen s witty intelligent lyrics and compared it to pink s stupid girls commercial performance fear debuted at number 168 on uk singles chart on 25 january 2009 for week ending dated 31 january 2009 following week song climbed 167 places to top of chart thwarting lady gaga s just dance from summit gaga commented on this saying i m very familiar with lily s music and good job lily for knocking me off there always deserves to be a female on top and i don t want to be only one to do it i think generally that pop music is making an enormous comeback and i m actually very pleased with lily allen s new record as it s decidedly pop song managed to remain on top for four weeks throughout whole of february until it was dethroned by kelly clarkson s my life would suck without you it thus earned allen s second chart topper since her debut single smile achieved feat in july 2006 fear also became single which spent

from it as she exits her clothes are revealed to be a smock dress with a big bow and high heels upon returning through caravan door interior changes to that of a luxurious mansion in reality an english country estate chorus starts and she walks down hall surrounded by butlers all making synchronised moves and starting a choreography with allen afterwards she climbs stairs and camera cuts to next scene where she is sitting down in front of mirror in an extravagant bedroom with dresses lamps toys and cupcakes scene changes once again with allen walking into a room with giant brightly coloured presents they suddenly stand up having two human legs and begin to spin around with singer joining them after descending stairs and walking through same hall she entered she exits estate and video takes down a darker more serious tone while verse forget about guns and forget ammunition cause i m killing them all on my own little mission now i m not a saint but i m not a sinner now everything is cool as long as i m getting thinner is sung euphoric visual effects appear once again soon after as chorus takes place allen walks down estate stairs being surrounded by dancing balloons hopping butlers and coloured fog camera zooms out showing estate tied in a giant ribbon but also grey melancholic clouds which contrast cheerful party from before allen stated that she hoped music video would convey parts of song s sarcasm video reportedly cost ps50 000 during shoot video was documented by mtv in interview allen declared i wanted to do a dance routine even though i m not really doing a dance routine other people are doing it but i m part of it i think people are quite used to girls in this industry really being able to move in front of camera but i m just rubbish at that kind of thing i find it quite nerve racking performing actually because when you write songs you don t really think about performing in a video i think it s quite fun lots of colour and dancing and it s about doing something that s in keeping with song actually live performances while being invited to bbc show hosted by scott mills allen talked about her struggles with paparazzi and also premiered
