son theo dies as tomorrow approaches and kee tries to wake him to see that they ve been saved as credits roll sound of children laughing and playing can be heard in background possibly implying that fertility crisis was solved thanks to kee cast clive owen as theo faron a former activist who was devastated when his child died during a flu pandemic theo is archetypal everyman who reluctantly becomes a saviour cast in april 2005 owen spent several weeks collaborating with cuaron and sexton on his role impressed by owen s creative insights cuaron and sexton brought him on board as a writer clive was a big help cuaron told variety i would send a group of scenes to him and then i would hear his feedback and instincts julianne moore as julian taylor for julian cuaron wanted an actor who had credibility of leadership intelligence and independence moore was cast in june 2005 initially to play first woman to become pregnant in 20 years she is just so much fun to work with cuaron told cinematical she is just pulling rug out from under your feet all time you don t know where to stand because she is going to make fun of you clare hope ashitey as kee an illegal immigrant and first pregnant woman in eighteen years she did not appear in book and was written into film based on cuaron s interest in recent single origin hypothesis of human origins and status of dispossessed people fact that this child will be child of an african woman has to do with fact that humanity started in africa we re putting future of humanity in hands of dispossessed and creating a new humanity to spring out of that michael caine as jasper palmer theo s dealer and friend caine based jasper on his experiences with friend john first time he had portrayed a character who would pass wind or smoke cannabis cuaron explains once he had clothes and so on and stepped in front of mirror to look at himself his body language started changing michael loved it he believed he was this guy michael phillips of chicago tribune notices an apparent homage to schwartz in orson welles film noir touch of evil 1958 jasper calls theo amigo just as schwartz referred to ramon miguel vargas jasper s cartoons seen in his house were provided by steve bell chiwetel ejiofor as luke charlie hunnam as patric pam ferris as miriam peter mullan as syd danny huston as nigel theo s cousin and a high ranking government official nigel runs a ministry of arts programme ark of arts which rescues works of art such as michelangelo s david albeit with a broken leg pablo picasso s guernica and banksy s british cops kissing he mentions that he tried to save michelangelo s pieta but a mob destroyed it before he could oana as marichka paul sharma as ian jacek as tomasz themes hope and faith children of men explores themes of hope and faith in face of overwhelming futility and despair film s source p d james novel children of men 1992 describes what happens when society is unable to reproduce using male infertility to explain this problem in novel it is made clear that hope depends on future generations james writes it was reasonable to struggle to suffer perhaps even to die for a more just a more compassionate society but not in a world with no future where all too soon very words justice compassion society struggle evil would be unheard echoes on an empty air film switches infertility from male to female but never explains its cause environmental destruction and divine punishment are considered this unanswered question and others in film have been attributed to cuaron s dislike for expository film there s a kind of cinema i detest which is a cinema that is about exposition and explanations it s become now what i call a medium for lazy readers cinema is a hostage of narrative and i m very good at narrative as a hostage of cinema cuaron s disdain for back story and exposition led him to use concept of female infertility as a metaphor for fading sense of hope almost mythical human project is turned into a metaphor for possibility of evolution of human spirit evolution of human understanding without dictating how audience should feel by end of film cuaron encourages viewers to come to their own conclusions about sense of hope depicted in final scenes we wanted end to be a glimpse of a possibility of hope for audience to invest their own sense of hope into that ending so if you re a hopeful person you ll see a lot of hope and if you re a bleak person you ll see a complete hopelessness at end religion like virgil s aeneid dante s divine comedy and chaucer s canterbury tales crux of journey in children of men lies in what is uncovered along path rather than terminus itself theo s heroic journey to south coast mirrors his personal quest for self awareness a journey that takes him from despair to hope according to cuaron title of p d james book children of men is an allegory derived from a passage of scripture in bible psalm 90 89 3 of kjv thou man to destruction and return ye children of men james refers to her story as a christian fable while cuaron describes it as almost like a look at christianity i didn t want to shy away from spiritual archetypes cuaron told filmmaker magazine but i wasn t interested in dealing with dogma this divergence from original was criticised by some including anthony sacramone of first things who called film an act of vandalism noting irony of how cuaron had removed religion from p d james fable in which morally sterile nihilism is overcome by christianity film has been noted for its use of christian symbolism for example british terrorists named fishes protect rights of refugees opening on christmas day in united states critics compared characters of theo and kee with joseph and mary calling film a modern day nativity story kee s pregnancy is revealed to theo in a barn alluding to manger of nativity scene when theo asks kee who father of baby is she jokingly states she is a virgin and when other characters discover kee and her baby they respond with jesus christ or sign of cross also archangel gabriel among other religious figures is invoked in bus scene to highlight these spiritual themes cuaron commissioned a 15 minute piece by british composer john tavener a member of eastern orthodox church whose work resonates with themes of motherhood birth rebirth and redemption in eyes of god calling his score a musical and spiritual reaction to alfonso s film snippets of tavener s fragments of a prayer contain lyrics in latin german and sanskrit sung by mezzo soprano sarah connolly words like mata mother pahi mam protect me avatara saviour and alleluia appear throughout film in closing credits sanskrit words shantih shantih shantih appear as end titles writer and film critic laura eldred of university of north carolina at chapel hill observes that children of men is full of tidbits that call out to educated viewer during a visit to his house by theo and kee jasper says shanti shanti shanti eldred notes that shanti used in film is also found at end of an upanishad and in final line of t s eliot s poem waste land a work eldred describes as devoted to contemplating a world emptied of fertility a world on its last teetering legs shanti is also a common beginning and ending to all hindu prayers and means peace referencing invocation of divine intervention and rebirth through an end to violence contemporary references children of men takes an unconventional approach to modern action film using a documentary newsreel style film critics michael rowin jason guerrasio and ethan alter observe film s underlying touchstone of immigration alter notes that film makes a potent case against anti immigrant sentiment prevalent in modern societies like united kingdom and united states with guerrasio describing film as a complex meditation on politics of today for alter and other critics structural support and impetus for contemporary references rests upon visual nature of film s exposition occurring in form of imagery as opposed to conventional dialogue visually refugee camps in film intentionally evoke abu ghraib prison guantanamo bay detention camp and maze other popular images appear such as a sign over refugee camp reading homeland security similarity between hellish cinema verite stylized battle scenes of film and current news and documentary coverage of iraq war is noted by film critic manohla dargis describing cuaron s fictional landscapes as war zones of extraordinary plausibility in film refugees are hunted down like cockroaches rounded up and put into roofless cages open to elements and camps and even shot leading film critics like chris smith and claudia puig to observe symbolic overtones and images of holocaust this is reinforced in scene where an elderly refugee woman speaking german is seen detained in a cage and in scene where british homeland security strips and beats illegal immigrants a song by libertines arbeit macht frei plays in background visual allusions to nazi round ups are unnerving writes richard a blake it shows what people can become when government orchestrates their fears for its own advantage cuaron explains how he uses his imagery to cross reference fictional and futuristic events with real contemporary or historical incidents and beliefs production adaptation of p d james novel was originally written by paul chart and later rewritten by mark fergus and hawk ostby studio brought director alfonso cuaron on board in 2001 cuaron and screenwriter timothy j sexton began rewriting script after director completed y tu mama tambien afraid he would start second guessing things cuaron chose not to read p d james novel opting to have sexton read book while cuaron himself read an abridged version cuaron did not immediately begin production instead directing harry potter and prisoner of azkaban during this period david arata rewrote screenplay and delivered draft which secured clive owen and sent film into pre production director s work experience in united kingdom exposed him to social dynamics of british psyche giving him insight into depiction of british reality cuaron used film battle of algiers as a model for social reconstruction in preparation for production presenting film to clive owen as an example of his vision for children of men in order to create a philosophical and social framework for film director read literature by slavoj zizek as well as similar works film sunrise was also influential location a clockwork orange was one of inspirations for futuristic yet battered patina of 2027 london children of men was second film cuaron made in london with director portraying city using single wide shots while cuaron was preparing film london bombings occurred but director never considered moving production it would have been impossible to shoot anywhere but london because of very obvious way locations were incorporated into film cuaron told variety for example shot of fleet street looking towards st paul s would have been impossible to shoot anywhere else due to these circumstances opening terrorist attack scene on fleet street was shot a month and a half after london bombing cuaron chose to shoot some scenes in east london a location he considered a place without glamour set locations were dressed to make them appear even more run down cuaron says he told crew let s make it more mexican in other words we d look at a location and then say yes but in mexico there would be this and this it was about making place look run down it was about poverty he also made use of london s most popular sites shooting in locations like trafalgar square and battersea power station power station scene whose conversion into an art archive is a reference to tate modern has been compared to antonioni s red desert cuaron added a pig balloon to scene as homage to pink floyd s animals other art works visible in this scene include michelangelo s david picasso s guernica and banksy s british cops kissing london visual effects companies double negative and framestore worked directly with cuaron from script to post production developing effects and creating environments and shots that wouldn t otherwise be possible historic dockyard in chatham was used to film scene in empty activist safehouse style and design in most sci fi epics special effects substitute for story here they seamlessly advance it observes colin covert of star tribune billboards were designed to balance a contemporary and futuristic appearance as well as easily visualizing what else was occurring in rest of world at time and cars were made to resemble modern ones at first glance although a closer look made them seem unfamiliar cuaron informed art department that film was anti blade runner rejecting technologically advanced proposals and downplaying science fiction elements of 2027 setting director focused on images reflecting contemporary period single shot sequences children of men used several lengthy single shot sequences in which extremely complex actions take place longest of these are a shot in which kee gives birth 199 seconds 3 19 an ambush on a country road 247 seconds 4 07 and a scene in which theo is captured by fishes escapes and runs down a street and through a building in middle of a raging battle 378 seconds 6 18 these sequences were extremely difficult to film although effect of continuity is sometimes an illusion aided by cgi effects cuaron had experimented with long takes in great expectations y tu mama tambien and harry potter and prisoner of azkaban his style is influenced by swiss film jonah who will be 25 in year 2000 a favorite of cuaron s cuaron said i was studying cinema when i first saw jonah and interested in french new wave jonah was so compared to those films camera keeps a certain distance and there are relatively few close ups it s elegant and flowing constantly tracking but very slowly and not calling attention to itself creation of single shot sequences was a challenging time consuming process that sparked concerns from studio it took fourteen days to prepare for single shot in which clive owen s character searches a building under attack and five hours for every time they wanted to reshoot it in middle of one shot blood splattered onto lens and cinematographer emmanuel lubezki convinced director to leave it in according to owen right in thick of it are me and camera operator because we re doing this very complicated very specific dance which when we come to shoot we have to make feel completely random cuaron s initial idea for maintaining continuity during roadside ambush scene was dismissed by production experts as an impossible shot to do fresh from visual effects laden harry potter and prisoner of azkaban cuaron suggested using computer generated imagery to film scene lubezki refused to allow it reminding director that they had intended to make a film akin to a raw documentary instead a special camera rig invented by gary of systems was employed allowing cuaron to develop scene as one extended shot a vehicle was modified to enable seats to tilt and lower actors out of way of camera and windshield was designed to tilt out of way to allow camera movement in and out through front windscreen a crew of four including director of photography and camera operator rode on roof however commonly reported statement that action scenes are continuous shots is not entirely true visual effects supervisor frazer churchill explains that effects team had to combine several takes to create impossibly long shots where their job was to create illusion of a continuous camera move once team was able to create a seamless blend they would move on to next shot these techniques were important for three continuous shots coffee shop explosion in opening shot car ambush and battlefield scene coffee shop scene was composed of two different takes shot over two consecutive days car ambush was shot in six sections and at four different locations over one week and required five seamless digital transitions and battlefield scene was captured in five separate takes over two locations churchill and double negative team created over 160 of these types of effects for film in an interview with variety cuaron acknowledged this nature of single shot action sequences maybe i m spilling a big secret but sometimes it s more than what it looks like important thing is how you blend everything and how you keep perception of a fluid choreography through all of these different pieces tim webber of vfx house framestore cfc was responsible for three and a half minute single take of kee giving birth helping to choreograph and create cg effects of childbirth cuaron had originally intended to use an animatronic baby as kee s child with exception of childbirth scene in end two takes were shot with second take concealing clare hope ashitey s legs replacing them with prosthetic legs cuaron was pleased with results of effect and returned to previous shots of baby in animatronic form replacing them with framestore s computer generated baby sound cuaron uses sound and music to bring fictional world of social unrest and infertility to life a creative yet restrained combination of rock pop electronic music hip hop and classical music replaces typical film score mundane sounds of traffic barking dogs and advertisements follow character of theo through london east sussex and kent producing what los angeles times writer kevin crust calls an urban audio rumble for crust music comments indirectly on barren world of children of men deep purple s version of hush blaring from jasper s car radio becomes a sly lullaby for a world without babies while king crimson s court of crimson king make a similar allusion with their lyrics three lullabies in an ancient tongue amongst a genre spanning selection of electronic music a remix of aphex twin s switch 7 which includes male thijs loud scream audio sample by not present on original nor indeed on official soundtrack can be heard during scene in jasper s house where jasper s strawberry cough a potent strawberry flavoured strain of marijuana is being sampled during a conversation between two men radiohead s life in a glasshouse plays in background a number of dubstep tracks most notably anti war dub by digital as well as tracks by space ape and pressure are also featured for bexhill scenes during film s second half director makes use of silence and cacophonous sound effects such as firing of automatic weapons and loudspeakers directing movement of fugees illegal immigrants here classical music by george frideric handel gustav mahler and krzysztof penderecki s threnody to victims of hiroshima complements chaos of refugee camp throughout film john tavener s fragments of a prayer is used as a spiritual motif to explain and interpret story without use of narrative a few times during film a loud ringing tone evocative of tinnitus is heard this sound generally coincides with death of a major character julian jasper and is referred to by julian herself who describes tones as last time you ll ever hear that frequency in this way then loss of tones is symbolic of loss of characters release children of men had its world premiere at 63rd venice international film festival on 3
