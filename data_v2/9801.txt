oryzomys dimidiatus also known as nicaraguan oryzomys musser and carleton 2005 p 1148 thomas s rice rat or nicaraguan rice rat duff and lawson 2004 p 54 jones and engstrom 1986 p 12 is a rodent in genus oryzomys of family cricetidae it is known from only three specimens all collected in southeastern nicaragua since 1904 placed in nectomys upon its discovery it was later classified in its own subgenus of oryzomys and finally recognized as closely related to other species now placed in oryzomys including marsh rice rat and oryzomys couesi which occurs in same region with a head and body length of 110 to 128 mm 4 3 to 5 0 in oryzomys dimidiatus is a medium sized rice rat upperparts are gray brown and underparts are grayish not buffy as in o couesi tail is only slightly darker above than below all three specimens were caught near water and species may be semiaquatic spending some time in water its conservation status is currently assessed as least concern taxonomy first known specimen was obtained by w g palmer in 1905 p 587 and next year oldfield thomas of british museum of natural history described this animal as holotype of a new species he named nectomys dimidiatus he placed it in genus nectomys commenting that it was much smaller than but otherwise similar to previously known members of that genus species was listed as a nectomys in taxonomic overviews in next decades including a 1944 review of genus by philip hershkovitz hershkovitz 1944 p 80 after examining holotype in london hershkovitz instead placed species in genus oryzomys in 1948 he remarked that it was an especially distinctive member of that genus and hence classified it in its own subgenus micronectomys hershkovitz 1948 pp 54 55 j hernandez camacho described a second species of micronectomys oryzomys micronectomys borreroi from colombia in 1957 hershkovitz 1970 p 792 in 1970 hershkovitz treated o dimidiatus in another publication and conceded that his name micronectomys was a nomen nudum naked name because he had not explicitly mentioned characters differentiating it from other taxa in his 1948 publication hershkovitz 1970 p 791 nevertheless he did not do anything to rectify situation and micronectomys remains a nomen nudum musser and carleton 2005 p 1144 hershkovitz also noted that while o dimidiatus resembles a juvenile nectomys in external anatomy it is otherwise similar to marsh rice rat oryzomys palustris he accepted o borreroi as an oryzomys but did not think it closely related to o dimidiatus six years later alfred gardner and james patton instead suggested that o borreroi was a zygodontomys and in his 1991 review of that genus robert voss confirmed that it is same as zygodontomys brunneus voss 1991 p 46 a second specimen was obtained in 1966 and find was published in 1971 by hugh genoways and knox jones who noted that species is closely similar to o palustris genoways and jones 1971 p 433 later workers affirmed relationship between o dimidiatus o palustris and associated species like o couesi fiona reid reported in 1997 that a third specimen had been found reid 1997 p 204 in 2006 marcelo weksler and coworkers removed most of species formerly placed in oryzomys from genus because they are not closely related to type species o palustris but kept o dimidiatus as an oryzomys weksler et al 2006 table 1 footnote e oryzomys dimidiatus is now recognized as one of eight species in genus oryzomys carleton and arroyo cabrales 2009 p 116 o dimidiatus is further part of o couesi section which is centered on widespread central american o couesi and also includes six other species with more limited and peripheral distributions carleton and arroyo cabrales 2009 p 117 o couesi occurs with o dimidiatus in southeastern nicaragua jones and engstrom 1986 p 12 many aspects of systematics of o couesi section remain unclear and it is likely that current classification underestimates true diversity of group carleton and arroyo cabrales 2009 p 107 oryzomys is classified in tribe oryzomyini rice rats a diverse assemblage of american rodents of over a hundred species weksler 2006 p 3 and on higher taxonomic levels in subfamily sigmodontinae of family cricetidae along with hundreds of other species of mainly small rodents musser and carleton 2005 description thumb left alt a rat grayish above and pale below among reed and leaf litter marsh rice rat oryzomys palustris is similar to o dimidiatus oryzomys dimidiatus is a medium sized rice rat smaller than o couesi with thick glossy fur and velvety underfur hairs on back are about 6 mm in length upperparts are gray brown with some dark hairs appearing darker overall than in o couesi color becomes more yellowish towards sides according to thomas a faint buff line extends from sides to inner sides of hindlegs underparts are grayish contrasting with buffy underparts of o couesi snout is short and well haired ears are partly hidden by fur hands and feet are off white or brownish above not white as in o couesi hindfeet show small interdigital webs but they lack long tufts of hair on digits and some of pads are reduced or absent tail is about as long as head and body and contains about 15 rings per centimeter it is slightly darker grayish above than below whitish but difference in color is much less pronounced than in o couesi thomas 1905 p 586 genoways and jones 1971 p 833 sanchez et al 2001 pp 209 210 reid 2009 p 207 compared to that of nectomys skull is lightly built and has narrow nasals and a broad round braincase without conspicuous ridges on it zygomatic plate is broad incisive foramina perforations of front part of palate extend between first molars and are broadest in their back halves broad mesopterygoid fossa gap behind end of palate is perforated by sphenopalatine vacuities molar crowns are not as simplified as in nectomys species but front cusps of upper anterocone and lower first molar anteroconid are not divided in two in addition to main roots upper and lower first molars have smaller additional roots hershkovitz 1948 p 55 sanchez et al 2001 pp 209 210 measurements for first two known examples are as follows in each
