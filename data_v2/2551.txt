battle of alamo february 23 march 6 1836 was a pivotal event in texas revolution following a 13 day siege mexican troops under president general antonio lopez de santa anna reclaimed alamo mission near san antonio de bexar modern day san antonio texas united states killing texian and immigrant occupiers santa anna s cruelty during battle inspired many texians both legal texas settlers and illegal immigrants from united states to join texian army buoyed by a desire for revenge texians defeated mexican army at battle of san jacinto on april 21 1836 ending rebellion several months previously texians had driven all mexican troops out of mexican texas about 100 texians were then garrisoned at alamo texian force grew slightly with arrival of reinforcements led by eventual alamo co commanders james bowie and william b travis on february 23 approximately 1 500 mexicans marched into san antonio de bexar as first step in a campaign to retake texas for next 10 days two armies engaged in several skirmishes with minimal casualties aware that his garrison could not withstand an attack by such a large force travis wrote multiple letters pleading for more men and supplies from texas and from united states but texians were reinforced by fewer than 100 men because united states had a treaty with mexico and supplying men and weapons would have been an overt act of war in early morning hours of march 6 mexican army advanced on alamo after repelling two attacks texians were unable to fend off a third attack as mexican soldiers scaled walls most of texian fighters withdrew into interior buildings occupiers unable to reach these points were slain by mexican cavalry as they attempted to escape between five and seven texians may have surrendered if so they were quickly executed most eyewitness accounts reported between 182 and 257 texians died while most historians of alamo agree that around 600 mexicans were killed or wounded several noncombatants were sent to gonzales to spread word of texian defeat news sparked both a strong rush to join texian army and a panic known as runaway scrape in which texian army most settlers and new self proclaimed but officially unrecognized republic of texas government fled eastward toward united states ahead of advancing mexican army within mexico battle has often been overshadowed by events from mexican american war of 1846 48 in 19th century texas alamo complex gradually became known as a battle site rather than a former mission texas legislature purchased land and buildings in early part of 20th century and

on their intent one interpretation is that bowie s orders were to destroy only barricades that mexican army had erected around san antonio de bexar and that he should then wait in alamo until governor

wounded and his english curses convinced occupiers to open gates these texian reinforcements were later dubbed immortal 32 on march 3 texians watched from walls as approximately 1 000 mexicans marched into bexar mexican army celebrated loudly throughout afternoon both in honor of their reinforcements and at news that troops under general jose de had soundly defeated texian colonel frank w johnson at battle of san patricio on february 27 todish et al 1998 p 47 most of texians in alamo believed that sesma had been leading mexican forces during siege and they mistakenly attributed celebration to

fannin s force which he still believed to be en route lindley 2003 p 140 scouts discovered a large group of texians camped from alamo lindley s research indicates that up to 50 of these men had come

12 pounder cannons anticipated to arrive on march 7 todish et al 1998 p 48 that evening a local woman likely bowie s cousin in law juana navarro alsbury approached santa anna to negotiate a surrender for alamo occupiers according to many historians this visit probably increased santa anna s impatience as historian timothy todish noted there would have been little glory in a bloodless victory todish et al 1998 p 49 following morning santa anna announced to his staff that assault would take place early on march 6 santa anna arranged for troops from bexar to be excused from front lines so that they would not be forced to fight their own families legend holds that at some point on march 5 travis gathered his men and explained that an attack was imminent and that they were greatly outnumbered by mexican army he supposedly drew a line in ground and asked those willing to die for texian cause to cross and stand alongside him only one man moses rose was said to have declined hopewell 1994 p 126 most scholars disregard this tale as there is no primary source evidence to support it story only surfaced decades after battle in a third hand account chariton 1992 p 195 however travis apparently did at some point prior to final assault assemble men for a conference to inform them of dire situation and giving them chance to either escape or stay and die for cause susannah dickinson recalled travis announcing that any men who wished to escape should let it be known and step out of ranks last texian verified to have left alamo was james allen a courier who carried

began preparing for final assault fewer than 1 800 were divided into four columns commanded by cos colonel francisco duque colonel jose maria romero and colonel juan morales veterans were positioned

pena a single cannon volley did away with half company of chasseurs from toluca duque fell from his horse after suffering a wound in his thigh and was almost trampled by his own men general manuel castrillon quickly assumed command of duque s column although some in front of mexican ranks wavered soldiers in rear pushed them on as troops massed against walls texians were forced to lean over walls to shoot leaving them exposed to mexican fire travis became one of first occupiers to die shot while firing his shotgun into soldiers below him though one source says that he drew his sword and stabbed a mexican officer who had stormed wall before succumbing to his injury few of mexican ladders reached walls few soldiers who were able to climb ladders were quickly killed or beaten back as texians discharged their previously loaded rifles however they found it increasingly difficult to reload while attempting to keep mexican soldiers from scaling walls mexican soldiers withdrew and regrouped but their second attack was repulsed fifteen minutes into battle they attacked a third time during third strike romero s column aiming for east wall was exposed to cannon fire and shifted to north mingling with second column cos column under fire from texians on west wall also veered north todish et al 1998 p 53 when santa anna saw that bulk of his army was massed against north wall he feared a rout panicked he sent reserves into same area petite 1998 p 112 mexican soldiers closest to north wall realized that makeshift wall contained many gaps and one of first to scale 12 foot 3 7 m wall was general juan amador at his challenge his men began swarming up wall amador opened postern in north wall allowing mexican soldiers to pour into complex others climbed through gun ports in west wall which had few occupiers as texian occupiers abandoned north wall and northern end of west wall texian gunners at south end of mission turned their cannon towards north and fired into advancing mexican soldiers this left south end of mission unprotected within minutes mexican soldiers had climbed walls and killed gunners gaining control of alamo s 18 pounder cannon by this time romero s men had taken east wall of compound and were pouring in through cattle pen interior fighting as previously planned most of texians fell back to barracks and chapel holes had been carved in walls to allow texians to fire unable to reach barracks texians stationed along west wall headed west for san antonio river when cavalry charged texians took cover and began firing from a ditch sesma was forced to send reinforcements and texians were eventually killed sesma reported that this skirmish involved 50 texians but edmondson believes that number was inflated occupiers in cattle pen retreated into horse corral after discharging their weapons small band of texians scrambled over low wall circled behind church and raced on foot for east prairie which appeared empty as mexican cavalry advanced on

his head hopewell 1994 p 127 according to historian wallace chariton most popular and probably most accurate chariton 1992 p 74 version is that bowie died on his cot back braced against wall and using

sixteen mexican corpses tinkle 1985 p 214 historians disagree on which version of crockett s death is accurate according to petite every account of crockett surrender execution story comes from an avowed antagonist either on political or military grounds of santa anna s it is believed that many stories such as surrender and execution of crockett were created and spread in order to discredit santa anna and add to his role as villain petite 1998 p 124 petite 1998 p 124 santa anna reportedly told captain fernando that battle was but a small affair lord 1961 p 167 another officer then remarked that with another such victory as this we ll go to devil identity of this officer is disputed edmondson claims that this remark was made by colonel juan almonte and overheard by almonte s

with only 70 mexican soldiers killed and 300 wounded his secretary ramon martinez caro later repudiated report other estimates of number of mexican soldiers killed ranged from 60 200 with an additional 250 300 wounded most alamo historians place number of mexican casualties at 400 600 nofi 1992 p 136 this would represent about one third of mexican soldiers involved in final assault which todish remarks is a tremendous casualty rate by any standards most eyewitnesses counted between 182 257 texians killed nofi 1992 p 133 some historians believe that at least one texian henry warnell
