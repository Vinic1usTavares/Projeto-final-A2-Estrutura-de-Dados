antiquities 3 69 3 6 modern views according to dominant scholarly view during late 19th and much of 20th century roman religion was originally animistic directed towards spirits associated with specific objects or activities which were only later perceived as gods with independent personal existence terminus with his lack of mythology and his close association with a physical object seemed a clear example of a deity who had developed little from such a stage this view of terminus retains some recent adherents but other scholars have argued from indo european parallels that personalised gods of roman religion must have preceded city s foundation georges dumezil regarded jupiter juventas and terminus as roman form of a proto indo european triad comparing roman deities respectively to vedic mitra aryaman and bhaga in this view sovereign god jupiter mitra was associated with two minor deities one concerned with entry of men into society juventas aryaman and other with fair division
