a cannon is a type of gun classified as artillery that launches a projectile using propellant in past gunpowder was primary propellant before invention of smokeless powder during 19th century cannon vary in caliber range mobility rate of fire angle of fire and firepower different forms of cannon combine and balance these attributes in varying degrees depending on their intended use on battlefield word cannon is derived from several languages in which original definition can usually be translated as tube cane or reed in modern era term cannon has fallen into decline replaced by guns or artillery if not a earliest known depiction of cannon appeared in song dynasty china as early as 12th century however solid archaeological and documentary evidence of cannon do not appear until 13th century in 1288 yuan dynasty troops are recorded to have used hand cannons in combat and earliest extant cannon bearing a date of production comes from same period by early 14th century depictions of cannon had appeared in middle east and europe and almost immediately recorded usage of cannon began appearing by end of 14th century cannon were widespread throughout eurasia cannon were used primarily as anti infantry weapons until around 1374 when cannon were recorded to have breached walls for first time in europe cannon featured prominently as siege weapons and ever larger pieces appeared in 1464 a 16 000 kg 35 000 lbs cannon known as great turkish bombard was created in ottoman empire cannon as field artillery became more important after 1453 with introduction of limber which greatly improved cannon maneuverability and mobility european cannon reached their longer lighter more accurate and more efficient classic form around 1480 this classic european cannon design stayed relatively consistent in form with minor changes until 1750s etymology and terminology cannon is derived from old italian word cannone meaning large tube which came from latin canna in turn originating from greek kanna kanna reed kanna henry george liddell robert scott an intermediate greek english lexicon on perseus and then generalised to mean any hollow tube like object cognate with akkadian m and hebrew tube reed word has been used to refer to a gun since 1326 in italy and 1418 in england both cannons and cannon are correct and in common usage with one or other having preference in different parts of english speaking world cannons is more common in north america and australia while cannon as plural is more common in united kingdom history thumb dazu rock carvings a man

appear until 13th century primary extant specimens of cannon from 13th century are wuwei bronze cannon dated to 1227 heilongjiang hand cannon dated to 1288 and xanadu gun dated to 1298 however only xanadu gun contains an inscription bearing a date of production so it is considered earliest confirmed extant cannon xanadu gun is 34 7 cm in length and weighs 6 2 kg other cannon are dated using contextual evidence heilongjiang hand cannon is also often considered by some to be oldest firearm since it was unearthed near area where history of yuan reports a battle took place involving hand cannon according to history of yuan in 1288 a jurchen commander by name of li ting led troops armed with hand cannon into battle against rebel prince nayan chen argues there were no guns before 1259 while dang shoushan believes wuwei gun and other western xia era samples point to appearance of guns by 1220 and stephen haw goes even further by stating that guns were developed as early as 1200 sinologist joseph needham and renaissance siege expert thomas arnold provide a more conservative estimate of around 1280 for appearance of true cannon whether or not any of these are correct it seems likely that gun was born sometime during 13th century references to cannon proliferated throughout china in following centuries cannon featured in literary pieces in 1341 xian zhang wrote a poem called iron cannon affair describing a cannonball fired from an which could pierce heart or belly when striking a man or horse and even several persons at once by 1350s cannon was used extensively in chinese warfare in 1358 ming army failed to take a city due to its garrisons usage of cannon however they themselves would use cannon in thousands later on during siege of suzhou in 1366 korean kingdom of joseon started producing gunpowder in 1374 and cannon by 1377 cannons appeared in dai viet by 1390 at latest during ming dynasty cannon were used in riverine warfare at battle of lake

began producing themselves by 1523 and began improving later on japan did not acquire a cannon until 1510 when a monk brought one back from china and did not produce any in appreciable numbers during 1593 siege of pyongyang 40 000 ming troops deployed a variety of cannon against japanese troops despite their defensive advantage and use of arquebus by japanese soldiers japanese were at a severe disadvantage due to their lack of cannon throughout japanese invasions of korea 1592 98 ming joseon coalition used artillery widely in land and naval battles including on turtle ships of yi sun sin

and had firearms islamic world thumb right dardanelles gun a 1464 ottoman bombard thumb malik e maidan a 16th century cannon was effectively utilised by deccan sultanates and was largest cannon operated during battle of talikota there is no clear consensus of when cannon first appeared in islamic world with dates ranging from 1260 to mid 14th century cannon may have appeared in islamic world in late 13th century with ibn khaldun in 14th century stating that cannons were used in maghreb region of north africa in 1274 and other arabic military treatises in 14th century referring to use of cannon by mamluk forces in 1260 and 1303 and by muslim forces at 1324 siege of huesca in spain however some scholars do not accept these early dates while date of its first appearance is not entirely clear general consensus among most historians is that there is no doubt mamluk forces were using cannon by 1342 part 4 and part 5 according to historian ahmad y al hassan during battle of ain jalut in 1260 mamluks used cannon against mongols he claims that this was first cannon in history and used a gunpowder formula almost identical to ideal composition for explosive gunpowder he also argues that this was not known in china or europe until much later hassan further claims that earliest textual evidence of cannon is from middle east based on earlier originals which report hand held cannon being used by mamluks at battle of ain jalut in 1260 while paul e j hammer and gabor agoston are open to possibility of cannon s appearance in islamic world in 1260 such an early date is not accepted by some historians including david ayalon alam khan joseph needham and tonio andrade khan argues that it was mongols who introduced gunpowder to islamic world and believes cannon only reached mamluk egypt in 1370s needham argued that term dated to textual sources from 1342 to 1352 did not refer to true hand guns or bombards and that contemporary accounts of a metal barrel cannon in islamic world did not occur until 1365 similarly andrade dates textual appearance of cannon in middle eastern sources to 1360s gabor agoston and david ayalon note that mamluks had certainly used siege cannon by 1342 or 1360s respectively but earlier uses of cannon in islamic world are vague with a possible appearance in emirate of granada by 1320s and 1330s though evidence is inconclusive ibn khaldun reported use of cannon as siege machines by marinid sultan abu yaqub yusuf at siege of sijilmasa in 1274 paul e j hammer 2007 warfare in early modern europe 1450 1660 page 297 ashgate publishing passage by ibn khaldun on marinid siege of in 1274 occurs as follows sultan installed siege engines and gunpowder engines which project small balls of iron these balls are ejected from a chamber placed in front of a kindling fire of gunpowder this happens by a strange property which attributes all actions to power of creator while hammer and agoston are open to possibility of cannon s appearance in maghreb in 1274 name source is not contemporary and was written a century later around 1382 its interpretation has been rejected as anachronistic by some historians who urge caution regarding claims of islamic firearms use in 1204 1324 period as late medieval arabic texts used same word for gunpowder naft as they did for an earlier incendiary naphtha agoston and peter purton note that in 1204 1324 period late medieval arabic texts used same word for gunpowder naft that they used for an earlier incendiary naphtha needham believes ibn khaldun was speaking of fire lances rather than hand cannon ottoman empire made good use of cannon as siege artillery sixty eight super sized bombards were used by mehmed conqueror to capture constantinople in 1453 jim bradbury argues that urban a hungarian cannon engineer introduced this cannon from central europe to ottoman realm according to paul hammer however it could have been introduced from other islamic countries which had earlier used cannon these cannon could fire heavy stone balls a mile and sound of their blast could reportedly be heard from a distance of historian marin barleti discusses turkish bombards at length in his book de obsidione 1504 describing 1478 79 siege of in which eleven bombards and two mortars were employed ottomans also used cannon to sink ships which attempted to prevent them from crossing bosporus strait ottoman cannon also proved effective at stopping crusaders at varna in 1444 and kosovo in 1448 despite presence of european cannon in former case similar dardanelles guns for location

1443 iranians were also making some of their own cannon as mir wrote of a 1200 kg metal piece being made by an iranian which was most likely a cannon due to difficulties of transporting cannon in

earliest texts to mention gunpowder are roger bacon s opus majus 1267 and opus tertium in what has been interpreted as references to firecrackers in early 20th century a british artillery officer proposed that another work tentatively attributed to bacon epistola de secretis artis et naturae et de also known as opus minor dated to 1247 contained an encrypted formula for gunpowder hidden in text these claims have been disputed by science historians in any case formula itself is not useful for firearms or even firecrackers burning slowly and producing mostly smoke bert s hall introduction 1999 p xxiv to reprinting of there is a record of a gun in europe dating to 1322 being discovered in nineteenth century but artifact has since been lost earliest known european depiction of a gun

which displays a gun with a large arrow emerging from it and its user lowering a long stick to ignite gun through in same year another similar illustration showed a darker gun being set off by a group

military historians scholars suggest that lack of gunpowder weapons in a well traveled venetian s catalogue for a new crusade in 1321 implies that guns were unknown in europe up until this point further solidifying 1320 mark however more evidence in this area may be forthcoming in future oldest extant cannon in europe is a small bronze example unearthed in scania in southern sweden roger pauly 2004 firearms life story of a technology greenwood press p 21 it dates from early mid 14th century kevin dockery 2007 stalkers and shooters a history of snipers berkley and is currently in swedish history museum in stockholm early cannon in europe often shot arrows and were known by an assortment of names such as pot de fer ribaldis and ribaldis which shot large arrows and simplistic grapeshot were first mentioned in english privy wardrobe accounts during preparations for battle of crecy between 1345 and 1346 florentine giovanni villani recounts their destructiveness indicating that by end of battle whole plain was covered by men struck down by arrows and cannon balls similar cannon were also used at siege of calais 1346 47 although it was not until 1380s that clearly became mounted on wheels early use battle of crecy which pitted english against french in 1346 featured early use of cannon which helped long bowmen repulse a large force of genoese crossbowmen deployed by french english originally intended to use cannon against cavalry sent to attack their archers thinking that loud noises produced by their cannon would panic advancing horses along with killing knights atop them early cannon could also be used for more than simply killing men and scaring horses english cannon were used defensively during siege of castle to launch fire onto an advancing belfry in this way cannon could be used to burn down siege equipment before it reached fortifications use of cannon to shoot fire could also be used offensively as another battle involved setting of a castle ablaze with similar methods particular incendiary used in these cannon was most likely a gunpowder mixture this is one area where early chinese and european cannon share a similarity as both were possibly used to shoot fire another aspect of early european cannon is that they were rather small dwarfed by bombards which would come later in fact it is possible that cannon used at crecy were capable of being moved rather quickly as there is an anonymous chronicle that notes guns being used to attack french camp indicating that they would have been mobile enough press attack these smaller cannon would eventually give way to larger wall breaching guns by end of 1300s eastern europe documentary evidence of cannon in russia does not appear until 1382 and they were used only in sieges often by defenders it was not until 1475 when ivan iii established first russian cannon foundry in moscow that they began to produce cannon natively later on large cannon were known as bombards ranging from three to five feet in length and were used by dubrovnik and kotor in defence during later 14th century first bombards were made of iron but bronze became more prevalent as it was recognized as more stable and capable of propelling stones weighing as much as around same period byzantine empire began to accumulate its own cannon to face ottoman empire starting with medium sized cannon long and of 10 in calibre earliest reliable recorded use of artillery in region was against ottoman siege of constantinople in 1396 forcing ottomans to withdraw ottomans acquired their own cannon and laid siege to byzantine capital again in 1422 by 1453 ottomans used 68 hungarian made cannon for 55 day bombardment of walls of constantinople hurling pieces everywhere and killing those who happened to be nearby largest of their cannon was great turkish bombard which required an operating crew of 200 men and 70 oxen and 10 000 men to transport it gunpowder made formerly devastating greek fire obsolete and with final fall of constantinople which was protected by what were once strongest walls in europe on 29 may 1453 it was end of an era in more ways than one turnbull p 43 offensive vs defensive use while previous smaller guns could burn down structures with fire larger cannon were so effective that engineers were forced to develop stronger castle walls to prevent their keeps from falling this isn t to say that cannon were only used to batter down walls as fortifications began using cannon as defensive instruments such as an example in india where fort of had gun ports built into its walls to accommodate use of defensive cannon in art of war niccolo machiavelli opined that field artillery forced an army to take up a defensive posture and this opposed a more ideal offensive stance machiavelli s concerns can be seen in criticisms of portuguese mortars being used in india during sixteenth century as lack of mobility was one of key problems with design in russia early cannon were again placed in forts as a defensive tool cannon were also difficult to move around in certain types of terrain with mountains providing a great obstacle for them for these reasons offensives conducted with cannon would be difficult to pull off in places such as iran early modern period thumb right various 16th century artillery pieces including culverin falconet and mortar by 16th century cannon were made in a great variety of lengths and bore diameters but general rule was that longer barrel longer range some cannon made during this time had barrels exceeding in length and could weigh up to consequently large amounts of gunpowder were needed to allow them to fire stone balls several hundred yards by mid century european monarchs began to classify cannon to reduce confusion henry ii of france opted for six sizes of cannon six sizes are in order from largest to smallest cannon great culverin bastard culverin legitimate culverin falcon and falconet but others settled for more spanish used twelve sizes and english sixteen they are from largest to smallest cannon royal cannon cannon serpentine bastard cannon pedrero culverin basilisk bastard culverin saker minion falcon falconet serpentine and better powder had been developed by this time as well instead of finely ground powder used by first bombards powder was replaced by a corned variety of coarse grains this coarse powder had pockets of air between grains allowing fire to travel through and ignite entire charge quickly and uniformly tunis p 88 thumb left tsar cannon largest howitzer ever made cast by andrey end of middle ages saw construction of larger more powerful cannon as well as their spread throughout world as they were not effective at breaching newer fortifications resulting from development of cannon siege engines such as siege towers and trebuchets became less widely used however wooden battery towers took on a similar role as siege towers in gunpowder age such as that used at siege of kazan in 1552 which could hold ten large calibre cannon in addition to 50 lighter pieces another notable effect of cannon on warfare during this period was change in conventional fortifications niccolo machiavelli wrote there is no wall whatever its thickness that artillery will not destroy in only a few days although castles were not immediately made obsolete by cannon their use and importance on battlefield rapidly declined instead of majestic towers and merlons walls of new fortresses were thick angled and sloped while towers became low and stout increasing use was also made of earth and brick in breastworks and redoubts these new defences became known as bastion forts after their characteristic shape which attempted to force any advance towards it directly into firing line of guns a few of these featured cannon batteries such as house of tudor s device forts in england bastion forts soon replaced castles in europe and eventually those in americas as well thumb right remains of a post medieval cannon battery mounted on a medieval town wall although without carriages by end of 15th century several technological advancements made cannon more mobile wheeled gun carriages and trunnions became common and invention of limber further facilitated transportation manucy p 5 as a result field artillery became more viable and began to see more widespread use often alongside larger cannon intended for sieges better gunpowder cast iron projectiles replacing stone and standardisation of calibres meant that even relatively light cannon could be deadly in art of war niccolo machiavelli observed that it is true that arquebuses and small artillery do much more harm than heavy artillery this was case at battle of flodden in 1513 english field guns scottish siege artillery firing two or three times as many rounds sadler p 60 despite increased maneuverability however cannon were still slowest component of army a heavy english cannon required 23 horses to transport while a culverin needed nine even with this many animals pulling they still moved at a walking pace due to their relatively slow speed and lack of organisation and undeveloped tactics combination of pike and shot still dominated battlefields of europe manucy p 6 innovations continued notably german invention of mortar a thick walled short barrelled gun that blasted shot upward at a steep angle mortars were useful for sieges as they could hit targets behind walls or other defences this cannon found more use with dutch who learnt to shoot bombs filled with powder from them setting bomb fuse was a problem single firing was first used to ignite fuse where bomb was placed with fuse down against cannon s propellant this often resulted in fuse being blown into bomb causing it to blow up as it left mortar because of this double firing was tried where gunner lit fuse and then touch hole this however required considerable skill and timing and was especially dangerous if gun misfired leaving a lighted bomb in barrel not until 1650 was it accidentally discovered that double lighting was superfluous as heat of firing would light fuse tunis p 90 thumb right contemporary illustration on how a cannon could be used with aid of quadrants for improved precision thumb left upright 7 use of gabions with cannon was an important part in attack and defence of fortifications gustavus adolphus of sweden emphasised use of light cannon and mobility in his army and created new formations and tactics that revolutionised artillery he discontinued using all 12 pounder or heavier cannon as field artillery preferring instead to use cannon that could be handled by only a few men one obsolete type of gun was replaced by 4 pounder and 9 pounder demi culverins these could be operated by three men and pulled by only two horses adolphus s army was also first to use a cartridge that contained both powder and shot which sped up reloading increasing rate of fire manucy pp 7 8 finally against infantry he pioneered use of canister shot essentially a tin can filled with musket balls tunis p 96 until then there was no more than one cannon for every thousand infantrymen on battlefield but gustavus adolphus increased number of cannon sixfold each regiment was assigned two pieces though he often arranged them into batteries instead of distributing them piecemeal he used these batteries to break his opponent s infantry line while his cavalry would outflank their heavy guns manucy p 8 at battle of breitenfeld in 1631 adolphus proved effectiveness of changes made to his army by defeating johann count of tilly although severely outnumbered swedes were able to fire between three and five times as many volleys of artillery and their infantry s linear formations helped ensure they didn t lose any ground battered by cannon fire and low on morale tilly s men broke ranks and fled in england cannon were being used to besiege various fortified buildings during english civil war nathaniel nye is recorded as testing a birmingham cannon in 1643 and experimenting with a saker in 1645 from 1645 he was master gunner to parliamentarian garrison at evesham and in 1646 he successfully directed artillery at siege of worcester detailing his experiences and in his 1647 book art of gunnery believing that war was as much a science as an art his explanations focused on triangulation arithmetic theoretical mathematics and cartography as well as practical considerations such as ideal specification for gunpowder or slow matches his book acknowledged mathematicians such as robert and marcus as well as earlier military writers on artillery such as niccolo fontana tartaglia and thomas or francis malthus author of a treatise on artificial fire works thumb right fort a bastion fort was built with angles and sloped walls specifically to defend against cannon around this time also came idea of aiming cannon to hit a target gunners controlled range of their cannon by measuring angle of elevation using a gunner s quadrant cannon did not have sights therefore even with measuring tools aiming was still largely guesswork tunis p 97 in latter half of 17th century french engineer sebastien le prestre de vauban introduced a more systematic and scientific approach to attacking gunpowder fortresses in a time when many field commanders were notorious dunces in siegecraft careful sapping forward supported by enfilading ricochets was a key feature of this system and it even allowed vauban to calculate length of time a siege would take he was also a prolific builder of bastion forts and did much to popularize idea of depth in defence in face of cannon griffith p 29 these principles were followed into mid 19th century when changes in armaments necessitated greater depth defence than vauban had provided for it was only in years prior to world war i that new works began to break radically away from his designs griffith pp 56 57 18th and 19th centuries thumb left cannon used by tipu sultan s forces at battle of srirangapatna 1799 thumb left jahan cannon in 1750s lower tier of 17th century english ships of line were usually equipped with demi cannon guns that fired a solid shot and could weigh up to demi cannon were capable of firing these heavy metal balls with such force that they could penetrate more than a metre of solid oak from a distance of and could even largest ships at close range full cannon fired a shot but were discontinued by 18th century as they were too unwieldy by end of 18th century principles long adopted in europe specified characteristics of royal navy s cannon as well as acceptable defects and their severity united states navy tested guns by measuring them firing them two or three times termed proof by powder and using pressurized water to detect leaks thumb 36 pounder long gun at ready carronade was adopted by royal navy in 1779 lower muzzle velocity of round shot when fired from this cannon was intended to create more wooden splinters when hitting structure of an enemy vessel as they were believed to be more deadly than ball by itself carronade was much shorter and weighed between a third to a quarter of equivalent long gun for example a 32 pounder carronade weighed less than a ton compared with a 32 pounder long gun which weighed over 3 tons guns were therefore easier to handle and also required less than half as much gunpowder allowing fewer men to crew them carronades were manufactured in usual naval gun calibres twelve 18 24 32 and 42 pounders but 6 pounder and 68 pounder versions are known but were not counted in a ship of line s rated number of guns as a result classification of royal navy vessels in this period can be misleading as they often carried more cannon than were listed cannon were crucial in napoleon s rise to power and continued to play an important role in his army in later years during french revolution unpopularity of directory led to riots and rebellions when over 25 000 royalists led by general danican assaulted paris paul barras was appointed to defend capital outnumbered five to one and disorganised republicans were desperate when napoleon arrived he reorganised defences but realised that without cannon city could not be held he ordered joachim murat to bring guns from artillery park major and his cavalry fought their way to recently captured

artillery improving it significantly and making it among finest in europe baynes p 669 such tactics were successfully used by french for example at battle of friedland when sixty six guns fired a total of 3 000 roundshot and 500 rounds of grapeshot inflicting severe casualties to russian forces whose losses numbered over 20 000 killed and wounded in total at battle of waterloo napoleon s final battle french army had many more artillery pieces than either british or prussians as battlefield was muddy recoil caused cannon to bury themselves into ground after firing resulting in slow rates of fire as more effort was required to move them back into an adequate firing position also roundshot did not ricochet with as much force from wet earth despite drawbacks sustained artillery fire proved deadly during engagement especially during french cavalry attack wilkinson latham p 36 british infantry having formed infantry squares took heavy losses from french guns while their own cannon fired at cuirassiers and lancers when they fell back to regroup eventually french ceased their assault after taking heavy losses from british cannon and musket fire nofi pp 115 116 thumb right illustration by william simpson shows action in a british artillery battery during crimean war with cannon firing and being loaded and men bringing in supplies in 1810s and 1820s greater emphasis was placed on

casting spiralling lines inside cannon s barrel was applied to artillery more frequently by 1855 as it gave cannon projectiles gyroscopic stability which improved their accuracy one of earliest rifled cannon was breech loading armstrong gun also invented by william armstrong which boasted significantly improved range accuracy and power than earlier weapons projectile fired from armstrong gun could reportedly pierce through a ship s side and explode inside enemy vessel causing increased damage and casualties british military adopted armstrong gun and was impressed duke of cambridge even declared that it could do everything but speak despite being significantly more advanced than its predecessors armstrong gun was rejected soon after its integration in favour of muzzle loading pieces that had been in use before while both types of gun were effective against wooden ships neither had capability to pierce armour of ironclads due to reports of slight problems with breeches of armstrong gun and their higher cost older muzzle loaders were selected to remain in service instead realising that iron was more difficult to pierce with breech loaded cannon armstrong designed rifled muzzle loading guns bastable p 72 which proved successful times reported even fondest believers in invulnerability of our present ironclads were obliged to confess that against such artillery at such ranges their

1888 and 1913 german cannon cannon in 20th and 21st centuries are usually divided into sub categories and given separate names some of most widely used types of modern cannon are howitzers mortars guns and autocannon although a few very large calibre cannon custom designed have also been constructed nuclear artillery was experimented with but was abandoned as impractical modern artillery is used in a variety of roles depending on its type according to nato general role of artillery is to provide fire support which is defined as application of fire coordinated with manoeuvre of forces to destroy neutralize or suppress enemy when referring to cannon term gun is often used incorrectly in military usage a gun is a cannon with a high muzzle velocity and a flat trajectory useful for hitting sides of targets such as walls as opposed to howitzers or mortars which have lower muzzle velocities and fire indirectly lobbing shells up and over obstacles to hit target from above thumb

howitzers as they were more suited at hitting targets in trenches furthermore their shells carried more explosives than those of guns and caused considerably less barrel wear german army had advantage

and proximity fuses all of which increased effectiveness of cannon against specific target proximity fuse emerged on battlefields of europe in late december 1944 used to great effect in anti aircraft projectiles proximity fuses were fielded in both european and pacific theatres of operations they were particularly useful against v 1 flying bombs and kamikaze planes although widely used in naval warfare and in anti air guns both british and americans feared unexploded proximity fuses would be reverse engineered leading to them limiting its use in continental battles during battle of bulge however fuses became known as american artillery s christmas present for german army because of their effectiveness against german personnel in open when they frequently dispersed attacks anti tank guns were also tremendously improved during war in 1939 british used primarily 2 pounder and 6 pounder guns by end of war 17 pounders had proven much more effective against german tanks and 32 pounders had entered development meanwhile german tanks were continuously upgraded with better main guns in addition to other improvements for example panzer iii was originally designed with a 37 mm gun but was mass produced with a 50 mm cannon to counter threat of russian t 34s another more powerful 50 mm gun was introduced only to give way to a larger 75 mm cannon which was in a fixed mount as stug iii most produced german world war ii armoured fighting vehicle of any type green p 47 despite improved guns production of panzer iii was ended in 1943 as tank still could not match t 34 and was replaced by panzer iv and panther tanks in 1944 8 8 cm kwk 43 and many variations entered service with wehrmacht and was used as both a tank main gun and as pak 43 anti tank gun one of most powerful guns to see service in world war ii it was capable of destroying any allied tank at very long ranges thumb right firing her guns despite being designed to fire at trajectories with a steep angle of descent howitzers can be fired directly as was done by 11th marine regiment at battle of chosin reservoir during korean war two field batteries fired directly upon a battalion of chinese infantry marines were forced to brace themselves against their howitzers as they had no time to dig them in chinese infantry took heavy casualties and were forced to retreat thumb left a 5 inch 127 mm 54 calibre mark 45 gun being fired from tendency to create larger calibre cannon during world wars has reversed since united states army for example sought a lighter more versatile howitzer to replace their ageing pieces as it could be towed m198 was selected to be successor to world war ii era cannon used at time and entered service in 1979 still in use today m198 is in turn being slowly replaced by howitzer which weighs nearly half as much and can be more easily moved although land based artillery such as m198 are powerful long ranged and accurate naval guns have not been neglected despite being much smaller than in past and in some cases having been replaced by cruise missiles however s planned armament includes advanced gun system ags a pair of 155 mm guns which fire long range land attack projectile warhead which weighs has a circular error of probability of and will be mounted on a rocket to increase effective range to further than that of paris gun ags s barrels will be water cooled and will fire 10 rounds per minute per gun combined firepower from both turrets will give a zumwalt class destroyer firepower equivalent to 18 conventional m198 howitzers reason for re integration of cannon as a main armament in united states navy ships is because satellite guided munitions fired from a gun are less expensive than a cruise missile but have a similar guidance capability autocannon thumb right a large bore maxim on c 1898 autocannons have an automatic firing mode similar to that of a machine gun they have mechanisms to automatically load their ammunition and therefore have a higher rate of fire than artillery often approaching or in case of rotary autocannons even surpassing firing rate of a machine gun while there is no minimum bore for autocannons they are generally larger than machine guns typically 20 mm or greater since world war ii and are usually capable of using explosive ammunition even if it isn t always used machine guns in contrast are usually too small to use explosive ammunition most nations use rapid fire cannon on light vehicles replacing a more powerful but heavier tank gun a typical autocannon is 25 mm bushmaster chain gun mounted on lav 25 and m2 bradley armoured vehicles autocannons may be capable of a very high rate of fire but ammunition is heavy and bulky limiting amount carried for this reason both 25 mm bushmaster and 30 mm are deliberately designed with relatively low rates of fire typical rate of fire for a modern autocannon ranges from 90 to 1 800 rounds per minute systems with multiple barrels such as a rotary autocannon can have rates of fire of more than several thousand rounds per minute fastest of these is gsh 6 23 which has a rate of fire of over 10 000 rounds per minute autocannons are often found in aircraft where they replaced machine guns and as shipboard anti aircraft weapons as they provide greater destructive power than machine guns aircraft use thumb westland c o w gun fighter with 37mm c o w gun mounted to fire upwards first documented installation of a cannon on an aircraft was on voisin canon in 1911 displayed at paris exposition that year by world war i all of major powers were experimenting with aircraft mounted cannon however their low rate of fire and great size and weight precluded any of them from being anything other than experimental most successful or least unsuccessful was spad 12 ca 1 with a single 37mm mounted to fire between cylinder banks and through propeller boss of aircraft s hispano suiza 8c pilot by necessity an ace had to manually reload each round thumb left supermarine spitfire with 20 mm cannon protruding from leading edge of wing first autocannon were developed during world war i as anti aircraft guns and one of these coventry ordnance works cow 37 mm gun was installed in an aircraft but war ended before it could be given a field trial and never became standard equipment in a production aircraft later trials had it fixed at a steep angle upwards in both vickers type 161 and westland c o w gun fighter an idea that would return later thumb left gsh 23 autocannon mounted on underside of a mikoyan gurevich mig 23 during this period autocannons became available and several fighters of german luftwaffe and imperial japanese navy air service were fitted with 20mm cannon they continued to be installed as an adjunct to machine guns rather than as a replacement as rate of fire was still too low and complete installation too heavy there was a some debate in raf as to whether greater number of possible rounds being fired from a machine gun or a smaller number of explosive rounds from a cannon was preferable improvements during war in regards to rate of fire allowed cannon to displace machine gun almost entirely cannon was more effective against armour so they were increasingly used during course of world war ii and newer fighters such as hawker tempest usually carried two or four versus six 50 browning machine guns for us aircraft or eight to twelve m1919 browning machine guns on earlier british aircraft hispano suiza hs 404 oerlikon 20 mm cannon mg ff and their numerous variants became among most widely used autocannon in war cannon as with machine guns were generally fixed to fire forwards mounted in wings in nose or fuselage or in a under either or were mounted in gun turrets on heavier aircraft both germans and japanese mounted cannon to fire upwards and forwards for use against heavy bombers with germans calling guns so installed schrage musik schrage musik derives from german colloquialism for jazz music german word schrag means slanted or oblique thumb right upright gau 8 a avenger rotary cannon mounted in a fairchild a 10 thunderbolt ii preceding vietnam war high speeds aircraft were attaining led to a move to remove cannon due to mistaken belief that they would be useless in a dogfight but combat experience during vietnam war showed conclusively that despite advances in missiles there was still a need for them nearly all modern fighter aircraft are armed with an autocannon and they are also commonly found on ground attack aircraft one of most powerful examples is 30mm gau 8 a avenger gatling type rotary cannon mounted exclusively on fairchild republic a 10 thunderbolt ii lockheed ac 130 gunship a converted transport can carry a 105mm howitzer as well as a variety of autocannons ranging up to 40mm both are used in close air support role materials parts and terms thumb center 800px side elevation of a typical 19th century cannon cannon in general have form of a truncated cone with an internal cylindrical bore for holding an explosive charge and a projectile thickest strongest and closed part of cone is located near explosive charge as any explosive charge will dissipate in all directions equally thickest portion of cannon is useful for containing and directing this force backward motion of cannon as its projectile leaves bore is termed its recoil and effectiveness of cannon can be measured in terms of how much this response can be diminished though obviously diminishing recoil through increasing overall mass of cannon means decreased mobility field artillery cannon in europe and americas were initially made most often of bronze though later forms were constructed of cast iron and eventually steel bronze has several characteristics that made it preferable as a construction material although it is relatively expensive does not always alloy well and can result in a final product that is spongy about bore bronze is more flexible than iron and therefore less prone to bursting when exposed to high pressure cast iron cannon are less expensive and more durable generally than bronze and withstand being fired more times without deteriorating however cast iron cannon have a tendency to burst without having shown any previous weakness or wear and this makes them more dangerous to operate older and more stable forms of cannon were muzzle loading as opposed to breech loading in order to be used they had to have their ordnance packed down bore through muzzle rather than inserted through breech following terms refer to components or aspects of a classical western cannon c 1850 as illustrated here in what follows words near close and behind will refer to those parts towards thick closed end of piece and far front in front of and before to thinner open end negative spaces bore hollow cylinder bored down centre of cannon including base of bore or bottom of bore nearest end of bore into which ordnance wadding shot etc gets packed diameter of bore represents cannon s calibre chamber cylindrical conical or spherical recess at nearest end of bottom of bore into which gunpowder is packed vent a thin tube on near end of cannon connecting explosive charge inside with an ignition source outside and often filled with a length of fuse always located near breech sometimes called fuse hole or touch hole on top of vent on outside of cannon is a flat circular space called vent field where charge is lit if cannon is bronze it will often have a vent piece made of copper screwed into length of vent solid spaces main body of a cannon consists of three basic extensions foremost and longest is called chase middle portion is reinforce and closest and briefest portion is cascabel or chase simply entire conical part of cannon in front of reinforce it is longest portion of cannon and includes following elements neck narrowest part of chase always located near foremost end of piece muzzle portion of chase forward of neck it includes following swell of muzzle refers to slight swell in diameter of piece at very end of chase it is often chamfered on inside to make loading cannon easier in some guns this element is replaced with a wide ring and is called a muzzle band face is flat vertical plane at foremost edge of muzzle and of entire piece muzzle mouldings are tiered rings which connect face with rest of muzzle first of which is called lip and second fillet muzzle astragal and fillets are a series of three narrow rings running around outside of chase just behind neck sometimes also collectively called chase ring chase astragal and fillets these are a second series of such rings located at near end of chase chase girdle this is brief length of chase between chase astragal and fillets and reinforce reinforce this portion of piece is frequently divided into a first reinforce and a second reinforce but in any case is marked as separate from chase by presence of a narrow circular reinforce ring or band at its foremost end span of reinforce also includes following trunnions are located at foremost end of reinforce just behind reinforce ring they consist of two cylinders perpendicular to bore and below it which are used to mount cannon on its carriage are short broad rings located at union of trunnions and cannon which provide support to carriage attachment reinforce band is only present if cannon has two reinforces and it divides first reinforce from second breech refers to mass of solid metal behind bottom of bore extending to base of breech and including base ring it also generally refers to end of cannon opposite muzzle i e location where explosion of gunpowder begins as opposed to opening through which pressurized gas escapes base ring forms a ring at widest part of entire cannon at nearest end of reinforce just before cascabel cascabel this is that portion of cannon behind reinforce s and behind base ring it includes following knob which is small spherical terminus of piece neck a short narrow piece of metal holding out knob and fillet tiered disk connecting neck of cascabel to base of breech base of breech is metal disk that forms most forward part of cascabel and rests against breech itself right next to base ring to pack a muzzle loading cannon first gunpowder is poured down bore this is followed by a layer of wadding often nothing more than paper and then cannonball itself a certain amount of windage allows ball to fit down bore though greater windage less efficient propulsion of ball when gunpowder is ignited to fire cannon fuse located in vent is lit quickly burning down to gunpowder which then explodes violently propelling wadding and ball down bore and out of muzzle a small portion of exploding gas also escapes through vent but this does not dramatically affect total force exerted on ball any large smoothbore muzzle loading gun used before advent of breech loading rifled guns may be referred to as a cannon though once standardised names were assigned to different sized cannon term specifically referred to a gun designed to fire a shot as distinct from a demi cannon culverin or demi culverin gun specifically refers to a type of cannon that fires projectiles at high speeds and usually at relatively low angles they have been used in warships and as field artillery term cannon is also used for autocannon a modern repeating weapon firing explosive projectiles cannon have been used extensively in fighter aircraft since world war ii operation thumb parts of a cannon described in john roberts compleat london 1652 thumb firing of a field gun of early 17th century with a in 1770s cannon operation worked as follows each cannon would be manned by two gunners six soldiers and four officers of artillery right gunner was to prime piece and load it with powder and left gunner would fetch powder from magazine and be ready to fire cannon at officer s command on each side of cannon three soldiers stood to ram and sponge cannon and hold ladle second soldier on left tasked with providing 50 bullets before loading cannon would be cleaned with a wet sponge to extinguish any smouldering material from last shot fresh powder could be set off prematurely by lingering ignition sources powder was added followed by wadding of paper or hay and ball was placed in and rammed down after ramming cannon would be aimed with elevation set using a quadrant and a plummet at 45 degrees ball had utmost range about ten times gun s level range any angle above a horizontal line was called random shot wet sponges were used to cool pieces every ten or twelve rounds thumb firing of a 6 pound cannon during napoleonic wars a british gun team consisted of five gunners to aim it clean bore with a damp sponge to quench any remaining embers before a fresh charge was introduced and another to load gun with a bag of powder and then projectile fourth gunner pressed his thumb on vent hole to prevent a draught that might fan a flame charge loaded fourth would prick bagged charge through vent hole and fill vent with powder on command fifth gunner would fire piece with a slow match friction primers replaced slow match ignition by mid 19th century when a cannon had to be abandoned such as in a retreat or surrender touch hole of cannon would be plugged flush with an iron spike disabling cannon at least until metal boring tools could be used to remove plug this was called spiking cannon a gun was said to be honeycombed when surface of bore had cavities or holes in it griffiths artillerist s manual 53 caused either by corrosion or casting defects deceptive use historically logs or poles have been used as decoys to mislead enemy as to strength of an emplacement quaker gun trick was used by colonel william washington s continental army during american revolutionary war in 1780 approximately 100 loyalists surrendered to them rather than face bombardment during american civil war quaker guns were also used by confederates to compensate for their shortage of artillery decoy cannon were painted black at muzzle and positioned behind fortifications to delay union attacks on those positions on occasion real gun carriages were used to complete deception in popular culture cannon sounds have sometimes been used in classical pieces with a military theme one of best known examples of such a piece is pyotr ilyich tchaikovsky s 1812 overture overture is to be performed using an artillery section together with orchestra resulting in noise levels high enough that musicians are required to wear ear protection cannon fire simulates russian artillery bombardments of battle of borodino a critical battle in napoleon s invasion of russia whose defeat piece celebrates when overture was first performed cannon were fired by an electric current triggered by conductor however overture was not recorded with real cannon fire until mercury records and conductor antal dorati s 1958 recording of minnesota orchestra cannon fire is also frequently used annually in presentations of 1812 on american independence day a tradition started by arthur fiedler of boston pops in 1974 hard rock band ac dc also used cannon in their song for those about to rock we salute you and in live shows replica napoleonic cannon and pyrotechnics were used to perform piece restoration cannons recovered from sea are often extensively damaged from exposure to salt water because of this electrolytic reduction treatment is required to forestall process of corrosion cannon is then washed in deionized water to remove electrolyte and is treated in tannic acid which prevents further rust and gives metal a bluish black colour after this process cannon on display may be protected from oxygen and moisture by a wax sealant a coat of polyurethane may also be painted over wax sealant to prevent wax coated cannon from attracting dust in outdoor displays in 2011 archaeologists say six cannon
