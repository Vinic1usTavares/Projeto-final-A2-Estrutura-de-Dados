first and only credit for series to date episode featured guest actress gillian jacobs as kidnapper joanne ostler jacobs explained her character s motivations i m a very mysterious figure and at beginning of episode you see that i have taken this boy have kidnapped him i have taken him to this room and have him hooked him up to these ekg machines i m trying to get him to finish writing this piano piece which i need to help solve an equation it s very important to me horder payton considered confrontation between olivia and joanne to be former s first big fight scene she added it s been well choreographed and they ve been practicing for several weeks according to torv she and jacobs broke moves down really simply and then put them together into really small little bits director called it a pretty violent and quite messy fight to which first assistant director colin maclellan added it s a pretty phenomenal brawl actually to have two women kick crap out of each other first season dvd includes several scenes that were omitted from final cut of episode first centers on walter waking up in middle of night explaining to a disgruntled peter that he s attempting to shift my circadian rhythm to nocturnal cycle other scene shows olivia and peter playing poker which leads her to realize an important part of episode s case themes and analysis flashing multicolored lights specifically red and green are a consistent theme of first season with into looking glass exploring worlds of fringe author sarah clarke stuart calling them noteworthy recurring images they can also be seen in computer graphics of observer s binoculars as well as during second and third seasons as a way to distinguish two universes character of walter goes through much development during first season stuart believed that he changes most out of main cast and his return to st claire s reflects this progression actor john noble explained his character s evolution in a november 2008 interview we see walter from a different angle very vulnerable he goes back to asylum again and we see very very fearful man return for a while although he does have some wonderful moments earlier in episode when he goes back inside he turns into this incredibly fearful stuttering fellow that we saw when we first met him it s a very interesting journey we see walter go through in episode walter sees himself several times while staying in mental institution many reviewers expressed curiosity about this visitor or second walter after looking through walter s lab notes released by fox after each episode ramsey isler of ign speculated that walter suffered from a multiple personality disorder while aol tv s jane boursaw thought it was either an hallucination or his alternate universe counterpart reception ratings equation first broadcast on fox network in united states on november 18 2008 it was watched by an estimated 9 18 million viewers earning a 4 1 10 ratings share among adults aged 18 to 49 meaning that it was seen by 4 4 percent of all 18 to 49 year olds and 11 percent of all 18 to 49 year olds watching television at time of broadcast episode also received a 5 6 8 ratings share among all households fringe and its lead in show house m d helped fox win night in adult demographic as it was fringes highest rating since season s second episode it was fox s fifth ranked show for week reviews episode received mixed to positive reviews from television critics fearnet columnist alyse wax called it a pretty good episode and believed it to be far more enjoyable than last week s as it lacked that episode s conspiracy nonsense and john scott storyline however wax continued that equation seemed rather pedestrian because nothing too freaky happened and wished that walter and peter had been used more jane boursaw of aol tv considered walter s return to asylum heartbreaking ign s travis fickett rated equation 7 5 10 and called it a solid episode despite a few perceived plotholes he liked walter and peter s actions in asylum and concluded at this point whether a solid single episode is enough to keep you watching fringe likely has to do with your overall patience with series and whatever its ultimate goals might be erin dougherty of cinema blend called it best episode since same old story since it contained suspense and drama and a minimal amount of conspiracy theories making her feel seriously giddy while still calling it entertaining she disliked walter seeing himself in asylum believing it was really strange and didn t go with flow of story a v club writer noel murray graded episode with a b explaining that he believed it to be mainly an original story what kept him from promoting it to elusive a level something no fringe episode has yet done for me was ending which was like something out of dozens of mediocre cop shows despite this murray found it and asylum storyline to be compelling conversely ugo networks was critical of episode writing fringe continues to wobble in story quality last night s episode was a perfectly good way to waste an hour but far off track of last week s episodes episode featured some plot conveniences that were a bit hard to swallow references works cited external links equation at fox category 2008 american television episodes category fringe season 1 episodes
