that final season he played rarely he took part in early rounds of copa del rey and in group stage of champions league as atletico finished third in their group and dropped into europa league but made

for which he received lengthy treatment in tenth minute of resultant stoppage time chris wood scored a winning goal for birmingham pablo had replaced injured curtis davies in starting eleven but concussion sustained at brugge gave davies time to regain fitness and his undisputed starting place alongside steven caldwell in central defence after caldwell s season ended early through injury pablo returned to team for last few games including play off semi final defeat and finished 62 game season with 17 starts of which only 7 came in league davies and caldwell began 2012 13 season as first choice until an ankle injury sustained by davies during a league cup match at coventry city gave pablo an early opportunity to impress he kept his place after davies returned to fitness but chipped a bone in his foot in defeat to barnsley and was expected to be out for a month further injuries return to fitness of caldwell and emergence of young left back mitch hancox which allowed paul robinson to partner davies in centre meant that pablo played only twice more and he was released at end of his contract international career after only a few segunda division matches pablo received his first call up to spanish under 21 team for a friendly match against bulgaria on 19 november 2002 despite media s assumption that he would be among substitutes he played whole match as spain won 7

against france in february 2008 style of play pablo is tall good in air and as a younger player was noted for his pace albacete teammate miquel suggested that those key attributes made him worst thing that could happen to a forward his coach at both albacete and atletico cesar ferrando said he had all qualities needed for his position which included anticipation and intelligence to keep things simple again according to ferrando pablo rarely fouled because he doesn t need to he has a whole arsenal of defensive resources a 2006 world cup profile suggested he was much happier on ball than first impressions may suggest and could look ungainly a scout s assessment of his running style as ugly reportedly discouraged real madrid from pursuing an early interest in him in later years he used his experience in 2012 birmingham mail suggested that in contrast to more aggressive and animated steven caldwell pablo tends to be subtle in his positioning and tackling he likes to read game rather than go head to head in a gladiatorial battle personal life pablo married in albacete cathedral in 2007 as of december 2010 couple had one son adrian and one daughter paula in 2008 provincial
