olivia returns having found no leads on peter s location farnsworth returns walter to his home where observer watches from a distance and notes peter s disappearance production episode was originally called overture but was later changed to brown betty as a reference to walter s marijuana habit it was written by executive producers jeff pinkner and j h wyman along with consulting producer akiva goldsman seith mann served as director his only directional credit for series for sweeps week fox network announced fox rocks campaign in which various shows within their lineup were encouraged to produce musical episodes in same vein as sophomore show glee along with fringe family guy bones simpsons and a few other fox series took up musical theme episode was already in development before fox s announcement jeff pinkner stated that music was not in original plan for episode but was added to fit into fox s sweeps stunt as episode occurred after big reveal of peter s true identity man from other side writers knew they wanted brown betty to explore aftermath from walter s damaged psyche fox did not ask for a full blown musical but requested that some music be integrated into episode in any shape or form pinkner elaborated we came up with a narrative device to really explore walter s feelings we had largely all elements of episode in place and fox called and said hey how would you guys feel about if we asked you to have some musical element in show anything like just feature a song playing they didn t ask us to do glee and we instantly before we got off phone said well this is what we re thinking for episode and here s an idea how that could work for us we turned their request into what felt like a positive for us and really deepened and sort of blew episode out even further in direction we were already taking it episode begins with walter smoking his own strain of marijuana while listening to roundabout by band yes scene was originally removed out of concern it would be airing on network television but was later reinserted because story itself had so many different genres playing we had a noir element we had a musical element and it just really played funnier coming from an altered state of walter according to co producer tanya swerling jeff pinkner added we set out to do an episode that explored walter s state of mind he s dealing with some very upsetting news when we realized that way walter would deal with such news would be to try to anesthetize himself with copious amounts of marijuana well singing and dancing became a natural outcome music supervisor charles scott iv and j r wyman are big yes fans and consequently chose song that appeared in opening scene as episode was done with a 1940s aesthetic every department had to act accordingly torv s normally straight hair was placed into a curl hairdo fashionable for time period and lighting changes were made to reflect period as well new furniture was brought in for various sets such as walter s lab and nina s office at massive dynamic which was then removed in preparation for following week ending was a challenge for producers as it was supposed to end with ella s version of story conclusion and walter still feeling upset over peter s absence but they felt this ended making viewers feel depressed they debated ways to make it a happier tone so wyman added observer scene to change feeling of episode and prepare viewers for next week as guest actor leonard nimoy who plays william bell was unavailable to shoot brief conversation with blair brown s nina sharp producers knew they wanted to do something a little more creative for scene they talked to cartoonist frank miller and hired a special effects school to do all modeling which they accomplished based on photos of nimoy because actor could not come in to have his head scanned he did some voicework however finished scene included an animated version of nimoy s head shown through same window as one used in peter pinkner thought added musical element improved episode because it gave insights into each of characters psyches according to wyman and pinkner episode was supposed to be a fantastical episode in first place and so music supports storytelling wyman continued in a different interview with los angeles times that noirs traditionally are morality tales and that s kind of what we re doing we felt that that was a great way to get across walter s mind frame and where his head is at right now with his son missing other cast members also praised added music john noble wrote it really deepened and blew episode out even further in direction we were already taking we get walter s fractured take on world and his condition now that peter has left music really supports storytelling he added it is like a mind trip of walter s it is walter trying to grapple with fact that his son is gone jasika nicole continued i have a musical theater background so i ve been waiting for some moment in some realm of where i am in tv and film for this to happen and you know of course when glee came on air i was like great that was my chance and i m in this show which i love this show but i m never going to sing and dance in this show and i did it s so awesome swerling called it longest and possibly most difficult episode of season to create as with other fringe episodes fox released a science lesson plan for grade school children focusing on science seen in brown betty with intention of having students learn about fingerprints and how they can be collected and used as evidence to identify an individual music co music supervisor billy gottlieb called episode a little mini feature film in sense that we had a lot of camera performances with music in order to get best performances out of cast and be able to shoot scenes in various different ways producers had actors go into a music studio in vancouver and record their respective musical numbers according to gottlieb actors were very nervous about singing in episode despite their parts being around a mere 40 seconds actor joshua jackson who plays peter bishop was adamant that he not sing in episode despite fact he frequently sings on set causing him to be one of few cast members with no musical part as original script contained no musical number for jasika nicole she emailed jeff pinkner specifically asking him to let her sing which he then approved some critics noted their surprise that tony award winning actor michael cerveris did not sing in episode producers were initially going to have him sing django reinhardt s blue moon but changed their minds because they thought it would be better to keep observer out of musical aspect of episode despite pre recordings audio used in episode was taken from actors actually singing on set tanya swerling believed recordings were not a wasted effort however as it helped make actors more comfortable about singing on set at end of shooting gottlieb believed everybody was great they could jump on stage and do broadway and it wouldn t be a problem for any of them he and other crew members called jasika nicole probably most accomplished musical person of cast as one of episode writers akiva goldsman chose stevie wonder song for once in my life on composing episode s score chris tilton cited chinatown as a big influence and commented idea was to have this noir feel but still not be totally away from fringe episode featured excerpted music from following tracks yes roundabout heard in background tears for fears head over heels also sung by walter and lip synched by rachel traffic s low spark of high heeled boys played on piano and sung by broyles a chorus line s i hope i get it sung by astrid willy wonka chocolate factory s candy man sung by singing corpses and later by walter miles davis freddie freeloader played at peter house stevie wonder s for once in my life sung by olivia ella fitzgerald s blue moon heard in background and also danced by peter and olivia reception ratings brown betty was watched by 5 551 million viewers in united states with a 3 4 share out 5 among all households and a 2 0 6 share of audience aged 18 49 episode fell five percent from previous week reviews episode premiered to generally positive reviews although initially cringing over musical premise ramsey isler of ign called episode admittedly fun because it gave us an indirect window to view how walter feels about himself in a review of dvd another critic from ign later called it worst overall episode of season however asking question musical numbers and olivia dunham who thought this would be a good idea ken tucker of entertainment weekly was also initially irritated after hearing fox s musical plans and consequently gave fringe a lot of credit for pulling off this hour so cleverly jennifer walker from tv fanatic thought episode was bizarre to watch it held our interest for entire 60 minutes but really failed to introduce any new information about peter and unknown man that has crossed into our dimension mtv s john wigler loved noir element and thought each and every participating fringe cast member exhibited great musical ability overall it was a very solid effort on everyone s part jane boursaw of tv squad loved scenes between walter and ella and thought it was downright brilliant to create a story within a story while he praised episode s production and singing abilities of cast kurt anthony krug of mania com wrote a negative review all in all what was supposed to be a fun filler episode before question of where peter went at end of last episode when he found out he was peter from an alternate reality one of turning points in show s mythology fell flat sarah stegall of sfscope enjoyed it writing there was just enough music and just enough dance to season this story without overburdening it she praised it took to make episode edgy and whimsical casting aside concrete conventions of television storytelling not only was it entertaining but it moved storyline forward on some important emotional fronts as characters deal with peter s disappearance in ways that protect them but reveal as well andrew hanson from los angeles times also was impressed with cast s singing abilities and praised writers risk taking that just goes to show how well thought out creative and just plain fun tonight s fringe really was a lot of people would have pegged a 1940s film noir musical episode as a big risk but bigger risk bigger pay out rhee dee of pinkraygun com commented after revelation in last episode and peter running away this episode was a great way to express walter s grief and guilt about this whole situation without actually watching walter talk about how sad and guilty he feels about everything walter s story serves as a powerful metaphor for how he actually feels tim grierson of new york magazine thought episode turned out to be simply mediocre because its noir elements weren t incorporated in a really interesting way and as for musical numbers they tended to be throwaway bits save for fictional dunham crooning for once in my life to seemingly dying fictional peter near episode s end grierson continued that if a show is going to completely throw away its usual rulebook for a fun onetime only episode it would be great if writers could come up with a story as audacious as their premise but aside from some chinatown references fancy threads and mildly clever mirroring of show s mythology massive dynamic is up to no good in this story land world as well brown betty wasn t all that enjoyable because it didn t do a great job of capturing what generally makes fringe enjoyable noel murray of a v club graded episode an a while television without pity gave it a c jeff jensen of entertainment weekly named it fourth best episode of series explaining late season lark that officially launched a tradition for similar stunts musical film noir homage brown betty was an offbeat gem that expressed all of fringes core themes redemption connection and encapsulated key relationships slow moving walter peter reconciliation peter and olivia s carefully tended soul deep romance more poignantly than most on point episodes of fringe and it left fans wanting show to keep pushing innovation it could never do it enough in a similar list den of geek named it ninth best episode of series explaining that it shouldn t work and yet it does because although technically nothing happens episode shows us just how deep walter has sunk into a metaphorical pit of despair and guilt making himself villain in his own story and despairing of ever being forgiven it also gives audience a refreshing break from some of high level angst of end of season allowing peter and olivia to act out a properly romantic storyline while their characters in real world have been torn apart also there are singing corpses in it only on fringe awards and nominations brown betty
