producers alongside chris shaw majority of songs on rings around world were written by rhys on guitar and piano with keyboardist cian ciaran contributing a touch sensitive and miniature as well as collaborating with other members of band on run christian run alternate route to vulcan street and no sympathy ex beatle paul mccartney and former velvet underground member john cale make cameo appearances on album musically rings around world is an eclectic record incorporating pop prog punk jungle electronica techno and death metal rhys has offered several explanations of album s lyrical content claiming record is about earth and pollution of space and also that it addresses human condition critics meanwhile have referred to record as thematically eccentric and lacking an overarching theme critical reception was generally positive with album being nominated for 2001 s mercury music prize and placing at number one in mojo s best albums of 2001 feature some reviews claimed it to be best record of band s career although nme described it as band s worst album origins and recording rings around world was super furry animals first album for epic records following demise in 1999 of their previous label creation and success of 2000 s mwng which was issued on band s own label placid casual singer gruff rhys has stated that band aimed to make a laid back and sort of wiped clean record with rings in a 2008 interview with uncut rhys described album as a very ambitious project stating that we were trying to make a blockbuster album that was going to be like eagles we were trying to make utopian pop music that had pretensions of being progressive and exciting rings was originally going to be called text messaging is destroying pub quiz as we know it and released as a double album containing 75 90 minutes of material with rhys stating that he was into excess of it that was whole point group eventually decided against idea but drawn by technical capabilities of format and desire to do something that had never been done before produced a dvd version of rings making it first album to be simultaneously released on cd and dvd dvd features a surround sound mix alongside music videos and remixes and was made possible only by financial backing of epic recording sessions began in april 2000 at monnow valley studios in rockfield monmouthshire wales with co producer chris shaw and engineer eric tew band moved to bearsville studios new york before returning to monnow valley some months later where recording was completed in september 2000 bearsville was chosen because of its drum and live rooms which band felt were desirable as they were using more microphones to capture audio for surround sound mix included on dvd version of album than they would normally when simply recording in stereo group were mindful of capabilities of surround sound and recorded sub bass on tracks such as a touch sensitive and juxtapozed with u which could only be heard through a low frequency subwoofer channel in surround mix band recorded onto two inch analogue tape until they had a take they were happy with then transferred results to pro tools where individual songs were edited and overdubs were added according to keyboardist cian ciaran this meant band could edit some beats very precisely like gated kicks at end of track sidewalk serfer girl once they were happy with a song group then transferred it back to tape before mixing took place as they liked tape sound right thumb alt a man with a skinhead haircut sat in front of a musical keyboard he is

keyboardist cian ciaran contributed two tracks to rings around world and collaborated with other members of band on several more rhys wrote many of tracks on album on acoustic guitar and piano and brought them to band either as fully formed songs or as ideas which group would then jam out ciaran wrote songs a touch sensitive and miniature and intro and outro of run christian run a jam between cian and guitarist huw bunford resulted in rings around world s opening track alternate route to vulcan street pair looped a sample of drummer dafydd ieuan playing bass drum and snare and recorded themselves playing along on piano and guitar into a sampler they then chopped playing up a bit and filtered drums and guitar to give them more movement finally rhys wrote lyrics and a string arrangement was added by sean o hagan cian also contributed second part of song no sympathy sampling mellow acoustic guitars from first half to create a techno climactic ending sessions for rings around world saw band concentrating on arrangements particularly their vocal harmonies on previous albums individual members of group would keep singing until they came up with harmonies that worked but encouraged by co producer chris shaw for rings band took time to work out harmonies in advance group used piano keyboards or whatever was available to give themselves a starting note before five band members and staff at recording studio began trying ideas out occasionally auto tune was used to re pitch existing lines to see if different versions of them would counterpoint correctly with band then learning new vocal lines and recording them as they did not want to use auto tune on finished album paul mccartney is credited as providing celery and carrot on track receptacle for respectable mccartney is alleged to have performed a similar role over thirty years earlier chewing celery to form percussion track of beach boys song vegetables from album smiley smile super furry animals had met ex beatle at nme awards when a drunk ciaran persuaded him to let them remix some beatles material resulting in 2000 s liverpool sound collage album band asked him to return favour and appear on rings around world recording his part over phone huw bunford has said of mccartney s contribution he took it with good nature you kind of see how far you can go sometimes we figured we already had a bass and singers so we really didn t need any more musicians so we figured he could crunch vegetables former velvet underground member john cale a sort of childhood hero of rhys s also makes an appearance on album playing piano on song presidential suite super furry animals had met cale in cardiff when they acted as his backing band for a song which appeared on film beautiful mistake they originally asked him to arrange strings for presidential suite but cale turned them down reasoning that he would simply do what band do hum a melody to someone who could write music down for him musical style rings around world is very cinematic and falls somewhere between super furry animals 1999 album instantaneous easy to grasp and almost disposable guerrilla and its exact opposite 2000 s mwng band combined technology they used for former with simplicity of latter which featured just band playing in studio singer gruff rhys has described album as band s cosmic rock record album is a kaleidoscopic blend of pop prog punk psych and electronica drowned in sound describes it as similar to guerrilla with beach boys esque psychedelic pop put to techno undertones while nme has called rings around world an expensive glossy production lush and widescreen and suggested that it reaches for an effect so modern that at times it sounds like it could ve been made in 80s first single juxtapozed with u is reminiscent of both philadelphia soul music of 1970s and plastic approximation of that music on david bowie s 1975 album young americans while no sympathy has been described as missing link between crosby stills nash young harmonies jungle hi hats and berserk sampler techno dallas observer compared it s not end of world to tunes such as kinks waterloo sunset dennis wilson s forever and jack bruce s theme for an imaginary western while big issue called sidewalk serfer girl surf punk electro pop elsewhere on album eclectic range of sounds continues from trip hop of a touch sensitive to status quo esque drawing rings around world and electro country rock of run christian run track receptacle for respectable reflects eclecticism of album as it undergoes a complete personality change over course of its four minute thirty two second duration veering from prog rock to death metal song begins as an acoustic guitar driven pop song and then shifts into a slower bridge section which leads to an even slower coda which has been compared to music of burt bacharach and beach boys smiley smile album and features paul mccartney chewing carrots and celery to beat track ends with a pantomime death metal section with rhys s distorted bellowed vocals screaming title phrase according to cian ciaran song initially comprised just first two parts when recorded at monnow valley studios but by time group relocated to bearsville studios rhys had written and added third section while there band added fourth section by pissing about with pro tools looping bass from end of third section by accident to create musical backing a fifth hip hop section was discussed but band decided against it reasoning that if you re going to do a fifth bit you d probably do a sixth and before you know where you are you re doing a concept album made up of nothing but bits according to band track is only time on album where they tried to achieve comedy and completely went with their silly streak lyrical themes right thumb alt a man with long bushy dark brown hair and a short beard playing acoustic guitar while singing into a microphone and looking to his right away from camera he is seen from knees upwards and is wearing a brown jacket with a red and blue embroidered pattern on right shoulder chief lyricist gruff rhys has described songs on rings around world as broodier and more revealing than those on 1999 s guerrilla singer and chief lyric writer gruff rhys has given several explanations of lyrical themes present on album he has claimed that record is about earth and pollution of space it s about debris and that it was originally going to be a state of planet concept album before band decided against it rhys has also stated that album is about human condition citing tracks such as fragile happiness and receptacle for respectable as examples critics have referred to album as thematically eccentric and lacking an overarching theme with independent claiming it leaps from religious fundamentalists to modern telecommunications and old hollywood star system with disorienting glee in contrast with 1999 s guerrilla which featured songs with self consciously disposable happy lyrics tracks on rings around world are according to rhys broodier and more revealing track no sympathy was originally written for a film entitled which followed three unsympathetic characters who lived for a week as though it were their last rhys has described song as quite a departure for him as a lyric writer and claimed that out of context it could appear bleak and scary presidential suite about former united states and russian presidents bill clinton and boris yeltsin is a reflective look back at decadent nineties during lewinsky scandal and asks if we need to know if he really came inside her mouth juxtapozed with u addresses social injustice and is about house prices going up and people being left behind by super rich and has been described by rhys as grotesque in its and lift sidewalk serfer girl was initially written about patti white bull a girl who fell into a coma for 15 years awaking in 1999 but became an amalgamation of lyrics of several different songs including one section in which rhys describes his disdain for extreme sports receptacle for respectable is about simultaneously being in awe of and being hurt by a girl around town while it s not end of world is a romantic song about growing old run christian run was influenced by guitarist huw bunford s interest in doomsday cult websites bunford printed out several essays from these websites and gave them to rhys who used them as inspiration for his lyrics along with his own recollections of watching christian television shows during band s american tours album s title track drawing rings around world is based on an idea put forward by rhys girlfriend s father and is about all rings of communication around world all rings of pollution and all radioactivity that goes around shoot doris day refers to shooting american singer and actress doris day with film a very cinematic reference for a song which rhys claims is over top lyrically track is about how people change and also references labour party spin doctor peter mandelson in guise of victor panache dvd dvd of rings around world contains 13 songs featured on cd version of album along with 7 bonus tracks these 20 songs are presented in surround sound and are accompanied by low budget music videos release also includes 16 remixes and interactive menus featuring ambient music created by band according to keyboard player cian ciaran group were worried that doing a dvd might seem elitist because only certain people have dvd players and systems even now but reasoned that most people will have dvd playback systems at home within five years even if it doesn t take off stereo version of album will always be there dvd release received a 15 certificate from british board of film classification meaning that no one under age of 15 could buy or rent it in united kingdom ciaran has stated that super furry animals were very hands on during making of dvd initially band were mainly concerned with sound quality describing presentation of album s tracks in surround sound as radical like change from mono to stereo group directed surround sound mix themselves instructing audio engineers to move instruments and vocal parts between speakers we want that one bit of sound to travel from centre over our heads and finish on my right shoulder let s have main vocal in middle then each harmony in its own speaker they soon became equally as interested in remixes visuals and interactive elements however ciaran has described this process as not always a nice position to be in when for example they had to reject music videos they weren t happy with band asked different directors to make music videos for each song having tried unsuccessfully to make a film to accompany their 1999 album guerrilla themselves according to singer gruff rhys band tended to go for illustrators who could make videos cheaply using flash and artists who like to work directors were asked to make visuals as extreme as possible in an effort to avoid making videos that looked like just another pop promo like mtv and according to ciaran had to work even harder at creating something interesting due to limited budget available many of those who made videos for dvd release had no previous experience of making films resulting in a really fresh kind of scruffy end product according to rhys band made separate music videos for rings around world s three singles as they saw videos included on dvd release of album as pure art whereas they needed promotional videos that were more like adverts for songs rhys has stated that super furry animals felt that fans placed too much emphasis on videos on rings around world rather than concentrating on music as a result of which band used really bland images on dvd release of their next album phantom power although he enjoyed having so much control over project ciaran has claimed that it sometimes felt like it would never end and he was glad to get back to music side of things upon dvd s completion singer gruff rhys has stated that he found being involved with all aspects of dvd release really exciting and particularly enjoyed working with so many people

first truly flawless album and later named it best album of 2001 tiny mix tapes called rings around world one of if not best releases of 2002 describing it as a mixture of sugar pop of yesteryear and modern britpop resulting in a near perfect album rings around world was later nominated for 2001 s mercury music prize in a review for stylus magazine scott plagenhoef wrote that on rings around world band are gleefully working outside of a scene or prototype and dabbling in a world of musical influences and western hegemony playing merry prankster to radiohead s gloom and all with a smile and in three part harmony writing for allmusic stephen thomas erlewine praised record claiming that it shines brightly compared to dead world of mainstream and indie rock in 2001 but expressed disappointment that it is first sfa album not to progress from its predecessor rob brunner of entertainment weekly claimed that at its best album recalls a lost brian wilson style psychedelic marvel but went on to state that it is at times marred by forced eccentricity citing heavy metal gorgon voice booming through receptacle for respectable and awful lite rock homage juxtapozed with u as examples q stated that although songs such as drawing rings around world shoot doris day and presidential suite are excellent album features nothing to change anyone s world while nme claimed that despite containing some great songs it is band s worst album robert christgau of village voice singled out tradewinds as a choice cut indicating a good song on an album that isn t worth your time or money accolades
