uncredited production legal disputes originally meant as first james bond film thunderball was centre of legal disputes that began in 1961 and ran until 2006 former ian fleming collaborators kevin mcclory and jack whittingham sued fleming shortly after 1961 publication of thunderball novel claiming he based it upon screenplay trio had earlier written in a failed cinematic translation of james bond lawsuit was settled out of court mcclory retained certain screen rights to novel s story plot and characters by then bond was a box office success and series producers broccoli and saltzman feared a rival mcclory film beyond their control they agreed to mcclory s producer s credit of a cinematic thunderball with them as executive producers later in 1964 eon producers broccoli and saltzman agreed with mcclory to cinematically adapt novel it was promoted as ian fleming s thunderball yet along with official credits to screenwriters richard maibaum and john hopkins screenplay is also identified as based on an original screenplay by jack whittingham and as based on original story by kevin mcclory jack whittingham and ian fleming to date novel has twice been adapted cinematically 1983 jack schwartzman produced never say never again features sean connery as james bond but is not an eon production casting broccoli s original choice for role of domino derval was julie christie following her performance in billy liar in 1963 upon meeting her personally however he was disappointed and turned his attentions towards raquel welch after seeing her on cover of october 1964 issue of life welch however was hired by richard zanuck of 20th century fox to appear in film fantastic voyage same year instead faye dunaway was also considered for role and came close to signing for part saltzman and broccoli auditioned an extensive list of relatively unknown european actresses and models including former miss italy maria grazia yvonne monlaur of hammer horror films and gloria paul eventually former miss france claudine auger was cast and script was rewritten to make her character french rather than italian although her lines were dubbed in final cut by nikki van der zyl who had voiced several previous bond girls nevertheless director young cast her once again in his next film triple cross 1966 one of actresses who tried for domino luciana paluzzi later accepted role as femme fatale assassin fiona kelly who originally was intended by maibaum to be irish surname was changed to volpe in co ordination with paluzzi s nationality filming guy hamilton was invited to direct but considered himself worn out and creatively drained after production of goldfinger terence young director of first two bond films returned to series coincidentally when saltzman invited him to direct dr no young expressed interest in directing adaptations of dr no from russia with love and thunderball years later young said thunderball was filmed at right time considering that if it was first film in series low budget dr no cost only 1 million would not have yielded good results thunderball was final james bond film directed by young filming commenced on 16 february 1965 with principal photography of opening scene in paris filming then moved to chateau d anet near dreux france for fight in sequence much of film was shot in bahamas thunderball is widely known for its extensive underwater action scenes which are played out through much of latter half of film rest of film was shot at pinewood studios buckinghamshire silverstone racing circuit for chase involving count lippe fiona volpe s rpg armed bsa lightning motorcycle and james bond s aston martin db5 before moving to nassau and paradise island in bahamas where most of footage was shot and miami huntington hartford gave permission to shoot footage on his paradise island and is thanked at end of film thumb home used as largo s estate in film on arriving in nassau mcclory searched for locations to shoot many of key sequences of film and used home of a local millionaire couple sullivans for largo s estate palmyra part of spectre underwater assault was also shot on coastal grounds of another millionaire s home on island most difficult sequences to film were underwater action scenes first to be shot underwater was at a depth of 50 feet to shoot scene where spectre divers remove atomic bombs from sunken vulcan bomber peter lamont had previously visited a royal air force bomber station carrying a concealed camera which he used to get close up shots of secret missiles those appearing in film were not actually present most of underwater scenes had to be done at lower tides due to sharks on bahamian coast after he read script connery realised risk of sequence with sharks in largo s pool and insisted that production designer ken adam build a plexiglas partition inside pool barrier was not a fixed structure so when one of sharks managed to pass through it connery fled pool seconds away from attack ken adam later told uk daily newspaper guardian we had to use special effects but unlike special effects today they were real jet pack we used in thunderball was real it was invented for united states army bloody dangerous and it only lasted a couple of minutes ejector seat in aston martin was real and emilio largo s boat disco volante was real you had power boats at that time but there were no good sized yachts that were able to travel at 40 to 50 knots so it was quite a problem but by combining a hydrofoil which we bought in puerto rico for 10 000 and a catamaran it at least looked like a big yacht we combined two hulls with a one inch slip bolt and when they split it worked like a dream we used lots of sharks for this movie i d rented a villa in bahamas with a saltwater pool which we filled with sharks and used for underwater filming smell was horrendous this was where sean connery came close to being bitten we had a plexiglass corridor to protect him but i didn t have quite enough plexiglass and one of sharks got through he never got out of a pool faster in his life he was walking on water when special effects coordinator john stears provided a supposedly dead shark to be towed around pool shark which was still alive revived at one point due to dangers on set stuntman bill cummings demanded an extra fee of ps250 to double for largo s sidekick quist as he was dropped into pool of sharks climactic underwater battle was shot at clifton pier and was choreographed by hollywood expert ricou browning who had worked on creature from black lagoon in 1954 and other films he was responsible for staging of cave sequence and battle scenes beneath disco volante and called in his specialist team of divers who posed as those engaged in onslaught voit provided much of underwater gear in exchange for product placement and film tie in merchandise lamar boren an underwater photographer was hired to shoot all of sequences united states air force lieutenant colonel charles russhon who had already established eon productions rapports with local authorities in turkey for from russia with love 1963 and at fort knox for goldfinger 1964 supplied experimental rocket fuel used to destroy disco volante russhon using his position was also able to gain access to united states navy s fulton surface to air recovery system used to lift bond and domino from water at end of film filming ceased in may 1965 and final scene shot was physical fight on bridge of disco volante while in nassau during final shooting days special effects supervisor john stears was supplied experimental rocket fuel to use in exploding largo s yacht ignoring true power of volatile liquid stears doused entire yacht with it took cover and then detonated boat resultant massive explosion shattered windows along bay street in nassau roughly 30 miles away stears went on to win an academy award for his work on thunderball as filming neared its conclusion connery had become increasingly agitated with press intrusion and was distracted with difficulties in his marriage of 32 months to actress diane cilento connery refused to speak to journalists and photographers who followed him in nassau stating his frustration with harassment that came with role i find that fame tends to turn one from an actor and a human being into a piece of merchandise a public institution well i don t intend to undergo that metamorphosis in end he gave only a single interview to playboy as filming was wrapped up and even turned down a substantial fee to appear in a promotional tv special made by wolper productions for nbc incredible world of james bond according to editor peter r hunt thunderballs release was delayed for three months from september until december 1965 after he met david picker of united artists and convinced him it would be impossible to edit film to a high enough standard without extra time effects thanks to special effects man john stears thunderball s teaser aston martin db5 introduced in goldfinger reappears armed with rear firing water cannon seeming noticeably weathered just dust and dirt raised moments earlier by bond s landing with bell rocket belt developed by bell aircraft corporation rocket belt bond uses to escape chateau actually worked and was used many times before and after for entertainment most notably at super bowl i and at scheduled performances at 1964 1965 new york world s fair bond receives a spear gun armed underwater jet pack scuba allowing frogman to manoeuvre faster than other frogmen designed by jordan klein green dye was meant to be used by bond as a smoke screen to escape pursuers instead ricou browning film s underwater director used it to make bond s arrival more dramatic sky hook used to rescue bond at end of film was a rescue system used by united states military at time at thunderballs release there was confusion as to whether a rebreather such as one that appears in film existed most bond gadgets while implausible often are based upon real technology in real world a rebreather could not be so small as it has no room for breathing bag while alternative open circuit scuba releases exhalation bubbles which film device does not it was made with two co2 bottles glued together and painted with a small mouthpiece attached for this reason when royal corps of engineers asked peter lamont how long a man could use device underwater answer was as long as you can hold your breath maurice binder was hired to design title sequence and was involved in a dispute with eon productions to have his name credited in film as thunderball was first james bond film shot in panavision binder had to reshoot iconic gun barrel scene which permitted him to not only incorporate pinhole photographic techniques to shoot inside a genuine gun barrel but also made connery appearing in sequence for first time a reality as stunt man bob simmons had doubled for him in three previous films binder gained access to tank at pinewood which he used to film silhouetted title girls who appeared naked in opening sequence which was first time actual nudity although concealed had ever been seen in a bond film on 26 june 2013 christie s auction house sold breitling sa top time watch worn in film by connery for over ps100 000 given to bond by q it was also a geiger counter in plot was third james bond score composed by john barry after from russia with love and goldfinger original title song was entitled mr kiss kiss bang bang taken from an italian journalist who in 1962 dubbed agent 007 as mr kiss kiss bang bang title theme was written by barry and leslie bricusse song was originally recorded by shirley bassey and later rerecorded by dionne warwick whose version was not released until 1990s song was removed from title credits after producers albert r broccoli and harry saltzman were worried that a theme song to a james bond film would not work well if song did not have title of film in its lyrics barry then teamed up with lyricist don black and wrote thunderball which was sung by tom jones who according to bond production legend fainted in recording booth when singing song s final note jones said of it i closed my eyes and i held note for so long when i opened my eyes room was spinning country musician johnny cash also submitted a song to eon productions titled

upon its release film received generally positive reviews dilys powell of sunday times remarked after seeing film that cinema was a duller place before 007 david robinson of financial times criticised appearance of connery and his effectiveness to play bond in film remarking it s not just that sean connery looks a lot more haggard and less heroic than he did two or three years ago but there is much less effort to establish him as connoisseur playboy apart from off handed order for beluga there is little of that comic display of bon manship that was one of charms of connery s almost a gentleman 007 reflective reviews according to danny peary thunderball takes forever to get started and has too many long underwater sequences during which it s impossible to tell what s going on nevertheless it s an enjoyable entry in bond series sean connery is particularly appealing as bond i think he projects more confidence than in other films in series film has no great scene but it s entertaining as long as actors stay above water peary danny 1986 guide for film fanatic simon schuster p 435 critics such as james berardinelli praised connery s performance femme fatale character of fiona volpe and underwater action sequences remarking that they were well choreographed and clearly shot he criticised length of scenes however stating they were in need of editing particularly during film s climax
