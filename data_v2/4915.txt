miniopterus tao is a fossil bat in genus miniopterus from pleistocene of zhoukoudian in china it is known from a number of mandibles lower jaws which were initially identified as living species miniopterus schreibersii in 1963 before being recognized as a separate species m tao in 1986 miniopterus tao is larger than living m schreibersii and has more closely spaced lower premolars and more robust talonids back groups of cusps on lower molars back part of mandible is relatively low and on it coronoid and condyloid processes are about equally high average length of mandible is 12 0 mm taxonomy in 1934 chinese paleontologist c c young was first to describe fossil bats from fossil site of zhoukoudian locality 1 which is famous for peking man however he did not mention miniopterus which was first recorded by kazimierz kowalski and chuan kuei li in 1963 in a description of new material from layer 8 of cave site they identified miniopterus as widespread living species miniopterus schreibersii on basis of 48 mandibles lower jaws from layer 8 and reassigned another mandible that had previously been identified as myotis to miniopterus kowalski and li 1963 pp 148 150 in a 1986 paper however bronislaw woloszyn described population as a new species miniopterus tao after examining two mandibles in collections of polish academy of sciences he did place species in schreibersii group of miniopterus but considered it unlikely to be ancestral to living m schreibersii woloszyn 1986 p 209 specific name tao refers to chinese philosophical concept tao woloszyn 1986 p 205 description woloszyn described species on basis of two mandibles one damaged and with third premolar p3 through third molar m3 and other intact and with fourth premolar p4 through second molar m2 miniopterus tao is a large member of schreibersii group and about as large as miniopterus rummeli from miocene of germany ziegler 2003 p 487 mandible is robust and generally resembles m schreibersii mental foramen an opening at outer side of jaw is located between lower canine and second lower premolar p2 coronoid process a projection at back of mandible is low and rounded and is connected to condyloid process behind it by a nearly horizontal ridge which contains a slight raising at its back compared to m schreibersii condyloid process is more slender but base of angular process at lower back corner of jaw is more robust woloszyn 1986 p 206 in m rummeli back part of mandible is higher and coronoid process is distinctly higher than condyloid process ziegler 2003 pp 484 485 487 preserved alveoli show that p2 is about as large as p3 not smaller as in tristis group of miniopterus woloszyn 1986 p 208 premolars in m tao are placed closely together which distinguishes species from m schreibersii and fossil european species including m rummeli woloszyn 1986 pp 208 209 ziegler 2003 p 487 p3 is robust and surrounded by a well developed cingulum shelf crown is trapezoid in shape in p4 there is a clear cingulum at front and labial outer margins crown is triangular and back edge is straight not saddle shaped as in m schreibersii woloszyn 1986 p 207 molars resemble those of m schreibersii but are more robust particularly talonids cusp groups at back of teeth woloszyn 1986 p 207 total length of mandible ranges from 11 6 to 12 4 mm and averages 12 0 mm in ten specimens coronoid process is 3 1 to 3 3 mm high averaging 3 2 mm and length of molar row is 4 0 to 4 4 mm averaging 4 2 mm woloszyn 1986 table 2 range miniopterus tao has only been recorded from locality 1 at zhoukoudian locality 3 contains a smaller miniopterus identified as m schreibersii locality 1 is pleistocene in age between about 2 million and 10 000 years old and also contains ia io and species of rhinolophus and myotis among bats in addition to homo erectus references literature cited kowalski k and li c k 1963 remarks on fauna of bats chiroptera from locality 1 at choukoutien vertebrata 7 2 144 150 woloszyn b w 1986 a new species of long winged bat miniopterus tao sp n mammalia chiroptera from locality 1 at choukoutien china acta universitatis geologica 1986 2 205 211 ziegler r 2003 bats chiroptera mammalia from middle miocene karstic fissure fillings of petersbuch near eichstatt southern franconian alb bavaria subscription required geobios 36 4 447 490 category miniopteridae category pleistocene bats category pleistocene mammals of asia
