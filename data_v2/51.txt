ahead of its time biography early life 1907 45 grinsell was born in london on 14 february 1907 he was educated at highgate school from january 1921 until july 1923 his family moved to brighton shortly after first world war there his interest in archaeology was encouraged by h s toms curator of brighton museum who had formerly been an assistant to archaeologist augustus pitt rivers moving back to london in 1925 grinsell became a clerk for barclays bank although he had developed his interest in prehistory through an examination of stone tools he came to focus his attention on barrows recognising that these were among least well understood prehistoric monuments in british landscape and one of few that could be studied from position of an amateur at time a number of antiquarians were still active in southern england with grinsell being encouraged in his interests by prominent figures in this milieu such as eliot curwen and hadrian thumb left grinsell s only excavation was of one of devil s humps pictured in sussex grinsell s techniques of conducting archaeological fieldwork were entirely self taught and from start of his investigations he was very interested in understanding both distribution and chronology of barrows during 1930s grinsell personally visited and catalogued all of extant barrows in counties of surrey sussex berkshire hampshire and isle of wight establishing himself as pre eminent figure in study of british barrows archaeologist nicholas thomas later noted that despite grinsell s status as an amateur by 1932 he had established himself as being without parallel in british archaeology with his accomplishments surpassing even work of professionals like o g s crawford never having learned to drive grinsell conducted all his visits through use of buses trains and on foot in 1932 grinsell attended first international prehistoric congress held in london it was here that he was introduced to crawford with two becoming close acquaintances both sharing an interest in use of maps as part of their archaeological fieldwork it was also here that he met dutch archaeologist albert van giffen they discussed whether bell barrows of sussex were related to palisade barrows of netherlands which van giffen had been investigating seeking an answer to this question grinsell conducted his only excavation an examination of one of several bell barrows collectively known as known as devil s humps atop bow hill in sussex conducted in april 1933 with help of two members of brighton and hove archaeological society publication of results was delayed until 1942 in 1936 he published ancient burial mounds of england and then followed this with bronze age round barrows of wessex in 1941 around 1937 he met painter and amateur archaeologist heywood sumner while conducting an exploration of barrows of hampshire with his own hand drawn plans of barrows becoming influenced by sumner s illustrative style with archaeologist r f jessup he began conducting a survey of barrows in kent although their notes for this were later destroyed in an air raid during second world war before they could be published with archaeologist r rainbird clarke he then conducted a survey of barrows of norfolk their findings were stored in an archive although never published after outbreak of second world war grinsell became a pilot officer in air photographic branch of royal air force raf in 1941 during conflict he was stationed in egypt where he spent time studying archaeological remains of ancient egypt and visiting all of pyramids near to cairo based on these experiences at his own expense he published egyptian pyramids in 1947 designed as a guide to sites it was as grinsell acknowledged heavily reliant on earlier plans of egyptologists but with additional aerial photographs that grinsell had obtained through his involvement with raf book was largely ignored by britain s egyptological establishment life as a professional archaeologist 1945 95 thumb right in 1950s grinsell focused on barrows of wiltshire such as bush barrow pictured on returning to britain grinsell went back to his job at barclays bank in 1947 he was a postgraduate diploma of prehistoric archaeology student at institute of archaeology now part of ucl at university of london in same cohort as sinclair hood university of london institute of archaeology bulletin no 23 university of london institute of archaeology 1987 p 28 that year he also became treasurer of prehistoric society a position that he retained until 1970 during which he

order to compile victoria county history of wiltshire grinsell accepted leaving his bank job and moving to wiltshire town of devizes thus becoming a professional archaeologist thomas later stated that victoria county history of wiltshire represents high point in grinsell s combined powers of fieldwork grasp of secondary sources and handling of a great deal of detailed information grinsell later published book archaeology of wessex which was based on his experience during this period leaving devizes in 1952 grinsell became keeper of anthropology and archaeology at bristol city museum remaining there until his retirement in 1972 he also published a number of academic articles and book reviews during his holidays he often visited mediterranean where he examined various prehistoric tombs he also continued pursuing his interest in barrows and by 1970s had also catalogued those examples in dorset gloucestershire somerset and devon bristol university awarded him an honorary degree on basis of his work while he was appointed to order of british empire obe in 1972 that same year a festschrift was issued in his honour edited by nichols fowler in 1989 grinsell published an autobiography reviewing it for folklore journal historian hilda ellis davidson praised it but noted that it does not tell us very much about inner life of author according to archaeologist paul ashbee grinsell s directness whimsical humour and sound common sense were legendary as were his walking youth and penchant for traditional afternoon teas of cream variety a bachelor he never married legacy over course of his career grinsell had examined and recorded around 10 000 barrows thomas stated that grinsell s astonishing volume of published fieldwork assured for him a place without equal in history of british archaeological studies this recording was particularly valuable for archaeologists because it occurred before large numbers of british barrows were heavily damaged as a result of deep ploughing and land development it also demonstrated spread of barrows within particular regions and confirmed older assumption that these barrows were heavily concentrated on areas of chalk geology many of barrows that grinsell discovered such as lambourn long barrow in berkshire were previously unrecorded while he was also responsible for discovery of rock art on face of an early bronze age grave slab at pool farm in west harptree somerset according to thomas grinsell s career illustrated validity of amateur archaeologists importance of publishing one s research and significance of archaeological fieldwork other than excavation archaeologist paul ashbee expressed view that to a great extent he determined direction of field archaeology in second half of 20th century interested in using sources other than archaeology grinsell made use of documents place names folklore and accounts of antiquarians as part of his research according to later archaeologists amy schwartz and cornelius grinsell was one of few archaeologists of his generation who was interested in relationship between folklore and archaeology comparing him in this way to continental european scholars paul horst and karel c peeters bibliography a bibliography of grinsell s publications from 1929 through to 1971 including his books and articles was assembled by nicholas thomas and peter fowler and
