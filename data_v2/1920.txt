macdonald seamount named after gordon a macdonald is a seamount in polynesia southeast of austral islands and in neighbourhood of a system of seamounts that include ngatemato seamounts and taukina seamount it rises from seafloor to a depth of about and has a flat top but height of its top appears to vary with volcanic activity there are some subsidiary cones such as macdocald seamount seamount was discovered in 1967 and has been periodically active with gas release and seismic activity since then there is hydrothermal activity on macdonald and vents are populated by hyperthermophilic bacteria macdonald seamount is currently active volcano of macdonald hotspot a volcanic hotspot that has formed this seamount and some other volcanoes eruptions occurred in 1967 1977 1979 1983 and 1987 1989 and earthquakes were recorded in 2007 activity which has produced basaltic rocks has modified shape of volcano and may lead to formation of an island in future discovery and name macdonald seamount was discovered in 1967 when hydrophones noted earthquake activity in area seamount was named in 1970 after gordon a macdonald it is also known as while macdonald appears to be an incorrect capitalization geography and geology regional setting thumb hotspots of pacific ocean is characterized by long island chains which typically extend from southeast to northwest in direction of motion of pacific plate often such chains begin in southeast with volcanoes such as hawaii that become progressively more eroded northwestward and eventually end as series of atolls this has led to suggestion that they are formed by deep sources over which pacific plate drifts and eventually carries volcano away from its magma source these sources are known as hotspots and their total number has been estimated to be between 42 and 117 hotspots may also be formed by cracks propagating in crust and such hotspots would not necessarily show an age progression local setting macdonald seamount is located off southeastern end of austral islands austral islands extend away from southern cook islands to iles maria and eventually marotiri southeastward including islands rurutu tubuai and rapa a relatively large gap separates marotiri from macdonald volcano ngatemato seamounts and taukina seamounts lie north of macdonald they are considerably older and appear to have a very different origin even farther southeast lies foundation seamount chain and associated hotspot may have generated some of seamounts close to macdonald seamount lies close to southeastern end of an area of shallower ocean which extends northwestward towards marotiri and includes annie seamount simone seamount and president thiers bank high ra seamount named after polynesian term for sun rises northwest of macdonald to a depth of it is apparently an extinct volcano and may have once emerged above sea level a smaller seamount macdocald rises from southern foot of macdonald to depths of additional small seamounts that appear to have formed at east pacific rise are also found in area crust beneath macdonald is of eocene age and away from area of shallower ocean it is covered with hills and sediment macdonald seamount rises from seafloor to a depth of about below sea level surveys in 1979 found a pinnacle reaching to a depth of below sea level and a wide summit plateau with small high and wide spatter cones other sources indicate a surface area of for summit plateau ongoing volcanic activity may have modified topography of summit of macdonald between surveys in 1975 and 1982 forming another elliptical pinnacle reaching a depth of at northwestern margin of plateau and raising summit plateau to depths of by time of a new survey in 1986 pinnacle had been replaced by a pile of rocks which only reached a depth of upper parts of edifice are covered by thick lapilli with lava flows underneath some hydrothermal alteration products are also found and a thick ash cover occurs to depths of aside from these lapilli deposits lava flows are exposed on edifice as well farther down lava flow fronts form scarps which become particularly noticeable at depths of except on northern flank even deeper pillow lavas predominate below summit area slopes fall down steeply to a depth of and then flatten out save for a debris covered ridge to northwest macdonald has a circular shape with a width of at a depth of slopes of macdonald display radial ridges which may reflect tectonically controlled rift zones as well as isolated parasitic cones volume of whole edifice has been estimated to be macdonald seamount bears traces of landslides including collapse scars up on edifice and smooth terrain formed by debris on its lower slopes collapses have been inferred on eastern southern western and northwestern flank seafloor further shows evidence of turbidity currents including ripples geomagnetic analysis of edifice has demonstrated existence of a normally magnetized structure at base of volcano and an additional anomaly which seems to be magma chamber at a depth of within edifice close to northern flank data obtained in rocks expelled by volcano during its eruptions also suggest that another magma reservoir exists at depths of that is within crust beneath macdonald composition macdonald has principally erupted basalt this basalt contains phenocrysts of clinopyroxene olivine and especially plagioclase additional rocks are basanite mugearite picrite and overall composition is alkaline and rock debris found on macdonald seamount includes intrusive rocks such as gabbro picrite and pyroxenite gabbros appear to originate from slow crystallization of basaltic magma within a magma reservoir followed by low temperature alteration such rocks were uprooted by explosive activity in addition hydrothermal and thermal alteration has formed amphibole chlorite epidote phyllosilicates pyrite quartz and smectite with additional components including albite biotite and orthopyroxene vulcanites are typical ocean island basalts whose alkaline nature is unlike tholeiite that is found on other hotspot volcanoes such as hawaii iceland and reunion in these volcanoes alkaline lavas are erupted in post shield stage but macdonald is clearly a developing volcano and further research is needed to explain chemical history of macdonald these magmas in case of macdonald were derived from partial melting of spinel lherzolite and further influenced by fractional crystallization and carbon dioxide but with no influence of overlying plate eruptions macdonald is only known active volcano in cook islands and austral islands unlike in society islands where active volcanism is spread over several volcanoes first recorded eruptions at macdonald occurred in 1967 and was followed by additional activity in 1977 although pumice rafts observed in 1928 and 1936 could have been formed by seamount as well these eruptions were recorded with hydrophones further such activity occurred 1979 1983 some eruptions especially eruptions on southern flank or within a crater would have passed unnoticed additional eruptions at macdonald occurred between june 1987 december 1988 and a seismic swarm probably with eruptions occurred in 2007 eruptions at macdonald include phreatic and phreatomagmatic activity which led to formation of lapilli and lava bombs and also to hydrophone signals but also effusive eruptions forming lava flows volcanic activity is not steady with prolonged pauses observed between eruptions macdonald seamount is among most active submarine volcanoes in world and most active on floor of pacific ocean radiometric dating of rocks dredged from macdonald has yielded two separate clusters of ages one less than two million years old and second about 30 million years 1989 events several eruptions occurred in 1989 when a scientific expedition was underway on seamount these eruptions were accompanied by discolouration of water over of length release of burning hydrogen and hydrogen sulfide accompanied by formation of a plume of hydrothermally altered water submarine observed activity directly in one summit crater in form of intense bubbling while steam and water fountains were seen on ocean surface grey coloured slicks developed on ocean surface which were formed by pyrite sulfur and volcanic glass plus smaller amounts of cinnabar and events caused changes in ph of water on seamount and increased methane concentrations future birth of an island macdonald likely formed an island during last glacial maximum when sea level was lower and future eruptions at macdonald may lead to birth of an island even with present day sea levels such an eruption would have to be fairly large and continuous otherwise resulting island will likely be eroded away quickly depending on how quickly erosion and other factors reduce its size such an island will likely be temporary hydrothermal system macdonald seamount is hydrothermally active with several hydrothermal vents inferred to exist on western flank a wide eruption fissure was observed to be hydrothermally active in 1989 further volcano releases gases including carbon dioxide methane and sulfur dioxide such release occurs in summit area in so called champagne field but also from a second crater at depth in southeastern flank macdonald volcano may be a major source of heavy metals for area methane appears to be partially of biological origin and partly abiogenic biology hyperthermophilic bacteria have been found on macdonald including and as well as previously undescribed species these bacterial communities contain both hydrogen or sulfur consuming and and appear to be capable of long range propagation considering that relatives of species found are known from vulcano in italy aside from corals and sponges have been found in summit area of macdonald references sources category active volcanoes category volcanoes of pacific ocean category seamounts of pacific ocean
