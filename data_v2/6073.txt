directed it pinkner has stated that first six episodes of season one served as a prologue and that following episodes beginning with in which we meet mr jones would be next chapter in story pinkner further described episode as foundational as it will set up a lot of things will be set up which will come to pay off over next several weeks character david robert jones is a reference to english musician david bowie who was born with that name in which we meet mr jones was first appearance of character when actor jared harris was first cast for part he was told jones was possibly a major important character as indicated by episode s title whether his character would make a reappearance later in season depended on how well received jones was by show s audience harris performance and if writers felt they had more to tell about character harris later described jones in a may 2009 interview i think you could sense that there was a great bit of ambiguity about character which was useful he s a bad guy that might be on right side he just might be fighting for good guys those guys are always great parts because you leave audience guessing about what side he s really on he s one of those guys that if he s fighting for right cause he s a tremendous ally but if he s fighting on wrong cause he s a formidable opponent he s an anti hero who is fighting for just cause harris asserted in a february 2009 interview that he did not sign a recurring contract meaning that character was not meant to be permanent he affirmed this by believing character s personality rendered jones incapable of joining regular cast you d have to keep jones chained like a dog you couldn t let him loose you certainly couldn t let him use his hands you know what f k he d do crew first considered making parasite look like an alien but shifted away from that in favor of depicting it like an amoeba to be more familiar to audience cgi modeling followed along with a physical model which was then used by cgi department to simulate it being wrapped around loeb s heart to create actual physical parasite crew used a prosthetic chest and cgi to create parasite and a pig torso was used when doctors made initial incision at hospital during scene where broyles is talking with mitchell loeb mitchell mentions words page 47 number 47 bears a huge significance to another j j abrams show alias reception ratings premiere of in which we meet mr jones was watched by an estimated 8 61 million viewers in united states it received a 5 2 8 rating among all households reviews travis fickett of ign disliked episode criticizing it as sloppy science as repeating itself and fringe element parasite as especially goofy he rated episode 6 0 10 writing for mania com critic stephen lackey thought anna torv s performance felt forced but heaped praise on john noble lackey believes torv and joshua jackson have good chemistry and consequently partly disliked episode because they had few scenes together he also thought case of week was fairly entertaining but storyline was just passable as he wanted show to be done with all of introductions and get more into mystery of pattern he concluded his review hopefully next week story will be just a little more concise olivia and peter back working together and maybe at some point astrid will actually have something important to do los angeles times thought episode was solid if unexceptional as he liked walter but disliked vacuum of personality that is astrid ugo networks writer jon lachonis stated if you were on fence before episode will drag you kicking and screaming into dark world of fringe science wielding in which we meet mr jones is what fringe promised it would be from beginning a suspense driven procedural that probes deep into our technological phobias with this new formulation of fringe we get challenge of a sophisticated crime drama mixed with sad sack characters that tempt everyman into game while blowing us away with a level of wordplay and pseudo science that csi or alias could only have dreamed of a v club s noel murray enjoyed episode giving it a b while television without pity gave episode a b references
