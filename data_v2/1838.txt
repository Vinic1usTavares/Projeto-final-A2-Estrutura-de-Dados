lafargue mental health clinic more commonly known as lafargue clinic was a mental health clinic that operated in harlem new york from 1946 until 1958 clinic was named for french marxist physician paul lafargue and conceived by german american psychiatrist fredric wertham who recognized dire state of mental health services for blacks in new york with backing of black intellectuals richard wright and ralph ellison as well as members of church and community clinic operated out of parish house basement of st philip s episcopal church and was among first to provide low cost psychiatric health services to poor especially for poor blacks who either could not afford treatment at new york hospitals or were victimized by racism from doctors and other hospital staff staff consisted entirely of volunteers and wertham and hilde mosse were clinic s lead doctors though clinic only operated for 12 years wertham and mosse s experiences from lafargue were cited in a court decision to integrate schools in wilmington delaware and later in brown v board of education which ruled that separate black and white schools were unconstitutional wertham would use case studies from his time at clinic to support his later arguments that comic books caused juvenile delinquency as evidenced in his 1954 work seduction of innocent background plans for lafargue clinic began when fredric wertham then chief psychiatrist at queens general hospital agreed in 1942 to see author ralph ellison who refused to serve in a jim crow army for a psychiatric visit intended to find grounds to void ellison s draft notice meeting between two men was set up by richard wright then an established harlem intellectual in september 1946 after establishment of clinic wright penned an article in free world titled psychiatry comes to harlem where he described destitute state of mental health services for blacks in new york t hat harlem s 400 000 black people produced 53 of all juvenile delinquents of manhattan which has a white population of 1 600 000 that while in theory negroes have access to psychiatric aid just as negroes of mississippi in theory have access to vote such aid really does not exist owing to subtle but effective racial discrimination that obtains against negroes in almost all new york city hospitals and clinics that it is all but impossible for negro interns to gain admission to hospitals to receive their psychiatric training wright richard psychiatry comes to harlem free world september 1946 49 50 wright noted that wertham long recognized subpar state of black psychiatric services and that wertham s attitude is that psychiatry is for everybody or none at all wright psychiatry comes 50 wertham also unsuccessfully petitioned mayor fiorello h la guardia to create preventative psychiatry facilities in harlem for at least ten years adding to his frustration with city s treatment of black mental patients founding ellison brought idea of clinic to sheldon hale bishop reverend at st philip s episcopal church who agreed to house clinic in two rooms of parish house basement reibman 1044 clinic which men named after french marxist physician paul lafargue opened on march 8 1946 and served patients from 6 to 8 o clock on tuesdays and thursdays according to dennis doyle a medical historian and expert on lafargue demand was so great for services that waiting list was still full in clinic s final years doyle where need is greatest 752 clinic s staff was interracial and most were professionally accredited their ranks included psychiatrists and psychiatric nurses social workers and psychologists as well as teachers and psychology students clinic saw around 70 adults and 30 children other progressive psychiatrists opened another harlem facility in 1946 called northside center which primarily served children and operated under what doyle referred to as a combination of race blind universalism which meant that doctors did not as was common practice at time make adjustments in their diagnoses for biological conceptions of race and social psychiatry at that time a new clinical approach doyle where need is greatest 754 755 said wertham w e re not here to make a study of negro we re simply here to treat them like other human beings operation clinic was only psychotherapeutic meaning that it could not treat psychoses or other brain diseases however it treated minor neuroses and emotional disturbances and frequently referred its patients to other inpatient facilities 21 of adult patients during clinic s operation were diagnosed with psychosis and clinic was able to detect mental defects and disorders previously undiagnosed doyle where need is greatest 756 when doctors at lafargue made a diagnosis of a serious brain disease they referred their patients to outside hospitals providing blacks a pathway to proper medical care 12 of lafargue patients received inpatient care elsewhere in city doyle where need is greatest 757 in some cases patients who received referrals would follow through with treatment but others did not a woman known only as rachel listed in records as being clinic s first referral was referred by head physician hilde mosse to a respected gynecology clinic outside of harlem for menorrhagia excessive vaginal bleeding she had exam performed and came back to tell mosse about visit a teenage boy named chris son of southern migrants was treated for bad blood a southern euphemism for syphilis and was referred out to a local medical clinic for a spinal tap however boy and his mother skipped referral appointment and ended their counseling sessions at lafargue due to pain of procedure doyle where need is greatest 758 in addition clinic served as a de facto social welfare office providing connections to public housing and welfare offices and hosting a desegregated chapter of alcoholics anonymous doyle where need is greatest 760 indeed wertham and mosse reasoned that improvements in social conditions of harlem would relieve main source of anxiety for an estimated third of their patients doyle where need is greatest 759 decline and closure in 1954 new york state passed community mental health services act establishing mental health boards in cities with more than 50 000 residents purpose of boards was to dispense state funds to licensed providers of mental healthcare while northside center which worked with black children received 72 000 in funding lafargue clinic was rejected for funds by both city and state according to gabriel mendes author of under strain of color harlem s lafargue clinic and promise of an antiracist psychiatry lafargue was a good fit for intended developments of community mental health services act but wertham s reputation as a self important nuisance as well as his challenging of psychiatric orthodoxy turned psychiatric establishment s favor away from lafargue and led clinic to not receive funds in addition rev bishop who had initially granted clinic its space and was one of its strongest supporters retired from ministry in 1957 his replacement a columbia university graduate named m moran weston turned parish house into a center for community services and health programs headed by members of st philip s congregation said mendes weston s health initiative was not a slight directed at wertham and lafargue clinic rather it reflected a changing of guard and perhaps desire to place health needs of central harlem community in hands of black professionals mendes 161 without their strongest advocate and with loss of their primary funding outside donations that rev bishop played a strong role in soliciting clinic s closing grew inevitable doyle a fine new child 212 due to change in leadership at st philip s and deaths and illnesses of several clinic staffers clinic held its last session on november 1 1958 over clinic s thirteen year history it served 1 389 patients doyle a fine new child 177 legacy wertham and comic books though wertham was instrumental in advocacy foundation and operation of lafargue clinic he remains known for his alarmist condemnations of comic books best typified by his 1954 book seduction of innocent which claimed that comics were pathological and negative influences on children many of wertham s case studies and anecdotal references came from his time at lafargue and at queens general hospital mendes
