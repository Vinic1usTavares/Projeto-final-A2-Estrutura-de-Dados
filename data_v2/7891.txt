on one of their dates about her excitement on seeing him again cast eihi shiina as ryo ishibashi as jun as tetsu sawaki as miyuki matsuda as negishi as shigeru saiki as ken mitsuishi as ren as renji ishibashi as themes audition has been read as both feminist and misogynistic miike has stated that when he met journalists in united kingdom and france he found they commented on film s feminist themes when asami gets revenge on men in her life film sets up aoyama with traits and behaviours which could be considered sexist a list of criteria for his bride to meet and phoney audition format he uses to search for future wife tom mes author of agitator cinema of takashi miike stated that torture sequence with mutilation of aoyama can be seen as revenge from asami dennis lim of los angeles times examined similar themes noting that film is ultimately about male fear of women and female sexuality and that women are blatantly objectified in first half of film only to have asami redress this imbalance in second half when she becomes an avenging angel chris writing in american cinematographer stated that one plausible approach to interpreting film is to see final act as a representation of aoyama s guilt at his mistreatment of women and his desire to dominate them aoyama develops a paranoid fantasy of an attacking object because he harbours sadistic thoughts towards women he develops a fear that object will retaliate contrary to this miike has stated that final torture scenes in film are not a paranoid nightmare dreamed up by aoyama mes has argued against feminist portrayal of film noting that asami is not motivated by an ideological agenda and that acknowledging that she takes revenge on a man who has lied to her would be ignoring that she has also lied to aoyama asami states i want to tell you everything during torture scene implying she had not been truthful before mes also notes that avenging angel theme contradicts a feminist themed revenge interpretation given that one of asami s victims is female in audition character of asami is a victim of child abuse colette balmain in her book introduction to japanese horror film described asami as just one more face of wronged women in japanese culture they are victims of repression and oppression and only death and loneliness remain for them film critic robin wood wrote that through her child abuse asami is taught that love and pain must be inseparable audience is led to identify with asami through this victimization and also what stephen described as a patriarchal japanese society elvis mitchell new york times stated that theme of film was objectification of women in japanese society and mirror image horror of retribution it could create tom mes suggested that these themes can be witnessed in scene where asami feeds her mutilated prisoner and then turns into childhood version of herself and pets him like a dog mes concludes that this is done to suggest that what had happened in asami s life had made her violent adult seen in film production development thumbnail left film was adapted from novel of same name by ryu murakami alt novelist ryu murakami main production company behind audition was japanese company omega project omega were originally behind production of hideo nakata s film ring this was a great success in japan and subsequently rest of asia omega had problems setting up release of ring in korea and had company afdf korea work on a korean re adaptation of ring following year in 1998 omega partnered again with afdf korea and other production companies including creators company connection film face and to make adaptation of ryu murakami s 1997 novel audition omega wanted to create a film different than supernatural themed ring and chose to adapt murakami s novel which lacked this trait to attempt something different they hired a screenwriter daisuke tengan and a director takashi miike who were not known for working on horror films prior to audition tengan was best known as a screenwriter for working with his father shohei imamura on eel which won palme d or in 1997 pre production to create audition miike worked with many of his previous collaborators such as cinematographer hideo yamamoto miike spoke of his cinematographer by saying that yamamoto was very sensitive towards death both of his parents died very young and it s not something he talks about much miike also noted that he felt that yamamoto was living in fear and that sensibility comes through in his work it s something i want to make most of film s score was composed by koji endo endo had previously composed work for miike on films such as bird people in china yasushi shimamura was film s editor shimamura had worked with miike as early as lady hunter prelude to murder in 1991 actor ryo ishibashi wanted to work with miike and agreed to role he commented that despite not being a great fan of horror films he enjoyed scripts such as that of audition that showcased human nature model eihi shiina was cast in film as asami shiina s career was primarily as a model and she only began acting after being offered a film role while she was on holidays shiina first learned about miike through his film blues harp which made her interested in meeting director when shiina first met miike they began talking about her opinions on love and relationships on their second meeting miike asked shiina to play part of asami shiina thought that opinions and feelings she expressed to miike were reason she was cast in role and she tried to play role as naturally as she could without going over top production audition was shot in approximately three weeks which was about one more week than usual for miike s films at time scenes such as those in asami s apartment and at a restaurant were shot on location in a real apartment and a real restaurant outdoor scenes were shot in tokyo along intersections in omotesando torture scene at end of film did not initially contain asami s lines kiri kiri kiri shiina was initially whispering her lines while filming this scene but after discussion with miike two decided that having her say these lines would make scene scarier ishibashi found that miike was having so much fun with that scene and that miike was especially excited when ishibashi s character s feet are cut off for special effects where shiina s character places acupuncture needles into ishibashi special effects make up was used to create a mask layer which was laid upon ishibashi s eyes which is then pierced by needles release thumb upright

average score of 69 out of 100 based on 19 critics indicating generally favorable reviews ken eisner variety gave film a positive review reviewer referred to film as a truly shocking horror film that was made even more disturbing by its haunting beauty geoffrey macnab writing in sight and sound referred to film as a slow burning but ultimately devastating horror pic and wrote that it s a virtuoso piece of film making with much more subtlety and depth than miike s other films hollywood reporter frank scheck described film as one of most audacious iconoclastic horror films in recent years mark schilling japan times praised shiina and ishibashi s acting but noted that among film s few irritants is a smarmy bad guy turn by renji ishibashi as asami s wheelchair bound ballet instructor he is a reminder of where too many other miike films have headed straight for video racks schilling concluded that miike is ready for a bigger role as one of leading japanese directors of his generation in early 2010s time out conducted a poll with several authors directors actors and critics who have worked within horror genre to vote for their top horror films audition placed at number 18 on their top 100 list writers for variety hollywood reporter and sight sound all emphasized film s final scene scheck hollywood reporter wrote that miike lulls audience into a state of complacency with a studied slow moving lightly comic first half before delivering a gruesome final section that makes stephen king s misery look wholesome ending was all more shocking for clinical way in which it is presented eisner variety stated that it is only at ending of film that audition breaks out of creepfest ghetto in his essay on themes in audition robin wood stated that most of miike s films are disturbing for what they have to tell us about state of contemporary civilization they are not in least disturbing in themselves operating on some fantasy level of annihilation with comic book violence in comparison he stated that audition is authentically disturbing and infinitely more horrifying first time i watched it on dvd at home after warnings i had received i was repeatedly tempted through last half hour to turn it off wood compared film to pier paolo pasolini s salo or 120 days of sodom stating that film was almost as unwatchable as news reels of auschwitz of innocent victims of hiroshima and nagasaki and vietnam victims of nazi or american dehumanization of film s success with western audiences miike states that he was not surprised but that he had no idea what goes on in minds of people in west and i don t pretend to know what their tastes are and i don t want to start thinking about that it s nice that they liked my movie but i m not going to start deliberately worrying about why or what i can do to make it happen again actress eihi shiina stated that in japan only a certain type of film fan would watch audition by comparison she said film was seen by many more people overseas which she attributed to good timing aftermath and influence after release of audition miike was going to adapt murakami s novel coin locker babies but project failed to find financing to get started audition has been described as an influence on torture porn term was invented by david edelstein to describe films such as saw devil s rejects and wolf creek that offer titillating and shocking scenes that push audience to margins of depravity for them to feel something audition influenced american directors such as eli roth roth stated that audition influenced him to make his film hostel with miike even making a cameo as a satisfied customer of kidnappers who let customers torture their victims richard corliss writing in time opined that audition was different from torture porn films as unlike saw and its imitators in genre of torture porn audition doesn t go for gore money shots miike s films live inside their characters taking temperature of their longings ridiculous ambitions they chase so obsessively and their need to experience extreme to prove they re alive audition was listed by twin directors jen and sylvia soska as one of their favourite horror films and with sisters saying that it was an influence on their film american mary directors noted character of asami stating that an audience generally sees female characters in a horror film as helpless victim this film leads you in one direction skillfully hinting at a darker storyline for otherwise meek and slight asami until final 15 minutes where we are introduced to a merciless monster a perfect personification
