established his power base in western cilicia and himself prepared for war in 95 bc antiochus ix marched against his nephew but lost battle and was killed seleucus vi became master of capital but had to share syria with his brother demetrius iii based in damascus and his cousin antiochus ix s son antiochus x according to ancient historian appian seleucus vi was a violent ruler he taxed his dominions extensively to support his wars and resisted allowing cities a measure of autonomy as had been practice of former kings his reign did not last long in 94 bc he was expelled from antioch by antiochus x who followed him to cilician city of mopsuestia seleucus took shelter in city where his attempts to raise money led to riots that eventually claimed his life in 94 bc ancient traditions have different versions of his death but he was most probably burned alive by rioters following his demise his brothers antiochus xi and philip i destroyed mopsuestia as an act of revenge and their armies fought those of antiochus x name family and early life 264px thumb alt a coin struck by antiochus viii of syria reigned 125 96 bc portrait of antiochus viii on obverse depiction of zeus holding

married ptolemaic egyptian princess tryphaena in shortly after his ascension to throne seleucus vi was couple s eldest son from antiochus viii had to contend with his half brother antiochus ix for throne civil war continued for more than a decade it claimed life of tryphaena in 109 bc and ended when antiochus viii was assassinated in 96bc in aftermath of his brother s murder antiochus ix advanced on capital antioch and took it he also married second wife and widow of antiochus viii cleopatra selene according to an inscription city of priene sent honors to seleucus son of king antiochus son of king demetrius embassy probably took place before seleucus vi ascended throne as inscription does not mention him as a king embassy of priene probably met seleucus vi in cilicia antiochus viii might have sent his son to that region as a strategos reign 264px thumb alt coin struck by seleucus vi in seleucia on calycadnus modern obverse contain a portrait of king and reverse

tetradrachm depicting seleucus vi bearded following his father s death seleucus vi declared himself king and took city of seleucia on calycadnus in western cilicia as his base while his brother demetrius iii took damascus volume of coins minted by new king in seleucia on calycadnus surpassed any other mint known from late seleucid period and most of coins were produced during his preparations for war against antiochus ix a conflict that would end in year 96 95 bc 217 se seleucid year this led numismatist arthur houghton to suggest an earlier death for antiochus viii and a longer reign for seleucus vi beginning in 98 or instead of 96bc numismatist oliver d hoover contested houghton s hypothesis as it was not rare for a king to double his production in a single year at times of need and academic consensus prefers year 96bc for death of antiochus viii titles and royal image ancient hellenistic kings did not use regnal numbers instead they employed epithets to distinguish themselves from other kings with similar names numbering of kings is a modern practice seleucus vi appeared on his coins with epithets epiphanes god manifest and nicator victorious as being son of antiochus viii was source of his legitimacy as king seleucus vi sought to emphasize his descent by depicting himself on coinage with an exaggerated hawk nose in likeness of his father another iconographic element of seleucus vi s coinage is short vertical stubby horns above temple area meaning of this motif has been debated among scholars it is likely an allusion to seleucus vi s descent from his grandfather demetrius ii who utilized same motif specific meaning of horns is not clear but it could have been an indication that king was a manifestation of a god stubby horns sported by seleucus vi probably carried same meaning as those of his grandfather in seleucid dynasty currency struck during campaigns against a rival or usurper showed king with a beard seleucus vi was depicted with a beard which was later removed from coins indicating fulfilment of a vengeance vow to avenge his father struggle against antiochus ix in seleucia on calycadnus seleucus vi prepared for war against his uncle whose forces probably occupied central cilicia and confined his nephew to western parts of region king needed a harbor for seleucia on calycadnus and probably founded city of elaiussa to serve that purpose seleucus vi gathered funds for his coming war from cities of cilicia including mopsuestia which seems to have been taxed on several occasions during his reign it is estimated that seleucus vi produced 1 200 talents of coins to support his war effort enough to pay ten thousand soldiers for two years on reverse of bronze coins produced in a mint whose location is not known coded uncertain mint 125 a motif depicting a formed in shape of a macedonian shield appeared on reverse this motif was probably meant to rally support of military macedonian colonists in region those coins were probably produced in syria in a city half way between tarsus in cilicia and antioch therefore they were probably minted in course of seleucus vi s campaign against antiochus ix 264px thumb alt map depicting kingdom of syria in year 95 bc when it was divided between seleucus vi in north with his capital at antioch demetrius iii in south with his capital at damascus and antiochus x in west with his base at syria in 95 bc antiochus ix took note of seleucus vi s preparations after latter started his march on antioch in antiochus ix left capital and moved against his nephew seleucus vi emerged victorious while his uncle lost his life either by committing suicide according to third century historian eusebius or by being executed according to first century historian josephus soon afterwards seleucus vi entered capital cleopatra selene probably fled before his arrival policy and war against antiochus x in 144 se 169 168 bc king antiochus iv allowed nineteen cities to mint municipal bronze coinage in their own names indicating his awareness of mutual dependency of cities and monarchy on each other this movement towards greater autonomy continued as cities sought to emancipate themselves from central power adding phrase sacred and autonomous to their coinage seleucus vi did not follow policy of his forebears in cilicia as long as he reigned autonomy was not granted a change in political status of cilician cities was apparently not acceptable for seleucus vi seleucus vi controlled cilicia and syria northern syria antiochus ix had a son antiochus x according to josephus he fled to city of where he declared himself king seleucus vi attempted to kill his cousin and rival but plot failed and antiochus x married cleopatra selene to enhance his position archaeologist alfred bellinger believed that seleucus vi prepared for his coming war against antiochus x in elaiussa in 94bc antiochus x advanced on capital antioch and drove seleucus vi out of northern syria into cilicia according to eusebius final battle took place near mopsuestia and ended with defeat of seleucus vi death and legacy thumb 264px alt drawing of an inscription it is found

historian appian as violent and extremely tyrannical seleucus vi took shelter in mopsuestia and attempted to tax residents again which led to his death during riots year of his demise is not clear eusebius placed it in 216 se 97 96 bc which is impossible considering that a market weight of seleucus vi from antioch dated to 218 se 95 94 bc has been discovered fourth century historian jerome has 219 se 94 93 bc as year of seleucus vi s demise which is more plausible year 94bc is academically accepted date for death of seleucus vi no spouse or children were recorded for seleucus vi according to first century biographer plutarch first century bc roman general lucullus said that armenian king tigranes ii who conquered syria in put to death successors of seleucus and carried off their wives and daughters into captivity given fragmentary nature of ancient sources regarding late seleucid period statement of lucullus leaves open existence of a wife or daughter of seleucus vi ancient traditions preserve three accounts regarding seleucus vi s death oldest by josephus has a mob burning king and his courtiers in royal palace appian shares burning account but has city s gymnasium as scene according to eusebius seleucus vi discovered intention of residents to burn him and took his own life bellinger considered account of josephus to be most probable he noted that eusebius presented suicide accounts for other seleucid kings who were recorded as having been killed by other historians such as alexander i and antiochus ix bellinger believed that third century historian porphyry source of eusebius stories about seleucids was attempting to tone down somewhat horrors of seleucid house city of athens shared a close relation with seleucid kings and statues of syrian monarchs set up by athenian citizens on island of delos testify to that a citizen named dionysius dedicated a statue for seleucus vi between 96 and 94bc in deference to his late brother king antiochus
