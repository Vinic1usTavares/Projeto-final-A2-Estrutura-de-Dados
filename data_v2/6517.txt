partially completed non player characters npcs populate world and can be interacted with in a number of ways player may engage them in conversation marry an eligible npc kill them or engage in a

cat or lizard like creatures and then customizing their character s appearance over course of game players improve their character s skills which are numerical representations of their ability in certain areas there are eighteen skills divided evenly among three schools of combat magic and stealth when players have trained skills enough to meet required experience their character levels up each time their character levels players may choose to select a skill specific ability called a perk or store perk points for later use earlier entries in elder scrolls series used a character class system to determine which skills would contribute to character s leveling but skyrim allows players to discover preferred skills as they play game and it rewards them with more experience when a frequently used skill is leveled a head up display hud appears when any of player s three main attributes health magicka and stamina are being depleted attributes regenerate over time although this process can be accelerated by using potions or regenerative spells health is depleted primarily when player takes damage and loss of all health results in death magicka is depleted by use of spells certain poisons and by being struck by lightning based attacks stamina determines player s effectiveness in combat and is depleted by sprinting performing heavy power attacks and being struck by frost based attacks player s inventory can be accessed from menu and items can be viewed in 3d which may prove essential in solving puzzles found in dungeons player s effectiveness in combat relies on use

defeated alduin originally with their help player defeats alduin once and for all development having completed work on oblivion in 2006 bethesda game studios began work on fallout 3 it was during this time that team began planning their next elder scrolls game from outset they had decided to set new entry in land of skyrim incorporating dragons into main theme of game full development began following release of fallout 3 in 2008 developers considered skyrim a spiritual successor to both fallout 3 and previous elder scrolls games game was developed by a team of roughly 100 people composed of new talent as well as of series veterans production was supervised by todd howard who has been director of several titles released by bethesda softworks design team set game in province of skyrim designing it by hand while similar in size to oblivions game world of cyrodiil mountainous topography of world inflates game space and makes it more difficult to traverse than cyrodiil which was relatively flat in designing skyrims world team opted for a different approach to what was taken with oblivion art director matt considered epic realism of skyrims world design as a departure from oblivions generic representation of classic european fantasy lore howard expressed team s desire to re encapsulate wonder of discovery of morrowind s game world in skyrim as return to classic fantasy of arena and elder scrolls ii daggerfall in oblivion meant sacrificing a world with a unique culture as a way of creating diversity in world team divided world into nine sectors known as holds and attempted to make each hold feel topographically unique from another in addition team wanted to reflect socioeconomic background of npcs by making some locations elaborate and wealthy while others are poorer and lower tech thumb right within skyrims universe is use of dragon language alphabet was constructed to look aesthetically dragon like hence use of claw like markings team sought to make each of game s ten races feel unique howard considered player s choice of race at beginning of game a more important decision than it had been in previous elder scrolls games because culture of skyrims world contains more racism however he reiterated that player s choice of race does not have major game affecting consequences as it simply adds flavor in different npcs dispositions towards player and is not meant as a way of locking players out of particular quests efforts to make skyrims world feel hand crafted extended to team abandoning use of generated landscapes as they had done in oblivion while just one team member was charged with designing dungeons in oblivion skyrims 150 dungeons were designed by a group of eight people skyrim features 244 quests over 300 points of interest with a map marker and numerous unmarked locations collector s edition making of skyrim dvd engine skyrim is powered by bethesda s creation engine forked from fallout 3 codebase specifically for skyrim after fallout 3s release team devised numerous design objectives to meet for skyrim and according to howard team got all those done and kept going had team not been able to meet their design goals with current hardware they would have waited for next generation and released skyrim then but howard felt that technology of time did not hold team back at all creation engine allows for numerous improvements in graphical fidelity over bethesda s previous efforts for example draw distance renders farther than in previous elder scrolls games howard provided an example where player can stare at a small object such as a fork in detail and then look up at a mountain and run to top of it dynamic lighting allows shadows to be created by any structure or item in game world and creation engine allowed for greater detail in flora production than had in previous bethesda games for example with bethesda s own technology developers were able to give weight to branches of trees which affects how trees blow in wind in addition technology allows wind to affect flow of water in channels such as rivers and streams because of large presence of snow in skyrims game world technological upgrades were applied to weather effects and allow for dynamic snow fall upon terrain instead of snow that was rendered as a textural effect in previous games team used havok s behavior toolset for character animation which allows for a greater fluidity between character s movements of walking running and sprinting and also increases efficiency of third person camera option which had been criticized in oblivion toolset allows interactions between player and npcs to take place in real time in oblivion when player went to interact with an npc time would freeze and camera would zoom in on npc s face in skyrim npcs can move around and make body gestures while conversing with player children are present in game and their presence is handled similarly to fallout 3 in that they cannot be harmed by player in any way since depictions of violence involving children in video games are controversial skyrim uses radiant ai artificial intelligence system that was created for oblivion and it has been updated to allow npcs to do what they want under extra parameters updated system allows for greater interaction between npcs and their environments npcs can perform tasks such as farming milling and mining in game world and will react to each other audio team employed jeremy soule to compose music for skyrim who previously worked on morrowind and oblivion game s main theme dragonborn was recorded with a choir of over 30 people singing in fictional dragon language creative director todd howard envisioned theme for skyrim as elder scrolls theme sung by a choir of barbarians this became a reality when idea was passed by soule who recorded 30 man choir and layered three separate recordings to create effect of 90 voices bethesda s concept artist adam adamowicz created draconic language and also developed a 34 character runic alphabet for game he expanded lexicon of draconic as needed bruce nesmith explained that words were introduced to lexicon every time that studio wanted to say something bethesda released four audio cds along with game on november 11 2011 soundtrack to skyrim is sold via jeremy soule s distributor directsong and soule autographed all physical copies ordered via

intention to release dlc packages having done so for previous releases he revealed that it was team s goal to release a lower number of dlc packages that were larger in content than those released for fallout 3 as he felt that releasing a larger number of low content packages was chaotic via a press release team announced that first two planned dlc packages would release on xbox 360 via xbox live a

initially in german only an english version was released august 16 2016 reception skyrim received critical acclaim upon release removal of character class system present in previous elder scrolls entries was well received billy shibley of machinima s inside gaming and charles onyett of ign praised its removal because it allowed players to experiment with different skills without having to make decisions about a class early in game john bedford of eurogamer stated that by removing character class system game tailored itself to players who wanted to build an all around character while still letting other players specialize in a preferred play style steve butts of escapist considered addition of perks to character advancement system a great method to make your character feel even more unique and personal kevin vanord of gamespot praised way perks allowed for player s preferred skills to become more powerful over time stating that perk system forms around way you play but allows for tweaking so that you retain a sense of control user interface was also praised by reviewers for its accessibility bedford complimented its elegant design which succeeded oblivions comparatively complex interface art style of game world drew acclaim from many reviewers who welcomed departure from oblivion s cyrodiil jason schreier of wired described land of skyrim as a viking inspired treasure trove of flavor and charm noting its contrast to cyrodiil which he considered generic by comparison staff at edge magazine described cyrodiil as a patchwork of varying terrains praising more consistent design of skyrim shibley praised lack of copy and paste level design that s plagued bethesda s previous games giving a lived in and handcrafted look to world bedford noted that improved graphical fidelity over oblivion allowed game world to feel more lifelike praising misty mountain setting complete with swirling fog and high altitude snowstorms an editor for pc powerplay praised diversity of dungeon design andrew reiner of game informer cited criticisms that oblivion faced for repetitive dungeons noting that composition of each dungeon is largely unique and individualized in skyrim he also favored design choice to have a quick route out of a dungeon leading from its last room eliminating a problem he identified oblivion as having where player would clear a dungeon and then have to go all way back to beginning to exit it many reviewers praised large number of things to do in world outside of main story tom francis of pc gamer noted that it was difficult to explore world without becoming distracted by things to do stating that it s hard to walk for a minute in any direction without encountering an intriguing cave a lonely shack some strange stones a wandering traveller or a haunted fort reviewers welcomed ability to dual wield weapons and magic an editor for pc powerplay felt that dual wielding ability transforms tactical scope of each combat encounter shibley noted that dual wielding option gave player more freedom to experiment with combat writing that ability to apply a spell to each hand generates huge potential for getting creative with your spell combinations however reviewers were critical of melee combat feeling that it had not been improved upon as much as other areas in game justin mcelroy of joystiq felt that what should be thrilling fights in skyrim are often weighed down by same clunky melee system oblivion suffered from onyett described melee combat as flat and floaty and that many times it feels like you re slicing air instead of a mythical creature s flesh francis agreed with this sentiment stating that too much of time you wave your weapon around and enemies barely react to hits many reviewers noted glitches while playing skyrim some game breaking nick cowen of guardian pointed out that game s glitches were a trade off for its ambitious scope and that he had experienced glitches that forced him to reload earlier saves edge began their review by criticizing lack of polish while still acknowledging many areas in game which made up for it in addition quality of main quest divided some reviewers while reiner praised main quest as superbly penned and bethesda s best effort to date butts and francis criticized fact that story was delivered primarily through conversations and quest journals rather than through player s own interactions while dragon battles were well received some reviewers observed flaws in ai for dragons onyett pointed out their predictable attack patterns which francis agreed with claiming that fighting them never changes much you can just ignore them until they land then shoot them from a distance when they do reiner felt that due to repetitiveness of their attack patterns dragons were not challenging enough for low level players edge pointed out a curve in difficulty for players who favored archery and magic as dragons were difficult to attack while airborne technical issues at launch of skyrim many technical issues of varying severity were reported some examples include a texture down scaling issue on xbox 360 version when game was run from hard drive crashes slowdown and frame rate issues on playstation 3 version when save files exceeded 6 mb commonly occurring due to extended gameplay times and various crashes and slowdowns on windows version according to skyrims director todd howard notion that bugs were caused by restrictive ram is incorrect howard said it s literally things you ve done in what order and what s running since release several patches were published to address technical issues and improve overall gameplay patch 1 2 was released on november 29 2011 to fix some of game s issues however some players reported new bugs in game following patch including more frequent game crashes patch 1 3 was released on december 7 2011 to improve stability further address known issues and fix some problems that were introduced in version 1 2 patch 1 4 was released on february 1 2012 for pc another list of issues and bugs were addressed in this patch and skyrim launcher support for skyrim workshop pc was provided patch 1 5 was released on march 20 2012 for pc numerous bugs were fixed and new archery spellcasting kill cams were included on april 12 2012 bethesda announced that kinect support would be coming for xbox 360 version of skyrim with over 200 voice commands patch 1 6 was released on may 24 2012 for pc this includes a new feature mounted combat patch 1 7 was released on july 30 2012 for pc and 1 8 was released on november 1 2012 for pc these two introduced only minor bugfixes patch 1 9 was released on march 18 2013 in addition to providing various bug fixes this patch also added new features most prominently new legendary difficulty and legendary skills which effectively remove level cap an unofficial community patch attempts to fix remaining issues unattended by official patches it lists hundreds of gameplay quest and other bugs that it fixes in game and its add ons sales during first day of release steam showed over 230 000 people playing skyrim concurrently within two days of game s launch 3 4 million physical copies were sold of those sales 59 were for xbox 360 27 for ps3 and 14 for pc in first week of release bethesda stated that 7 million copies of game had been shipped to

012 468 users logged in on january 2 2012 total number of sold copies on pc platform is difficult to confirm because valve does not publicly publish digital sales shortly after its release skyrim was
