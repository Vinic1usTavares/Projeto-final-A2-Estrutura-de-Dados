of korra overlooking republic city released after announcement of series legend of korra was co created and produced by bryan konietzko and michael dante dimartino together referred to as by fans in reference to shipping naming conventions at nickelodeon animation studios in burbank california to illustrate length of production process about 10 to 12 months per episode and overlap of various phases konietzko wrote in july 2013 that their team was already developing storyboards for first episode of book 4 while last episodes of book 2 were not yet finished production of series was announced at annual comic con in san diego on july 22 2010 it was originally due for release in october 2011 tentatively titled avatar legend of korra at time it was intended to be a twelve episode mini series set in same fictional universe as original show but seventy years later in 2011 title was changed to last airbender legend of korra and again in march 2012 to legend of korra premiere was eventually delayed to april 14 2012 animation work was mostly done by south korean animation studio studio mir according to animation director yoo jae myung nickelodeon was initially reluctant to approve series and suspended production because unlike in almost all american animated series protagonist was a girl conventional wisdom according to konietzko had it that girls will watch shows about boys but boys won t watch shows about girls creators eventually persuaded channel s executives to change their mind konietzko related that in test screenings boys said that korra being a girl did not matter to them they just said she was awesome creators wrote all of episodes of first season themselves omitting filler episodes to allow for a concise story once series was expanded from its original 12 episode schedule to 26 and then to 52 more writers were brought in so that creators could focus on design work joaquim dos santos and ryu ki hyun who worked on animation and design of original series also became involved with creating legend of korra as is storyboarder ian graham jeremy zuckerman and benjamin wynn who composed soundtrack for original series as track team also returned to score legend of korra second season book two spirits premiered on september 13 2013 and concluded on november 22 2013 it consists of fourteen episodes animation work was done by south korean animation studio studio mir as well as japanese animation studio pierrot studio mir was expected to solely work on book 2 but executive director jae myung yoo decided that studio mir would animate boondocks instead because animation process was less rigorous pierrot was eventually called in to fill void and animate book 2 according to jae myung yoo studio mir was later contacted and re asked to animate book 2 yoo feared that if book 2 failed studio mir and korean animators would have their reputations tarnished for pierrot s failures consequently studio mir accepted offer and worked alongside pierrot third season book three change aired its first three episodes on june 27 2014 soon after some episodes were leaked online it takes place two weeks after events of book two spirits episodes nine to thirteen were streamed online rather than being broadcast as a television program book four balance final season was produced in parallel to previous two seasons crew at one point worked on approximately 30 episodes at same time post production for season 2 production for season 3 and pre production for season 4 some production steps such as color correction and retakes continued up until date of series finale december 19 2014 season 4 started online distribution a few months after third season s finale on october 3 2014 after nickelodeon cut season s budget by amount required for one episode dimartino and konietzko decided to include a clip show which reuses previously produced animation as episode 8 remembrances instead of dismissing many of creative staff studio mir was helped by its companion studio a subunit called studio reve while working on book 4 concerning development of much discussed final scene intended to show friends korra and asami becoming a romantic couple bryan konietzko explained that at first he and dimartino did not give idea much weight assuming they would not be able to get approval for portraying their relationship but during production of finale they decided to test that assumption approached network and found them supportive up to a certain limit they decided to change final scene from korra and asami only holding hands to also facing each other in a pose referencing marriage scene a few minutes prior animation style legend of korra was produced mainly as traditional animation with most frames drawn on paper in south korea by animators at studio mir and scanned for digital processing each episode comprises about 15 000 drawings series makes occasional use of computer generated imagery for complex scenes or objects most noticeably in animations of pro bending arena or mecha suits of later seasons while legend of korra was produced in united states and therefore not a work of japanese animation anime in strict sense escapist magazine argued that series is so strongly influenced by anime that it would otherwise easily be classified as such its protagonists a superpowered heroine her group of talented supporting friends a near impervious villain who wants to reshape world its themes family friendship romance fear and death and quality of its voice acting as well as visual style are similar to those of leading anime series such as fullmetal alchemist brotherhood bleach or trigun a notable difference from such series is absence of lengthy opening and ending sequences set to j pop songs to save broadcast time legend of openings and endings last only a few seconds series mostly abstains from using visual tropes characteristic of anime but does occasionally use exaggerated facial expressions to highlight emotions for comic effect as in avatar series adds to its asian aesthetic by presenting all text that appears in its fictional world in traditional chinese characters without translating it for example on wanted posters seen in episode stakeout names of protagonists are written as kou la korra ma gao mako and bo lin bolin music legend of korra is set to music by jeremy zuckerman who previously wrote music for avatar last airbender with benjamin wynn for legend of korra zuckerman is sole composer while wynn is lead sound designer two collaborate with foley artist aran tanchum and showrunner mike dimartino on soundscape of series konietzko and dimartino s concept for score was to blend traditional chinese music with early jazz on that basis zuckerman composed a score combining elements of dixieland traditional chinese music and western orchestration it is performed mainly by a string sextet and various chinese solo instruments including a flute drums a and a mongolian a soundtrack cd legend of korra original music from book one was published on july 16 2013 music from korra and avatar was also played in concert at festival in malaga spain in september 2014 series s

production values quality of its writing its challenging themes and its transgression of conventions of youth entertainment on review aggregator rotten tomatoes third season has a rating of 100 positive reviews based on 5 reviews with an average rating of 8 5 10 style and production values david hinckley of new york daily news wrote that visually striking series is full of little tricks and nuances that only true fans will notice and savor but nothing prevents civilians from enjoying it as well writing for vulture matt patches highlighted second season s loose handheld style cinematography challenging for an animated series and weird wonderful wildly imagined spirits fought by korra a kaiju parade with beasts that mirror velociraptors max nicholson for ign described third season as easily show s most consistent season to date delivering complex themes excellent storylines and unmatched production values and oliver sava for a v club characterized it as a truly magnificent season of television delivering loads of character development world building socio political commentary and heart racing action all presented with beautifully smooth animation and impeccable voice acting writing and themes before first season s finale scott thill of wired hailed legend of korra as smartest cartoon on tv able to address adults spiritual and sociopolitical concerns while presenting an alternately riveting and hilarious ride packed with fantasy naturalism steampunk grandeur kinetic conflicts sci fi weaponry and self aware comedy in atlantic julie beck characterized series as some of highest quality fantasy of our time appreciating it for combining nuanced social commentary with avatar last airbenders warmth whimsy and self referential wit brian lowry of variety felt that series represents a bit more ambitious storytelling for older kids and perhaps a few adults with geek gene at tv com noel kirkpatrick commented favorably on how second season of one of television s best programs handled necessary quantity of exposition and on its introduction of theme of conflict between spiritualism and secularism covering third season scott thill at salon described korra as one of toughest most complex female characters on tv despite being in a cartoon and considered that surreal lovely sequel to avatar lastingly and critiques power gender extinction spirit and more all wrapped up in a kinetic toon as lyrical and expansive as anything dreamt up by hayao miyazaki or george lucas david levesley at daily beast recommended series to those looking for beautifully shot and well written fantasy on television after end of game of most recent season noting that in both series fantastical and outlandish are carefully balanced with human relationships and political intrigue several reviewers noted sociopolitical issues that unusually for an animated series on a children s channel run through legend of korra according to forbes by telling some of darkest most mature stories ever animated legend of korra has created a new genre world s first animated television drama thill proposed that equalists cause in season 1 reflected recent appearance of occupy movement and dimartino responded that though series was written before occupy wall street began he agreed that show similarly depicted a large group of people who felt powerless up against a relatively small group of people in power beck wrote that legend of korra used magic to illustrate growing pains of a modernizing world seeing rise of technology and capitalism and taking halting jerky steps toward self governance while portraying no side of conflict as entirely flawless alyssa rosenberg praised show for examining issues of class in an urban setting and a guest post in her column argued that struggle between korra and amon s equalists reflected some of ideas of john rawls luck egalitarianism praising series for tackling moral issues of inequality and redistribution writing for escapist mike hoffman noted how series respected its younger viewers by explicitly showing but also giving emotional weight to death of major characters including one of most brutal and sudden deaths in children s television in case of p li in season 3 by portraying korra s opponents not as stereotypical villains but as human beings with understandable motivations corrupted by an excess of zeal series trusted in viewers to be able to resolve dissonance between understanding someone s view and disagreeing with their methods and hoffman wrote by showing korra to suffer from full on depression at end of third season and devoting much of fourth to her recovery series helped normalize mental health issues a theme generally unaddressed in children s television which made them less oppressive for viewers gender race and sexual orientation thumb series final shot intended to show asami and korra becoming a romantic couple was seen as pushing boundaries of lgbt representation in children s tv summing up book four joanna robinson for vanity fair described it as most subversive television event of year noting how much of season and series pushed boundaries of what is nominally children s television by breaking racial sexual and political ground it featured a brave strong brown skinned female lead character as well as a bevy of diverse female characters of all ages focused on challenging issues such as weapons of mass destruction ptsd and fascism and was infused with an eastern spirituality based on tenets such as balance and mindfulness levesley also highlighted many examples of well written women predominantly of color in series oliver sava at a v club noted that series had consistently delivered captivating female figures he considered it to be first and foremost about women and about how they relate to each other as friends family and rivals in romance and politics moreover according to robinson series final scene in which korra and asami gaze into each other s eyes in a shot mirroring composition of avatars final moments in which aang and katara kiss changed face of tv by going further than any other work of children s television in depicting same sex relationships an assessment shared by reviewers for tv com a v club usa today ign moviepilot and advocate mike hoffman on other hand felt that korra and asami s relationship was not intended as particularly subversive but as something writers trusted younger viewers now often familiar with same sex relationships to be mature enough to understand megan of polygon wrote that by portraying korra and asami as bisexual series even avoided error of assuming sexual orientation as many other tv series did to be a strict divide between gay and straight in 2018 io9 ranked series final scene 55 on its list of 100 most important pop culture moments of last 10 years accolades first season of legend of korra received numerous accolades it received two
