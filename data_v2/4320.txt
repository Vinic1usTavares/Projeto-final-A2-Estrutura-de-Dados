formosa air battle 12 16 october 1944 was a series of large scale aerial engagements between carrier air groups of united states navy fast carrier task force tf38 and japanese land based air forces of imperial japanese navy ijn and imperial japanese army ija battle consisted of american air raids against japanese military installations on formosa taiwan during day and japanese air attacks at night against american ships japanese losses exceeded 300 planes destroyed in air while american losses amounted to fewer than 100 aircraft destroyed and two cruisers damaged this outcome effectively deprived japanese navy s combined fleet of air cover for future operations which proved decisive during battle of leyte gulf later in october background japanese strategic plans for a decisive battle with u s fleet were already established by september 1944 anticipating various options open to american landing forces japanese operational order code named sho victory provided four scenarios to counter an invasion anywhere between philippines and kuriles plan was problematic for morale however because it broke with ijn tradition by assigning overriding importance to sinking u s supply vessels rather than u s warships as a result commander in chief of combined fleet admiral soemu toyoda flew out to front in early october to rally troops behind sho by 10 october toyoda s tour of front was complete he intended to depart from formosa for japan that same day but was forced to change his plans when vice admiral marc mitscher s fast carrier task force suddenly appeared to north launching strikes against ryukyu islands toyoda could not risk a return trip home through a concentrated enemy carrier force that now embarked more than 1 000 aircraft especially not after previous combined fleet commanders had been lost during aerial engagements as a result he was grounded far from combined fleet headquarters at a decisive moment out of position and with inadequate lines of communication response to such overwhelming enemy air power was left to toyoda s chief of staff vice admiral ryunosuke kusaka kusaka correctly saw these strikes as a precursor to u s troop landings in part due to imperial navy intelligence collected over previous week because he was still unsure exactly where enemy forces would land he chose to execute air component of sho 1 or sho 2the planned defense of philippines or formosa morning of 10october sho was a complex plan involving multiple naval surface forces sortieing from bases as far away as singapore and japan it would take these warships time to maneuver into position for a concerted attack rather than waiting for arrival of fleet for a combination of sea and air power kusaka ordered air forces reserved for sho to engage enemy at once he reinforced this order by implementing sho 2 in full on morning of 12october many aircraft were available for sho but were widely dispersed on 10october vice admiral shigeru fukudome s sixth base air force consisted of approximately 740 planes spread out from formosa to kyushu vice admiral kimpei teraoka s fifth base air force and lieutenant general kyoji tominaga s fourth air army of imperial japanese army air service ijaas in philippines together had around 440 aircraft over course of next four days an additional 690 or so planes arrived from japan and china although this represented a huge number of available aircraft imperial japanese navy air service ijnas was still recovering from losses suffered at battle of philippine sea in june while units were largely reconstituted in terms of quantity by this time pilot quality was in clear decline moreover though overall number of planes committed to battle by 12october dwarfed any force that japan had previously fielded in air u s navy s fast carrier force was capable of committing a much larger significantly better trained force order of battle imperial japanese navy air service 1 225 fighters bombers 1st

early warning knowing that dawn strikes on 12october were imminent ground forces were placed on alert and aircraft were readied for early morning intercept combat experience of u s carrier air groups during battle depended to a considerable degree upon disposition of their task group and assigned strike targets on morning of 12october four task groups of fast carrier task force were strung out roughly from northwest to southeast task group 38 2 as northernmost group was assigned northern third of formosa task group 38 3 was next in line and assigned central portion of island finally task groups 38 1 and 38 4 were jointly assigned southern formosa 12 october left thumb uss lexington cv 16 launching an during formosa air battle 12october 1944 all four task groups completed launch of pre dawn fighter sweeps by around 06 00 hours because japanese were on alert grumman f6f hellcat fighters from all four groups were intercepted by airborne enemy aircraft moderate to intense anti aircraft fire was universally reported air to air engagements were fiercest over northern and central formosa where planes from rear admiral gerald f bogan s tg38 2 and rear admiral frederick c sherman s tg38 3 operated sherman s and claimed almost 50 enemy aircraft shot down between them bogan s task group contained three essex class carriers and intrepid and bunker hill claimed over 50 japanese planes destroyed making combined total for two groups around 100 claimed victories american carrier air groups on other hand suffered minimal personnel losses during early morning fighter sweep in above two task groups only nine u s aircraft were shot down with three pilots subsequently recovered by nearby ships submarines these lopsided results were in part due to a lack of experience among japanese pilots ijaas fighters stationed to north of philippines for example were still in training bulk of enemy fighter aircraft reported by u s aviators were japanese army types primarily nakajima ki 44 allied reporting name tojo kawasaki ki 61 tony and nakajima ki 43 oscar models even though there were some experienced japanese naval aviators operating at this time ijnas mitsubishi a6m zero fighter units reconstituted after battle of philippine sea were still learning to work together and did not execute kind of section or division flying that yielded tactical advantage though day s remaining carrier strikes by hellcat fighters curtiss sb2c helldiver dive bombers and grumman tbf avenger torpedo bombers did significant damage to military installations on formosa it proved impossible to completely neutralize japanese air power based on island japanese response was well suppressed however and only effective counter attack to develop against tf38 came from japan itself an elite air attack unit trained for all weather and night flying called tair attack force moved south to execute japan s first large scale radar assisted nighttime aerial torpedo attack results were lackluster u s navy ships made smoke for cover and engaged in radical maneuvering to keep enemies astern as japanese planes dropped flares to illuminate their targets eight japanese planes were shot down by ships guns during night and three mitsubishi g4m betty bombers were claimed by night fighters from suffered damage from friendly fire but no damage from enemy aircraft was incurred 13 october on 13 october weather was more uncooperative than on previous day even though a wider array of targets was assigned to task groups from pescadores to northern luzon and formosa far fewer enemies were encountered in air results of day s strike operations were hard to ascertain due to overcast pilots reports from these two days of strikes helped uncover a larger network of air bases on formosa than previously anticipated this knowledge combined with radio intercepts and dusk strikes fended off previous evening led commander task force 38 mitscher to cancel any strikes scheduled to take off after 14 00 hours instead task groups prepared to defend against another night assault elements of t air attack force returned as expected to carry out twilight strikes against u s warships this time tgs38 1 and 38 4 found themselves under attack japanese formations were spotted via radar at 16 40 and intercepted by combat air patrol cap planes from tg38 4 s an hour later belleau wood fighters put enemy formation to rout more than 70 miles from carrier force destroying and bombers before returning to their ship thumb b6n torpedo bomber attacking tg38 3 during formosa air battle october 1944 by 18 12 just before sunset another formation of t attack force pilots was closing to within striking range of task groups six more planes were shot down in vicinity of tg38 4 in span of twenty minutes a subsequent group of six mitsubishi g4m betty bombers which had penetrated picket and evaded cap made determined attacks on carriers of tg38 4 putting four torpedoes in water before all six were shot down by shipboard anti aircraft guns one torpedo ran just ahead of and another ran too deep and passed beneath carrier one of bettys attempted to crash into franklin on its way down but glanced off flight deck and slid over starboard edge of ship into water tg 38 1 was not as lucky ten yokosuka p1y frances bombers made contact with group at 18 23 after eluding early radar detection by flying low over water though visual contact was made and shipboard anti aircraft fire destroyed six planes one frances pressed home a determined torpedo attack on carriers pilot was forced off course missing his chance to torpedo a fleet carrier however his torpedo struck killing 23 of her crew and inflicting serious damage upon cruiser both engine rooms flooded and damage was done to rudder as a result canberra had to be taken in tow as part of a new task group tg30 3 composed of ships detached from carrier groups around 22 00 began towing crippled cruiser to southeast 14 october task groups were forced to stay within enemy air range longer than anticipated due to canberra situation early morning fighter sweeps were launched to suppress air power on luzon and formosa while newly formed task group attempted to escort canberra to safety some air groups encountered japanese planes in strike zones but no major air to air combat developed throughout afternoon enemy aircraft flew to perimeter of task groups to relay sighting reports another long night at general quarters was anticipated by ctf 38 this intelligence was proved correct in short order tgs38 1 38 2 and 38 3 all suffered mass enemy air attacks between roughly 15 00 18 30 hours tg 38 2 was first group attacked a formation of 25 yokosuka d4y judy dive bombers using cloud cover to evade detection was intercepted by group s combat air patrol only a few japanese planes made it past american fighters surviving bombers were able to put two bombs in vicinity of hancock and one hit forward port side gun tub without detonating on impact no serious damage was inflicted by this attack left thumb uss canberra and uss houston under tow after receiving torpedo hits during formosa air battle 12 16october 1944 at around 17 00 a large formation of enemies showed up on radar headed towards tg38 3 as before a great many of these were shot down by combat air patrol surviving enemy planes flew down to water level to evade further radar detection these bombers and ambushed formation just minutes later evasive maneuvers squall weather and poor fighter cover on part of japanese helped tg38 3 escape without suffering any significant damage task group 38 1 had been designated as cover for retiring canberra group at 16 15 joined tg38 1 to replace wichita which had been positioned to port off wasp bow before its assignment as tow boat a large bogie appeared after sunset at 1831 anti aircraft batteries of group s picket ships downed ten planes as they attempted to close on carriers but there were many more that made it to center of group at least two enemy aircraft put torpedoes into water in vicinity of houston ship turned hard to starboard in an attempt to avoid first torpedo wake that was seen though a second torpedo missed ship to port first struck cruiser amidships between keel and armor belt flooding in engine rooms and other interior spaces caused ship to take on a many of ship s crew had gone over side of wallowing vessel into water an order to abandon ship was almost given but it was decided that would tow damaged cruiser back east though attacks against tg 38 1 continued for hours after houston was hit no further successes were scored by japanese raiders 15 october initially operations orders called for task groups to refuel on this date given torpedoing of houston and canberra however only tgs38 2 and 38 3 departed for refueling tg38 4 was reassigned strikes on luzon to keep attacking planes at bay while tg38 1 continued to function as escort for group of damaged ships now nicknamed crippled faced with decision to either scuttle or protect damaged cruisers advisers to admiral william halsey jr commander of u s 3rd fleet convinced him to turn a bad situation into an opportunity unofficially dubbed bait division slow moving ships and their escorts were used as a lure to draw out japanese fleet urgent radio transmissions were broadcast on open channels in hopes of enemy interception it appeared based on sighting reports that plan might work in morning and evening cruiser and battleship forces were reported heading south from japan and southeast from formosa meanwhile enemy air attacks did not slack off despite severe losses suffered by japanese over preceding days rather than waiting for nighttime raids japanese attack formations escorted by a6m zero fighters conducted strikes on tgs38 1 and 38 4 from dawn to dusk combat air patrol over tg38 4 had to be augmented with additional fighters to intercept incoming japanese aircraft approximately two dozen japanese attack and fighter planes were shot down between 10 45 10 56 hours by a combination of cap fighters and ships guns fighters from accounted for many more planes destroyed throughout afternoon hours though franklin took a glancing bomb hit during these battles damage proved superficial tg38 4 planes did battle with enemy over land as well air group 13 cag 13 aboard franklin encountered a large group of enemies at nielson field during morning strikes against luzon they claimed at least 20 enemy planes for a loss of just one hellcat fighter once again tg 38 1 was subject to most concerted japanese attacks no offensive strikes were launched by group s aircraft instead cap strength was bolstered as much as possible fighting squadron 14 vf 14 aboard claimed 30 enemy planes shot down by day s end and other carrier fighter groups in task group downed over a dozen more some close bomb hits were recorded by carriers but no real damage was done to any u s warship during these attacks 16 october thumb japanese aerial torpedo explodes against uss houstons starboard quarter during afternoon of 16october 1944 while ship was under tow by uss pawnee long range searches were conducted in morning and afternoon by task force aircraft it was hoped that a japanese surface fleet would be heading towards broadcast location of bait division unfortunately by evening it was clear that enemy reconnaissance aircraft had taken stock of remaining u s fleet strength no surface engagement developed from halsey s lure of streamlined bait though enemy ships did not materialize japanese air attacks continued in force throughout morning and into afternoon dedicated air cover for tg30 3 was provided by light carriers and whose air groups intercepted numerous bandits largest strike consisting of 75 japanese attack and fighter planes arrived around 13 30 hours one twin engine plane fought through cap and ships anti aircraft batteries surviving just long enough to put a torpedo in water before plane itself crashed into sea torpedo struck after portion of starboard side of houston blowing 20 men overboard and spreading gasoline fires in waters around cruiser initially unsure whether ship would hold together captain ordered evacuation of 300 crew members while ship s condition was ascertained in end it was determined she would stay afloat towing continued as before slowly moving task group towards navy base at ulithi aftermath surviving japanese pilots returned with tales of a stunning victory it was reported that practically whole u s third fleet had been sunk and that american carrier force was left in shambles though some members of ijn command were initially skeptical of such reports this narrative was carried forward by members of cabinet until it reached emperor hirohito he congratulated navy and army for their success newspapers in particular trumpeted these claims repeating that u s task force was broken and in retreat even those unconvinced members of ijn up to and including toyoda believed some kind of victory had been achieved off formosa actually formosa air battle represented a rout of japanese air forces and a turning point for future naval operations upon realizing scale of japanese defeat suffered on 12 october alone vice admiral fukudome lamented our fighters were nothing but so many eggs thrown at stone wall of indomitable enemy formation in response to american strikes on formosa beginning 12 october newly formed carrier units like japanese 634th naval air group nag were detached from their ships in ijn s fourth carrier division posted to land based 2nd air fleet 634th nag experienced rapid attrition throughout remainder of month by january 1945 this group had no personnel capable of maintaining flight operations at same time older carrier units like 653rd naval air group which had just finished rebuilding after losses suffered during first battle of philippine sea were detached and similarly integrated into 2nd air fleet over course of formosa air battle alone 653rd nag lost almost half of its available aircraft between aforementioned carrier air group losses which deprived vice admiral jisaburo ozawa s ships of their pilots and losses of experienced land based attack units like tair attack force there remained no real prospect of providing air cover over japanese fleet for coming battle of leyte gulf both historians of battle and ijn commanders have acknowledged this factor as primary reason for sho plan s failure h p willmott writes in large measure japanese defeat in philippines had assumed substance prior to landing operations of 17 and this was case because of nature and extent of victory won by american carrier air groups in course of their operations after 10october toyoda when posed question what would you say was primary cause for lack of success in that operation responded our weakness in air and fact that our pilots under admiral ozawa were not sufficiently trained formosa air battle also proved a turning point for japanese military tactics organized kamikaze attacks had been proposed after first battle of philippine sea but were rejected by imperial japanese navy leaders through september 1944 only in immediate wake of formosa air battle when vice admiral takijiro onishi replaced vice admiral kimpei teraoka as leader of ijn s 1st air fleet were units specifically deployed with intent to crash dive enemy vessels notes references bibliography primary sources external links category philippine sea category pacific ocean theatre of
