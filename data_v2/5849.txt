university in 1969 university president syracuse university corbally replaced william pearson tolley as chancellor at syracuse and reorganized school s administration structure to match what he had experienced at ohio adding a provost and multiple vice president positions as opposed to single vice chancellor position that university had before during his short time as chancellor corbally faced crises spurred on by civil unrest surrounding vietnam war and race relations tolley his predecessor was a proponent of military education on campus this included establishment of a reserve officers training corps rotc program by time tolley left office university faced major financial issues and there was uncertainty regarding future of rotc program corbally advocated for keeping program and its academic accreditation an idea which was opposed by students hostile to a military presence on campus some of whom participated in a sit in of rotc building in february 1970 matter was referred to school senate a democratic body composed of students faculty and administrators which voted to keep program open a move which many students felt was forced by chancellor later that same year on may 4 shooting of four students at kent state protesting against united states invasion of cambodia led directly to student strike of 1970 a nationwide protest by students on college campuses against us involvement in vietnam including at syracuse early protests on campus led to firebombing and window breaking but corbally s decision to cancel classes and allow students to protest without police or administration interference arguably resulted in more moderate protests than at other colleges peace was short lived however as in august 1970 eight black players on syracuse orange football team did not show up for preseason practice citing systemic racism in program and discrimination by coach ben move was a continuation of a boycott of spring practice by players and they were automatically suspended as a result a university report released in december of that year declared that there was a chronic problem of racism in syracuse athletics programs though in some cases discrimination was unintentional in response corbally reinstated players and approved creation of athletic policy board to oversee athletics at school board would include input from students and ensure that all students regardless of race were entitled to fair treatment university of illinois in early 1971 corbally was offered presidency of university of illinois system which he readily accepted suddenness of his resignation at syracuse led to speculation that he had been pressured to leave due to tense events of 1970 or that he wanted to jump ship from a school still facing financial difficulties however john robert greene in a 1998 book on history of syracuse argues that none of that is true corbally handled student protesters and football boycott admirably despite criticism at time from some alumni of school and he along with his vice chancellor ronald brady had improved financial status of school much in two years since corbally took office according to greene chancellor took new job simply because he received a better job offer corbally was succeeded by his provost melvin eggers at illinois corbally replaced david d henry who stated he was stepping down in favor of a younger president with fresh ideas almost immediately corbally sought to raise capital to fund construction and programs at what was then ninth largest university system in country especially focusing on chicago campus and school s veterinary medicine and agriculture programs corbally enlisted help of alumni from these programs to raise money for two new buildings on urbana champaign campus in 1976 1977 corbally sought to preserve funding to university of illinois at a time when governor dan walker was seeking cuts to state university budgets continued funding was secured from state legislature in 1977 by way of a campaign by current and former students of school organized by corbally macarthur foundation corbally was elected to board of directors of chicago based macarthur foundation in 1979 he later
