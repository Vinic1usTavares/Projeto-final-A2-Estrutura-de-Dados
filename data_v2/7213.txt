for players of different abilities levels were made much larger than those in spyro 2 so that more areas for minigames could be added to prevent player confusion on where to go next these areas were designed to load separately from main hubs price stated that addition of critters was a way to make game more enjoyable and varied instead of just adding more moves for spyro game was named year of dragon simply because it was released during 2000 year of dragon in chinese zodiac in previews publications such as ign and gamespot noted that graphics had been improved and that there were many new characters and locations new minigames were previewed and ign pointed out that they offered enough complexity to back up simple gameplay in an interview with gamespot ted price stated that emphasis for title was on new critters but that spyro would not be left behind in story year of dragon also implemented crack protection in addition to copy protection previous games had contained this helped prevent hackers from cracking game until two months after release despite positive response game would go on to receive year of dragon was developer insomniac games last spyro title in an interview ceo ted price said that company stopped producing games because they could not do anything new with character and that after five years of development on a single series team wanted to do something

of dragon was composed and produced by stewart copeland former drummer for rock band police with additional contributions by ryan beveridge during band s hiatus copeland composed several movie soundtracks and composed scores for previous spyro titles price stated that copeland s offering for third installment was his best work to date in an interview copeland stated that his creative process for writing music for spyro series always began by playing through levels trying to get a feel for each world s atmosphere copeland noted challenge of writing for games was to create music that would both be interesting to listen to and complemented gameplay his approach was to incorporate more complicated harmonies and basslines so that music could seem fresh for players even after repeated listening he complimented compact disc format of playstation and its support for high quality audio there were no technical constraints that stopped him from producing sound he wanted copeland recorded entire orchestral scores for extra flourish when visuals called for an expansive sound but used more percussive and beat driven melodies for high energy moments in game release and

game to date and arguably best playstation game overall publications like psxextreme thought music helped bring atmosphere to varied worlds and allgame enthused that insomniac should be commended for realizing importance of music in games it seems to enhance whole experience other points of praise were voice acting and character development some reviewers critiqued that camera could be annoying at times particularly when it was unable to keep up with spyro joseph of game revolution found sound to be well done but nothing extraordinary arguing that background music and sound effects were both fairly generic while voice acting was better than usual he also called game s premise its only real flaw as it was too unoriginal but added that story that unfolds as you actually play game is flawlessly interwoven and quite entertaining other publications cautioned that elements of game might feel too much like those of its predecessors references category 2000 video games category 3d
