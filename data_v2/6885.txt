ward twice sued city of chicago to force it to remove buildings and structures from grant park and to keep it from building new ones second suit was still pending in 1906 and legal cloud regarding deliberations of architectural limitations in grant park caused inaction garvey pp 14 15 while trustees remained silent taft sought wider public support by publishing a picture of spirit of great lakes in century magazine which drew interest from buffalo new york as a host of final work by february 1907 buffalo illustrated times published a cover with an image of work and a caption describing anticipation of beautifying buffalo society for obtaining work for city garvey p 15 17 however by end of 1907 taft and his connections with trust fund resolved his commission on october 31 1907 ferguson trust board voted taft a commission and on december 16 he signed a 38 000 contract to commence work commission was first commission from ferguson fund garvey p 142 despite financial agreement it would be some time before a determination of a site for work ward s suit continued to loom over deliberations one proposal was to locate it in grant park south of art institute and another was to locate it at 35th street and grand boulevard now martin luther king jr drive intersection that now hosts chicago landmark and national register of historic places listed victory monument 1909 art institute annual report mentioned a proposal for a sunken garden with a focal fountain south of institute legal issues regarding land use intensified in 1910 and art institute began to make modest plans for fountain almost attached to south wall of its own building garvey pp 18 20 for next few years there was little mention of fountain as taft focused on other work then in may 1913 fountain model at taft s midway studios was disassembled and taken to jules s foundry for bronze casting shepley rutan and coolidge designed base for sculpture garvey p 37 it was subsequently assembled by mid august in preparation for a september 9 1913 dedication date in 1963 with construction of new morton wing of art institute of chicago building fountain was moved from its south facing position adjacent to original building that was visible from historic michigan boulevard district to west wall of new wing in a position facing westward sculpture was positioned so that plaque on back which reads that fund must be used for erecting and maintaining enduring statuary and monuments is no longer legible thumb fountain of great lakes was almost located at 35th street and king drive where national register of historic places listed victory monument now sits although taft is now better remembered for his books such as history of american sculpture which is regarded as first comprehensive work on subject in title he was in his day well known for portraits and allegorical public sculpture especially public fountains fountain was produced in period following his assignment to design sculptures for william le baron jenney s horticultural building when he designed several large scale public works including fountain of time at time of dedication taft described ferguson fund commission to sculpt fountain as a turning point in his career that led to increased publicity more commissions and growing recognition in community which combined to give him encouragement for further commitment to arts he hoped that fountain of great lakes would mark a new era of civic beautification and that it would also mark beginning of chicago school of sculpture garvey p 140 dream that chicago would be epicenter of sculpting universe had been bred during world s columbian exposition twenty years earlier and rekindled with ferguson bequest fountain of great lakes was a major career accomplishment for taft which propelled him beyond level of a portraitist garvey p 141 critical response general opinion of fountain of great lakes was positive with some describing it as a cultural achievement for taft and chicago detractors conceded that as a figural composition it was ideal in an old world way critics voiced concern over sculpture s confusion and decorum garvey pp 149 150 one of basic problems for critics was propriety of symbolism of artistic and attractive bronze figures posed as bodies of water there had for some time been discussion of depictions representing relative elevations and flows of waters as they seem to do there were grumblings for closer association of figures to lakes by use of physical features directional orientation and definite contours harriet monroe a general supporter of taft s artistic efforts was disappointed in lack of representative geographic configuration and lack of spirit of lakes as inland seas garvey pp 150 55 with respect to this specific piece she had gone from being an ardent supporter who felt model was stupendous to finding herself in doubt about work garvey pp 162 63 taft s human form depictions of lake failed to capture imagery of contemporary literature as it related to power and fury of nature and heroism of those struggling against those forces in works such as those of hamlin garland charles eugene banks willa or robert morss lovett taft s representations of lakes with quiet trickling water was in keeping with his general theme of quiet dignity for public sculpture on day of dedication chicago daily news expressed this point with a photomontage juxtaposition of taft s fountain and lake michigan in all its fury after one got past symbolism of ladies as lakes complaints existed about lack of recognition of contemporary form of female representation in art and literature which had gone from lillian russell type to gibson girl to lillie langtry image while taft had apparently chosen packing house ladies as his female form garvey p 156 when taft presented live depictions of his sculptures with quintets of women he faced complaints that three of his five sculptural compositions had nude upper torsos while his live representations were fully clothed degree to which nudity in public art was more for sake of nudity than for sake of art was a contemporary issue involving confiscated paul fully nude painting roman catholic church critics art dealers and collectors all this led to a 1913 amendment to chicago municipal obscenity laws proposed by mayor of chicago carter harrison jr to chicago city council which passed three months before dedication of taft s partially nude fountain garvey p 158 chicago tribune writers stood behind taft s fountain using humor against what they described as a streak of over accentuated puritanism that could adversely affect public art taft had beaux arts training that lent itself well to allegorical sculpture for fountain of great lakes taft claimed an inspiration from greek mythology danaus ordered his 49 daughters to kill their husbands and condemned them to delivering water to a bottomless vessel in hades this was in keeping with taft s penchant for classical inspiration although this was a loose association where number of daughters was reduced from 49 to 5 and artist s task did not seem to be nearly as cruel as mythological one
