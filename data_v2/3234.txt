guianan cock of rock rupicola rupicola is a species of a passerine bird from south america it is about in length and weighs about it is found in tropical rainforests near its preferred habitat of rocky outcrops female s plumage is brownish dark smokey grey in colour and generally less noticeable coloured than males because of their nesting work in rocky areas male s feathers are a bright orange both have a heavy body broad based bill and wear a remarkable half moon crest on head it is one of two species of genus rupicola other being andean cock of rock guianan cock of rock lives across forested region of northeastern south america its diet consists mostly of fruit but sometimes includes small snakes and lizards female guianan cock of rock breeds in early months of year and on average lays her eggs around march females choose a mate by flying down to ground and pecking male on his rump male then turns around and mating takes place almost immediately during height of mating season males engage in competitive displays in lek which is a complex courting behaviour that is done to attract females males and females live separately except when females choose a mate mating success varies based on multiple factors ranging from plumage exhibited by a male to composition of lek itself there is speculation that male to male competition is an important factor in lek formation and breeding main predators of guianan cock of rock are harpy eagles and black and white hawk eagles description left thumb male guianan cock of rock perched showing a frontal view of eccentric crests guianan cock of rock is a stout bodied bird with a prominent half moon crest it is a sexually dimorphic bird male s crest is more pronounced than female s and is bright orange males also have an orange tipped black tail black orange and white wings a bright orange bill an orange iris yellowing as it nears its outer edge and silky orange filamentous feathers of inner remiges both sexes also have orange legs and skin less conspicuous female is dark brownish grey overall and has a yellow tipped black bill a duller orange iris and a smaller crest one year old juvenile males look similar to an adult female but has orange speckles over their bodies after two years juvenile males become mostly orange with brown and grey spots males attain their definitive plumage at around three years juvenile females look almost identical to their adult counterparts guianan cocks of rock have a total length of approximately and a total weight of around richter w and g m kirwan 2011 guianan cock of rock rupicola rupicola neotropical birds online t s schulenberg ed cornell lab of ornithology ithaca ny usa two species of cock of rock are allopatric and therefore do not meet with one another plumage of male andean is redder and its wings are mostly black lacking orange colouration seen on male guianan female andean is reddish brown rather than brownish gray of guianan etymology generic and specific names are derived from latin words rupes rock or cliff and cola inhabiting which express its habit of nesting on rock walls taxonomy cock of rock is one of two species of genus rupicola it was described by carl linnaeus in 1766 as type species of its genus its closest relative and congener andean cock of rock rupicola peruvianus is similar in body shape and colouration though two are wholly allopatric from each other their closest family relatives are red cotingas genus phoenicircus two rupicola species are in subfamily which also includes other species of cotingas such as before mentioned red cotingas genus phoenicircus which is a sister genus to rupicola and genus range and habitat left thumb male in its lush tropical habitat as suggested by its name guianan cock of rock is found in guianan shield occurring in french guiana suriname guyana southern venezuela eastern colombia and northern amazonian brazil its preferred habitats are humid forests near rocky outcrops they are normally found at an altitude of guianan cock of rock has distinctive territorial markings males usually take dominance of an area on ground although sometimes they occupy middle strata in forests they make their characteristic marking by clearing out debris from ground including twigs leaves and pellets this area is called a court quality of courts are known to have some influence on mate choice court quality is determined by territory density and location to center of activity in lek reason for focus on center of activity in lek is that successful males tended to own courts in most densely clustered lek areas guianan courts are commonly found in guianan shield a forested region in northeastern south america del hoyo i elliott a christie d a eds 2004 handbook of birds of world vol 9 cotingas to pipits and wagtails edicions barcelona p 751 ecology and behavior diet diet of adult guianan cock of rock consists mainly of fruits meaning they are frugivorous up to 65 species of fruit have been reported in their diet primarily from canopy trees or lianas three quarters 75 of fruit eaten by guianan cock of rock at one study site were either black or red coloured fruit in british guiana e thomas gilliard found papayas growing at base of a huge rock on top of rock were perched females that were nesting he found that no other papayas were growing in that part of forest and speculated that perched females ate papayas in forest where they are native and dropped seeds below where they were nesting small snakes lizards insects and frogs are occasionally found in its diet by selectively feeding on nearby fruit trees and then defecating or regurgitating seeds within leks these birds can actively influence regeneration and succession of forest habitat where they breed breeding left thumb closer view of male s crest and ornamental feathers guianan cocks of rock breed early in year and females lay their eggs around march nesting in rocky areas during height of mating season males gather in leks with multiple males defending a social display arena of much greater area than that of a lone male males each have their own area on forest floor where they make their courts size of each court is about in diameter and next bird is often about away females and males live separately only when it is time to mate do females fly over to observe and choose a male when this occurs females tap males from behind and insemination quickly follows when females approach a lek males stand firmly and present themselves rigidly mating success is dependent on a variety of factors that range from plumage exhibited by a male to composition of lek itself in one study female guianan cocks of rock displayed sexual selection based off sequential comparisons or threshold standards hens engaged in a pool comparison tactic meaning that females chose males of higher rank in courtship males of higher rank were those with more matings received from other females lower ranking single males were ignored rankings were determined by where courts were positioned in lek courts that were more centrally placed indicated more successful and higher ranking males females in study were individually observed to aggregate towards larger more centrally concentrated leks demonstrating active female choice nesting unlike other species of family guianan cock of rock makes its nest on rocky cliff faces and caves rather than in trees female lays one or two eggs in nest of mud and plant material which is attached by saliva to a vertical rock female takes care of building and maintenance of nest incubation of eggs and parenting male does not participate at all eggs typically incubate for 27 28 days ideal nesting sites for this species are usually located in a cave or vertical rock face with crevices that provide some shelter and protection from elements nests themselves are solid moldings formed from mud and plant material deposited into crevices due to solid nature of these nests they typically persist from one breeding season to next females will make repairs to their nests as a breeding season begins mating behavior thumb left illustration by jacques barraband showing male plumage smaller of two cocks of rock male guianan takes lesser part in breeding it is polygynous and has nothing to do with nesting once mating is done male s energy instead is devoted to very elaborate display rituals that show off its magnificent plumage these displays take place in communal leks where 40 or more males may gather to challenge rivals and beckon to females displaying male purposely contrasts itself from forest shows its crest and plumage so much that bill and tail become obscured almost making it difficult to recognize as a bird to attract females within lek each female has its own perch on a low branch while males own a court on ground below that is cleared of dead leaves by draughts of each male taking off and landing males have a variety of calls and movements showing off crest elongated filaments on rump secondary feathers and snapping of their bills males display on branches about from ground until a female approaches when males display and call from individual plots on ground most males copulate with only a few females however some are very successful and may copulate with many unlike many other bird species male does not use resources nor parental care to entice females alexander r d and tinkle d w eds 1981 natural selection and social behavior recent research and new theory chiron press pp 138 169 males often engage in courtship disruption practices in a study conducted by pepper w trail interactions between adult males females and yearlings were observed and linked to mate choice and male dispersion patterns within leks adult males produced this disruptive behaviour with varying intensity which depended on situation in lower intensity disruptions males usually directed their aggression or threats towards neighboring males in attempts to improve or maintain breeding status and success males that were hassled tended to be more successful and often were disrupted with much greater frequency than males with lower mating success higher intensity disruptions were used by less successful males and directed towards females that wandered by this behaviour is suggested to have effect of redirecting females towards hassling male yearlings often disrupted courtships of more mature adults on basis of practice for future courtships since yearlings do not possess any territory within lek female disruption was an uncommon event that had little if any effect on accessibility of a male young males of highly promiscuous species such as cock of rock often failed to mate in their first year probably because older more experienced males will enjoy majority of matings in this strong system of sexual selection successive breeding of dominant and aggressive males leads to high sex drives and endurance of polygyny a theory suggests that selection of these aggressive males also puts a premium or value on female characteristics hence there is a less likely occurrence of female elicited aggression ecological consequences one possible advantage to lek formation in guianan cock of rock and other species is severe selection and consequent rapid evolutionary advancement all of which is possible due to high of males only a few males are needed to fertilize next generation courtship behaviour is similarly theorized to have arisen from differences in division of labour between two sexes females expend their energy on building nests and rearing young while males spend most of their time and energy of finding mates and caring for their plumage guianan cocks of rock form large leks averaging 55 adult males males in these display leks were especially vulnerable to attacks and predation by large snakes and other natural predators in manipulated groups of smaller size around 6 predation was less likely to occur due to an inverse relationship between number and frequency of attacks and size of leks thus with a smaller frequency of attacks on smaller group guianan cock of rock males was less likely to flush or disperse completely as compared to a large group where a false alarm could trigger a complete flush 90 of time it was found that these birds have relatively ineffective methods of anti predation and that social anti predation and infrequency of encounters with predators were keeping these males alive there is speculation that simulation of male male competition is important in lek formation and breeding impact of natural and sexual selection on trait development colouration of males allows them to visibly stand out from brown forest floor this bright colouration provides a sexual advantage for adult males increasing their likelihood of successfully mating result is rapid evolutionary selection within species for brighter plumage and more conspicuous behaviour patterns in males bright colouration also makes males more susceptible to predation males are more expendable for this reason only a small number of males are needed within any generation in order to perpetuate species while sexual selection leads to bright plumage natural selection in turn favors defensive colouration in birds there is higher fitness in birds monitoring nests whose colouration acts as camouflage protection from predation conservation fairly common in its large range and with its population stable guianan cock of rock is considered by international union for conservation of nature to be a least concern on its red list of threatened species main predators of guianan cock of rock are harpy eagles black and white hawk eagles black hawk eagles bald eagles golden eagles and slaty backed forest falcons although these are main predators four species of owls crested owls blakiston s fish owls northern eagle owls and spectacled owls are also predators felines such as jaguar mountain lion and ocelot can also be predators along with snakes such as bird snake tree boas boa constrictor tiger rat snake and fer de lance species is rare in captivity but breeding has been achieved at a small number of facilities world s first successful captive breeding was at dallas world aquarium usa in 2008 predation response in larger lek groups there is less risk of predation in a group there are more individuals to alert group about an approaching predator all birds in groups will be vigilant in looking for a predator because there is an advantage to seeing predator first there is also risk that in a bigger group there will more false alarm signals common signal is vocalization after which birds will fly up into trees it was found birds did not however give this signal when there was a snake references further reading external links birdlife species factsheet guianan cock of rock category birds of colombia category birds of
