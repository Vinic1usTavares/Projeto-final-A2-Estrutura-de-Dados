przevalski s nuthatch sitta przewalskii originally given nomen nudum sitta eckloni is a bird species in sittidae family collectively known as nuthatches long regarded as a subspecies of white cheeked nuthatch sitta leucopsis it nevertheless differs significantly in morphology and vocalizations both s przewalskii and s leucopsis have been regarded as closely related to north american white breasted nuthatch sitta carolinensis it is a medium sized nuthatch measuring about in length its upper body is a dark gray blue or slate color becoming dark blue black at crown cheeks and throat are a white buff orange turning to a rich cinnamon on underparts that intensifies in color on sides of breast vocalizations consist of alternating series of ascending whistles and short notes bird is endemic to areas in southeastern tibet and west central china including eastern qinghai gansu and sichuan inhabiting coniferous mountain forests of spruce or fir altitude at which it nests varies according to locality but typically is from species was first described in 1891 from a specimen collected in china s haidong prefecture common name and latin binomial commemorate russian explorer nikolay przhevalsky who discovered species in 1884 little is known about its ecology which is probably comparable to that of white cheeked nuthatch it was given rank of full species separate from white cheeked nuthatch in 2005 in pamela c rasmussen s birds of south asia ripley guide other authorities followed suit but as of 2014 s przewalskii does not have a full threat status evaluation by birdlife international or international union for conservation of nature a 2014 phylogenetic study of species found it to be at base of nuthatch evolutionary tree out of 21 species examined dispelling a hypothesis that s przewalskii could belong to same species as s carolinensis taxonomy thumb left drawing by john gould and h c richter of a white cheeked nuthatch couple s przewalskii s supposed closest cousins nuthatches constitute a genus sitta of small passerine birds belonging to family sittidae genus may be further divided into seven subgenera of which s przewalskii belongs to along with its nominate subspecies sitta leucopsis and white breasted nuthatch sitta carolinensis nuthatches are typified by short compressed wings and short square 12 feathered tails compact bodies longish pointed bills strong toes with long claws and behaviorally by their unique head first manner of descending tree trunks most nuthatches have gray or blue upperparts and a black eyestripe one recognizable feature of przevalski s nuthatch is that it lacks eyestripe common to most nuthatch species sitta is derived from ancient greek name for nuthatches sitte nuthatch first recorded in 1350 is derived from nut and a word probably related to hack since these birds hack at nuts they have wedged into crevices sitta przewalskii was first scientifically described in 1891 by russians mikhail mikhailovich berezovsky and valentin bianchi based on a single specimen obtained in haidong prefecture in eastern qinghai common name and latin binomial commemorate russian explorer nikolay przhevalsky who discovered species in tibet in 1884 and dubbed it sitta eckloni without providing adequate description rendering it a nomen nudum though primary habitats of sitta przewalskii and white cheeked nuthatch sitta leucopsis are separated from each other by almost przevalski s nuthatch was described as closely related to white cheeked nuthatch and was thereafter often considered and treated as a subspecies of s leucopsis in 2005 pamela c rasmussen granted taxon autonomous status in her book birds of south asia ripley guide uncoupling species from s leucopsis classification was noted by ornithologists nigel j collar and john d pilgrim in 2007 and endorsed by international ornithological congress by alan p peterson in his well known zoological nomenclature resource and by internet bird collection ibc sponsored by handbook of birds of world no subspecies of s przewalskii itself have been identified in explaining this separation of species rasmussen points to morphological divergence and significant differences in vocalization ornithologist edward c dickinson observed in a 2006 article that though evidence of morphological and vocal differences between s przewalskii and s leucopsis have been delineated little had yet been published presenting comparative morphological details and that it would be instructive to study how each taxon responds to calls of other white cheeked nuthatch with s przewalskii subsumed within it has been regarded as closely related to north american white breasted nuthatch sitta carolinensis which has a similar contact call though s is moderately higher in pitch and they have sometimes been treated as conspecific in turn it has been proposed that triumvirate of s przewalskii s leucopsis and s carolinensis could be related to sitta canadensis monophyletic group corresponding to subgenus which includes six species of average sized nuthatches relationships remain very unclear a molecular study by eric pasquet conducted in 2014 may provide some clarity in 2014 eric pasquet et al published a phylogeny based on examination of nuclear and mitochondrial dna of 21 nuthatch species though s leucopsis was not included in study it found that within nuthatch group covered s przewalskii is basal an ancestor at base or root to nuthatch evolutionary family tree and thus sister to all other nuthatches without any close relatives findings resulted from phylogenetic analyses employing bayesian inference and maximum likelihood methods a biogeographical analysis using dispersal extinction cladogenesis model was then performed cladogram drawn from evidence indicates that first clade and closest descendants of przevalski s nuthatch are north american white breasted nuthatch and giant nuthatch s magna dispelling hypothesis that s przewalskii could belong to same species as s carolinensis description thumb illustration of s przewalskii in worn plumage by j g keulemans because sitta przewalskii has long been regarded as a subspecies of white cheeked nuthatch its description has often been made in comparison with it though both species lack black eyestripe typical of other nuthatches their coloring is distinct with s leucopsis being white or creamy buff on its throat cheeks breast flanks and belly where s przewalskii has varying shades and concentrations of cinnamon s przewalskii is also smaller of two and its bill is markedly thinner males and females of species are nearly identical in appearance except for male s brighter cinnamon coloring area above eyes including forehead crown and nape is a deep blue black through top edge of mantle mantle proper is a medium to dark gray blue as are tertials and upperwing coverts turning to a dark gray at median greater and primary coverts and alula secondaries and inner primaries are fringed in gray blue central rectrices are gray blue and outer rectrices are a blackish gray paling towards tips face and surrounding areas including lores supercilium ear coverts cheeks and throat are a white buff orange below belly and breast are a rich cinnamon darkening to an orange cinnamon at sides of breast rear flanks and undertail covert feathers are rufous in worn plumage color may be uneven in lower parts and lighter in hue upper mandible of bill is black and lower is gray with a black tip iris and legs are dark brown juveniles of species resemble adults but for base of their beaks being yellow proportionately shorter and their overall coloring being less vibrant przevalski s nuthatch is a medium sized bird measuring about in length folded wing of male is long and that of female an average of shorter than white cheeked nuthatch wingspan is about beak measures which is thinner and shorter than that of s leucopsis in which beak is approximately long tarsus is and tail is in length vocalizations and behavior sitta przewalskii s territorial calls differ significantly from those of s leucopsis whose notes are more nasal whereas song of s przewalskii is in long verses composed of whistles that ascend in pitch interspersed with short notes according to handbook of birds of world vocalizations include a muffled mellow chip repeated in irregular series a loud emphatic whistled dweep or dweep eep a slightly nasal querulous que usually repeated 3 5 times and thinner pee pee pee pee or seet seet seet seet notes on same pitch but slowing towards end of phrase in 1950 english naturalist frank ludlow reported a description of bird as provided to him by ernst schafer who studied an adult male near litang in 1934 it was characterized as one of shyest and rarest denizens of conifer forest and one leading a solitary life much like nearby populations of three toed woodpeckers picoides by contrast ludlow observed species in southeastern tibet probably during winter and did not find it particularly reserved he reports having killed a specimen in a willow tree far from species usual coniferous nesting grounds specimen was captured on outskirts of a forest on a ridge between two valleys where it stood on a dead branch from which it launched in pursuit of insects in flight like a flycatcher distribution and habitat thumb 230px species is endemic to an area in west central china and southeastern tibet in china it is found in eastern qinghai from daba mountains as far north as hui autonomous county and as far south as plateau of amdo 35deg n e as well as in southern part of qinghai in county in area of yellow river in county in gansu southwest of and min counties in sichuan where it has been observed in north center and west of province including sightings in county at valley nature reserve in mountains in district in region of county and in area of litang species has also been observed in kunming yunnan in far southwestern china where it most likely migrates to overwinter in tibet species has been found in northeastern tibet autonomous region in prefecture and in southeast of region in tse in december and in dzeng in april both in south tibet tsangpo valley region tsangpo valley sightings may be anomalous only indicating winter visitation bird observed in dzeng was in an environment alien to species normal coniferous forest environs and both dzeng and tse individuals had atypically pale underparts indicating they may have been nominate s leucopsis but with genetic introgression traits from przevalski s nuthatch s przewalskii inhabits coniferous mountain forests of spruce or fir its altitudinal range commonly approaches a forest s tree line in china it has been observed at height distributions of in sichuan during august and in qinghai at and at approximately during june in western nepal a range of has been described in tibet individuals have been recorded at heights of in northeast and from in southeast threats and protection sitta przewalskii is not yet treated as an independent species by birdlife international or international union for conservation of nature and its threat level is not evaluated by either despite being described as rare in china and southeast tibet because taxon is treated instead as a subspecies of s leucopsis evaluation of its population incorporates relative abundance of its parent species concomitantly it takes on its parent category of least concern as s przewalskii has not been extensively studied independently from s leucopsis a classification of data deficient could be applied but rarity of sightings indicates concern for its status a finding of near threatened or even classification as a vulnerable species may be warranted notes and references notes references bibliography external links photograph of przevalski s nuthatch in worn plumage photograph of przevalski s nuthatch in fresh
