noisy miner manorina melanocephala is a bird in honeyeater family meliphagidae and is endemic to eastern and south eastern australia this miner is a grey bird with a black head orange yellow beak and feet a distinctive yellow patch behind eye and white tips on tail feathers tasmanian race has a more intense yellow panel in wing and a broader white tip to tail males females and juveniles are similar in appearance though young birds are a brownish grey as common name suggests noisy miner is a vocal species with a large range of songs calls scoldings and alarms and almost constant vocalisations particularly from young birds one of four species in genus manorina noisy miner itself is divided into four subspecies separation of tasmanian m m leachi is of long standing and mainland birds were further split in 1999 found in a broad arc from far north queensland through new south wales and victoria to tasmania and southeastern south australia noisy miner primarily inhabits dry open eucalypt forests that lack understory shrubs these include forests dominated by spotted gum box and ironbark as well as in degraded woodland where understory has been cleared such as recently burned areas farming and grazing areas roadside reserves and suburban parks and gardens with trees and grass but without dense shrubbery density of noisy miner populations has significantly increased in many locations across its range particularly human dominated habitats popularity of nectar producing garden plants such as large flowered grevilleas was thought to play a role in its proliferation but studies now show that noisy miner has benefited primarily from landscaping practices that create open areas dominated by eucalypts noisy miners are gregarious and territorial they forage bathe roost breed and defend territory communally forming colonies that can contain several hundred birds each bird has an activity space and birds with overlapping activity spaces form associations called coteries most stable units within colony birds also form temporary flocks called coalitions for specific activities such as mobbing a predator group cohesion is facilitated not only by vocalisations but also through ritualised displays which have been categorised as flight displays postural displays and facial displays noisy miner is a notably aggressive bird and chasing pecking fighting scolding and mobbing occur throughout day targeted at both intruders and colony members foraging in canopy of trees and on trunks and branches and on ground noisy miner mainly eats nectar fruit and insects most time is spent gleaning foliage of eucalypts and it can meet most of its nutritional needs from manna honeydew and lerp gathered from foliage noisy miner does not use a stereotyped courtship display but copulation is a frenzied communal event it breeds all year long building a deep cup shaped nest and laying two to four eggs incubation is by female only although up to twenty male helpers take care of nestlings and fledglings noisy miners have a range of strategies to increase their breeding success including multiple broods and group mobbing of predators noisy miner s population increase has been correlated with reduction of avian diversity in human affected landscapes its territoriality means that translocation is unlikely to be a solution to its overabundance and culling has been proposed although noisy miner is currently a protected species across australia taxonomy english ornithologist john latham described noisy miner four times in his 1801 work supplementum indicis ornithologici sive systematis ornithologiae seemingly not knowing it was same bird in each case chattering bee eater merops garrulus black headed melanocephala hooded bee eater merops cucullatus and white fronted bee eater merops albifrons early notes recorded its tendency to scare off prey as hunters were about to shoot it was as chattering bee eater that it was painted between 1792 and 1797 by thomas watling one of a group known collectively as port jackson painter john gould treated name merops garrulus as original description and renamed it myzantha garrula in his 1865 work handbook to birds of australia giving it common name of garrulous honeyeater and noting alternate name of chattering honeyeater he noted colonists of tasmania called it a miner and aboriginal people of new south wales called it que que gang was a local aboriginal name from blue mountains in early 20th century australian ornithologists started using name manorina melanocephala instead because it was listed first by latham in 1801 this usage did not follow letter of international code of zoological nomenclature and in 2009 international commission on zoological nomenclature conserved current name by formally suppressing name m garrula species name melanocephala is derived from ancient greek words melas black and kephale head referring to its black crown other common names include mickey miner and four subspecies are recognised including subspecies leachi found in eastern tasmania mainland population was split into three subspecies in 1999 by richard schodde titaniota from cape york peninsula in queensland as far south as mareeba lepidota from central queensland and inland new south wales west of and nominate subspecies melanocephala from southeastern new south wales victoria and southern south australia there are broad zones where birds are intermediate between subspecies further study is required to settle taxonomic status of these populations noisy miner is one of four species in genus manorina in large family of honeyeaters known as meliphagidae other three being black eared miner m yellow throated miner m and bell miner m one of most obvious characteristics of genus is a patch of bare yellow skin behind eyes which gives them an odd cross eyed look within genus noisy black eared and yellow throated miners form subgenus myzantha noisy miner occasionally hybridises with yellow throated miner molecular analysis has shown honeyeaters to be related to pardalotidae pardalotes acanthizidae australian warblers scrubwrens thornbills etc and maluridae australian fairy wrens in a large meliphagoidea superfamily description appearance thumb right a grey bird with a distinctive yellow patch behind eye yellow orange bill and feet and a yellow olive patch on wing thumb right fledglings utter 85 to 100 chip calls in a minute noisy miner is a large honeyeater in length with a wingspan of and weighing male female and juvenile birds all have similar plumage grey on back and tail and on breast and otherwise white underneath with white scalloping on nape and hind neck and on breast off white forehead and lores a black band over crown bright orange yellow bill and a distinctive patch of yellow skin behind eye a prominent white tip to tail a narrow olive yellow panel in folded wing and orange yellow legs and feet a juvenile can be distinguished by softer plumage a brownish tinge to black on its head and grey on its back and a duller greyish yellow skin patch behind eye noisy miner is similar in appearance to yellow throated miner and black eared miner it has a dull white forehead and a black crown while others have grey heads geographical variations size variation in noisy miner over its range follows bergmann s rule namely birds tend to be larger where climate is colder adults from central eastern and northern queensland tend to have little or no olive yellow edging to feathers of back and wings and have a wider white fringe on feathers of hind neck and back giving birds from queensland appearance of having more distinctive scalloping than other populations wing length generally increases with latitude and m m leachi has measurably shorter wings than nominate race although no significant difference in wing length was found in a study of populations north of 30deg s and south of murray river subspecies leachi also has finer scalloping on hind neck than nominate race a more intense yellow tinge to wing panels and a slightly broader off white tip to tail far north queensland subspecies titaniota has a shorter tail paler crown larger yellow skin patch and paler upper parts without yellow olive of nominate race and lepidota found in western new south wales is smaller than nominate race with a black crown and darker more mottled upperparts vocalisations as common name suggests noisy miner is an unusually vocal species previously known as garrulous honeyeater it has a large and varied repertoire of songs calls scoldings and alarms most are loud and penetrating and consist of harsh single notes it has two broad frequency alarm calls that are used when mobbing intruders into their territory or when predators including humans are sighted and a narrow frequency alarm call that is primarily used when airborne predators are seen such as brown falcon falco berigora or other large flying birds including australian magpie gymnorhina tibicen and pied currawong strepera graculina aerial predator alarm call is a series of high pitched slurred whistling notes broad frequency alarm calls are a series of churr notes low pitched and harsh occurring at low and high levels of intensity narrow band call is used in situations where bird signals presence of a predator and restricts information about its own location while broad band alarm is used to attract attention and can initiate mobbing behaviour these calls vary between individuals and laboratory tests show noisy miners can distinguish calls by different birds hence this may be integral to complex social structure of species contact or social facilitation calls are low pitched sounds that carry long distances chip calls are given by individual birds when foraging and a similar call is given by nestlings that call at an increased rate as mother approaches nest where there is a high level of social activity such as during territorial disputes with conspecifics calls are a series of quick regular single notes noisy miner has a mating display flight song a soft warble of low frequency notes given during short undulating flights by male and responded to by female with a low frequency whistle noisy miner is found in open woodland habitats where it is an advantage to call from air so as to overcome sound attenuation another display call described as yammer is a rapid rhythmical series of notes that is uttered during open bill wing waving displays noisy miner has a song described as dawn song a communal song of clear whistled notes emitted in chorus in early hours of morning from may through january dawn song which is also sung at dusk is audible over long distances and features duets that often involve a nestling begins to give chip call soon after it emerges from egg and it calls frequently for first two thirds of nestling period and constantly for last third call does not vary in presence of an adult at nest so it seems likely that call is not directed at adult bird nestling becomes silent when an adult gives an alarm call and makes a squealing sound when adult delivers food begging call of a fledgling is similar to call of nestling but significantly louder and covering a greater frequency range which may make it more directional rate of calling on average is 85 to 100 calls in a minute and in open scrub call can be heard up to a kilometre away a juvenile vocalisation comprising elements of various calls begins to be uttered when fledgling is around thirty days old noisy miner also produces non vocal sounds by clicking or snapping its bill usually during antagonistic encounters with other bird species or when mobbing a predator distribution and habitat noisy miner is endemic to eastern and south eastern australia occupying a broad arc from far north queensland where there are scattered populations to new south wales where it is widespread and common from coast to a line from to through victoria into south eastern south australia and eastern tasmania its range in south australia has been steadily expanding since it was first recorded near adelaide in early 1890s it is sedentary over its entire range noisy miner is territorial and territory of a colony is aggressively defended which has led to a significant reduction in avian diversity in areas occupied by noisy miner with smaller species excluded thumb left open eucalypt forests without understory shrubs suit noisy miner noisy miner primarily inhabits dry open eucalypt forests without understory shrubs it is commonly found in open sclerophyll forests including those on coastal dunes or granite outcrops forests dominated by spotted gum on mountain ridges and exposed slopes box and ironbark forests on foothills of great dividing range mixed forests of eucalypts and cypress callitris forests dominated by mulga or emu bush in stands of belah and scattered clumps of on edges of woodlands of river red gum including swamp woodlands bordering floodplains and areas dominated by exotic species such as european ash and willow it regularly inhabits degraded patches of forest where understory has been cleared including recently burned areas and modified habitats such as lightly timbered farming and grazing areas roadside reserves bushland remnants in towns and cities and suburban parks and gardens with trees and grass but without dense shrubbery noisy miner has benefited from thinning of woodland on rural properties heavy grazing that removes understory fragmentation of woodland that increases percentage of edge habitat and urban landscaping practices that increase open eucalypt environments it has been described as a reverse keystone species as it is colonising an ever increasing range of human dominated habitats and aggressively excluding smaller bird species from urban environments this phenomenon has been also observed in rural areas a field study across south west slopes of new south wales showed that noisy miner s presence corresponded with reduced numbers of insectivorous birds such as fantails restless flycatcher and other honeyeater species and that this decrease was most marked in sites with better access to water and nutrients while it has been hypothesised that proliferation of large flowering grevillea cultivars has contributed to abundance of noisy miners recent research has identified proliferation of lightly treed open areas and presence of eucalypt species as most significant factors in population increase large flowered grevillea hybrids such as grevillea robyn gordon can benefit noisy miner in that an abundance of resources is usually dominated by larger aggressive honeyeaters and a continuous nectar source could provide an advantage for non migratory species a field study in box ironbark country in central victoria found miner numbers were correlated with occurrence of yellow gum eucalyptus which reliably produces flowers and nectar each year abundance of noisy miner is primarily determined by habitat structure while range of noisy miner has not significantly expanded density of population within that range has substantially increased high densities of noisy miners are regularly recorded in forests with thick understory in southern queensland or more from forest agricultural land edge many of these sites have extensive road networks used for forest management and picnic areas and walking tracks for recreational use and it has been found that these cleared spaces play a role in abundance of noisy miners in forests there is evidence to suggest that higher road densities correspond with higher noisy miner population levels field work in victoria showed noisy miners infiltrated anywhere from into remnant woodland from edges with greater penetration occurring in less densely forested areas this has implications for size of woodland habitat needed to contain miner free areas around revegetation projects restoring buloke woodland a species of she oak integral to survival of red tailed black cockatoo banksii have been with a nurse species usually fast growing eucalypts noisy miner populations were more likely in those buloke woodlands where eucalypts had been planted at densities of up to 16 per hectare 6 4 per acre presence of noisy miners was accompanied by a substantial difference in number and types of other birds found in woodland behaviour social organisation noisy miner is a gregarious species and birds are rarely seen singly or in twos they forage move and roost in colonies that can consist of several hundred birds thumb left a gregarious species noisy miner engages in most activities communally within a colony a male bird will occupy an activity space which will overlap with activity spaces of other males males with overlapping activity spaces form associations called coteries usually consisting of 10 to 25 birds coteries are most stable unit within colony birds also form temporary flocks when engaged in same activity these flocks called coalitions usually comprise five to eight birds although coalitions of up to 40 birds can occur when mobbing a potential predator membership of coalition changes frequently as individuals leave group as it passes beyond boundary of their activity space or activity ends or changes as when breeding season begins females use activity spaces that overlap with those of male birds but not other females so that females will join coalitions with males in their area but only rarely will there be more than one female in coalition exclusivity of female activity spaces leads to young females being driven out of colony in which they were born and also makes it difficult for them to gain a place in a new colony a study of banded nestlings that survived in one colony until next breeding season found that they were all male birds suggesting that all female nestlings had died or left colony emigration of males does not seem to occur until population density of colony reaches a critical level looking after young is communal with males of coterie bringing food to nestlings and removing faecal sacs communal feeding increases after fledging when males from nearby coteries may even bring food to young birds if not driven off roosting is usually communal with two to six adults and juveniles roosting in contact with each other usually near end of a hanging branch up to above ground within their activity space they select a new site each evening often selecting and rejecting several sites and engaging in aggressive calling and chasing as other birds attempt to join group they are often last birds to roost at night but appear to sleep soundly undisturbed by torchlight noisy miners drink together at edge of lakes and dams and from cattle troughs often perching on a submerged branch they bathe by diving head first into water and when almost totally submerged flapping their wings vigorously and ducking their heads under water they shake excess water off and then fly to a nearby branch to preen they have been observed using rain or dew soaked foliage to bathe and in dry weather will dust bathe in dry soil or fine litter such as grass clippings bathing is communal with birds stimulated to participate by observing others they are occasionally observed anting flock behaviour thumb right upright tall posture is a mild threat signal noisy miner engages in most activities in a group roosting foraging preening bathing and dust bathing or anting are communal activities dawn song is a communal chorus particularly during breeding season communal interaction is facilitated by ritualised displays that have been categorised as flight displays postural displays and facial displays in long flight displays initiated by either male or female birds groups of up to twenty birds from more than one coterie fly about above canopy for distances of up to from colony constantly calling and not returning to colony for about twenty minutes as they return remaining birds show signs of agitation and sometimes fly up to join them short flight display is performed by male and may be analogous to territorial advertising displays of other birds in a ritualised movement noisy miner flies out from a perch across an open area in a rhythmic undulating pattern usually calling in flight at end of clearing it turns on an upward swoop and flies silently back to a perch near starting point head up flight is performed by female during nesting period and may function to attract male helpers in its most intense form body and tail are held almost vertically with legs dangling and head held up and back it is performed by female when she is selecting nest site and when carrying nest building material and probably has function of indicating location of nest to other group members thumb left pointing bill is usually a warning signal postural displays include tall and low poses pointing open bill and wing waving tall posture is used when in close contact with another bird and is a mild threat bird holds itself upright with neck and legs stretched and it faces other bird low posture is a submissive gesture bird sits low on perch with legs obscured by fluffed feathers and often faces away from other bird fledglings threatened by adult birds will adopt a low posture and open their bill widely pointing is a threat display where bird stretches out horizontally with feathers sleeked and bill pointed at target of aggression a bill snap will sometimes accompany pointing an open bill display is used by subordinates in encounters between two birds and by a female on nest when other birds approach trident bill display involves a fully open bill with tongue raised and protruding and is a higher intensity submissive display wing waving is often performed at same time as an open bill display wings are flexed and held slightly away from body and flapped out and up around three to six times wing waving may be accompanied by a yammer call eagle displays involve holding wings and tail spread out in either a vertical or horizontal position eye displays are made by exposing or covering bare yellow patch behind eye when feathers are completely sleeked entire patch is visible and when they are fluffed patch is hidden eye displays are used in conjunction with postural displays with yellow patch fully displayed by dominant birds using threat postures and immature birds tending to reduce size of eye patch when under attack from other members of coterie on occasion early in breeding season mass displays erupt where twenty or thirty birds perform various wing spreading displays short flights and constant calling displaying birds are attacked by others and groups of silent but agitated birds watch interactions mass displays are more common in early morning can last for up to 40 minutes and seem to be a combination of sexual and agonistic behaviour a corroboree from word for a ceremonial meeting of aboriginal australians is a group display where birds converge on adjacent branches and simultaneously pose hunchbacked giving wing waving and open bill displays and yammer call a corroboree occurs when birds meet after a change in social environment such as a bird returning after an absence or repulsion of an intruder or coming together of different coteries corroboree appears to have a bonding function and may involve all members of a colony agonistic behaviour described as always at war with others of feathered kind in early notes noisy miner is one of most aggressive of honeyeaters much of activity within a noisy miner colony is agonistic with chasing pecking fighting scolding and mobbing occurring frequently throughout day birds unite to attack predators and to defend colony area against all other species of birds species is also highly aggressive female noisy miners are aggressive towards each other and one cause of a male biased sex ratio in colonies may be females greater intolerance for each other driving immatures out of colony and preventing immigration of new females aggression at nest is common between males adult males begin attacking juveniles when they are around 11 weeks old and attackers can include males that previously cared for fledgling adult females are less aggressive towards young birds although mothers do occasionally attack their own offspring and infanticide has been recorded there is little male to female aggression other than driving flights that form part of mating ritual in direct attacks of young birds pecks are directed at eye patch agonistic behaviour has been observed among nestlings with aggression intensifying after fledging and at times resulting in death of a sibling noisy miner colony unites to mob inter specific intruders and predators noisy miner will approach threat closely and point expose eye patches and often bill snap five to fifteen birds will fly around intruder some birds diving at it and either pulling away or striking intruder mobbing continues until intruder remains still as with a tawny frogmouth podargus strigoides or it leaves area mobbing of snakes and goannas is particularly intense and most species of bird even non predators entering territory are immediately chased noisy miner has been recorded attacking an australian owlet nightjar aegotheles cristatus during day grebes herons ducks and cormorants on lakes at edge of territories crested pigeons pardalotes and rosellas non predatory mammals such as bats cattle sheep and wallabies are also attacked though less vigorously than birds noisy miner attacks are not limited to chasing intruder and aggressive incidents often result in death of trespasser reports include those of two noisy miners repeatedly pecking a house sparrow passer domesticus at base of its skull and killing it in six minutes one noisy miner grasping a striated striatus by wing while another pecked it on head until it died and a sacred kingfisher sanctus being chased and harassed for over five hours and then found dead with a fractured skull response to threats noisy miners make louder alarm calls in noisier sections of urban environments such as main roads most common initial response to alarm calls is to stay in area and scan for threats rather than withdraw a study conducted in melbourne and a nearby rural area found that noisy miners in urban areas were less likely to take flight and when they did they flew shorter distances it is unclear whether this is an adaptation or bolder miners had been ones to settle in city a field study in canberra found that superb fairywrens malurus cyaneus that lived in areas frequented by noisy miners recognised miner alarm calls and took flight and had learnt to ignore their non alarm calls while those that live in areas not frequented by noisy miners did not respond to miner alarm calls this suggests species has adapted and learnt to discriminate and respond to another species vocalisations breeding thumb right fledglings demand to be fed by any nearby adult noisy miner does not use a stereotyped courtship display displays can involve driving where male jumps or flies at female from away and if she moves away he pursues her aggressively female may perform a bowed wing display where wings and tail are spread and quivered with wings arched and head pointing down male may adopt a vertical or horizontal eagle display with wings and tail spread wide and held still for several seconds copulation is frequent and conspicuous with both males and females copulating with several birds while other members of colony display or otherwise interfere with mating pair copulation usually occurs on larger exposed branches close to nest site and can occur at any time of day although slightly more often between 11 00 and 13 00 when communal activities are less frequent frenzied courtship activity had led to speculation that female mates to recruit males to help care for young but recent genetic testing shows that 96 5 of noisy miner broods result from monogamous mating and that multiple paternity is rare an observation of banded birds noted that while females copulated repeatedly it was always with same male mate switching between broods is uncommon with pairs staying together over several years thumb left fledged siblings huddle together noisy miner breeds all year long with most activity from july through november though peak period is subject to seasonal variations with sharp peaks in laying activity when conditions are particularly favourable for raising young nest is built in prickly or leafy trees and noisy miner is often recorded nesting in eucalypts and also in wattles araucaria banksia bursaria hibiscus mistletoe melaleuca pittosporum schinus and jacaranda it seems to prefer moderately dense foliage for nesting often near end of drooping horizontal branches support for nest may be primary criterion of a suitable nest site rather than characteristics of vegetation or location female alone builds nest which is deep and cup shaped woven of twigs and grasses with other plant material animal hair and spider webs occasionally nest will include man made materials such as twine scraps of material and tissue paper it is lined with wool hair feathers flowers or plant down and padded with a circular mat woven from fibres pulled from cocoons of processional caterpillar female noisy miner walks around on ground close to nest site picking up material she gathers material from disused nests of other birds or dismantles its most recent nest to build a new one female completes nest in five or six days on average nests have an external diameter of and an external depth of internal depth of nest is around thumb right newly hatched chick and egg eggs vary greatly in size shape and markings but are generally elongated ovals white to cream or pinkish or buff coloured freckled spotted or blotched with reddish brown to chestnut or a purplish red sometimes with underlying markings of violet or purplish grey clutch consists of two to four eggs incubation is by female only and incubation period is around sixteen days hatching is asynchronous with up to six days being recorded between hatching of first and last chicks in a clutch young are naked at hatching and develop a cover of down within two to three days fledging period is around sixteen days and young begin to find food for themselves between twenty six and thirty days after fledging but are still regularly fed by adults to thirty five days young leave nest before they are fully fledged and only able to fly downwards and scramble up they do not go far from nest return to it at night and take some weeks to completely leave nest many fledglings are found on ground and in low shrubs during this period where they continue to be cared for until they can make their way up into trees these birds are often mistakenly rescued fledglings seek out siblings if separated and huddle together for up to three weeks after fledging noisy miner has some of largest group sizes of any communally breeding bird with up to twenty males and one female attending a single brood only males help with a nest and while many birds may be associated with a particular brood some males devote all their time to a single nest while others spread their helping efforts across five or six nests behavioural evidence and genetic testing indicate that helpers are male offspring of breeding pair or full siblings of male parent males nearly always bring food to nestling singly and if several arrive at once one will pass food to a nestling while others wait female leaves nest quickly when a male bird arrives and never takes food from one of helpers communal feeding of young increases after fledging and young beg for food with constant chip chip calls and gaping mouths female rarely feeds young birds after they have fledged nest predation cooperative breeding has been described as a strategy for decreasing nest predation although one study found no relationship between number of helpers visiting a nest site and its success or failure noisy miners were seen to have a range of strategies to increase their breeding success including multiple broods laying eggs early in season nesting low in canopy and group mobbing of predators these measures did not guarantee against nest failure due to diversity of potential predators in noisy miner s open woodland habitat feeding thumb right upright cultivated grevilleas are a key urban food source noisy miner primarily eats nectar fruit and insects and occasionally it feeds on small reptiles or amphibians it is both arboreal and terrestrial feeding in canopy of trees and on trunks and branches and on ground it forages within colony s territory throughout year usually in groups of five to eight birds although hundreds may gather at a stand of flowering trees such as banksia noisy miner collects nectar directly from flowers hanging upside down or straddling thin branches acrobatically to access nectar it takes fruit from trees or fallen on ground or hawks for invertebrates and picks through leaf litter for insects it has been recorded turning over dried droppings of emu novaehollandiae and eastern grey kangaroo macropus giganteus searching for insects thumb left an immature bird with brownish feathers eats a in a study of birds foraging in suburban gardens noisy miner was seen to spend more time in banksia grevillea and eucalypt species and when in flower callistemon than in other plants including exotics most time was spent gleaning foliage of eucalypts and noisy miners were significantly more abundant in sites where eucalypts were present noisy miner can meet most of its nutritional needs from manna honeydew and lerp gathered from foliage of eucalypts lower numbers of noisy miner were recorded at banksias and grevilleas than other large honeyeaters such as little wattlebird anthochaera chrysoptera and red wattlebird anthochaera carunculata detailed studies of diet of noisy miner record it eating a range of foods including spiders insects leaf beetles ladybirds stink bugs ants moth and butterfly larvae nectar from jacaranda erythrina variegata lagunaria patersonia callistemon callistemon viminalis eucalypts argyle apple sugar gum yellow gum grey ironbark and grey gum banksia ericifolia b integrifolia b serrata grevillea aspleniifolia g banksii g hookeriana g juniperina g rosmarinifolia and flowering quince seeds from oats wheat and pepper tree fruit from saltbush mistletoe and crabapple frogs and skinks and other matter such as bread pieces of meat and cheese and food scraps in first study to demonstrate different learning techniques in a single species noisy miner was found to employ different cognitive strategies depending upon resource it was foraging when searching for nectar which does not move but is readily depleted noisy miner uses a spatial memory based strategy identifying characteristics of environment a strategy that is efficient in new environments and is not affected by changes in bird s activities when searching for invertebrates it appears to employ a different strategy based on learned rules of insect movement they improve at finding invertebrates with practice two different strategies imply existence of adapted cognitive mechanisms capable of responding appropriately to different foraging contexts conservation status being abundant throughout its significant range noisy miner is considered of least concern for conservation and its extreme population densities in some areas actually constitute a threat to other species strong correlation between presence of noisy miners and absence of avian diversity has been well documented role played by noisy miner in steep decline of many woodland birds its impact on endangered species with similar foraging requirements and level of leaf damage leading to die back that accompanies exclusion of insectivorous birds from remnant woodlands means that any strategy to restore avian diversity will need to take account of management of noisy miner populations some habitat restoration and revegetation projects have inadvertently increased problem of noisy miner by establishing open eucalypt habit that they prefer a focus of many regeneration projects has been establishing of habitat corridors that connect patches of remnant forest and use of eucalypts as fast growing nurse species both practices have sound ecological value but allow noisy miner to proliferate so conservation efforts are being modified by planting a shrubby understory with eucalypts and avoiding creation of narrow protrusions corners or clumps of trees in vegetation corridors a field study conducted in southern highlands found that noisy miners tended to avoid areas dominated by wattles species of which in study area had bipinnate leaves hence authors proposed revegetation projects include at least 15 acacia species with bipinnate leaves if possible as well as shrubby understory plants translocation of noisy miners is unlikely to be a solution to their overabundance in remnant habitats in a victorian study where birds were banded and relocated colonies moved into now unpopulated area but soon returned to their original territories translocated birds did not settle in a new territory they were not assimilated into resident populations of miners but instead wandered up to from release point moving through apparently suitable habitat occupied by other miners at least for first 50 days following translocation two birds with radio tracking devices travelled back to their site of capture although noisy miners are protected across australia and a permit is required to cull them culling has been proposed as most humane and practical method of reducing their impact particularly where combined with rehabilitation of habitat to suit a wider variety of bird life an unsanctioned cull took place on private rural property over 1991 and 1992 which reportedly resulted in an increase in species diversity references bibliography
