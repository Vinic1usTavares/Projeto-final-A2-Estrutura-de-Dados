time fingleton was widely believed to be responsible for leaking captain bill woodfull s admonishment of england s tactics fingleton was dropped after this test and was overlooked for 1934 tour of

season earning a recall to australian team for 1935 36 tour of south africa from that point onwards until outbreak of world war ii he opened batting with bill brown it was happiest time of fingleton s

palmer moved to sydney morning herald and fingleton became disenchanted he was coaxed by cricketer journalist to move his publication telegraph pictorial where he worked for several years before

chagrin growden pp 36 37 pair s first meeting had been prickly and bradman glared angrily at fingleton after a mix up almost ended in a run out growden p 37 match was drawn and fingleton then made a duck against tasmania in an innings victory following summer with no test matches new south wales international representatives were available for entire season and fingleton missed selection for every match in 1930 31 aged 22 fingleton regained his position at start of sheffield shield season for new south wales and first came to prominence when he withstood a ferocious opening spell against express pace of eddie gilbert in brisbane against queensland on one occasion a particularly fast gilbert delivery supposedly evaded both batsman and wicket keeper travelled more than 60 metres and crashed through a fence before hitting and killing a dog on other side mallett p 69 fingleton scored 56 as a full strength team with test players fell for 143 visitors were set 392 for victory and

run fourth wicket partnership new south wales reached 432 and won by an innings fingleton then scored his maiden first class century of 117 in less than four hours in following match against touring south africa helping his team to 3 430 in their runchase hosts were 18 runs short of victory when time ran out although fingleton made only five in new south wales second match against south africans fingleton was selected for test series against same team this came after only ten matches for his state growden p 44 starting with second test he was twelfth man for three consecutive tests and as a result did not play any cricket for six weeks before he added a pair of 40s in a win over arch rivals victoria fingleton made his debut in fifth and final test in similar circumstances to his break at start of season bill ponsford fell ill and bradman twisted an ankle as bradman later took a hard running catch as a substitute fielder on same day some suspected that he had feigned injury to avoid playing on a rain affected wicket hostile to batting he had appeared uncomfortable against aggressive bowling in previous test growden p 46 in a low scoring match fingleton s first action on field was to let a ball go between his legs as south africa batted first growden p 47 opening with captain bill woodfull in absence of ponsford fingleton saw his skipper removed from first ball of innings he was allowed to ease into his first innings when first ball he faced from neville quinn was a deliberate full toss to give him an opportunity to score his initial runs easily pair became friends from this point onwards growden p 48 fingleton was second top scorer with 40 as australia made 153 recorded an innings victory match lasted less than one day s playing time as hosts fell for only 36 and 45 piesse p 125 cricketer journalist richard whitington later wrote that for courage and skill fingleton s 51 was worth quadruple that number sydney mail predicted that fingleton s display on rain affected wicket likes of which were common proved that he would someday be a great success there fingleton ended season with 386 runs at 42 88 with one century and a fifty in six matches bodyline turmoil in following summer came bodyline series when england toured under douglas jardine and targeted upper bodies of australian batsmen with short pitched bowling using a close leg side cordon to catch balls fended away from body in one of tour matches before tests fingleton scored a defiant 119 carrying his bat for new south wales against bumper barrage of harold larwood and gubby allen ensuring his selection for first test despite his unbending resistance his state fell to an innings defeat in a warm up for tests he scored 29 and 53 not out for an australian xi against tourists while most of his teammates struggled his earlier experience held him in good stead as he scored 26 and 40 as australia were crushed by ten wickets in first test in sydney fingleton stood his ground and was hit several times whitington p 105 he then made a defiant four hour innings to top score with 83 in first innings of australia s only win of series in second test in melbourne although he did run out his batting partner leo o brien in process whitington pp 115 117 this helped australians to reach 228 and they took a 59 run first innings lead before winning match despite fingleton making only one in second innings he appeared as well equipped as any australian to combat england s strategy adelaide leak however third test at adelaide oval was disastrous for fingleton who scored a pair as australia were hammered by 338 runs he was blamed for leaking details of dressing room exchange between captain bill woodfull and english manager plum warner which almost caused abandonment of test series warner had visited woodfull to express sympathies after australian captain was struck in heart by larwood s short pitched bowling to which woodfull retorted i do not want to see you mr warner there are two sides out there one is playing cricket and other is not leak caused a as woodfull had publicly remained composed in face of body barrage neither complaining nor retaliating cashman pp 322 323 fingleton was dropped for remaining two tests of series new south wales played england after third test and fingleton had a chance to show his credentials against bodyline but made only 19 and 7 in a four wicket defeat and was unable to force his way back into test team fingleton always denied responsibility for leak blaming bradman this incident was first in a string of open disagreements between fingleton and bradman bodyline season also marked beginning of fingleton s opening combination with bill brown who made his new south wales debut in same season cashman p 67 fingleton scored four half centuries for remainder of first class season and ended with 648 runs at 38 11 as new south wales won sheffield shield harte p 791 fingleton had a prolific 1933 34 australian season in which he scored 655 runs at 59 54 with two centuries and four fifties he scored 105 in test trial for richardson s xi and then struck 145 against arch rivals victoria in last match of season new south wales were unable to force a victory and thus ceded sheffield shield to their southern neighbours he had scored 76 in return match earlier in season and added 33 and 78 against rest of australia despite this fingleton was overlooked for australian side selected to tour england in 1934 with captain woodfull and bill ponsford established openers there was only one place for a spare opener and brown won position over his partner who had performed to a similar standard during season selectors asked don bradman australia s leading batsman and state teammate to brown and fingleton for advice bradman nominated brown believing that his style was better suited to english pitches perry p 175 on day that team was selected bradman wrote in his newspaper column criticising fingleton s running between wickets growden p 84 when pair next met fingleton s only words were to blame bradman for his omission bradman claimed that as a result of selection controversy fingleton relentless pursued a vendetta against him from there on fingleton also suspected that woodfull wanted him out of team because he held journalist responsible for leaked exchange with warner growden p 85 some incidents in fingleton s century in last match of season were also believed to have reflected badly at selection table having retired hurt on 78 he returned next day and was then dropped on 86 in slips fingleton had moved out of his crease to pat out pitch before ball had gone dead and victorian wicket keeper ben barnett broke stumps a displeased fingleton was given out by umpire george borwick and walked off ground only to be called back by captain woodfull fingleton refused woodfull s offer and did not return until woodfull successfully asked borwick to reverse his decision growden pp 86 87 media reported that fingleton had quarrelled with woodfull and several teammates told him that his apparent rebuff of national captain would prejudice his chances of selection and nswca made an inquiry into matter fingleton failed to respond during same innings bradman also wrote in his newspaper report that fingleton had been responsible for run out of teammate ray rowe which angered fingleton for an extended period growden p 87 a disappointed fingleton wrote to woodfull saying you have chosen chaps who do not like fast bowling he also questioned what he perceived to be woodfull s coldness towards him since bodyline series and decried unnamed fellow pressmen naturally jealous growden pp 88 89 wisden speculated that fingleton s omission may have been due to cricket diplomacy reasons following incident in adelaide while others thought that regionalism was to blame this view posited that ernest bromley was selected so that seven victorians and new south welshmen would be on tour growden p 91 bromley scored only 312 runs in 20 innings in england growden p 92 fingleton was selected for a second string australian team to tour new zealand for two months at end of season while test team departed for england however captain victor richardson and his deputy keith rigg withdrew dissatisfied with pay leaving fingleton as most senior member of team tour was then cancelled by new zealand who feared that large number of absentees would result in a large financial loss test recall right thumb fingleton and brown walk out to open for australia with retirements of both woodfull and ponsford following 1934 tour to england positions at top of australia s batting order became available fingleton also found state cricket more attractive now that bradman had decided to move to south australia to take up stockbroking fingleton responded to his omission from ashes tour by leading run scoring aggregates in 1934 35 season he scored 880 runs at 58 66 with four centuries and four fifties almost 200 runs more than second most prolific batsman brown after fingleton started summer with a fifty in woodfull s testimonial match pair started shield campaign with a 249 run stand in new south wales first match of season against south australia both scoring centuries in an innings victory fingleton made 134 in just over three hours growden p 93 fingleton reached 49 at least once in remaining five matches including a 108 against queensland despite form of openers new south wales failed to win sheffield shield after losing both of their matches against victoria fingleton ended season with consecutive centuries 124 and 100 against western australia and took first of two first class wickets in his career in first of two matches as a result of his performances fingleton was recalled to test team for tour of south africa in 1935 36 where he partnered brown at top of innings under normal circumstances australians would have been captained by fingleton s rival bradman who had been vice captain to woodfull however bradman was unable to tour for medical reasons and vic richardson led team instead with bradman out of way tour was to be most prolific and peaceful phase of fingleton s international career and included several large opening stands with brown during tour fingleton played with an attacking flair that contrasted with his established reputation for doggedness growden p 99 for fingleton it was happiest tour he had been on in large part due to bradman s absence growden p 101 fingleton nearly failed to make trip his newspaper editor eric baume ordered him to write a column attacking australian board of control for vetoing players from going on a private tour of india threatening to sack him if he refused criticism of board typically resulted in exclusion from selection fingleton was reluctant to comply and was reprieved when editor in chief overruled baume growden pp 93 94 fingleton scored 66 for australians in an innings victory over western australia before sailing for south africa it was to be start of a very productive campaign in three matches leading up to tests against natal western province and transvaal respectively fingleton scored 121 53 99 and seven not out australia won latter match by ten wickets and others by an innings in match by natal fingleton and brown both made centuries and combined in a double century stand after almost three years in wilderness fingleton returned to test arena in first test at durban after making two in first innings he was unbeaten on 36 when australia reached their second innings target with nine wickets in hand during first innings a 140 km h gale hit ground uprooting trees and forcing balls that were heading into wind to do u turns growden pp 96 97 he followed this with 62 innings top p 97 and 40 in second test at johannesburg after taking a 93 run first innings lead australia needed a test record of 399 in second innings to win on a turning wicket and after early demise of brown fingleton joined mccabe in a 177 run partnership that pushed score to 1 194 such was dominance of mccabe that he scored more than 80 of runs during this partnership growden p 98 australia needed only 125 with half day remaining and eight wickets in hand when poor visibility ended play mccabe had flayed attack and reached 189 not out when south africans had match called off claiming that fieldsmen were endangered by batsman s vigorous hitting cashman pp 197 198 fingleton finished series with centuries in each of last three tests all in consecutive innings 112 at cape town 108 at johannesburg and 118 in durban in third test fingleton and brown set a new australian test record opening stand of 233 which laid foundation for a total of 8 362 declared and an innings victory cashman p 67 it was australia s first double century opening stand in test cricket and remains a national record for first wicket against south africa on a rain affected wicket fingleton reached his maiden test century in only 180 minutes before wickets began falling steadily growden pp 98 99 before fourth test fingleton added 52 against border and 110 in an innings win over transvaal his 108 in fourth test was more than south africa s entire second innings of 98 and scored at almost a run a minute growden p 103 in fifth test pair combined for another century stand each of three matches resulted in an innings victory for australia as series was taken 4 0 fingleton ended test series with 478 runs at 79 66 against natal at durban he made his highest first class score of 167 his second century against provincial side for season he ended tour with a total of 1192 runs at 74 50 including six centuries despite his rapid scoring in south africa fingleton s achievements went largely unheralded at home at time england and australia were by far strongest test teams and media coverage of tour was scant there was little detail in reports apart from scores and fingleton was still described as a slow scorer something that angered him growden pp 102 103 under captaincy of bradman following 1936 37 season in australia saw more success for fingleton although with return of bradman as captain team harmony became strained gubby allen s englishmen toured australia and after failing to pass 10 in his first three innings for season fingleton scored 39 42 and 56 in matches for new south wales and an australian xi against tourists fingleton became first player to score centuries in four consecutive test innings when he scored 100 in first innings of first test at brisbane reaching on 7 december he top scored as australia replied to england s 358 with 234 fingleton s feats was later equalled by alan melville whose four centuries were scored on either side of world war ii and surpassed by west indian everton weekes in 1948 49 fingleton s run ended in second innings falling for a golden duck as australia were skittled for 58 on a sticky wicket and crushed

side fell to an innings defeat after being forced to follow on australia were facing a dilemma in third test in melbourne home team scored 200 fingleton contributing 38 before rain caused a sticky wicket and england declared at 9 76 however australia still had to bat on treacherous surface captain bradman reshuffled batting lineup putting bowlers in first and fingleton and himself in at nos 6 and 7 to save them for more favourable batting conditions bowlers managed to survive to end of day s play and wicket improved overnight pair came together with score at 5 97 and made a test record sixth wicket partnership of 346 with fingleton making 136 it turned test and saw australia ended at 564 hosts bowled england out for 323 to win match by 365 runs and prevent england from taking an unassailable 3 0 lead fingleton did not pass 20 in his last three innings of series as australia won remaining two matches to win series fingleton ended with 398 runs at 44 22 in tests and 631 runs at

best for arch rivals victoria scoring 59 and 160 to salvage a draw after new south wales had conceded a first innings lead of 231 new south wales went on to win title fingleton finished his season with 66 1 47 and 109 in two warm up matches for australian team against western australia before they headed to england for 1938 ashes series in 1938 fingleton made what turned out to be his international farewell as australia toured england a series in which he found runs difficult to come by he later attributed this to his inability to play pull shot however fingleton started tour well he passed 30 in each of his first seven innings on english soil and converted three of these starts into centuries scoring 124 against oxford university 111 against cambridge university and 123 not out against hampshire in first month of cricket fingleton s form tapered just at wrong time falling three times for single figures in last two matches before tests he carried this into first test at trent bridge where he made only 9 and 40 in a high scoring draw in which every innings passed 400 an infamous incident occurred in australia s second innings as australia were 247 runs behind on first innings and forced to follow on they played for a draw and brown and fingleton batted slowly in second innings sections of crowd heckled his slow batting by using a slow hand clap bradman then sent mervyn waite out to deliver orders to openers that they should back away from their positions and hold up proceedings until stopped fingleton said that he was not perturbed by crowd but obeyed umpire frank chester and england captain wally hammond had no issues with this at one point fingleton theatrically decided to take off his gloves put down his bat and sit down on pitch and refusing to resume before gallery quietened but this only caused a huge uproar growden p 143 wisden later criticised him saying that he lost all true sense of situation an extraordinary action on part of a cricket in a test match they regarded gesture as disrespectful as a majority of spectators had not heckled him fingleton rediscovered his form between tests scoring 121 against gentlemen of england and 96 against lancashire again however fingleton was unable to maintain momentum in tests making 31 and 4 against england in second test at lord s which ended in another draw fingleton then aggregated only 36 in four innings in next three county fixtures and after third test at old trafford never started due to persistent rain growden p 144 he was concussed in match against warwickshire at edgbaston a long hop from waite was pulled into his head at point blank range and fingleton managed to duck enough that it glanced his forehead and went into air to cries of catch it from bradman ball did not go to hand and fingleton was hospitalised growden pp 144 145 fingleton made 30 and 9 in a low scoring fourth test at headingley which australia won by five wickets to retain ashes he remained unproductive in lead up to final test scoring 51 in three first class innings his test career ended disappointingly at oval in hutton s match in course of england s marathon innings of 7 903 he sustained a leg injury which prevented him from batting in either australian innings with bradman also unable to bat australia collapsed to heaviest defeat in test history by an innings and 579 runs it capped off a tour that ended poorly after a promising start fingleton made 123 runs in six innings at an average of 20 50 with outbreak of world war ii australia was not to play another test until 1945 46 season ending fingleton s international career fingleton returned to australia and played in only three matches in 1938 39 domestic season scoring 81 runs at 16 20 before being sidelined at end of december

general douglas macarthur who was commanding allied forces in pacific curtin needed someone to hughes as macarthur had threatened to leave if denouncements continued growden p 161 fingleton spent three months working for temperamental hughes and was not successful in curbing his aggressive oratory growden pp 161 164 he then worked in censorship deciding which portions of curtin s press

autobiographical batting from memory was to have its australian launch during week in which he died of a heart attack his cricket writing regarded as one of most stylish by an australian often left a sour taste with observers because of persistent anti bradman jibes during his war years fingleton decided to take up book writing in addition to newspaper journalism and began compiling a book about bodyline series during his spare time in army a topic that was still deep in australian consciousness using his inside knowledge as a participant in that ashes campaign growden p 155 as fingleton had
