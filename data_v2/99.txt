sisters chomet p 12 death of prince albert helena s father prince albert died on 14 december 1861 queen was devastated and ordered her household along with her daughters to move from windsor to osborne house queen s isle of wight residence helena s grief was also profound and she wrote to a friend a month later what we have lost nothing can ever replace and our grief is most most bitter i adored papa i loved him more than anything on earth his word was a most sacred law and he was my help and adviser these hours were happiest of my life and now it is all all over packard p 101 queen relied on her second eldest daughter princess alice as an unofficial secretary but alice needed an assistant of her own though helena was next eldest she was considered unreliable by victoria because of her inability to go long without bursting into tears packard p 102 therefore louise was selected to assume role in her place packard p 103 alice was married to prince louis of hesse in 1862 after which helena assumed role described as crutch of her mother s old age by one biographer at her mother s side packard p 104 in this role she carried out minor secretarial tasks such as writing queen s letters helping her with political correspondence and providing her with company dennison p 204 marriage controversy princess helena began an early flirtation with her father s former librarian carl ruland following his appointment to royal household on recommendation of baron stockmar in 1859 he was trusted enough to teach german to helena s brother young prince of wales and was described by queen as useful and able chomet p 17 when queen discovered that helena had grown romantically attached to a royal servant he was promptly dismissed back to his native germany and he never lost queen s hostility chomet p 19 right thumb upright princess helena and prince christian part of a series of photographs following their engagement in 1865 following ruland s departure in 1863 queen looked for a husband for helena however as a middle child prospect of a powerful alliance with a european royal house was low chomet p 37 her appearance was also a concern as by age of fifteen she was described by her biographer as chunky dowdy and double chinned packard p 99 furthermore victoria insisted that helena s future husband had to be prepared to live near queen thus keeping her daughter nearby van der kiste p 61 her choice eventually fell on prince christian of schleswig holstein however match was politically awkward and caused a severe breach within royal family schleswig and holstein were two territories fought over between prussia and denmark during first and second schleswig wars in latter prussia and austria defeated denmark but duchies were claimed by austria for prince christian s family however following austro prussian war in which prussia invaded and occupied duchies they became prussian but title duke of schleswig holstein was still claimed by prince christian s family packard p 121 marriage therefore horrified king christian ix of denmark s daughter alexandra princess of wales who exclaimed duchies belong to papa alexandra found support in her husband his brother prince alfred and his second sister princess alice who openly accused her mother of sacrificing helena s happiness for queen s convenience battiscombe p 77 alice also argued that it would reduce already low popularity of her sister crown princess of prussia at court in berlin van der kiste p 65 however and unexpectedly crown princess who had been a personal friend of christian s family for many years ardently supported proposed alliance packard p 113 despite political controversies and their age difference he was fifteen years her senior helena was happy with christian and was determined to marry him packard p 114 as a younger son of a non reigning duke absence of any foreign commitments allowed him to remain permanently in britain queen s primary concern and she declared marriage would go ahead van der kiste p 64 helena and christian were actually third cousins in descent from frederick prince of wales relations between helena and alexandra remained strained and alexandra was unprepared to accept christian who was also a third cousin to alexandra in descent from king frederick v of denmark as either a cousin or brother in law battiscombe p 76 queen never forgave princess of wales for accusations of possessiveness and wrote of waleses shortly afterwards bertie is most affectionate and kind but alix pet name for alexandra is by no means what she ought to be it will be long if ever before she regains my confidence van der kiste p 181 engagement and wedding engagement was declared on 5 december 1865 and despite prince of wales s initial refusal to attend princess alice intervened and wedding was a happy occasion packard p 115 queen allowed ceremony to take place at windsor castle albeit in private chapel rather than grander st george s chapel on 5 july 1866 queen relieved her black mourning dress with a white mourning cap which draped over her back packard p 116 main participants filed into chapel to sound of beethoven s triumphal march creating a spectacle only marred by sudden disappearance of prince george duke of cambridge who had a sudden gout attack christian filed into chapel with his two supporters prince edward of saxe weimar and prince frederic of schleswig holstein and helena was given away by her mother who escorted her up aisle with prince of wales and eight bridesmaids christian looked older than he was and one guest commented that helena looked as if she was marrying an aged uncle indeed when he was first summoned to britain he assumed that widowed queen was inspecting him as a new husband for herself rather than as a candidate for one of her daughters van der kiste p 72 couple spent first night of their married life at osborne house before honeymooning in paris interlaken and genoa packard p 117 married life left thumb upright princess helena in her wedding dress 5 july 1866 helena and christian were devoted to each other and led a quiet life in comparison to helena s sisters chomet p 55 following their marriage they took up residence at cumberland lodge in windsor great park traditional residence of ranger of windsor great park honorary position bestowed on christian by queen when staying in london they lived at belgian suite in buckingham palace chomet p 133 couple had six children christian victor in 1867 albert in 1869 and helena victoria and marie louise in 1870 and 1872 respectively their last two sons died early harald died eight days after his birth in 1876 and an unnamed son was stillborn in 1877 princess louise helena s sister commissioned french sculptor jules to sculpt a memorial to helena s dead infants packard p 192 christians were granted a parliamentary annuity of ps6 000 a year which queen requested in person chomet p 52 in addition a dowry of ps30 000 was settled upon and queen gave couple ps100 000 which yielded an income of about ps4 000 a year chomet p 54 as well as that of ranger of windsor park christian was given honorary position of high steward of windsor and was made a royal commissioner for great exhibition of 1851 however he was often an absentee figurehead at meetings instead passing his time playing with his dog corrie feeding his numerous pigeons and embarking on hunting excursions chomet p 59 helena as promised lived close to queen and both she and beatrice performed duties for her beatrice whom victoria had groomed for main role at her side carried out more important duties and helena took on more minor matters that beatrice did not have time to do packard p 194 in later years helena was assisted by her unmarried daughter helena victoria to whom queen dictated her journal in last months of her life benson p 300 right thumb upright prince christian of schleswig holstein helena s health was not robust and she was addicted to drugs opium and laudanum packard pp 269 270 however queen did not believe that helena was really ill accusing her of hypochondria encouraged by an indulgent husband packard p 193 queen victoria wrote to her daughter crown princess of prussia complaining that helena was inclined to herself and christian too and to give way in everything that great object of her doctors and nurse is to rouse her and make her think less of herself and of her confinement quoted in chomet p 128 not all of her health scares were brought on by hypochondria in 1869 she had to cancel her trip to balmoral castle when she became ill at railway station in 1870 she was suffering from severe rheumatism and problems with her joints in july 1871 she suffered from congestion in her lungs an illness severe enough to appear in court circular which announced that her illness caused much anxiety to members of royal family quoted in chomet p 129 in 1873 she was forced to recuperate in france as a result of illness and in 1880s she travelled to germany to see an oculist chomet p 130 activities nursing helena had a firm interest in nursing and was founding chair of ladies committee of british red cross in 1870 playing an active role in recruiting nurses and organising relief supplies during franco prussian war she subsequently became president of british nurses association rbna upon its foundation in 1887 in 1891 it received prefix royal and received a royal charter following year she was a strong supporter of nurse registration an issue that was opposed by both florence nightingale and leading public figures chomet p 119 in a speech helena made in 1893 she made clear that rbna was working towards improving education and status of those devoted and self sacrificing women whose whole lives have been devoted to tending sick suffering and dying in same speech she warned about opposition and misrepresentation they had encountered although rbna was in favour of registration as a means of enhancing and guaranteeing professional status of trained nurses its incorporation with privy council allowed it to maintain a list rather than a formal register of nurses chomet p 120 right thumb upright florence nightingale against whom helena promoted nurse registration following death of queen victoria in 1901 new queen alexandra insisted on replacing helena as president of army nursing service this gave rise to a further breach between royal ladies with king edward vii caught in middle between his sister and his wife battiscombe p 234 lady roberts a courtier wrote to a friend matters were sometimes very difficult and not always pleasant however in accordance with rank helena agreed to resign in alexandra s favour and she retained presidency of army nursing reserve chomet p 122 though thought to be merely an artefact created by society ladies helena exercised an efficient and autocratic regime if anyone ventures to disagree with her royal highness she has simply said it is my wish that is sufficient quoted in battiscombe p 233 rbna gradually went into decline following nurses registration act 1919 after six failed attempts between 1904 and 1918 british parliament passed bill allowing formal nurse registration what resulted was royal college of nursing rcn and rbna lost membership and dominance helena supported proposed amalgamation of rbna with new rcn but that proved unsuccessful when rbna pulled out of negotiations chomet p 123 however she remained active in other nursing organisations and was president of isle of wight windsor and great western railway branches of order of st john in this position she personally signed and presented many thousands of certificates of proficiency in nursing needlework helena was also active in promotion of needlework and became first president of newly established school of art needlework in 1872 in 1876 it acquired royal prefix becoming royal school of needlework in helena s words objective of school was first to revive a beautiful art which had been well nigh lost and secondly through its revival to provide employment for gentlewomen who were without means of a suitable livelihood chomet p 124 as with her other organisations she was an active president and worked to keep school on an even level with other schools she personally wrote to royal commissioners requesting money for example in 1895 she requested and acquired ps30 000 for erecting a building for school in south kensington chomet p 125 her royal status helped its promotion and she held thursday afternoon tea parties at school for society ladies who wanted to be seen in presence of royal personages such as princess helena when christmas bazaar was held she acted as chief saleswoman generating long queues of people anxious to be served personally by her helena was anxious to help children and unemployed and began hosting free dinners for their benefit at windsor guildhall she presided over two of these dinners in february and march 1886 and over 3 000 meals were served to children and unemployed men during harsh winter that year chomet p 126 through her charitable activities she became popular with people a contemporary author c w cooper wrote that poor of windsor worshipped her quoted in chomet p 126 writing among helena s other interests was writing especially translation in 1867 when first biography of her father prince consort was written author sir charles grey notes that prince s letters were translated from german to english by helena with surprising fidelity chomet p 70 other translations followed and in 1887 she published a translation of memoirs of wilhelmine of bayreuth it was noted by saturday review that helena wrote an english version that was thoroughly alive with a sound dictionary translation and a high accuracy in spirit chomet p 71 her final translation was undertaken in 1882 on a german booklet called first aid to injured originally published by christian s brother in law it was republished several times until 1906 chomet p 80 bergstrasser affair a copyright issue arose after publication of letters written by helena s sister princess alice in germany an edition of alice s letters was published in 1883 by a darmstadt clergyman called carl sell who chose a selection of her letters made available to him by queen when it was done helena wrote to sell and requested permission to publish german text into english and it was granted but without knowledge of publisher dr bergstrasser in december 1883 helena wrote to sir theodore martin a favoured royal biographer informing him that bergstrasser was claiming copyright of alice s letters and on that basis was demanding a delay in publication of english edition martin acted as an intermediary between helena and bergstrasser who claimed to have received many offers from english publishers and that chosen one would expect a high honorarium chomet p 83 bergstrasser was persuaded to drop his demand for a delay in publishing and modify his copyright claims in return for a lump sum however queen and helena refused claiming that copyright belonged to queen and that only sell s original preface was open to negotiation royal ladies considered bergstrasser s claims unjustified if not impertinent and would not communicate with him directly eventually bergstrasser came to britain in january 1884 willing to accept ps100 for first 3 000 copies and a further ps40 for each subsequent thousand copies sold chomet p 84 martin chose publisher john murray who after further negotiations with bergstrasser printed first copies in mid 1884 it sold out almost immediately but for second edition murray replaced sell s biographical sketch of princess alice with 53 page memoir written by helena problem of royalties to sell was thus avoided and that helena gave her name to memoir to her sister attracted greater interest in book chomet p 86 after victoria edwardian period helena s favourite son prince christian victor died in 1900 followed shortly by her mother queen victoria at osborne house on 22 january 1901 new king edward vii did not have close ties with his surviving sisters with exception of princess louise helena s nephew prince alexander of battenberg later marquess of carisbrooke recorded that queen alexandra was jealous of royal family and would not invite her sisters in law to sandringham van der kiste p 180 moreover alexandra never fully reconciled herself to helena and christian following their marriage controversy in 1860s battiscombe pp 75 78 helena saw relatively little of her surviving siblings and continued her role as a support to monarchy and a campaigner for many charities she represented van der kiste p 182 she and christian led a quiet life but did carry out a few royal engagements on one such occasion elderly couple represented king at silver wedding anniversary in 1906 of kaiser wilhelm ii helena s nephew and his wife augusta victoria christian s niece during edwardian period helena visited grave of her son prince christian victor who died in 1900 following a bout with malaria while serving in second boer war she was met by south african prime minister louis botha but jan smuts refused to meet her partly because he was bitter that south africa had lost war and partly because his son had died in a british concentration camp marie louise pp 195 96 later years king edward died in 1910 and first world war began four years after his death helena devoted her time to nursing and her daughter princess marie louise recorded in her memoirs that requests for news of loved ones reached helena and her sisters it was decided that letters should be forwarded to crown princess margaret of sweden as sweden was neutral during war it was during war that helena and christian celebrated their golden wedding anniversary in 1916 and despite fact that britain and germany were at war kaiser sent a congratulatory telegram to his aunt and uncle through crown princess of sweden marie louise pp 141 142 king george v and queen mary were present when telegram was received and king remarked to helena s daughter marie louise that her former husband prince aribert of anhalt did her a service when he turned her out when marie louise said she would have run away to britain if she was still married king said with

clear that he would not fight against his mother s country marie louise p 43 in same year on 28 october prince christian died at schomberg house helena s last years were spent arguing with commissioners who tried to turn her out of schomberg house and cumberland lodge because of expense of running her households they failed as clear evidence of her right to live in those residences for life was shown chomet pp 143 44 death princess helena princess christian of schleswig holstein died at schomberg house on 9 june 1923 at age of 77 chomet p 149 her funeral described as a magnificently stage managed scene by her biographer seweryn chomet was headed by king george regiment of her favourite son prince christian victor lined steps of st george s chapel at windsor castle although

family whisper which carried farther than any megaphone remarked that prayer won t settle any strike her appearance and personality was criticised in letters and journals of queen victoria and biographers followed her example chomet p 30 however helena s daughter princess marie louise described her as music was one of her passions in her youth she played piano with charles halle and jenny lind and clara butt were among her personal friends her determination to carry out a wide range of public duties won her widespread popularity chomet p 40 she twice represented her mother at drawing

contemporaries as fearfully devoted to queen to point that she did not have a mind of her own she actively campaigned for women s rights a field queen abhorred longford p 395 nevertheless both she and
