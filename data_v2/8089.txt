were built by private entrepreneurs in late 1800s in 1903 first long distance high voltage transmission line in north america was built a 50 kv line connecting a shawinigan to montreal 135 km away in first half of 1900s market was dominated by regional monopolies whose service was publicly criticised in response in 1944 provincial government created hydro quebec from expropriated montreal light heat power in 1963 hydro quebec purchased shares of nearly all remaining privately owned electrical utilities then operating in quebec and undertook construction of manicouagan outardes hydroelectric complex to transmit complex s annual production of about 30 billion kwh over a distance of nearly 700 km hydro quebec had to innovate led by jean jacques archambault it became first utility in world to transmit electricity at 735 kv rather than 300 400 kv which was world standard at that time in 1962 hydro quebec proceeded with construction of first 735 kv power line in world line stretching from manic outardes dam to levis substation was brought into service on 29 november 1965 over next twenty years from 1965 to 1985 quebec underwent a massive expansion of its 735 kv power grid and its hydroelectric generating capacity hydro quebec equipement another division of hydro quebec and societe d energie de la baie james built these transmission lines electrical substations and generating

each bundle transmitting one phase of current left upright 0 7 thumb a series of v guyed towers near quebec earliest type of tower used was a massive self supporting delta pylon or waist pylon which consumed 21 tonnes of steel per kilometre of line this type of pylon was used for first 735 kv power line from manic outardes power stations to load centre of montreal there are two significant variations of delta pylon one has longer side crossbars such that all three bundles of conductors are suspended on v shaped insulators other has shorter side crossbars such that two outside bundles are hung on a vertical insulator string and only middle bundle is hung with a v shaped insulator over years hydro quebec researchers engineered a new type of pylon v guyed tower which reduced materials consumption to 11 8 tonnes of steel per kilometre of power line this type of tower also includes a variation with longer side crossbars where all conductors are hung with a v shaped insulator and one with shorter side crossbar where only middle bundle hangs from insulator and side bundles are strung on vertical insulator strings during construction of james bay transmission system cross rope suspension tower was invented this type of tower features two guyed tower legs similar to v guyed tower but two legs don t converge at tower base in case of cross rope suspension tower tower legs are spread apart on two different foundations in addition crossbar is replaced by a series of suspension cables with three vertical insulator strings to support three bundles which allows this design to consume only 6 3 tonnes of steel per kilometre of line design is also known as chainette little necklace transenergie uses two level pylons for angle towers or structures on 735 kv power lines to change direction of line or switch position of conductor bundles delta pylons and three leg guyed towers are also used as angle towers they are referred to as penguins by hydro quebec linemen pylons for other voltage levels hydro quebec transenergie uses a combination of double circuit three level pylons and single circuit delta pylons to suspend electrical conductors of other voltages such as 315 kv 450 kv high voltage direct current line in hydro quebec s power grid uses a t shaped tower lattice or pole to support two bundles of three conductors on each side direct

venture to build a new hvdc line from windsor quebec to deerfield new hampshire hydro quebec will own segment within quebec while segment within us will be owned by northern pass transmission llc a partnership between northeast utilities 75 and nstar 25 estimated to cost us 1 1 billion to build it is projected that line will either run in existing right of way adjacent to hvdc line that runs through new hampshire or it will connect to a right of way in northern new hampshire that will run through white mountains this line projected to carry 1 200 megawatts will bring electricity to approximately one million homes other features transenergie uses series compensation to alter way electricity behaves in power transmission lines which improves electricity transmission efficiency this reduces need to construct new power lines and increases amount of electric power sent to population centres series compensation is based on capacitor technology to maintain its transmission system performance transenergie sets aside funds for research and application of new technologies in addition to power transmission technology hydro quebec plans to offer high speed internet over its transmission lines within a few years utility started testing internet over its lines in january 2004 major disruptions in spite of transmission system s reputation and fact quebec escaped unscathed from northeast blackout of 2003 system has experienced damage and service interruptions from severe storms in past examples include 1982 and 1988 quebec blackouts prior to large 1989 and 1998 power interruptions 1989 geomagnetic storm at 2 44 am est on march 13 1989 a severe geomagnetic storm due to a coronal mass ejection from sun struck earth fluctuations within magnetic field of storm caused induced currents gics to flow through quebec s power lines which are direct current instead of alternating current carried by power lines insulating nature of canadian shield igneous rock directed gics to power lines conductors then forwarded this current to sensitive electrical transformers which require a certain voltage amplitude and frequency to function properly although most gics are relatively feeble nature of those currents destabilized voltage of power grid and current spikes erupted everywhere accordingly protective measures were taken in response to save transformers and other electrical equipment power grid was taken out of commission as circuit breakers tripped all over quebec and shut off power 2002 within less than 90 seconds this wave of breaking circuits left entire transmission grid out of service collapsed power grid left six million people and rest of quebec without electricity for hours on a very cold night even though blackout lasted around nine hours for most places some locations were in dark for days this geomagnetic storm caused about c 10 million in damage to hydro quebec and tens of millions to customers of utility 1998 ice storm thumb 300px map showing precipitation amounts for quebec and northeastern united states from january 4 5 to january 10 1998 warm moist air from south overriding cold air from north produced an ice storm leading to over 80 hours of freezing rain and drizzle for days a continuous shower of mostly freezing rain amounted to of water equivalent of precipitation places like montreal and south shore were especially hard hit with of largely freezing rain falling these heavy precipitation totals wreaked havoc on regional power transmission system physical damage five to six days of freezing rain and precipitation

effects of wind and precipitation these conductors may break and fall pylons designed to withstand only of ice accretion buckled and collapsed into twisted heaps of mangled steel cascading failures occurred on several transmission lines where collapse of one or more towers left a row of fallen pylons of all pylons damaged some 150 were pylons supporting 735 kv lines and 200 towers carrying 315 kv 230 kv or 120 kv power lines collapsed as well in a region bounded by montreal between saint hyacinthe saint jean sur richelieu and granby dubbed triangle of darkness half of overhead power grid was out of service quebec ordered myriad conductors and wire connections to repair ones disabled by storm in electrical transmission and electric power distribution system in all of quebec 24 000 poles 4 000 transformers and 1 000 electrical pylons were damaged or destroyed more than of downed electrical wires this cost a total of c 800 million to repair power outage with over 100 transmission lines paralyzed by ice quebec fell into a massive power outage in cold canadian winter even though power restoration initiated after first blackouts large numbers of quebecers were in dark at height

more than four million people were in dark private companies and other utilities from other parts of canada and united states were sent in to help hydro quebec undertake this massive restoration task but these efforts were complicated by widespread damage of power grid swiss reinsurance company canada inside an ice storm toronto 1998 blackouts in some areas lasted for 33 days and 90 of those affected by blackout had no power for more than seven days although power was fully restored to all locations in quebec by february 8 1998 it wasn t until mid march that power facilities were back in service by then much social and economic damage had occurred such as ruined food and deaths resulting from lack of electric heating after power outage was over hydro quebec made numerous upgrades to its system in order to improve power grid examples include strengthening of electrical pylons and power poles and increasing power supply this was done to enable utility to restore power more rapidly in case of a massive ice striking quebec again hydro quebec has stated that it is better prepared to handle an ice storm with same magnitude as one of 1998 2004 hydro tower bombing in 2004 shortly before u s president george w bush s visit to canada a tower along quebec new england transmission hvdc circuit in eastern townships near canada us border was damaged by explosive charges detonated at

2004 from google cache criticism performance of hydro quebec transenergie s power grid during 1998 ice storm raised questions about fundamental concept vulnerability and reliability of grid critics noted that power generation facilities were located approximately away from population centres and that there was a lack of local power stations around montreal which is served by only six 735 kv feeder lines report on state of power system submitted to ministre d etat des naturelles du quebec 21 january 1998 in addition 735 kv transmission system received scorn from public and media power transmission grid was said to concentrate power transmission on only a few 735 kv lines such as those that run from james bay to montreal out of six 735 feeder lines in montreal five of them form a loop called ring of power around city when ring failed on january 7 1998 roughly 60 of greater montreal s power supply was offline hydro quebec s large above ground transmission and distribution system was considered to be exposed to natural disasters although cost of grid was prohibitive technology utilized on hydro quebec transenergie grid also came under fire from critics it is claimed that this technology used to improve performance safety and reliability made people in quebec over dependent on power grid for their energy needs since electricity especially hydroelectric power makes up over 40 of quebec s energy supply this dependence evidenced by fact ontario farmers had more backup generators than farmers in quebec can increase severity of consequences when grid fails as it did
