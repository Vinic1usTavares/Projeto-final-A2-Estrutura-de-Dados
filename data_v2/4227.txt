telopea oreades commonly known as gippsland mountain or victorian waratah is a large shrub or small tree in family proteaceae native to southeastern australia it is found in wet sclerophyll forest and rainforest on rich acidic soils high in organic matter no subspecies are recognised though a northern isolated population hybridises extensively with braidwood waratah t mongaensis reaching a height of up to t oreades grows with a single trunk and erect habit it has dark green leaves with prominent veins that are long and wide red flower heads known as inflorescences appear in late spring each is composed of up to 60 individual flowers in garden t oreades grows in soils with good drainage and ample moisture in part shaded or sunny positions several commercially available cultivars that are hybrid forms with t speciosissima have been developed such as shady lady series timber is hard and has been used for making furniture and tool handles description left thumb flowering plant in errinundra national park telopea oreades grows as a large shrub or narrow tree high with a trunk reaching in diameter greyish brown trunk is thin in relation to tree s height and not buttressed its surface is smooth with horizontal lenticels and warty protuberances smaller branches are more brown and smooth young plants have a much more erect habit than other members of genus telopea and their stems have a distinct reddish tinge shiny dark green leaves are arranged alternately along stems leaves are narrow obovate to spathulate and measure long and wide they have a sunken midrib on upperside and corresponding ridge on underside with four to six pairs of lateral veins visible at a 45 degree angle to midline they veer and converge to form an easily seen vein that runs around inside leaf margin undersurface is paler and greyer when dried leaves appear to have a granular texture flowering occurs between october and december in its native range with plants at higher elevations flowering later than ones at lower altitude crimson flowerheads are about in diameter they are composed of 36 to 60 individual flowers with green to pink bracts which may be up to long each flower is encased in a long perianth which is a much brighter red on surface facing centre of flower than surface facing outwards anthesis or opening of flowers begins with those at centre of flowerhead and moves to edges or base individual flower bears a sessile anther that is it lacks a filament which lies next to stigma at end of style ovary lies at base of style and atop a stalk known as gynophore and it is from here that seed pods then develop meanwhile a crescent shaped lies at base of gynophore after flowering curved leathery to woody follicles develop these are long which somewhat resemble a boat in shape these ripen following may to september and split open to reveal and spill 10 16 seeds arranged in two columns winged flat brown seeds are around long with a roughly rectangular wing long new shoots often grow through flowerheads it can be difficult to distinguish t oreades from t mongaensis though leaves of latter species are more prominently veined and mostly but not always narrower than wide telopea oreades flowers around a month earlier than t mongaensis in areas where both are present taxonomy thumb open follicles following release of seeds gippsland waratah was first formally described by victorian government botanist ferdinand von mueller in 1861 in type material was collected in rugged mountainous country around creek a tributary of genoa river in south eastern new south wales mueller had been surveying mountainous eastern part of state since 1850s species name is said to be derived from ancient greek mountain and hence means of or relating to a mountain proper word for mountain in ancient greek is however oros oros liddell h g scott r 1940 a greek english lexicon revised and augmented throughout by sir henry stuart jones with assistance of roderick mckenzie oxford clarendon press only alternative scientific name proposed was in 1891 when otto kuntze named it as oreades but it was rejected as an illegitimate name common names applies to species include gippsland victorian mountain and tree waratah telopea oreades is one of five species from southeastern australia that make up genus telopea no subspecies are recognised it has been difficult to distinguish from similar t mongaensis but microscopic analysis has revealed that t oreades has features termed while t mongaensis does not two are sister species and their next closest relative is tasmanian waratah t truncata a disjunct northern population of t oreades grows together with t mongaensis in southern monga valley in southern new south wales with some hybrids reported crisp and weston concluded that two species for most part did not hybridise there however a genetic study using microsatellites found there was extensive hybridisation with much of presumed pure t oreades showing a close relation to t mongaensis populations of waratahs are thought to have grown and shrunk with ebb and flow of ice ages in pleistocene finally stranding a population of t oreades located alongside t mongaensis as conditions suitable for waratahs changed in southeastern australia genus lies in subtribe embothriinae along with tree waratahs alloxylon from eastern australia and new caledonia and oreocallis and chilean firetree embothrium coccineum from south america almost all these species have red terminal flowers and hence subtribe s origin and floral appearance must predate splitting of gondwana into australia antarctica and south america over 60 million years ago distribution and habitat thumb range in southeastern australia in red telopea oreades occurs in moist forests and temperate rainforests of coastal ranges and tableland escarpments in two disjunct areas of southeastern australia first is centred on east gippsland in victoria from orbost to vicinity of eden across border in far southeastern new south wales there is a more northerly population around monga valley near braidwood new south wales extending to moss vale there are unconfirmed reports of species in vicinity of brown mountain and state forest in southern new south wales which lie between two areas plants in victoria are found at altitudes ranging from in lind national park to on mount ellery wetter eastern and southern slopes are favoured habitats and annual rainfall ranges from t oreades grows in acidic soil that is high in nutrients and organic matter associated tree species in victoria include shining gum eucalyptus nitens messmate e obliqua mountain grey gum e cut tail e silvertop ash e sieberi southern sassafras black blanket leaf arborescens australian blackwood acacia melanoxylon privet mock olive pittosporum bicolor errinundra plum pine podocarpus sp rocks errinundra pepper subsp robusta and soft tree fern antarctica conservation telopea oreades is not listed under commonwealth environmental legislation and is not considered by respective state authorities to be rare or threatened in victoria or new south wales species does occur in threatened cool temperate rainforest community in victoria that is protected under flora and fauna guarantee act and it is a component of threatened southern escarpment wet sclerophyll forests of far southern new south wales furthermore planted specimens are frequently stolen from bush regeneration sites as they are desirable garden plants conversely in new zealand there is a report of t oreades escaping into kanuka scrub from trout hatchery gardens on tongariro river south of lake taupo ecology thumb mature plant in cool temperate rainforest habitat prominent position and striking colour of telopea oreades and many of its relatives within subtribe embothriinae both in australia and south america strongly suggest it is adapted to pollination by birds and has been for over 60 million years birds recorded visiting flowers for their nectar include red wattlebird anthochaera carunculata eastern spinebill acanthorhynchus tenuirostris crescent honeyeater phylidonyris pyrrhopterus yellow faced honeyeater lichenostomus chrysops brown headed honeyeater melithreptus brevirostris white naped honeyeater melithreptus lunatus and silvereye zosterops lateralis t oreades has a central taproot and few lateral roots like most proteaceae it has fine proteoid roots that arise from larger roots these are roots with dense clusters of short lateral rootlets that form a mat in soil just below leaf litter they are particularly efficient at absorbing nutrients from nutrient poor soils including phosphorus deficient native soils of australia t oreades has a swollen woody base largely under soil known as a lignotuber which stores energy and nutrients as a resource for rapid growth after a bushfire wet forests in which it grows seldom catch fire when they do plant community becomes a more open sclerophyll woodland until slow growing plants with larger leaves take over new shoots grow from lignotuber which survives bushfire as rest of plant above ground is burnt seed also germinates and grows in post bushfire soil which is higher in nutrients and more open with fewer competing plant species waratah seeds are often eaten and destroyed by animals and do not travel far several metres from parent plants cultivation and uses left thumb developing flowerhead in bud telopea oreades needs a well drained location as well as reliable moisture to thrive soil with some clay content is beneficial it is more shade tolerant than more popular new south wales waratah preferring part shade but tolerating sunny aspects it tolerates moderate frosts plants can be hard pruned old stems and branches can rejuvenate mature plants plants can benefit from low phosphorus fertilizer applied in spring and autumn propagation is by seed germination rates of which fall significantly after several months storage unless refrigerated or by cuttings of new growth that has just hardened cultivars must be propagated by cutting to make daughter plants identical to parent t oreades has been grown successfully in england plant was first cultivated there by canon arthur townsend boscawen at ludgvan in cornwall from seed that he obtained in 1910 he had succeeded in bringing plant into flower by 1915 providing material for illustration in curtis s botanical magazine in 1916 a plant in cornwall reached in height while another at wakehurst place reached in late 1980s although thriving at wakehurst species can be very sensitive to english soils royal horticultural society awarded species an award of merit in 1916 a selected white flowered form from errinundra plateau which was originally known as plateau view alba or plateau view white was registered by australian cultivar registration authority in 1990 as white have also developed several hybrids with t speciosissima looking to combine hardiness of t oreades with showier flowerheads of latter red pink and even white flowered cultivars are available telopea champagne is a cultivar registered under plant breeders rights pbr in 2006 its creamy yellow flowerheads appear from october to december it is a three way hybrid between t speciosissima t oreades and yellow flowered form of t truncata telopea golden globe is a cultivar registered under pbr in 2005 larger than champagne it is also a three way hybrid between t speciosissima t oreades and yellow flowered form of t truncata it has been propagated and sold as shady lady yellow it was originally bred in dandenong ranges east of melbourne telopea shady lady red is a larger shrub that may reach high and wide a hybrid of t speciosissima and t oreades it arose by chance in a melbourne garden first of shady lady series of cultivars it became commercially available in mid 1980s flowerheads are smaller and lack bracts of speciosissima parent as its name suggests it tolerates more shade it is vigorous and more reliable in temperate and subtropical areas and grows in semi shade or sun telopea shady lady white is a white flowered hybrid between t speciosissima and t oreades telopea shady lady pink is result of a cross between shady lady red and shady lady white telopea shady lady crimson is a selected colour form developed from shady lady red it became commercially available in australia in 2010 timber is fairly hard and resembles silky oak grevillea robusta it is durable and can be readily polished and worked with making it amenable for
