blue line also known as east link extension is a future light rail line serving eastside region of seattle metropolitan area in u s state of washington it will be part of sound transit s link light rail system running from west to east and serving 10 stations in downtown seattle mercer island bellevue and redmond blue line is scheduled to open in 2023 and will continue into downtown seattle transit tunnel and share stations with red line a extension to downtown redmond with two additional stations is scheduled to open in 2024 east link project projected to cost 3 7 billion to construct was approved by voters in 2008 sound transit 2 ballot measure line will use homer m hadley memorial bridge one of interstate 90 floating bridges which was constructed in 1989 with intent to convert its reversible express lanes to light rail early transit plans from 1960s proposed an eastside rail system but preliminary planning on system did not begin until sound transit s formation in early 1990s proposed alignment of east link project was debated by bellevue city council in early 2010s with members split on two different routes south of downtown bellevue city funding for downtown segment s tunnel was also debated and ultimately included in final agreement alignment was finalized in 2013 after more than two years of debate and delayed beginning of construction to 2016 and completion of project from 2021 to 2023 line will be world s first railway constructed on a floating bridge and is expected to carry 50 000 daily riders by 2030 history background and early proposals eastside suburbs underwent rapid development into bedroom communities after 1940 opening of first lake washington floating bridge which replaced a cross lake ferry system as main connection to seattle while private bus operators ran routes over lake washington floating bridge from seattle to eastside towns municipal seattle transit system opted not to extend its routes 1963 opening of evergreen point floating bridge fueled further growth leading to traffic congestion on both bridges during peak periods by 1965 more than 150 000 people lived on eastside king county government predicted in 1965 that up to 550 000 people would live in eastside cities by 1990 in 1960s construction of a rapid transit system for seattle metropolitan area was explored by municipal and regional governments initial system serving city of seattle would be extended east to bellevue via mercer island and an additional floating bridge in a later phase to be built by 1990 state government amended its plans for a parallel floating bridge to mercer island to include exclusive right of way for rapid transit eastside section of rapid transit system was expanded to include branches to eastgate and bel red area with provisions to extend system to redmond intermediate stations would be located at rainier avenue in seattle on mercer island and in downtown bellevue proposal funded with federal grants was put to a public vote as part of forward thrust referendums in 1968 and 1970 requiring a 60 percent majority in order to use increased property taxes during both referendums voters were unable to meet required majority to approve rapid transit plan first earned a simple majority while second failed due to local economic conditions metro transit was created by a 1972 referendum to operate a countywide bus system and resumed planning work for a seattle eastside transit system to be built using new interstate 90 floating bridge a transit element for new floating bridge was requested by puget sound council of governments and a group of municipal leaders from seattle and eastside seeking to avoid additional traffic a memorandum of agreement signed by washington state highway commission metro transit and local governments in late 1976 designated center two lanes of eight lane bridge for use by transit and mercer island residents with possible conversion to a fixed guideway system in future puget sound council of governments pscog a regional planning organization determined in a 1981 study that light rail would be a feasible way to relieve traffic on interstate 90 corridor and recommended that metro include it in their long term plan a joint study by metro and pscog in 1986 explored several alternative routes for an eastside light rail system recommending a route across interstate 90 bridge and branching from downtown bellevue to kirkland and bothell via eastside railway and downtown redmond via state route 520 while light rail plan was left unfunded provisions were made to accommodate a future eastside light rail connection in downtown seattle bus tunnel that opened in 1990 in 1990 state legislature called for creation of a regional transit authority to fund construction of a light rail system serving seattle metropolitan area a work group known as joint regional policy committee drafted a transit plan in march 1993 that conceived of a rapid rail system with a line between seattle bellevue and redmond served by through trains from snohomish county plan recommended a hybrid rail and bus system with rail serving as primary form of high capacity transit on interstate 90 corridor later that year central puget sound regional transit authority later renamed sound transit was established and began planning a package of transit projects for a public referendum committee s plan was downsized to of light rail including a line from seattle to bellevue and overlake and submitted to voters on march 14 1995 6 7 billion transit package was rejected by voters in part due to an opposition campaign funded by bellevue developer kemper freeman a smaller 3 9 billion system was proposed following year with a light rail line serving seattle and seattle tacoma international airport instead of a system spanning entire metropolitan area express buses from seattle to eastside would be funded by package in place of light rail service removal of eastside light rail line was opposed by politicians and business groups in area with prominent developers funding an opposition campaign package was approved by puget sound region s voters on november 5 1996 earning a majority of votes in eastside cities express buses between seattle and eastside funded by sound transit began operating in 1999 planning and ballot measures in late 1990s sound transit and washington state department of transportation wsdot co led a study into congestion relief measures on state route 520 corridor including use of light rail on either of floating bridges final trans lake washington study published in 2002 recommended further development of a high capacity fixed transit system on interstate 90 to supplement a new floating bridge carrying state route 520 while trans lake washington study was underway sound transit formed a steering committee in 1998 to assess configuration options for interstate 90 and its existing reversible express lane committee recommended addition of high occupancy vehicle lanes hov lanes to both directions of interstate 90 by narrowing existing lanes leaving reversible lanes ready for future transit use lane conversion coupled with additional hov ramps on mercer island was approved by sound transit wsdot and federal highway administration fhwa in 2004 an amendment to 1976 memorandum signed by metro and municipal governments to build interstate 90 bridge was drafted and signed authorizing conversion of reversible lanes for high capacity transit sound transit added eastside high capacity transit project to its preliminary long range plan in 2004 exploring several conceptual corridors and modes that branched out from a main line on interstate 90 bellevue overlake corridor was chosen as preferred routing of eastside line which would be either light rail trains or a bus rapid transit system that could be converted to rail in july 2005 light rail was chosen as preferred mode by sound transit in july 2006 after receiving endorsements from city councils of bellevue kirkland and redmond 3 9 billion light rail project named east link would be part of next regional transit ballot measure and run from seattle to bellevue microsoft campus and downtown redmond a segment of east link was included as part of of light rail in 47 billion roads and transit package which combined sound transit projects with highway expansion under plan light rail service from seattle to overlake hospital medical center east of downtown bellevue would begin in 2021 followed by an extension to microsoft campus in overlake by 2027 segment between overlake and downtown redmond would be prioritized for future extension using additional funding with engineering and property acquisition work covered by roads and transit package package attracted opposition from environmentalists developer kemper freeman and eastside elected officials and failed to pass in november 2007 election sound transit continued to hold public hearings and open houses on design of east link after rejection of roads and transit package as part of environmental review process a smaller transit only package named sound transit 2 with of light rail was passed by voters in november 2008 including funds for east link 18 billion plan projected that light rail trains would reach bellevue in 2020 and overlake transit center in 2021 and also included preliminary engineering for an eventual extension to downtown redmond floating bridge engineering and litigation thumb right looking east on homer m hadley memorial bridge in 2016 in 2005 wsdot conducted a live load test on interstate 90 floating bridge using 65 trucks carrying concrete weights to simulate weight of light rail trains and test its performance using results which matched those from an earlier computer simulation wsdot concluded that bridge could carry weight of light rail trains after minor changes to sections of transition spans were made during construction sound transit later determined in an engineering study that rail joints could be designed to accommodate multi directional movement of floating bridge with special design considerations and speed restrictions in 2008 state legislature s joint transportation committee commissioned an independent review of potential issues that would arise with light rail operations on floating bridge panel identified 23 issues including stray currents from electrical system that could cause corrosion weight of tracks and catenary on top of deck design of expansion joints and a needed seismic upgrade for bridge panel recommended several mitigation measures for identified issues which were accepted for consideration by sound transit and gave preliminary go ahead on project sound transit authorized a 53 million budget for preliminary engineering work on floating bridge segment in 2011 contracting out to a team led by parsons brinckerhoff and balfour beatty preliminary design on track bridge system to be used over bridge s expansion joints was completed in early 2012 following development of computer models and prototypes tested at university of washington a replica of bridge s light rail tracks complete with an electrified overhead line was built for field testing at transportation technology center in pueblo colorado using two light rail vehicles from central link track bridge system was designed to accommodate bridge s six ranges of motion changes in lake level and allow for trains to operate at full speed of track bridges consist of curved steel platforms placed under tracks connected to railroad ties by pivoting bearings that move independently of tracks allowing them to remain parallel pivoting bearings would also stabilize railroad ties during an earthquake moving slightly apart to accommodate seismic waves under steel platforms a series of flexible bearings would allow for tracks to rise and fall by up to while following motion of bridge deck trains would be halted from bridge in event of a major windstorm with gusts of from north or from south design of system which would make east link first railway over a floating bridge ever constructed was recognized by popular science magazine in their 2017 best of what s new awards design of seismic system and steel frames to be installed inside floating pontoons added 225 million in construction costs increasing construction budget by 46 percent and was paid for using contingency funds use of floating bridge for light rail service remained controversial after passage of sound transit 2 in 2008 bellevue developer kemper freeman filed a lawsuit against state government in 2009 arguing that 18th amendment of state constitution prohibited use of gas tax funded bridge for non road uses case was argued before state supreme court who ruled in april 2011 that case should be heard in a lower court first days later freeman re filed lawsuit in kittitas county superior court naming governor christine gregoire and secretary of transportation paula hammond as defendants a judge in kittitas court issued a summary judgement in favor of sound transit and wsdot effectively halting lawsuit a third lawsuit was filed by freeman in state supreme court where a 7 2 decision in september 2013 deemed that conversion of express lanes for light rail was not unconstitutional route refinement in bellevue sound transit 2 package did not include a specific route for east link in bellevue and redmond due to time needed to evaluate alignment options sound transit board divided line into five segments and identified 19 total potential alignments including tunnel routes in downtown bellevue favored by city s government that were studied in project s draft environmental impact statement in 2008 in southern bellevue named segment b alternatives considered included an at grade line along bellevue way an at grade or elevated alignment on 112th avenue southeast and a route following interstate 405 on east side of mercer slough nature park in downtown bellevue segment c three alternatives called for tunnels while two were elevated along 110th or 112th avenues and a sixth alignment consisted of an at grade line split between 108th and 110th avenues in bel red area segment d alignments traveled east above or along new streets proposed by city transitioning into an at grade and retained cut alignment along state route 520 to overlake transit center overlake to redmond segment segment e studied by project but not funded for construction diverged at west lake sammamish parkway generally serving stations at redmond town center mall and on east side of marymoor park bellevue city council endorsed 112th avenue alignment along with a tunnel in downtown bellevue under 106th avenue in february 2009 microsoft voiced its opposition to tunnel alignment which company believed would jeopardize funding for segment of line serving its corporate headquarters in overlake tunnel was estimated to add 600 million in costs to project s budget on may 14 2009 sound transit board chose two street surface alignment on 108th and 110th avenues as its preferred alternative but indicated that it would prefer a tunnel under 108th avenue if 500 million in additional funding could be found in september bellevue city council requested further review of options in downtown bellevue and together with sound transit proposed a short tunnel under 110th avenue with one station that would be cheaper to construct and avoid disruptions to existing bellevue transit center and 12th street corridor composition of bellevue city council was changed later in year with candidates backed by light rail opponent kemper freeman winning a majority in november election new councilmember kevin wallace proposed vision line an elevated alignment that followed interstate 405 and eastside rail corridor with its downtown station connected by and moving walkways bellevue continued to consider four new downtown alignments as well as options in south bellevue area city council considered routing trains through mercer slough and on eastside rail corridor until national park service spoke out against plan in march 2010 city council unanimously endorsed 110th avenue tunnel alternative which would cost an additional 285 million and drafted a cost savings plan that would levy a local tax to pay for tunnel a new alignment in south bellevue area using east sides of bellevue way and 112th avenue along with city covering cost of street reconstruction and utility relocation was also proposed in order to save 75 million in costs sound transit board made revised tunnel and south bellevue alignment its new preferred route in april and requested further study into impacts of rail construction in surrey downs area sound transit also approved exploration of alternative designs for overlake hospital station alignment through bel red area and overlake village station in redmond an additional downtown option using a shorter tunnel beginning at northeast 2nd street and an at grade crossing of main street was also proposed by sound transit to help reduce costs amid an expected shortfall in revenue thumb left map of preferred alignments selected by sound transit b2m colored blue and bellevue city council majority b7 colored red in july bellevue city council voted 4 3 to reject sound transit s six proposed south bellevue options in favor of its preferred alternative b7 using eastside rail corridor sound transit board voted to continue studying 112th avenue alignment and identified corridor as its preferred route b2m drawing criticism from bellevue mayor don davidson who spoke before board city council responded by approving 670 000 in funds towards study into b7 alternative to provide an even comparison to sound transit s proposed 112th avenue alignment three councilmembers who voted against study called it a hypocritical move in face of financial conservation during great recession and feared that it would extend planning period by several years sound transit released its supplemental draft environmental impact statement in november finding that b7 alternative would be costlier to construct and require more wetland mitigation and displace more businesses a public hearing on document later that month in bellevue was filled by supporters of b7 alternative who outnumbered those arguing in favor of b2m delays in deciding bellevue route moved projected opening date for east link from 2021 to 2022 for an at grade alignment and 2023 for a tunneled line a group of fourteen business executives representing boeing microsoft t mobile usa and symetra among others sent a letter to bellevue city council in may requesting it to cooperate with sound transit and expedite planning process divided opinions of bellevue city council led by b7 supporter kevin wallace and b2m supporter claudia balducci also a sound transit resulted in heated debates one of which devolved into a shouting match and accusations of conflicting interests in decisions related to light rail project in april 2011 city council hired an independent investigator to probe for possible conflicts of interest related to east link decision balducci through her involvement on sound transit board and councilmember grant degginger whose law firm represented sound transit in disputes over other projects were investigated and cleared of any wrongdoing under state laws wallace himself became subject of a separate investigation by city attorney s office after court documents revealed that his real estate company had negotiated with a freight railroad looking to use eastside rail corridor he was later cleared by independent investigator having not sought to profit from city council activities city of bellevue adopted an ethics code in 2013 that banned specific conflicts of interest as a result of investigation in november 2011 city council election freeman and other anti light rail developers funded challengers to balducci and chelminiak themselves funded by spring district developer wright as well as opposition messages and advertisements balducci and chelminiak were re elected and joined by newly elected councilmember john stokes replacing degginger in continuing 4 3 makeup of council preliminary bellevue city council report was released in may 2011 finding that b7 alternative would be feasible but cost up to 140 million more than sound transit s b2m alternative study received a mixed reaction from council and members of public and final version was cut after cost of study increased to 730 000 after release of study high level talks with sound transit were initiated by a delegation of bellevue officials including city manager steve sarkozy and councilmembers degginger and wallace negotiations moved into public sessions in mid july focusing on design modifications to sound transit s b2m alternative on 112th avenue that would lessen impacts on nearby homeowners a final environmental impact statement was published on july 15 which excluded a modified version of b7 alternative and sound transit board selected a modified version of its 112th avenue route and 110th avenue tunnel as its preferred route on july 28 new version included an hov lane on bellevue way grade separation on 112th avenue replacement of a station at southeast 8th street with one at main street and a noise wall and landscape buffer next to tracks bellevue city council approved a preliminary agreement in august in support of 112th avenue alignment and continued its negotiations with sound transit ahead of a memorandum of agreement due later in year further modifications in september eliminated a retained cut trench favored by city council and moved planned crossover from east side of 112th avenue to west side from southeast 6th street to southeast 15th street deadline for memorandum was originally set for october but it was extended into november while awaiting additional public comments solicited by city council city council also asked for a grade separated overpass for light rail trains crossing 112th avenue at southeast 15th street an umbrella memorandum of understanding between sound transit and city of bellevue was approved unanimously by city council on november 15 placing east link on 112th avenue and funding downtown tunnel with a 100 million contribution from city after signing of an agreement with wsdot to use interstate 90 floating bridge sound transit received a record of decision for east link project issued by federal transit administration fta formally ending environmental review process sound transit initiated design work on east link in early 2012 commissioning a cost savings analysis for bellevue segments to find elements where project costs could be reduced analysis was released for public comment in april proposing 60 million in savings by moving downtown station out of 110th avenue tunnel removing trenches from 112th avenue section and moving historic frederick w winters house out of planned guideway bellevue proposed an additional design change for 112th avenue corridor moving planned elevated flyover for trains into a trench under raised road after surrey downs residents complained of potential visual and noise impacts a shortlist of design modifications was approved for further study by sound transit board in late june with an endorsement from city council after publication of final cost savings analysis in september sound transit board and bellevue city council voted to endorse proposed design modifications to downtown station 112th avenue crossing and winters house trench design modifications to bellevue way and 112th avenue were opposed by residents of and surrey downs neighborhoods who claimed that changes would restrict road access and lower property values and quality of life after threatening to block property acquisition and delay project further a group representing surrey downs residents agreed to changes in city code that were approved by city council in february 2013 giving homeowners a larger setback from tracks and more time to negotiate property sales to sound transit city council also approved a streamlined permitting process that would expedite planning within bellevue surrey downs group had previously sued sound transit over impacts to mercer slough and winters house but lawsuit was rejected by u s district court in march 2013 a supplemental environmental impact statement was released in late march incorporating bellevue design modifications and requesting further design of pedestrian bridges over state route 520 near overlake village station in redmond bellevue city council unanimously approved a final alignment for east link on april 22 2013 including up to 53 million in cost savings identified in 2012 analysis days later sound transit approved same final alignment and design modifications public open houses on final design and property acquisitions began in may and an amended transitway agreement was signed by city of bellevue in june in july 2014 sound transit selected a former rail yard located west of spring district and its station as site of project s satellite operations and maintenance facility proposed site initially came as a surprise to city of bellevue who had hoped to use it for transit oriented development and also attracted an offer from mars hill church to share site which was later rejected after negotiations with city design of facility was amended to add of commercial and residential development on part of shrunken yard and asked sound transit to improve nearby pedestrian and bicycle connections in 2015 sound transit adopted a 3 7 billion budget for east link project funded primarily by tax revenue and bond proceeds from sound transit 2 package fta agreed to contribute a 1 33 billion loan for project as well as 88 7 million in grants city of bellevue also contributed 100 million towards construction of downtown tunnel after signing an updated memorandum of understanding in 2015 construction thumb
