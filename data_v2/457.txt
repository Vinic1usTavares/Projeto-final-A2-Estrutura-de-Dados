question time british national party controversy occurred in autumn of 2009 due to an invitation by british broadcasting corporation bbc to nick griffin leader of far right british national party bnp to be a panelist on question time one of its flagship television programmes on current affairs decision to have bnp represented on programme for first time sparked public and political debate in united kingdom at heart of matter was bbc s public broadcasting mandate requiring it to give equal prominence to political parties above a given level of electoral representation mark thompson director general of bbc defended bbc s decision to invite griffin stating bnp has demonstrated a level of support that would normally lead to an occasional invitation to join panel on question time it is for that reason not for some misguided desire to be controversial but for that reason alone that invitation has been extended a late appeal was made to bbc trust bbc s governing body by secretary of state for wales peter hain to have appearance blocked which ultimately failed griffin appeared on edition which aired on 22 october 2009 as programme was due to go on air public protests took place at bbc television centre in london pre recorded programme featured griffin alongside secretary of state for justice jack straw conservative peer and shadow minister for community cohesion warsi baroness warsi liberal democrats home affairs spokesperson chris huhne and writer playwright bonnie greer edition was watched by over 8 million people over half total audience share and more than double previous record high for question time background thumb 240px question time set in oxford alt news current affairs type television set question time is flagship bbc television political panel show which began in 1979 weekly show then hosted by david dimbleby since 1994 takes place at locations around country questions from a local audience are directed to a panel of invited guests usually consisting of british politicians alongside other public figures topics for debate during programme are loosely defined by set piece questions from pre selected audience members for each topic question is answered by each panel member in turn followed by supplementary questions on topic time permitting show is pre recorded a few hours before being broadcast and it is stressed by dimbleby as programme starts that panellists have no previous knowledge of content of questions british national party bnp is a far right minority party in britain founded by john tyndall in 1982 leader of party at time was nick griffin elected as one of eight meps in north west england constituency although he has since resigned as party leader at time of programme bnp won 943 598 votes and two seats in uk s 2009 european parliament elections in june where a total of 72 seats were contested bnp polled 6 26 of national vote of 15 625 823 from an electorate of 45 315 669 making it sixth ranked party behind conservatives 27 7 united kingdom independence party 16 5 labour 15 7 liberal democrats 13 7 and green party 8 6 result represented a 1 3 percentage point increase on its previous performance since then support for party has declined significantly allegedly due to internal splits and rise of ukip at time of programme bnp held one seat on london assembly and council seats in four london boroughs it was second party in london borough of barking and dagenham bbc policy coverage of bnp griffin had already appeared on other bbc shows including andrew marr show on bbc one and world at one on bbc radio 4 no bnp representative had ever appeared on question time before but following european election performance this stance was reviewed possibility of an appearance on question time by nick griffin was publicly announced by bbc in early september that month james macintyre of new statesman who was a former question time producer said that mentorn independent production company responsible for question time had been proposing an appearance by griffin over previous two years independent gave credit to bbc for resisting naive showbiz instincts of executives at mentorn who may have wanted what peter hain calls a for reasons well removed from bbc s charter obligations on 21 october day before broadcast bbc director general mark thompson wrote an article for guardian entitled keeping nick griffin off air is a job for parliament not bbc he said that those arguing for bnp to be excluded from programme were making case for censorship which was a matter for government and not bbc he explained bbc s decision question time is an opportunity for british public to put questions to politicians of every ideological hue politicians from uk s biggest parties appear most frequently but from time to time representatives of parties with many fewer supporters from scottish socialists and respect to green party also take their seats on stage question time is most prominent programme of its kind on british television and we carefully study support gained in elections by each of parties large and small before deciding who to invite and how frequently they should appear it is a straightforward matter of fact that with some 6 of vote and election of two meps in this spring s european elections and with some success in local elections as well bnp has demonstrated a level of support that would normally lead to an occasional invitation to join panel on question time it is for that reason not for some misguided desire to be controversial but for that reason alone that invitation has been extended bbc deputy director general mark byford also defended decision on day of programme saying bnp should have right to be heard be challenged and for public who take part in question time and viewers to make up their own minds about views of bnp it s not for bbc to censor and say they can t be on bbc s chief political adviser ric bailey stated after failed appeal that bbc would have been breaking its charter if it had not treated bnp with impartiality we absolutely stand by that judgement even though there s obviously been a lot of controversy about it a senior bbc presenter john humphrys said decision was absolutely right he said why should we be afraid of what they have to say free speech is issue here and bbc s obligations however broadcasting unions said some of its members would protest at invitation appeal to bbc trust a late attempt to stop programme came from labour secretary of state for wales peter hain who accused bbc of being apologists for bnp and making one of biggest mistakes in its proud history after failing to persuade bbc director general mark thompson to stop appearance hain appealed to bbc trust bnp s constitution restricting membership of party to indigenous caucasian people namely indigenous british ethnic groups including anglo saxon folk community and celtic scottish folk community was declared illegal on 15 october 2009 under race relations act after a challenge by equality and human rights commission and hain argued that appearance might be illegal in light of ruling on night of tuesday 20 october trust announced it was forming an emergency committee comprising three trustees chaired by richard tait to examine appeals late on 21 october day before programme was due to be made trust cleared griffin to appear on show it also ruled that given pre recorded nature of show many of concerns were hypothetical and premature trust declined further comment in case of an appeal of decision after show opinions

time griffin researched first appearance of sinn fein s gerry adams sen jack 20 march 2016 nick griffin a conversation with jack sen part 1 british renaissance 11 00 17 45 in an e mail to bnp supporters griffin said never before have we had chance to present our patriotic common sense solutions to britain s nightmare situation to public at large in such prominent fashion i am relishing this opportunity and i know that ordinary members supporters and voters of bnp will be in studio with me as i take on corrupt treacherous swine destroying our beautiful island nation contrasting to griffin s earlier 2001 appearance on hardtalk and later appearances on newsnight with jeremy paxman griffin claimed that he was non combative in his question time appearance in order to gain sympathy from viewers via a root for underdog mentality he had expected to salvage his reputation in expected a later 12 episodes of programme with him appearing as a panellist which did not occur however he also stated in a letter on bnp website i will no doubt be interrupted shouted down slandered put on spot and subjected to a scrutiny that would be a thousand times more intense than anything directed at other panellists it will in other words be political blood sport but i am relishing this opportunity griffin told times i thank political class and their allies for being so stupid he went on to say that his invitation on programme clearly gives us a whole new level of public recognition griffin said of his fellow question time panellists before show that bonnie greer was joker in pack who knows how to look after herself and may be more of a handful than others that menzies campbell would have been more daunting than chris huhne that jack straw is a very effective advocate he said that appearance of baroness warsi for conservatives was a typical stunt in run up to programme bnp website displayed a prominent countdown to question time uk parliamentary parties policy of labour party never to share a platform with bnp was changed following bbc s invitation to griffin labour said that future appearances were to be on a case by case basis on 27 september 2009 secretary of state for justice jack straw announced he would appear on programme following announcement that conservatives and liberal democrats would take part in any edition of question time that included bnp straw said he would be delighted to make argument for people against bnp wherever we have had bnp problems in my area and when we have fought them hard we ve pulled back and won seats back speaking on question time episode week before expected appearance by griffin home secretary alan johnson condemned decision of bbc there isn t a constitutional obligation to appear on question time that gives bnp a legitimacy they do not deserve these people believe in things that fascists believed in second world war they believe in what national front believe in they believe in purity of aryan race it is a foul and despicable party prime minister and labour leader gordon brown said he would not interfere with bbc s decision he said asked about their racist and bigoted views that are damaging to good community relations it will be a good opportunity to expose what they are about when pressed on reversal of labour s no platform policy brown said issue is should we have someone there jack straw is a very experienced person who has had to deal with bnp and their awful politics over a period of time conservative leader david cameron was uncomfortable with bbc decision which reminded him of an invitation to gerry adams to speak at oxford union during 1980s when he was at oxford he said it makes me uneasy i don t think bbc should have done it conservative panel member baroness warsi a british muslim from dewsbury west yorkshire a town which janice turner of times reported as having biggest bnp vote in britain stated i want to ask nick griffin what about me isn t british liberal democrat panel member chris huhne decided in consultation with his party leader nick clegg that given bbc s decision to invite griffin he had no choice but to attend he said that thursday night s excitement would not have been called off just because liberal democrats decided not to participate on day of programme former labour mayor of london ken livingstone said that bbc would bear moral responsibility for any rise in racist attacks in britain labour mp diane abbott first black woman to be elected to parliament believed that appearance of griffin would signal bnp was part of political mainstream in same way that her appearance on question time in 1987 had signalled black people s acceptance as part of mainstream she said it s not a programme that s going to scrutinise his views it s not that sort of programme it s politics as entertainment andy slaughter a labour mp whose constituency includes bbc television centre arrived to support protests scathingly attacking bbc s smugness saying that local people on estates were utterly affronted ten mps signed an early day motion tabled by labour mp mike gapes which called bbc decision profoundly wrong and noted that no previous bbc director general made such a judgement and that neither martin webster who polled 16 percent of vote in west bromwich by election in 1973 john tyndall colin jordan or oswald mosley were treated in same way other decision by bbc to invite griffin on to question time caused widespread controversy in an editorial on 15 october 2009 guardian said bnp is no normal party yet by inviting it on to question time bbc runs risk of normalising it it also stated that it would give bnp its best ever platform for its poisonous politics jim shields associate professor in french studies at warwick university stated that appearance would be a real milestone in griffin s acceptability he said that far right leader jean marie le pen s appearance on a similar programme in france saw support for his front national party double overnight professor ted commissioned by government to investigate 2001 oldham riots urged a more sophisticated approach using reasoned arguments to defeat far right anti fascist magazine searchlight said that entry level for inclusion on bbc programmes should be election to national parliament muhammad abdul bari secretary general of muslim council of britain said we regret bbc s decision there is a general fear that allowing bnp to air its toxic views will increase islamophobia and give bnp aura of respectability needed to spread its message of hate on 21 october iain martin wrote in a wall street journal blog that appearance on question time signalled that mainstream political parties in britain had badly let down their fellow britons by setting narrow terms for national debate which exclude concerns of millions of voters and force them out on to fringes similarly issue of griffin s upcoming appearance was headline story on bbc two s newsnight previous evening it was dealt with in a segment on social decline in britain and perceived failings of major parties on morning of programme leading article in times said that bbc were right to invite griffin but that issue of his appearance should not be allowed to dominate programme and that panel and its chairman should be well briefed on mr griffin s many unsavoury comments on topics such as immigration richard preston blogging for daily telegraph compared importance of griffin s appearance with past infrequent question time panellists such as comedians eddie izzard norman pace and jim davidson while also expressing confidence that hour long show and david dimbleby would provide enough scrutiny to expose griffin if he was a lightweight or a he suggested that britain truly does have problems if a trio of mainstream politicians did not manage to take him apart broadcast panel panel for 22 october edition of question time consisted of bonnie greer writer historian and playwright nick griffin british national party mep for north west england and bnp leader chris huhne then liberal democrat mp for eastleigh and home affairs spokesperson jack straw labour mp for blackburn and

programme had overly focused on bnp becoming nick griffin show ofcom was considering whether a formal investigation was warranted under broadcast code section on harm and offence after one week ofcom had received 290 complaints panel view straw described nick griffin as a fantasising conspiracy theorist with some very unpleasant views and no moral compass but now that he has been exposed for what he is it is time to move on warsi said griffin was very much exposed for man that he is when he was questioned on his views his face of extremism was exposed he was given an opportunity to explain some of his policies and he couldn t huhne said this is a person who comes from a fascist background anyone who watches programme will see exactly what he stands for greer said griffin had been totally trounced on show and that sitting next to griffin had been probably weirdest and most creepy experience of my life nevertheless griffin perceived that he had struck up a rapport with greer who treated him differently from other panellists greer avoided looking in griffin s direction throughout and indeed turned her back on him pointedly speaking to associated press griffin stated that his appearance had secured bnp s place on national stage and while not revolutionary was like gaining a kind of boy scout s badge he was relatively pleased with having been able to land a few punches of my own later griffin declared millions of people are angry about way i was treated describing experience as a lynch mob he complained how choice of london had made it hostile territory for him and had prevented him from speaking on then current events such as postal strikes bnp view on 23 october day after broadcast griffin announced he would be lodging a formal complaint over programme over its focus on bnp issues rather than topical subjects griffin stated there is not much support for me there in london because place is dominated by ethnic minorities there is an ethnic minority that supports me english but there s not many of them left a spokesman for bnp said that london was too multicultural to be fair to it and that a location like northwest of england would have been more favourable bnp were also going to file a freedom of information request to bbc to determine decision making process behind hosting programme in london and in allowing debate to focus on bnp arguing that criticism of bnp had dominated whole programme griffin dismissed criticism of his performance saying people who have always been against bnp will say that i couldn t answer some things he was of opinion that he had been shown extraordinary hostility by main political parties but that he was happy having done his best griffin said i can see that millions of people who don t usually watch question time will remember what i ve said and think that s how they feel and i m perfectly happy with that he also said he expected bnp would appear on question time again bnp legal officer lee barnes described griffin s performance as failing to press attack and evening standard reported a possible challenge to griffin s leadership from a faction within bnp linked to chris jackson which was dissatisfied with his performance but rated this chance of success as low bnp also claimed that it had received thousands of pounds in donations and that 3 000 people had expressed an interest on their website in joining party once their recruitment freeze was lifted this would represent nearly a 30 increase in membership according to party website while campaigning on 28 october for forthcoming glasgow north east by election on 22 november griffin was asked why he had laughed on question time he replied i had thought that david dimbleby would have professional self respect to at least make a show of being fair i was laughing at fact that i was wrong adding all that was exposed was pure vicious bigotry of british ruling elite other reactions and analyses programme was headline news in several of early friday paper editions of british press from tabloids to broadsheets tabloid headlines included bigot at bay daily mail and when auntie met nazi sun auntie being a nickname for bbc while broadsheets featured examples such as hostile reception for griffin times and griffin s baptism of fire at bbc independent immediately after show independent said griffin had choked on oxygen of publicity given him by bbc times described griffin as having been caught in tv s glare subjected to a hostile hour long grilling guardian however was of opinion that while griffin was jeered and attacked and often looked just plain shifty he made no major gaffes and would thus think of it as a success after rating panel s performance as flawed and after some questions on night went unanswered or were avoided by griffin it concluded that it was audience that came out best from evening fact that four out of five question topics on night were bnp related was criticised by some who believed it would allow griffin to claim victimisation however according to times bbc was delighted with strategy which was to ensure it could not be accused of giving griffin an easy ride welsh secretary peter hain who had appealed to bbc trust to have griffin s appearance prevented continued to denounce decision david lammy one of britain s first black ministers feared that people would face violence as a result of programme former home secretary david blunkett attacked way in which bbc news at six engaged in deliberate promotion of their own publicity seeking decision opining that only people who have benefited from this row are bnp and bbc s question time ratings conservative mayor of london boris johnson responded to griffin s complaints about location by defending london s diversity urging residents to reject their narrow extremist and offensive views at every opportunity pfeffer commenting for israeli newspaper haaretz noted relative silence of uk jewish groups over bnp appearance and praised bbc s decision to give bnp a voice stating bbc is right to have griffin and other racists on its most respectable shows it is wrong to apologise by doing so it is simply fulfilling its democratic and journalistic duties pfeffer compared and contrasted this with israeli freedom of speech laws and questioned whether hitler could have risen to power in modern times given media s scrutiny of democratic politicians guardian selected a spontaneous joke about south pole made by an audience member klare as undoubted highlight having raised loudest cheer from audience klare son of indian parents who migrated to britain in 1960s had suggested collecting money for griffin to be deported to south pole as it s a colourless landscape that will suit you fine klare said that while he did not think so at first in retrospect he thought that question time was right platform for griffin analysing broadcast footage times determined that cameras spent nearly 25 minutes of hour long programme of screen time either on griffin or a two shot with him and another panellist equating to 38 daily mail alleged that bbc stage managed programme highlighting a crib sheet handed out to audience members guardians media monkey blog observed that such a sheet is routinely given to audience and also accused mail of using a doctored crib sheet first opinion poll taken after nick griffin s appearance conducted hours after programme by yougov for daily telegraph indicated that voter support for bnp had increased by 1 from 2 to 3 in previous month and that 22 of voters were now seriously considering voting bnp in a future local general or european election broken down into definitely 4 probably 3 and possible 15 bookmaker william hill changed its odds on bnp winning a

george carey spoke out against griffin s claims that he was representing christian britain and called on christians to stand shoulder to shoulder in rejecting british national party prime minister

middle east australia turkey russia and south america media later reported that cost of policing appearance had been 000 bbc view bbc was subjected to criticism from some of its own staff as radio 4 broadcaster sue macgregor said that show gave impression of attack dogs against nick griffin and another presenter called it a bear pit in defence of criticism of format and focus of programme deputy director general mark byford stated that agenda of programme was set by audience s own questions byford also said of comments that clearly mr griffin and bnp were subject of intense questioning but all panellists were given opportunity to respond and to have their voices heard sir christopher bland former chairman of bbc s board of governors said however that had bbc not changed format corporation would probably have been accused of leniency on 23 october bbc said it was too early to confirm how much more airtime would be given to bnp in future times reported on 24 october that bbc had no plans to have griffin on question time before next general election on 28 october mark thompson stated before house of lords communications committee that future bnp appearances on question time would probably be no more than once a year and could be less based on party continuing same levels of support thompson denied suggestions that invitation was made to boost viewing figures no bnp
