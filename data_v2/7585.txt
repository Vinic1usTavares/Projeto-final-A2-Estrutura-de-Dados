congo crisis was a period of political upheaval and conflict in republic of congo today democratic republic of congo between 1960 and 1965 crisis began almost immediately after congo became independent from belgium and ended unofficially with entire country under rule of joseph desire mobutu constituting a series of civil wars congo crisis was also a proxy conflict in cold war in which soviet union and united states supported opposing factions around 100 000 people are believed to have been killed during crisis a nationalist movement in belgian congo demanded end of colonial rule this led to country s independence on 30 june 1960 minimal preparations had been made and many issues such as federalism tribalism and ethnic nationalism remained unresolved in first week of july a mutiny broke out in army and violence erupted between black and white civilians belgium sent troops to protect fleeing whites katanga and south kasai seceded with belgian support amid continuing unrest and violence united nations deployed peacekeepers but un secretary general dag hammarskjold refused to use these troops to help central government in leopoldville fight secessionists prime minister patrice lumumba charismatic leader of largest nationalist faction reacted by calling for assistance from soviet union which promptly sent military advisers and other support involvement of soviets split congolese government and led to an impasse between lumumba and president joseph kasa vubu mobutu in command of army broke this deadlock with a coup d etat expelled soviet advisors and established a new government effectively under his own control lumumba was taken captive and subsequently executed in 1961 a rival government of free republic of congo was founded in eastern city of stanleyville by lumumba supporters led by antoine gizenga it gained soviet support but was crushed in early 1962 meanwhile un took a more aggressive stance towards secessionists after hammarskjold was killed in a plane crash in late 1961 supported by un troops leopoldville defeated secessionist movements in katanga and south kasai by start of 1963 with katanga and south kasai back under government s control a reconciliatory compromise constitution was adopted and exiled katangese leader moise tshombe was recalled to head an interim administration while fresh elections were organised before these could be held however maoist inspired militants calling themselves simbas rose up in east of country simbas took control of a significant amount of territory and proclaimed a communist people s republic of congo in stanleyville government forces gradually retook territory and in november 1964 belgium and united states intervened militarily in stanleyville to recover hostages from simba captivity simbas were defeated and collapsed soon after following elections in march 1965 a new political stalemate developed between tshombe and kasa vubu forcing government into near paralysis mobutu mounted a second coup d etat in november 1965 taking personal control of country under mobutu s rule congo renamed zaire in 1971 was transformed into a dictatorship which would endure until his deposition in 1997 background belgian rule thumb left belgian congo today democratic republic of congo highlighted on a map of africa colonial rule in congo began in late 19th century king leopold ii of belgium frustrated by belgium s lack of international power and prestige attempted to persuade belgian government to support colonial expansion around then largely unexplored congo basin belgian government s ambivalence about idea led leopold to eventually create colony on his own account with support from a number of western countries who viewed leopold as a useful buffer between rival colonial powers leopold achieved international recognition for a personal colony congo free state in 1885 by turn of century however violence of free state officials against indigenous congolese and ruthless system of economic extraction had led to intense diplomatic pressure on belgium to take official control of country which it did in 1908 creating belgian congo belgian rule in congo was based around colonial trinity trinite coloniale of state missionary and private company interests privileging of belgian commercial interests meant that capital sometimes flowed back into congo and that individual regions became specialised on many occasions interests of government and private enterprise became closely tied and state helped companies with strikebreaking and countering other efforts by indigenous population to better their lot country was split into nesting hierarchically organised administrative subdivisions and run uniformly according to a set native policy politique indigene in contrast to british and french who generally favoured system of indirect rule whereby traditional leaders were retained in positions of authority under colonial oversight there was also a high degree of racial segregation large numbers of white immigrants who moved to congo after end of world war ii came from across social spectrum but were nonetheless always treated as superior to blacks during 1940s and 1950s congo experienced an unprecedented level of urbanisation and colonial administration began various development programmes aimed at making territory into a model colony one of results of measures was development of a new middle class of europeanised african evolues in cities by 1950s congo had a wage labour force twice as large as that in any other african colony congo s rich natural resources including uranium much of uranium used by u s nuclear programme during world war ii was congolese led to substantial interest in region from both soviet union and united states as cold war developed politics and radicalisation an african nationalist movement developed in belgian congo during 1950s primarily among evolues movement was divided into a number of parties and groups which were broadly divided on ethnic and geographical lines and opposed to one another largest mouvement national congolais mnc was a united front organisation dedicated to achieving independence within a reasonable time it was created around a charter which was signed by among others patrice lumumba cyrille adoula and joseph ileo but others accused party of being too moderate lumumba became a leading figure within mnc and by end of 1959 party claimed to have 58 000 members thumb upright leader of abako joseph kasa vubu who later became independent congo s first president mnc s main rival was alliance des bakongo abako led by joseph kasa vubu who advocated a more radical ideology than mnc based around calls for immediate independence and promotion of regional identity abako s stance was more ethnic nationalist than mnc s it argued that an independent congo should be run by bakongo as inheritors of pre colonial kingdom of kongo confederation des associations tribales du katanga conakat a localist party led by moise tshombe was third major organisation it advocated federalism and primarily represented southern province of katanga these were joined by a number of smaller parties which emerged as nationalist movement developed including radical parti africain psa and factions representing interests of minor ethnic groups like alliance des although it was largest of african nationalist parties mnc had many different factions within it that took differing stances on a number of issues it was increasingly polarised between moderate evolues and more radical mass membership a radical faction headed by ileo and albert kalonji split away in july 1959 but failed to induce mass defections by other mnc members dissident faction became known as mnc kalonji mnc k while majority group became mnc lumumba mnc l split divided party s support base into those who remained with lumumba chiefly in stanleyville region in north east and those who backed mnc k which became most popular around southern city of elisabethville and among luba ethnic group major riots broke out in leopoldville congolese capital on 4 january 1959 after a political demonstration turned violent force publique colonial gendarmerie used force against rioters at least 49 people were killed and total casualties may have been as high as 500 nationalist parties influence expanded outside major cities for first time and nationalist demonstrations and riots became a regular occurrence over next year bringing large numbers of black people from outside evolue class into independence movement many blacks began to test boundaries of colonial system by refusing to pay taxes or abide by minor colonial regulations bulk of abako leadership was arrested leaving mnc in an advantageous position these developments led to white community also becoming increasing radicalised some whites planned to attempt a coup d etat if a black majority government took power as law and order began to break down white civilians formed militia groups known as corps de european volunteer corps to police their neighbourhoods these militias frequently attacked blacks independence in fallout from leopoldville riots report of a belgian parliamentary working group on future of congo was published in which a strong demand for internal autonomy was noted august de minister of colonies launched a high profile round table conference in brussels in january 1960 with leaders of all major congolese parties in attendance lumumba who had been arrested following riots in stanleyville was released in run up to conference and headed mnc l delegation belgian government had hoped for a period of at least 30 years before independence but congolese pressure at conference led to 30 june 1960 being set as date issues including federalism ethnicity and future role of belgium in congolese affairs were left unresolved after delegates failed to reach agreement thumb left patrice lumumba leader of mnc l and first prime minister pictured in brussels at round table conference of 1960 belgians began campaigning against lumumba whom they wanted to marginalise they accused him of being a communist and hoping to fragment nationalist movement supported rival ethnic based parties like conakat many belgians hoped that an independent congo would form part of a federation like french community or british commonwealth of nations and that close economic and political association with belgium would continue as independence approached belgian government organised congolese elections in may 1960 these resulted in an mnc relative majority proclamation of independent republic of congo and end of colonial rule occurred as planned on 30 june 1960 in a ceremony at palais de la nation in leopoldville king baudouin gave a speech in which he presented end of colonial rule in congo as culmination of belgian civilising mission begun by leopold ii after king s address lumumba gave an unscheduled speech in which he angrily attacked colonialism and described independence as crowning success of nationalist movement although lumumba s address was acclaimed by figures such as malcolm x it nearly provoked a diplomatic incident with belgium even some congolese politicians perceived it as unnecessarily provocative nevertheless independence was celebrated across congo politically new state had a semi presidential constitution known as loi fondamentale in which executive power was shared between president and prime minister in a system known as kasa vubu was proclaimed president and lumumba prime minister of republic of congo despite objections of conakat and others constitution was largely centralist concentrating power in central government in leopoldville and did not devolve significant powers to provincial level beginning of crisis force publique mutiny racial violence and belgian intervention despite proclamation of independence neither belgian nor congolese government intended colonial social order to end immediately belgian government hoped that whites might keep their position indefinitely republic of congo was still reliant on colonial institutions like force publique to function from day to day and white technical experts installed by belgians were retained in broad absence of suitably qualified black congolese replacements partly result of colonial restrictions regarding higher education many congolese people had assumed that independence would produce tangible and immediate social change so retention of whites in positions of importance was widely resented lieutenant general emile janssens belgian commander of force publique refused to see congolese independence as marking a change in nature of command day after independence festivities he gathered black non commissioned officers of his leopoldville garrison and told them that things under his command would stay same summarising point by writing before independence after independence on a blackboard this message was hugely unpopular among rank and file many of men had expected rapid promotions and increases in pay to accompany independence on 5 july 1960 several units mutinied against their white officers at camp hardy near thysville insurrection spread to leopoldville next day and later to garrisons across country rather than deploying belgian troops against mutineers as janssens had wished lumumba dismissed him and renamed force publique armee nationale congolaise anc all black soldiers were promoted by at least one rank victor lundula was promoted directly from sergeant major to major general and head of army replacing janssens at same time joseph desire mobutu an ex sergeant major and close personal aide of lumumba became lundula s deputy as army chief of staff government attempted to stop revolt lumumba and kasa vubu intervened personally at leopoldville and thysville and persuaded mutineers to lay down their arms but in most of country mutiny intensified white officers and civilians were attacked white owned properties were looted and white women were raped belgian government became deeply concerned by situation particularly when white civilians began entering neighbouring countries as refugees international press expressed shock at apparent sudden collapse of order in congo as world view of congolese situation prior to independence due largely to belgian propaganda was one of peace stability and strong control by authorities thumb left force publique soldiers in leopoldville in 1960 lumumba s stance appeared to many belgians to justify their prior concerns about his radicalism on 9 july belgium deployed paratroopers without congolese state s permission in and elsewhere to protect fleeing white civilians belgian intervention divided lumumba and kasa vubu while kasa vubu accepted belgian operation lumumba denounced it and called for all congolese to defend our republic against those who menace it at lumumba s request white civilians from port city of matadi were evacuated by belgian navy on 11 july belgian ships then bombarded city at least 19 civilians were killed this action prompted renewed attacks on whites across country while belgian forces entered other towns and cities including leopoldville and clashed with congolese troops belgian government subsequently announced that it would provide for belgian bureaucrats back in metropole triggering an exodus of most of congo s 10 000 european civil servants and leaving administration in disarray engulfed by disorder spreading throughout country most of government ministries were unable to function katanga and south kasai secessions thumb flag of secessionist state of katanga declared in 1960 on 11 july 1960 moise tshombe leader of conakat declared congo s southern province of katanga independent as state of katanga with elisabethville as its capital and himself as president mineral rich katanga region had traditionally shared closer economic ties with copperbelt of neighbouring northern rhodesia then part of central african federation than with rest of congo and because of its economic importance it had been administered separately from rest of country under belgians conakat furthermore contended that katangese people were ethnically distinct from other congolese secession was partly motivated by katangese separatists desire to keep more of wealth generated by province s mining operations and to avoid sharing it with rest of congo another major factor was what conakat held to be disintegration of law and order in central and north eastern congo announcing katanga s breakaway tshombe said we are seceding from chaos thumb upright left president of secessionist katanga moise tshombe major mining company in katanga umhk had begun supporting conakat during latter days of belgian rule amid worries that mnc might seek to nationalise company s assets after independence umhk was largely owned by a prominent holding company based in brussels that had close ties to belgian government encouraged by umhk belgian government provided military support to katanga and ordered its civil servants in region to remain in their posts tshombe also recruited mercenaries mainly whites from south africa and rhodesias to supplement and command katangese troops although supported by belgians katanga never received formal diplomatic recognition from any country katangese secession highlighted fundamental weakness of central government in leopoldville which had been chief advocate of a unified state less than a month after katangese secession on 8 august a section of region of kasai situated slightly to north of katanga also declared its autonomy from central government as mining state of south kasai based around city of bakwanga south kasai was much smaller than katanga but was also a mining region it was largely populated by luba ethnic group and its president albert kalonji claimed that secession was largely sparked by persecution of baluba in rest of congo south kasai government was supported by another belgian mining company which received concessions from new state in return for financial support without control over katanga and south kasai central government was deprived of approximately 40 percent of its revenues foreign reaction and un intervention disquiet about belgium s support for secessionist states led to calls within united nations un to remove all belgian troops from country secretary general of un dag hammarskjold believed that crisis would provide organisation with a chance to demonstrate its potential as a major peacekeeping force and encouraged sending of a multinational contingent of peacekeepers to congo under un command on 14 july un security council adopted resolution 143 calling for total belgian withdrawal from congo and their replacement with a un commanded force thumb a swedish peacekeeping soldier in congo un deployed troops from a variety of nations during onuc arrival of united nations operation in congo onuc was initially welcomed by lumumba and central government who believed un would help suppress secessionist states onuc s initial mandate however only covered maintenance of law and order viewing secessions as an internal political matter hammarskjold refused to use un troops to assist central congolese government against them he argued that doing so would represent a loss of impartiality and breach congolese sovereignty lumumba also sought assistance of united states government of dwight d eisenhower which refused to provide unilateral military support frustrated he turned to soviet union which agreed to provide weapons logistical and material support around 1 000 soviet military advisors soon landed in congo lumumba s actions distanced him from rest of government especially kasa vubu who feared implications of soviet intervention americans also feared that a soviet aligned congo could form basis of a major expansion of communism into central africa with soviet support 2 000 anc troops launched a major offensive against south kasai attack was extremely successful but during course of offensive anc became involved in infighting between baluba and bena lulua ethnic groups and perpetrated a number of large massacres of luba civilians around 3 000 were killed violence of advance caused an exodus of thousands of baluba civilians who fled their homes to escape fighting involvement of soviet union alarmed united states american government under eisenhower in line with belgian criticism had long believed that lumumba was a communist and that congo could be on track to become a strategically placed soviet client state in august 1960 central intelligence agency cia agents in region reported to their agency that congo is experiencing a classic communist takeover and warned that congo might follow same path as cuba political disintegration central government split and first mobutu coup thumb kasa vubu with members of college of commissionaires general installed by mobutu in september 1960 left lumumba s appeal for soviet support split government and led to mounting pressure from western countries to remove him from power in addition both tshombe and kalonji appealed to kasa vubu who they believed to be both a moderate and federalist to move against lumumba s centralism and resolve secession issue meanwhile mobutu took effective control of army routing foreign aid and promotions to specific units and officers to secure their allegiance on 5 september 1960 kasa vubu announced on national radio that he had unilaterally dismissed lumumba using massacres in south kasai as a pretext and with promise of american backing andrew cordier american un representative in congo used his position to block communications by lumumba s faction and to prevent a coordinated mnc l reaction to news both chambers of parliament however supported lumumba and denounced kasa vubu s action lumumba attempted to dismiss kasa vubu from his position but could not get support for this precipitating a constitutional crisis ostensibly in order to resolve deadlock joseph desire mobutu launched a bloodless coup and replaced both kasa vubu and lumumba with a college of commissionaires general college des generaux consisting of a panel of university graduates led by justin soviet military advisors were ordered to leave allegedly coup was intended to force politicians to take a cooling off period before they could resume control in practice however mobutu sided with kasa vubu against lumumba who was placed under house arrest guarded by ghanaian un troops and an outer ring of anc soldiers kasa vubu was re appointed president by mobutu in february 1961 from coup onwards mobutu was able to exert considerable power in congolese politics behind scenes thumb colonel mobutu left pictured alongside president kasa vubu in 1961 following kasa vubu s reinstatement there was an attempted rapprochement between congolese factions tshombe began negotiations for end of secession and formation of a confederal congo although a compromise agreement was reached it was prevented from taking effect as negotiations broke down amid personal animosity between kasa vubu and tshombe an attempted reconciliation in july 1961 led to formation of a new government led by cyrille adoula which brought together deputies from both lumumbist and south kasai factions but also failed to bring a reconciliation with katanga members of mnc l fled to stanleyville where led by antoine gizenga they formed a rebel government in november 1960 in opposition to central government in leopoldville gizenga government was recognised by some states including soviet union and china as official government of congo and could call on an approximate 5 500 troops compared to central government s 7 000 faced with un pressure gizenga government however collapsed in january 1962 after gizenga was arrested killing of lumumba thumb pro lumumba demonstrators in maribor yugoslavia in february 1961 left lumumba escaped house arrest and fled eastwards towards stanleyville where he believed he could rally support pursued by troops loyal to mobutu he was captured at lodi on 1 december 1960 and flown back to leopoldville with his hands bound despite un appeals to kasa vubu for due legal process soviet union denounced un as responsible for arrest and demanded his release a meeting of un security council was called on 7 december 1960 to consider soviet demands that un seek lumumba s immediate release his restoration to head of congolese government and disarming of mobutu s forces pro lumumba resolution was defeated on 14 december 1960 by a vote of 8 2 still in captivity lumumba was tortured and transported to thysville and later to katanga where he was handed over to forces loyal to tshombe on 17 january 1961 lumumba was executed by katangese troops near elisabethville news of execution released on 13 february provoked international outrage belgian embassy in yugoslavia was attacked by protesters in belgrade and violent demonstrations occurred in london and new york shortly thereafter seven lumumbists including first president of orientale province jean pierre finant were executed in south kasai for crimes against baluba nation gizenga s soldiers then shot 15 political prisoners in retaliation including lumumba s dissident minister of communications alphonse songolo united nations escalation and end of katangese secession since its initial resolution of july 1960 un had issued further resolutions calling for total withdrawal of belgian and mercenary forces from katanga in progressively stronger terms by 1961 onuc comprised nearly 20 000 men although their mandate prevented them from taking sides onuc had a mandate to arrest foreign mercenaries wherever they encountered them in september 1961 an attempt to detain a group of katangese mercenaries without violence during operation went wrong and turned into a fire fight onuc s claim to impartiality was undermined in mid september when a company of irish un troops were captured by numerically superior katangese forces following a six day siege in jadotville katanga proceeded to hold irishmen as prisoners of war a development that deeply embarrassed un mission and its proponents thumb swedish onuc troops advancing upon town of kamina on 18 september 1961 hammarskjold flew to ndola just across border in northern rhodesia to attempt to broker a cease fire between un and katangese forces his aircraft crashed before landing at ndola airport killing him and everybody else on board in stark contrast to hammarskjold s attempts to pursue a moderate policy in congo his successor u thant supported a more radical policy of direct involvement in conflict katanga released captured irish soldiers in mid october as part of a cease fire deal in which onuc agreed to pull its troops back a propaganda coup for tshombe restated american support for un mission and murder of ten italian un pilots in port empain in november 1961 strengthened international demands to resolve situation in april 1962 un troops occupied south kasai on night of 29 30 september 1962 south kasai military commanders launched a coup d etat in bakwanga against kalonjist regime on 5 october 1962 central government troops again arrived in bakwanga to support mutineers and help suppress last kalonjist loyalists marking end of south kasai s secession thumb left map of factions in congo in 1961 resolution 169 issued in november 1961 called for onuc to respond to deteriorating human rights situation and prevent outbreak of full scale civil war resolution completely rejected katanga s claim to statehood and authorised onuc troops to use all necessary force to assist central government of congo in restoration and maintenance of law and order katangese made further provocations and in response onuc launched operation unokat to dismantle katangese roadblocks and seize strategic positions around elisabethville faced with international pressure tshombe signed declaration in december 1962 in which he agreed in principle to accept authority of central government and state constitution and to abandon any claim to katangese independence following declaration however talks between tshombe and adoula reached a deadlock while katangese forces continued to harass un troops diminishing support and belgium s increasing reluctance to support katanga demonstrated that state could not survive indefinitely on 11 december 1962 belgian foreign minister paul henri spaak declared that belgian government would support un or central congolese government should they attempt to end katangese secession through force on 24 december 1962 un troops and katangese gendarmes clashed near elisabethville and fighting broke out after attempts to reach a ceasefire failed un troops launched operation and occupied elisabethville prompting tshombe to leave country a ceasefire was agreed upon soon thereafter indian un troops exceeding their orders then occupied jadotville preventing katangese loyalists from regrouping gradually un overran rest of katanga and on 17 january 1963 tshombe surrendered his final stronghold of effectively ending katangese secession attempted political reconciliation thumb a 1963 postage stamp commemorating reconciliation of political factions in congo after end of katangese secession following end of katanga secession political negotiations began to reconcile disparate political factions negotiations coincided with formation of an emigre political group conseil national de liberation by dissident lumumbists and others in neighbouring congo brazzaville negotiations culminated in creation of a new revised constitution known as luluabourg constitution after city in which it was written to create a compromise balance of power new constitution increased power of presidency ending system of joint consultation between president and prime minister and appeased federalists by increasing number of provinces from six to 21 while increasing their autonomy constitution also changed name of state from republic of congo to democratic republic of congo it was ratified in a constitutional referendum in june 1964 and parliament was dissolved to await new elections kasa vubu appointed tshombe exiled katangese leader as interim prime minister although personally capable and supported as an anti communist by western powers tshombe was denounced by other african leaders such as king hassan ii of morocco as an imperialist puppet for his role in katangese secession under tshombe s interim government fresh elections were scheduled for 30 march and rebellion broke out in central and eastern parts of congo kwilu and simba rebellions period of political crisis had led to widespread disenchantment with central government brought in by independence demands for a second independence from and political infighting in capital grew second independence slogan was taken up by maoist inspired congolese revolutionaries including pierre mulele who had served in lumumba government political instability of congo helped to channel wider discontentment into outright revolt thumb left map showing territory controlled by simba red and kwilu yellow rebels 1964 disruption in rural congo begun with agitation by lumumbists led by mulele among and peoples by end of 1963 there was unrest in regions of central and eastern congo kwilu rebellion broke out on 16 january 1964 in cities of and in kwilu province further disruption and uprisings then spread to kivu in east and later to albertville sparking further insurrection elsewhere in congo and outbreak of larger simba rebellion rebels began to expand their territory and rapidly advance northwards capturing port empain stanleyville and lisala between july and august rebels who called themselves simbas from kiswahili word for lion had a populist but vague ideology loosely based on communism which prioritised equality and aimed to increase overall wealth most of active revolutionaries were young men who hoped that rebellion would provide them with opportunities which government had not simbas used magic to initiate members and believed that by following a moral code they could become invulnerable to bullets magic was also very important to rebels who also made extensive use of witchcraft to protect themselves and also demoralise their anc opponents as they advanced rebels perpetrated numerous massacres in territory they captured in order to remove political opposition and terrorise population onuc was in process of withdrawing when rebellions started and had only 5 500 personnel most whom were deployed in eastern part of country and stranded by conflict straggling western missionaries retreated to their respective embassies which in turn requested un assistance a small force of peacekeepers was assembled and subsequently dispatched to kwilu region to retrieve fleeing missionaries rescue operations continued throughout march and april and resulted in successful recovery of over 100 missionaries rebels founded a state people s republic of congo republique populaire du congo with its capital at stanleyville and christophe gbenye as president new state was supported by soviet union and china which supplied it with arms as did various african states notably tanzania it was also supported by cuba which sent a team of over 100 advisors led by che guevara to advise simbas on tactics and doctrine simba rebellion coincided with a wide escalation of cold war amid gulf of tonkin incident and it has been speculated that had rebellion not been rapidly defeated a full scale american military intervention could have occurred as in vietnam suppression and belgian and american intervention after its early string of successes simba rebellion began to encounter local resistance as it encroached on areas outside of mnc l s old domain people s republic also suffered from a lack of coherent social and economic policy contributing to an inability to administer its own territory from end of august 1964 rebels began to lose ground to anc albertville and lisala were recaptured in late august and early september tshombe backed by mobutu recalled many of his former mercenaries from katangese secession to oppose simba mercenaries led by mad mike hoare and mostly whites from central and southern africa were formed into a unit known as 5 commando anc unit served as spearhead of anc but were known for widespread unsanctioned killing torture looting and mass rapes in recaptured rebel areas in a press interview hoare himself described his men as appalling thugs mercenaries were also materially supported by cia thumb belgian paratroopers on stanleyville airfield shortly after operation in november 1964 simbas rounded up remaining white population of stanleyville and its environs whites were held hostage in victoria hotel in city to use as bargaining tools with anc in order to recover hostages belgian parachute troops were flown to congo in american aircraft to intervene on 24 november as part of operation dragon rouge belgian paratroopers landed in stanleyville and quickly secured hostages in total around 70 hostages and 1 000 congolese civilians were killed but vast majority were evacuated belgian troops were only under orders to liberate hostages rather than push simbas out of city but attack nevertheless broke back of eastern insurrection which never recovered simba leadership went into exile in disarray and severe disagreement gbenye was shot in shoulder by his general after dismissing him meanwhile belgian paratroopers and civilians returned to their country in aftermath of intervention belgium itself was publicly accused of neocolonialism as a result of intervention tshombe lost support of kasa vubu and mobutu and was dismissed from his post as prime minister in october 1965 soon after dragon rouge anc and mercenary troops captured stanleyville putting an end to simba rebellion pockets of simba resistance continued to hold out in eastern congo most notably in south kivu where laurent desire kabila led a maoist cross border insurgency which lasted until 1980s second mobutu coup d etat in scheduled march 1965 elections tshombe s convention nationale congolaise conaco won a large majority of seats but a large part of his party soon defected to form new front democratique congolais fdc making overall result unclear as conaco controlled chamber of deputies while fdc controlled senate kasa vubu attempting to use situation to block tshombe appointed an anti tshombe leader evariste kimba of fdc to be prime minister designate in november 1965 but largely pro tshombe parliament refused to ratify appointment instead of seeking a compromise candidate kasa vubu again unilaterally declared kimba to be prime minister which was again rejected creating a political deadlock with government in near paralysis mobutu seized power in a bloodless coup ostensibly to stop impasse on 25 november 1965 under auspices of a regime d exception equivalent of a state of emergency mobutu assumed sweeping almost absolute power for five years after which he claimed democracy would be restored mobutu s coup which promised both economic and political stability was supported by united states and other western governments and his rule initially met widespread popularity he increasingly took other powers abolishing post of prime minister in 1966 and dissolving parliament in 1967 aftermath and legacy thumb mobutu with richard nixon at white house in 1973 once established as sole source of political power mobutu gradually consolidated his control in congo number of provinces was reduced and their autonomy curtailed resulting in a highly centralised state mobutu increasingly placed his supporters in remaining positions of importance in 1967 to demonstrate his legitimacy he created a party mouvement populaire de la revolution mpr which until 1990 was nation s only legal political party under mobutu s new constitution in 1971 state was renamed zaire and efforts were made to remove all colonial influences he also nationalised remaining foreign owned economic assets in country including umhk which became despite initial successes by time of its disestablishment mobutu s rule was characterised by widespread cronyism corruption and economic mismanagement in years after congo crisis mobutu was able to remove many opposition figures from crisis who might threaten his control tshombe was sent into a second exile in 1965 after being accused of treason between 1966 and 1967 two mutinies in stanleyville broke out involving up to 800 katangese gendarmes and former mercenaries of tshombe mutinies were eventually repressed in 1967 tshombe was sentenced to death in absentia and same year was kidnapped in an aeroplane hijacking and held under arrest in algeria his death in 1969 allegedly from natural causes has provoked speculation that mobutu government may have been involved mulele was also lured back to congo from exile by promise of an amnesty but was tortured and murdered political legacy issues of federalism ethnicity in politics and state centralisation were not resolved by crisis and partly contributed to a decline in support for concept of state among congolese people mobutu was strongly in favour of centralisation and one of his first acts in 1965 were to reunify provinces and abolish much of their independent legislative capacity subsequent loss of faith in central government is one of reasons that congo has been labeled as a failed state and has contributed violence by factions advocating ethnic and localised federalism local insurgencies continued in eastern congo into 1980s and left a legacy of instability along congo s eastern borders laurent desire kabila who had led an anti mobutu insurrection during crisis succeeded in deposing mobutu in 1997 and becoming president of restored democratic republic of congo he was succeeded by his son joseph kabila following fall of mobutu antoine gizenga founded a political party parti unifie and was appointed prime minister following 2006 general election congo crisis holds great significance in collective memory of congolese people in particular lumumba s murder is viewed in context of memory as a symbolic moment in which congo lost its dignity in international realm and ability to determine its future which has since been controlled by west many congolese view problems of crisis as unresolved and believe that congo s self determination has yet to be secured from western machinations latter notion has largely shaped political aspirations of a substantial number of congolese historiography and historical controversy congo crisis is usually portrayed in historiography as a time of intense disorder and disarray there is wide consensus that congolese independence was a calamity this
