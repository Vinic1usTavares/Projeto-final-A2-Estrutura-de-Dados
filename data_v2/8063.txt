reasoning and crime scene investigation game was specifically designed to be different from previous ace attorney titles with a larger focus on environment development team had originally considered using ema skye a character from earlier games in series as lead character but used miles edgeworth instead because of his popularity they aimed to have players be immersed in game and feel like they are edgeworth as opposed to previous ace attorney games where they felt players merely could identify with lead characters to do this they included direct control of edgeworth and a gameplay element that involves connecting his thoughts it was met by generally favorable reviews with a common complaint being that rebuttals at times devolve into trial and error game was one of best selling games of

edgeworth walk around crime scenes in search for evidence they also meet witnesses and suspects during these phases who they can talk to as edgeworth notices various things in crime scene they are saved as edgeworth s thoughts using logic function player can connect two such thoughts to gain new information for instance by connecting two bullet holes with a gun that has only been fired once edgeworth will conclude that two guns must have been at crime scene at some points player is able to control a cursor to examine parts of crime scene by using deduction function at these points player is able to point out a contradiction between crime scene and evidence if player successfully points out a contradiction they gain access to new information at certain points a device called little thief can be used to create hologram reproductions of crime scene by investigating these reproductions player can discover new information that would otherwise be hidden as more evidence is uncovered hologram is updated after having examined an area sufficiently investigation phase ends and game moves on to a rebuttal phase in rebuttal phases a witness or a rival character provides their idea of what has happened player is able to press them for details and can present relevant pieces of evidence that contradict what witness or rival is saying by doing this player gets closer to truth it is through confronting suspects during these phases that player solves cases upon solving a case episode is cleared and a new episode is made available to player if player makes mistakes throughout game such as presenting wrong pieces of evidence attempting to connect two thoughts that do not match up or making incorrect choices a green gauge called truth gauge decreases representing edgeworth getting further from truth if it is completely emptied game ends by clearing an investigation phase half of gauge is restored and by clearing an episode gauge is restored completely synopsis setting

yamazaki and produced by motohide eshiro with character designs by iwamoto and music by noriyuki iwadare and yamada eshiro got idea to make a new game featuring characters from original ace attorney games while working on trials and tribulations according to eshiro game was made for portable play and has an interface that uses touch screen as this could not be replicated on other platforms such as xbox live he said that nintendo ds was platform that was best suited for it and that no ports to other hardware were planned eshiro said that they could have set game in a courtroom similar to that of main series and made a few additions but that it would not have been very interesting instead they moved game to crime scenes and added several new gameplay elements yamazaki was one who came up with idea of making a game about deductive reasoning and crime scene investigation because of this theme it made sense to them to include ace attorney character ema skye in game as she is portrayed as wanting to be a forensic scientist yamazaki originally suggested that ema should be main character but based on fan feedback they decided to use more popular character miles edgeworth instead figuring out how to move game from courtroom to crime scene was a challenge for development team team also thought that it was difficult to make game feel new while also making sure it felt similar to game series because of new gameplay systems that all had to be created from scratch ace attorney investigations took longer to develop than previous ace attorney games had concept of story was that while each case is a standalone episode they are also all interlinked forming a larger mystery with each episode revealing a piece of puzzle because edgeworth is portrayed as a genius prosecutor whereas phoenix wright is a rookie attorney development team felt that they needed to come up with incidents that were larger in scale for ace attorney investigations to match edgeworth s skill level therefore opponents were made more formidable compared to ones in previous games in series eshiro saw story as most important part of game and said that while time consuming it was important to make sure that it works this was accomplished through a lot of trial and error and several rewrites and revisions yamazaki would come up with an idea which was tested to see if players had a hard time understanding it based on feedback from testers yamazaki would rewrite and reorder some parts and add hints when creating game s story development team took into account that some players might not have played any ace attorney games before because of this they tried to make game as accessible as possible and make it playable without first having played any of previous titles for instance first part of game is a tutorial that introduces game and characters they did however add in jokes for players who had played previous ace attorney games kay faraday was first new character that was created for game and was cited by eshiro as one of his favorite characters development team felt that with previous ace attorney games players could identify with phoenix wright and apollo justice for ace attorney investigations they wanted players to be immersed in game and feel like they are edgeworth he said that they think players will feel a connection with edgeworth and understand his character as examples of this eshiro cited ability to directly control edgeworth and possibility to see inside his head game s logic system was created because development team wanted to show how edgeworth thinks it represents what is happening inside his mind which eshiro describes as a very cool calm and collected way of thinking for rebuttal phases in game eshiro wanted to try out new things that could not be done in courtroom battles during rebuttals several characters come in and out during each scene at a rapid pace providing player with evidence to create drama with tension ace attorney investigations has a larger focus on environment than previous ace attorney titles had previous titles featured gameplay elements in which player finds contradictions in suspects statements whereas goal of ace attorney investigations is to find things at crime scene that contradict evidence player has game s third person perspective was specifically chosen to be different from main series first person perspective and to show environment so that players can walk around inside it game system was designed specifically for ace attorney investigations with aim of being different from main series therefore eshiro felt that a lot of its features should stay within investigations series and not be used in other ace attorney titles thumb left eshiro said that capcom would consider developing dsiware episodes if demand was high enough development team put effort into trying to make edgeworth look right eshiro described edgeworth s running animation as graceful while exerting effort while iwamoto was not entirely convinced and thought it looked like he is walking really fast accidentally eshiro and yamazaki wanted to add a lot of features to little thief system but due to time constraints it ended up more simplistic than they had originally envisioned eshiro used his experience with producing action games such as shadow of rome and laying out scenes to get backgrounds to move smoothly without scrolling issues when edgeworth moves programmers faced big technical challenges and had to make significant modifications to game when implementing graphics in game two animated characters whose graphics each are larger than those in previous ace attorney games appear simultaneously and on top of smaller mini avatar graphics eshiro said that he thinks they pushed graphic processing ability of nintendo ds system to its limits for this eshiro said that they would consider making dsiware episodes if demand was high enough but that they did not have any plans at time he said that there were many technical aspects to consider such as memory limitations for dsiware promotion and release game was announced in famitsu in april 2008 a demo of game was made available at tokyo game show 2008 it was also shown at san diego comic con international 2009 and appeared once more at tokyo game show in 2009 game was published by capcom for nintendo ds on may 28 2009 in japan on february 16 2010 in north america on february 18 2010 in australia and on february 19 2010 in europe a limited edition version of game was made available in japan containing a business card holder promotional videos a cd with five tracks from an ace attorney concert performed by tokyo philharmonic orchestra a pamphlet from concert a game box and a copy of game itself a bundle containing an ace attorney investigations themed nintendo dsi and a copy of game was also made available in japan an ios and android version was released worldwide on december 8 2017 soundtrack album kenji original soundtrack was released on june 24 2009 by suleputer localization for game s localization main focus was to keep dialogue natural and accessible to western players while also staying true to japanese version japanese version had several instances of puns or cultural jokes which would not have worked if they had been translated literally there were also places in script where development team would have liked to insert jokes in localization but thought that it may be inappropriate to do so since joke was not in japanese version team found difficulties in getting western version s tone right as they wanted to keep localized text interesting and at same time avoid inconsistencies with original version s tone reception ace attorney investigations was well received by critics game sold 172 000 units in week of its release in japan and 42 000 following week by end of 2009 it was 33rd best selling game of year in japan with 303 445 copies sold on other hand capcom usa s vice president described western sales as poor at best game won an aggie award for best character of 2010 for miles edgeworth and was awarded for best adventure title of 2010 on nintendo ds by nintendo world report following game s appearance at tokyo game show in 2008 it was awarded a japan game award in future category austin boosinger at adventure gamers said that gameplay changes compared to main series were mostly superficial resulting in a game that is similar to but worse than main series neal ronaghan at nintendo world report did on other hand feel that there had been enough changes for game to feel fresh and said that it was possibly best entry in ace attorney series hilary goldstein at ign said that new gameplay elements were strong additions that add variety to game but felt that series was running out of steam steven hopper at gamezone said that game was very similar to previous ace attorney games on good and bad and that ace attorney series was starting to show its age laura parker at gamespot said that game was a successful twist on gameplay of previous games in series and that it lacked none of magic of them boosinger called game too easy and streamlined and found logic system to be too simple he did however feel that finding contradictions in testimonies was fantastic as always while too reliant on trial and error ronaghan said that many solutions in rebuttal phases are binary while it makes sense to present a piece of evidence at several points game accepts only one of them he found controls to be fine but called touch screen based walking controls awkward and imprecise goldstein similarly found problems with multiple pieces of evidence that all could point to same contradiction but where game would only allow a specific one at other times she said that no reasonable solution could be found forcing her to guess john walker at eurogamer also complained about how reasonable solutions sometimes are not accepted hopper said that solving cases isn t intuitive enough and involves a lot of trial and error while some puzzles made sense to him others were frustrating parker called gameplay exciting and said that game has depth and variety but that it is too easy at times boosinger said that while game retains comedy of ace attorney series and has great character writing he found story to be dull slow and too long ronaghan called dialogue funny and said that game was well paced long and enjoyable goldstein called story interesting but said that it at times plays out like a bad soap opera walker appreciated choice to make edgeworth game s lead character and called kay a fantastic addition he found translation of game to be incredible despite a number of spelling mistakes hopper appreciated that game has a new protagonist and setting and called dialogue cheesy but charming on other hand he said that there is a lot of superfluous text in game making cases longer than they need to be parker said that it takes some time to get used to playing as edgeworth saying that he is not as immediately engaging as phoenix and apollo she called story deep and intricate and slow but solid ronaghan called art style and presentation wonderful and said that each character oozes with personality but that animation while better than that in previous titles was limited to only a few frames at a time goldstein called characters colorful but found locations to be uninteresting hopper called game s aesthetic anime esque and clean and said that static images were decent parker liked game s presentation and called environments beautifully drawn
