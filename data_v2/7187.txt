was released on may 29 2012 video is clearly influenced by protests and civil unrest that took place all across country video s final shot bears similarity to an image from visual artist s project wild rolling stone reported that clip for no church in wild depicts a grim clash between a large number of protesters and heavily armed and violent riot police video features neither west jay z or ocean but instead focuses on two groups protestors and police both at war with one another and yes this is war it s an unsettling and savage clip depicting protestors being beaten and pepper sprayed as they mercilessly combat with police though protestors turned rioters also inflict a large part of violence they destroy property loot stores and set fire to cars and humans video refuses to take sides as there s no winner when a conflict turns to violence young men are beaten choked sprayed with mace and dragged across concrete as frank ocean soulfully croons will he make it out alive in time with staged anarchy by end of five minute video freedom fighters seem to have notched a victory of some sort standing in triumph in face of their oppressors but even if a single battle is won there is no conclusive ending meaning that war still rages on popping up at end of clip is an actual elephant chained at neck and trying to resist getting choked to death pitchfork gave clip a positive review however noted kanye s you will not control threesome never fuck nobody without telling me verse seems pretty out of place when you re watching a cop get set on fire video was nominated for best

stylist hannah edwards colorist simon bourne local production unit sofa reception no church in wild received mostly positive reviews from music critics and was often described as a highlight from watch throne andy gill of independent stated best track is surely opener no church in wild whose deep detuned twang groove over a marching organ motif is most striking music on album promising rather more than rest of record is able to deliver both this and other stand out track made in america feature assured vocal refrains from frank ocean while two rappers muse over familiar themes of loyalty sexuality and maternal solidarity rolling stone claimed that it is one of most musically impressive songs on watch throne and described production as an ominous darkly funky bass groove and chilly synths tailor made for ocean s off kilter crooning matt popkin from american songwriter praised jay z s verse and menacing vibe of song now claimed that uncomfortably visceral opener no church in wild with its filthy phil manzanera guitar sample and mournful frank ocean chorus cuts to heart of watch throne s power dynamic however popmatters criticized that verses feel a little out of focus compared to hook and beat s opulence sputnikmusic s tyler fisher commented 88 keys creates a positively epic opening track with no church in wild full of creeping guitar riffs and pulsating bass building tension that simply never releases rolling stone named track sixth best song of year reporting that with hov and yeezy getting deep into arcane theology this track is just another high media usage
