microsoft windows and playstation 4 on same day story and setting team wanted theme of game to resonate with children they initially considered idea of expressing adventure and dreams they later explored concept of a child s greatest influence their mother and possibility of losing them although framework of story was completed prior to studio ghibli s involvement with game they still took part in many discussions regarding some ideas including game s final scenes majority of game takes place in a magical world referred to as other world to avoid making world map feel outdated team modernized design by arranging terrain in fun and fascinating ways game s open world was designed to remind players of a miniature diorama intending to invoke reminiscence to an older time as well as feeling of freshness other segments of game are set in oliver s fictional hometown of motorville town is modelled after an american town in peak of automotive industry during 1950s and 1960s this decision was made due to oliver s interest in cars and machines motorville is geographically based near city of detroit michigan japanese version of town was named hotroit art design level 5 collaborated with studio ghibli to produce game s animated sequences and game features graphics and visuals replicating traditional animation style of studio ghibli films collaboration began when musician naoya fujimaki who had previously worked with both companies introduced level 5 president akihiro hino to studio ghibli president toshio suzuki at time studio ghibli had completed work on ponyo 2008 and animation team had no ongoing projects which influenced suzuki s decision to collaborate with level 5 another influencing factor of collaboration was witnessing hino s passion for project studio ghibli approached production process in same way that they would create an animated film work on animation began in july 2008 and took much longer than predicted three months thumb right studio ghibli s yoshiyuki momose designed storyboards for game s animated sequences incorporating a ghibli like style to game alt a comparison of drawn storyboard and final animated version of a sequence in game player character is driving a vehicle and one of wheels falls off causing him to swerve studio ghibli s yoshiyuki momose served as game s director of animation staging scenes and directing actors during motion capture sessions he was also assigned to drawing character designs and storyboards hino wished game to have a heartwarming feel artwork and character movements was greatly inspired by studio ghibli s work particularly due to their attention to detail as well as their talent in creating storyboards and utilizing camera control development team constantly watched studio ghibli s films during development game director ken motomura regularly worked with studio ghibli swapping and reviewing assets while hino worked with studio in regards to game s dialogue and animated sequences to make studio ghibli s hand drawn cutscenes and game engine s real time cutscenes transition seamlessly level 5 adjusted latter s color tones shadows and character movements for backgrounds team used deep colors unifying them so they would not look like a mass of polygons team found particular difficulty in animating game s cel shaded appearance and spent time researching studio ghibli animation to recreate their traditional animation when designing familiars level 5 accounted for characteristics of their surrounding area which inspired later design some of initial familiar designs were deemed either creepy or overly cute and adapted accordingly to match style of studio ghibli s artwork character development for game s characters team wished to explore concept of opposites mainly represented by white witch s goal to destroy world and oliver s attempts to save it character performances were mostly recorded using motion capture technology followed by manual adjustment by team to make a more anime like movement game s characters were particularly inspired by level 5 s previous work on professor layton series 2007 present during development momose suggested that team design clothes in a modern fashion in order for players to gain a stronger sense that you have stepped out of familiar and into a different world game s main playable character oliver is a 13 year old boy team decided to make him a child as they wished to showcase a coming of age story they wanted children to empathize with oliver s development and adults to relive excitement of their adolescence a major part of story is oliver s personal development which hino describes as process of how a child grows into an adult in regards to oliver s physical appearance momose made his outfit represent a young boy in 1950s america which was inspiration for his hometown for localization of game team decided to give character of drippy a welsh accent citing comedian gilbert as a reference point steffan rhodri was ultimately cast as drippy team immediately felt that he fit role during his first audition fairy godmother character was initially conceived as an older lady with a perm which evolved into concept of a mountain like woman method that she uses to give birth in which offspring burst forth was inspired by process that sea anemones lay eggs character of cassiopeia was conceived in a quick meeting after which background information and story documents were handed to momose who drew character based on information cassiopeia underwent various changes throughout development in particular momose suggested possible alterations to her physical appearance such as size of her head and changing colors to reflect her emotions character pea was named as a reference to fairy tale princess and pea while her japanese name of is a reference to word technical and gameplay development ni no kuni wrath of white witch was developed for playstation 3 team planned to bring game to console from beginning of development but opted to work on ds version of game beforehand due to larger number of ds users in japan at time team found playstation 3 allowed them to render game world with great detail using hardware to its full potential to present animation world and music hino felt that playstation 3 version allowed game s music to accompany imagery which was not possible on ds version team found particular technical difficulty in animating oliver s cape which was overcome by a combination of mathematical calculations and hand drawn motions by programmers and graphic artists respectively team considered utilizing playstation move controller for casting spells in game in a similar fashion to use of touchscreen in ds version though ultimately decided against it as it would limit potential sales battle system was revised over ten times in order to achieve something new and unique for about a year of development battle system used a turn based system though this was ultimately changed when team felt that it was not fun for players team eventually merged turn based combat and action elements popular in japanese and western regions respectively in order to appeal to both regions level 5 worked with localization company shloc to translate game two studios collaborated for many weeks team found great difficulty when localizing game for western regions particularly due to large amounts of text and audio that required translation other minor changes to artwork and animation also occurred such as making oliver bow in a western
