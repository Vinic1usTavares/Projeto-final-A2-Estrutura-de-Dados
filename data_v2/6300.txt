sovetsky soyuz class battleships project 23 soviet union also known as stalin s republics were a class of battleships begun by soviet union in late 1930s but never brought into service they were designed in response to battleships being built by germany only four hulls of fifteen originally planned had been laid down by 1940 when decision was made to cut program to only three ships to divert resources to an expanded army rearmament program these ships would have rivaled imperial japanese and america s planned in size if any had been completed although with significantly weaker firepower nine guns compared to nine guns of japanese ships and a dozen on montanas failure of soviet armor plate industry to build cemented armor plates thicker than would have negated any advantages from sovetsky soyuz class s thicker armor in combat construction of first four ships was plagued with difficulties as soviet shipbuilding and related industries were not prepared to build such large ships one battleship sovetskaya belorussiya was cancelled on 19 october 1940 after serious construction flaws were found construction of other three ships was suspended shortly after nazi germany invaded soviet union in june 1941 and never resumed all three of surviving hulls were scrapped in late 1940s design and development design work began in 1935 on new battleships in response to existing and planned german battleships westwood p 202 and soviets made extensive efforts in italy and united states to purchase either drawings or ships themselves in late 1930s mclaughlin pp 362 72 italian firm of gio ansaldo c proposed a ship of standard displacement with nine 16 inch 406 mm guns in size and appearance similar to then under construction by company ireland p 93 u s firm of gibbs cox provided four designs one for a conventional battleship and three hybrid designs which combined battleship main armament with a raised flight deck on central superstructure capable of operating up to 30 aircraft ireland pp 92 93 p 66 while these projects proved useful to soviets they decided to proceed with their own designs first tactical technical requirement abbreviated in russian as ttz for large battleship design was issued on 21 february 1936 but proved too ambitious specifying nine 460 mm guns and a speed of on a displacement of 55 000 tons aside from ship s specifications themselves type of ton is not specified by mclaughlin ttz was revised in may 1936 by admiral orlov commander of soviet navy reducing speed to and weakening secondary and anti aircraft batteries a few months later admiral orlov further reduced size of battleship to 45 000 tons and set size of main guns at 406 mm shortly afterward soviet union signed anglo soviet quantitative naval agreement of 1937 and agreed to follow terms of second london naval treaty that limited battleships to a displacement of 35 560 metric tons 35 000 long tons although they did add a proviso that allowed them to build ships of unlimited size to face imperial japanese navy if they notified british yet another ttz was approved by orlov on 3 august for ships of 41 500 tons with an armament of nine 406 millimeter twelve twelve and forty guns a maximum armor thickness of and a speed of 30 knots mclaughlin pp 380 82 design of kb 4 surface ship design bureau of baltic shipyard was selected for further development although lead designers were convinced that only a larger ship could fulfill ambitious requirements they did manage to get agreement on 22 november 1936 for a thickening of deck armor that raised displacement to about 47 000 tons design work continued on this basis and technical work was completed for a ship of 47 700 tons in april 1937 but designers continued to press their case for larger ships issue was resolved by premier stalin at a meeting on 4 july when he agreed to increase displacement to about 56 000 tons this forced project to begin again mclaughlin pp 383 84 timing of redesign proved to be inauspicious as great purge was spreading through ranks of military and related industries original deadline for completion of design work by 15 october was missed and an incomplete version was presented to navy s shipbuilding administration next month a number of details remained to be worked out including final design of machinery plant 152 mm guns and 100 mm gun mounts in meantime extensive and expensive testing was conducted on ship s hull form deck armor and torpedo protection 27 million rubles were spent on experimental work in 1938 alone over 100 models of hull were tested in a ship model basin to find best hull form and two one tenth scale launches were built at sevastopol to test hull s maneuverability an old steamship was fitted with a replica of design s armor decks and tested against bombs proving that such ordnance would generally penetrate both upper and middle decks before exploding on armored deck main armor deck was raised one deck in consequence and a splinter deck added underneath it to stop any bomb or shell fragments that might penetrate armor deck underwater protection system was tested on fifteen one fifth scale models and two full sized experimental barges these tests proved that torpedo belt system of multiple bulkheads was superior to pugliese system of a large tube filled with smaller sealed tubes but it was too late to incorporate these test results into design as construction was well underway by time they were completed in late 1939 mclaughlin pp 384 85 a revised design was approved on 28 february 1938 and first ship was to be laid down on 15 july but even this design was incomplete and would be revised later trials with similarly shaped motor launches suggested that hull s propulsive efficiency would be less than planned and this was accepted in november 1938 revision as a maximum speed of however a new propeller design proved to be more efficient and was predicted to increase speed to another change was deletion of centerline rudder when tests showed that two wing rudders would not be able to counteract its effects if it jammed weight toward stern of boat was calculated to be too great producing a substantial stern down trim to remedy this two 100 mm turrets mounted on quarterdeck were deleted and height of armor belt abreast rear turret was lowered but this decision was reversed and they were restored by a decision of state defense committee on 14 january 1941 this forced a revision of aircraft arrangements as aircraft catapult had to be removed from centerline of quarterdeck two catapults were added to sides of quarterdeck instead mclaughlin pp 385 86 389 general characteristics as designed project 23 class ships as sovetsky soyuz and her sisters were designated were long overall they had a beam of and at full load a draft of they displaced at standard load and at full load although weight estimates made in 1940 show that they would have exceeded standard and at full load mclaughlin pp 379 386 thumb right 200px luftwaffe aerial reconnaissance photo of yard shipyard 189 leningrad showing battleship sovetsky soyuz top and cruiser chkalov under construction 26 june 1941 hull form was very full bodied especially at forward magazines where torpedo protection system added width to beam coupled with relatively low length to beam ratio of 7 14 1 this meant that very powerful turbines were necessary to achieve even modest speeds stalin s decision that project 23 class ships would use three shafts instead of four increased load on each shaft and reduced propulsive efficiency although it did shorten length of armored citadel and thus overall displacement metacentric height was designed at and tactical diameter was estimated at about mclaughlin p 388 sovetsky soyuz class ships were provided with aircraft facilities to handle two to four kor 2 flying boats which would be launched by two catapults mounted on stern two hangars were built into after end of forecastle deck to house two of them and cranes were provided at forward end of quarterdeck to hoist them out of water gribovskii p 167 machinery machinery arrangement provided good dispersal of machinery spaces but at cost of very long runs for wing shafts ca turbine compartments for wing shafts were located forward of boiler room no 1 and aft of no 2 turret magazines engine room for center shaft s turbine was between boiler room no 2 and no 3 this meant that wing propeller shafts had to run underneath boilers steam turbines and a license to build them were originally going to be ordered from cammell laird in united kingdom but their ps700 000 cost was more than soviets wanted to pay instead they bought them from brown boveri using technical information acquired from cammell laird in process for ps400 000 four single reduction impulse reduction geared turbines were ordered from swiss firm three to equip sovetskaya rossiya and one to serve as a pattern for factory in kharkov that was to build remainder three produced a total of six triangle type water tube boilers two in each boiler room powered turbines at a working pressure of and a temperature of mclaughlin pp 393 94 maximum speed was estimated at 28 knots using revised propeller design although forcing machinery would yield an extra knot normal fuel oil capacity was giving an estimated endurance of at and at full speed maximum fuel capacity was which gave a range of at 14 5 knots and at full speed mclaughlin p 380 armament thumb 406 mm b 37 gun in mp 10 test mount 1940 main armament consisted of three electrically powered mk 1 triple turrets each with three 50 caliber 406 mm b 37 guns guns could be depressed to 2deg and elevated to 45deg they had a fixed loading angle of 6deg and their rate of fire varied with time required to re aim guns it ranged from 2 0 to 2 6 rounds per minute depending on elevation turrets could elevate at a rate of 6 2 degrees per second and traverse at 4 55 degrees per second 100 rounds per gun were carried guns fired projectiles at a muzzle velocity of this provided a maximum range of secondary armament consisted of twelve 57 caliber b 38 152 mm guns mounted in six dual mk 4 turrets their elevation limits were 5deg to 45deg with a fixed loading angle of 8deg their rate of fire also varied with elevation from 7 5 to 4 8 rounds per minute they were provided with 170 rounds per gun mclaughlin pp 379 389 turrets could elevate at a rate of 13 degrees per second and traverse at 6 degrees per second they had a maximum range of about with a shell at a muzzle velocity of heavy anti aircraft aa fire was provided by a dozen 56 caliber 100 mm b 34 dual purpose guns in six twin mz 14 turrets with 400 rounds per gun ships began construction with only four turrets but two additional turrets were restored to quarterdeck in january 1941 they could elevate to a maximum of 85deg and depress to 8deg they could traverse at a rate of 12deg per second and elevate at 10deg per second they fired high explosive shells at a muzzle velocity of this provided a maximum range of against surface targets but their maximum range against aerial targets was limit of their time fuse light aa defense was handled by ten quadruple water cooled 46 k mounts fitted with 70 k guns with 1800 rounds per gun initially only eight mounts were planned when ships began construction but two more were added later probably in january 1941 one on each side of forward superstructure each mount was fully enclosed to protect crew from muzzle blast of larger guns and against splinters guns fired shells at a muzzle velocity of their effective anti aircraft range was fire control each main gun turret was given a dm 12 rangefinder for use in local control but they were generally controlled by one of three kdp 8 fire control directors these had two stereoscopic rangefinders one to track target and other to measure range to ship s own shell splashes two of these were protected by of armor and were mounted atop rear superstructure and tower mast other was mounted on top of conning tower and was protected by of armor they used a tsas 0 mechanical computer to generate firing solutions four kdp 4t ii directors with two rangefinders each controlled secondary armament one pair was on either side of tower mast and aft pair was on each side of aft funnel three spn 300 stabilized directors each with a 4 meter rangefinder controlled heavy anti aircraft guns there was one on each side of forward funnel while other was atop rear superstructure mclaughlin pp 388 89 protection soviet armor plate plants proved incapable of producing plates of cemented armor thicker than which forced decision to replace cemented plates thicker than with face hardened ones with less resistance in november 1940 plants tended to compensate by making thicker plates harder but this often made them more brittle and large numbers did not pass acceptance tests this would have significantly reduced level of protection enjoyed by sovetsky soyuz class ships in combat mclaughlin pp 387 390 sovetsky soyuz class ships devoted a total weight of to armor protection a slightly greater weight than that of larger japanese yamato class their armor was intended to resist 406 mm shells and 500 kg bombs specifically shells fired from forward bearings between 35deg and 50deg from centerline this led to very unusual situation where armor belt thickened toward bow to compensate for narrowing of ship near forward magazines which had to be compensated for by thicker armor belt was long and covered 57 of total waterline length it was inclined 5deg to increase its resistance to flat trajectory shells over machinery spaces it was thick and increased in steps until it was thick over forward magazines it was over rear magazine belt armor was carried forward of magazines at a thickness of and terminated in a steeply sloped 30deg transverse bulkhead that reduced to at lower deck where it was continued down to inner bottom by a bulkhead forward of this bulkhead was a 20 mm splinter belt that continued all way to bow main armor belt dropped down to main deck from upper deck abreast aft turret to reduce weight this step was protected by plates a transverse bulkhead separated rear turret and ship s sides main part of armored citadel was closed off by a 230 mm forward bulkhead and a rear bulkhead both of homogeneous armor splinter armor thick covered upper portion of citadel mclaughlin pp 190 92 forecastle deck was 25 mm thick while upper deck was over citadel below it 50 mm middle deck acted as a splinter deck upper deck was 100 mm thick above 220 mm waterline belt extension bottom edge of forward splinter belt met with a arched deck another arched deck of same thickness covered stern aft of rear transverse bulkhead mclaughlin pp 392 93 main gun turrets had faces thick with sides and roofs thick thick plates protected gun ports and bulkheads separated each gun barbettes were thick above upper deck mk 4 turrets had 100 mm faces and 65 mm sides their barbettes were 100 mm in thickness but reduced to 65 mm on their inboard sides 100 mm of armor protected faces sides and backs of mz 14 turrets for 100 mm guns but their roofs and barbettes were 100 mm thick forward conning tower had walls 425 mm thick while rear conning tower had only flag bridge in tower mast had of protection torpedo defense system was designed to withstand torpedoes with warheads equivalent to of tnt ships were intended to be able to remain afloat with any five adjacent compartments flooded or with three torpedo hits and destruction of unarmored above water side pugliese system protected of ships midsection at aft end was a multi bulkhead protection system that extended another to rear from pugliese system depth of system was amidships but it reduced to fore and aft outer plating ranged from in thickness while inner bottom was thick cylinder of pugliese system was also 7 mm thick while semi circular main bulkhead was thick with a flat bulkhead behind it diameter cylinder was intended to be immersed in fuel oil or water mclaughlin p 393 construction august 1938 shipbuilding plan envisioned a total of 15 project 23 class battleships and this grandiose scheme was only slightly revised downward to 14 ships in august 1939 plan eight of these were to be laid down before 1942 and remaining six before 1947 however only four were actually laid down before outbreak of world war ii forced soviets to reassess their ambitious plans on 19 october 1940 an order was issued signed by stalin and molotov that no new battleships would be laid down in order to concentrate on smaller ships building and also probably because more resources were required for army one ship is to be scrapped and priority should be given to only one of three remaining battleships rohwer and monakov pp 95 120 soviet shipbuilding and related industries proved to be incapable of supporting construction of so many large ships at same time largest warships built in soviet union prior to 1938 were s and even they had suffered from a number of production problems but soviet leadership appeared to ignore difficulties encountered in construction of kirov class when ordering 14 much more ambitious ships construction of two more ships planned for leningrad and nikolayev had to move to brand new shipyard nr 402 in molotovsk because existing shipyards could not be expanded to handle so many large ships components for these two ships had to be manufactured at leningrad and shipped via white sea baltic canal to molotovsk also turret shop at nikolaev proved to be too poorly equipped to assemble 406 mm mountings and propeller shafts had to be ordered in 1940 from germany and netherlands as domestic plants were already overburdened with orders shipbuilding steel proved to be in short supply in 1940 and a number of batches were rejected because they did not meet specifications armor plate production was even more problematic as only of anticipated were delivered in 1939 and more than half of that was rejected furthermore armor plants proved to be incapable of making cemented plates over 230 mm and inferior face hardened plates had to substitute for all thicknesses over 200 mm mclaughlin pp 386 87 machinery problems were likely to delay ships well past their intended delivery dates of 1943 1944 three turbines were delivered by brown boveri in 1939 to arkhangelsk for sovetskaya rossiya but turbogenerator works never completed a single turbine before german invasion in june 1941 a prototype boiler was supposed to have been built ashore for evaluation but it was not completed until early 1941 which further complicated production plan mclaughlin p 387 construction of all three ships was ordered halted on 10 july 1941 and sovetsky soyuz was placed into long term conservation as most advanced ship however all three were officially stricken from navy list on 10 september 1941 sovetsky soyuz thumb right german reconnaissance picture of sovetsky soyuz taken in june 1942 sovetsky soyuz soviet union was formally laid down 15 july 1938 in shipyard nr 189 ordzhonikidze in leningrad although evidence suggests that construction actually began in january 1939 after her slipway was completed necessary cranes were in place and working drawings had been completed gribovskii p 166 when war began she was estimated to be 21 19 complete with of steel assembled on slip she was only lightly damaged by german air attacks and bombardments and as some material had been used during siege of leningrad she was estimated to be 19 5 complete after end of war some thought was given to completing her but this was opposed as she was regarded as obsolete in light of experience gained during war stalin s expressed desire to see one of project 23 class ships completed only delayed decision to scrap her this was ordered on 29 may 1948 and was well underway by april 1949 mclaughlin pp 411 13 sovetskaya ukraina sovetskaya ukraina soviet ukraine was laid down 31 october 1938 at shipyard nr 198 marti south in nikolayev when war began she was 17 98 complete with assembled on slipway some effort was made to launch hull but little work had been done to dredge river at foot of slipway and she was captured on 18 august 1941 although retreating soviet troops slightly damaged her hull germans dismantled of her bow and of her stern for use in fortifications they were forced to evacuate nikolayev on 17 march 1944 and demolished supporting blocks under her port side before they left which gave her a list between 5 and 10 degrees and made her a total loss she was ordered scrapped on 27 march 1947 mclaughlin pp 379 411 413 sovetskaya rossiya sovetskaya rossiya soviet russia was laid down on 22 july 1940 in shipyard nr 402 in molotovsk after end of war she was only 0 97 complete with of steel assembled she was ordered scrapped on 27 march 1947 sovetskaya belorussiya sovetskaya belorussiya soviet belorussia was laid down 21 december 1939 at shipyard nr 402 in molotovsk but construction was suspended in mid 1940 when it was discovered that 70 000 rivets used in her hull plating were of inferior quality this fact probably influenced decision to cancel her on 19 october 1940 mclaughlin pp 379 387 material intended for her construction was
