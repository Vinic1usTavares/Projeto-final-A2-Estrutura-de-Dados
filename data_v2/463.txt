thumb 250px example of a bottleneck slide with and a resonator guitar made of metal slide guitar is a particular technique for playing guitar that is often used in blues style music technique involves placing an object against strings while playing to create glissando effects and deep vibratos it typically involves playing guitar in traditional position flat against body with use of a tubular slide fitted on one of guitarist s fingers slide may be a metal or glass tube such as neck of a bottle term bottleneck was historically used to describe this type of playing strings are typically plucked while slide is moved over strings to change pitch guitar may also be placed on player s lap and played with a hand held bar and is then referred to as lap slide guitar or lap steel guitar creating music with a slide of some type has been traced back to primitive stringed instruments in african culture and also to origin of steel guitar in hawaii near beginning of twentieth century blues musicians in mississippi delta popularized bottleneck slide guitar style and first recording of slide guitar was by sylvester weaver in 1923 since 1930s performers including robert nighthawk earl hooker elmore james and muddy waters popularized slide guitar in electric blues genre and influenced later slide guitarists in rock genre including rolling stones duane allman and ry cooder lap slide guitar pioneers include oscar buddy woods black ace turner and freddie roulette history technique of using a hard object against a plucked string goes back to diddley bow derived from a one stringed african instrument diddley bow is believed to be one of ancestors of bottleneck style when sailors from europe introduced spanish guitar to hawaii in latter nineteenth century hawaiians slackened some of strings from standard tuning to make a became known as slack key guitar today referred to as an open tuning with slack key hawaiians found it easy to play a three chord song by moving a piece of metal along fretboard and began to play instrument across lap near end of nineteenth century a hawaiian named joseph kekuku became proficient in playing this way using a steel bar against guitar strings bar was called steel and was source of name steel guitar kekuku popularized method and some sources claim he originated technique he moved to united states mainland and became a vaudeville performer later performing in europe for several years in first half of twentieth century this so called hawaiian guitar style of playing spread to us sol hoopii was an influential hawaiian guitarist who in 1919 at age 17 came to us mainland from hawaii as a stow away on a ship heading for san francisco hoopii s playing became popular in late 1920s and he recorded songs like hula blues and farewell blues according to author pete madsen hoopii s playing would influence a legion of players from rural mississippi most players of blues slide guitar were from southern us particularly mississippi delta and their music was likely from an african origin handed down to african american sharecroppers who sang as they toiled in fields earliest delta blues musicians were largely solo singer guitarists w c handy commented on first time he heard slide guitar in 1903 when a blues player performed in a local train station as he played he pressed a knife on strings of guitar in a manner popularised by hawaiian guitarists who used steel bars effect was unforgettable blues historian gerard herzhaft notes that tampa red was one of first black musicians inspired by hawaiian guitarists of beginning of century and he managed to adapt their sound to blues tampa red as well as kokomo arnold casey bill weldon and oscar woods adopted hawaiian mode of playing longer melodies with slide instead of playing short riffs as they had done previously in early twentieth century steel guitar playing divided into two streams bottleneck style performed on a traditional spanish guitar held flat against body and lap style performed on an instrument specifically designed or modified for purpose of being played on performer s lap bottleneck style was typically associated with blues music and was popularized by african american blues artists mississippi delta was home of robert johnson son house charlie patton and other blues pioneers who prominently used slide first known recording of bottleneck style was in 1923 by sylvester weaver who recorded two instrumentals guitar blues and guitar rag guitarist and author woody mann identifies tampa red and blind willie johnson as developing most distinctive styles in recorded of time he adds influential early electric slide guitarists when guitar was electrified in 1930s it allowed solos on instrument to be more audible and thus more prominently featured in 1940s players like robert nighthawk and earl hooker popularized electric slide guitar but unlike their predecessors they used standard tuning this allowed them switch between slide and fretted guitar playing readily which was an advantage in rhythm accompaniment robert nighthawk robert nighthawk born robert lee mccollum recorded extensively in 1930s as robert lee mccoy with such as john lee sonny boy williamson also known as sonny boy williamson i he performed on acoustic guitar in a style influenced by tampa red sometime around world war ii after changing his last name to nighthawk from title of one of his songs he became an early proponent of electric slide guitar and adopted a metal slide nighthawk s sound was extremely clean and smooth with a very light touch of slide against strings he helped popularize tampa red s black angel blues later called sweet little angel crying won t help you and anna lou blues as anna lee in his electric slide style songs which later became part of repertoire of earl hooker b b king and others his style influenced both muddy waters and hooker nighthawk is credited as one who helped bring music from mississippi into chicago blues style of electric blues earl hooker as a teenager earl hooker a cousin of john lee hooker sought out nighthawk as his teacher and in late 1940s two toured south extensively nighthawk had a lasting impact on hooker s playing however by time of his 1953 recording of sweet angel a tribute of sorts to nighthawk s sweet little angel hooker had developed an advanced style of his own his solos had a resemblance to human singing voice and music writer andy grigg commented he had uncanny ability to make his guitar weep moan and talk just like a person his slide playing was peerless even exceeding his mentor robert nighthawk vocal approach is heard in hooker s instrumental blue guitar which was later overdubbed with a unison vocal by muddy waters and became you shook me unusual for a blues player hooker explored using a wah wah pedal in 1960s to further emulate human voice elmore james possibly most influential electric blues slide guitarist of his era was elmore james who gained prominence with his 1951 song dust my broom a remake of robert johnson s 1936 song i believe i ll dust my broom it features james playing a series of triplets throughout song which rolling stone magazine called one immortal lick and is heard in many blues songs to this day although johnson had used figure on several songs james overdriven electric sound made it more insistent firing out a machine gun triplet beat that would become a defining sound of early rockers writes historian ted gioia unlike nighthawk and hooker james used a full chord glissando effect with an open e tuning and a bottleneck other popular songs by james such as it hurts me too first recorded by tampa red sky is crying shake your moneymaker feature his slide playing muddy waters although muddy waters made his earliest recordings using an acoustic slide guitar as a guitarist he was best known for his electric slide playing born mckinley muddy waters helped bring delta blues to chicago and was instrumental in defining city s electric blues style he was also one of pioneers of electric slide guitar beginning with i can t be satisfied 1948 many of his hit songs featured slide including rollin and tumblin rollin stone whose name was adopted by well known rock band and magazine louisiana blues and still a fool waters used an open g tuning for several of his earlier songs but later switched to a standard tuning and often used a capo to change keys he usually played single notes with a small metal slide on his little finger and dampened strings combined with varying volume to control amount of distortion according to writer ted one last factor to consider is slide vibrato that is achieved by shaking a slide back and forth muddy s slide vibrato was insane both manic and controlled that added to excitement of his playing early developments in rock music rock musicians began exploring electric slide guitar in early 1960s in uk groups like rolling stones who were fans of chicago blues and chess records artists in particular began recording songs by muddy waters howlin wolf and others stones second single i wanna be your man 1963 featured a slide guitar break by brian jones which may be first appearance of a slide on a rock record critic richie unterberger commented particularly outstanding was brian jones s slide guitar whose wailing howl gave tune a raunchy missing in beatles more straightforward rock n roll arrangement jones also played slide on their 1964 single little red rooster which reached number one on british charts one of his last contributions to a stones recording was his acoustic guitar slide playing on no expectations which biographer paul trynka describes as subtle totally without bombast or overemphasis perfect embodiment of journey he d embarked on in 1961 in chicago mike bloomfield frequented blues clubs as early as late early 1960s muddy waters and harmonica virtuoso little walter encouraged him and occasionally allowed him to sit in on jam sessions waters recalled mike was a great guitar player he learned a lot of slide from me plus i guess he picked up a little lick or two from me but he learned how to play a lot of slide and pick a lot of guitar bloomfield s slide playing attracted paul butterfield and together with guitarist elvin bishop they formed classic lineup of paul butterfield blues band their first album paul butterfield blues band 1965 features bloomfield s guitar work and his slide playing on band s adaptation of elmore james shake your moneymaker and shows his well developed slide style around same time he recorded with

of sonny boy williamson ii most clearly in allman brothers rendition of williamson s one way out recorded live at fillmore east and heard on their album eat a peach technique slide guitar according to music educator keith wyatt can be thought of as a one finger fretless guitar placement of a slide on a string determines pitch functioning in manner of a finger pressed against fretboard slide is pressed lightly against strings to avoid hitting against frets and is kept parallel with them frets are used only as a visual reference and playing in tune without them requires additional skill in this playing technique player s remaining fingers and thumb still have access to frets and may be used for playing rhythmic accompaniment or reaching additional notes guitar itself may be tuned in traditional tuning or an open tuning most early blues players used open tunings but most modern slide players use both major limitation of open tuning is that usually only one chord shape is easily available and is dictated by how guitar is originally tuned two note intervals can be played by slanting slide on certain notes in sixteenth century notes of a d g b e were adopted as a tuning for guitar like instruments and low e was added later to make e a d g b e as standard guitar tuning in open tuning strings are tuned to sound a chord when not fretted and is most often major open tunings commonly used with slide guitar include open d or tuning d a d f a d and open g or spanish tuning d g d g b d open e and open a formed by raising each of those tunings a whole tone are also common other tunings are also used in particular drop d tuning low e string tuned down to d is used by many slide players this tuning allows for power chords which contain root fifth and eighth octave notes in bass strings and conventional tuning for rest of strings robert johnson whose playing has been cited by clapton richards hendrix and winter as being a powerful influence on them used tunings of standard open g open d and drop d resonator guitars national string instrument corporation produced first metal body resonator guitars in late 1920s see image at beginning of article popular with early slide players these featured a large aluminum cone resembling an inverted loudspeaker attached under instrument s bridge to increase its volume it was patented in late 1920s by brothers and became widely used on many types of guitars and was adapted to mandolin and ukulele tampa red played a gold plated national style 4 and was of first black musicians to record with it delta blues

guitar thumb 250px wooden resonator guitar played with a steel angled to form a chord unavailable from straight open tuning lap slide guitar does not refer a specific instrument rather a style of playing guitar with instrument resting on performer s lap or otherwise supported and term usually indicates blues or rock music horizontal position is also known as hawaiian style there are various instruments specifically made or adapted to play in table top position including a traditional guitar which has been adapted for lap slide playing by raising bridge and or nut to make strings higher off fretboard steel guitars including lap steel console steel and pedal steel in which a solid metal bar typically referred to as a steel is pressed against strings and is source of name steel guitar a national or dobro type guitar which resembles a traditional guitar but with a thicker sometimes square reinforced neck proper terminology for hand held bar used is steel or tone bar rather than slide term lap slide coexists with lap steel to describe same lap played instrument but lap slide usually connotes blues or rock music while lap steel could encompass any musical genre that said not even manufacturers and players of many variants of these instruments agree on basic terminology these types of instruments may differ markedly in external resemble a traditional guitar while others

gerard herzhaft stated black ace is one of few blues guitarists to have played in purest hawaiian style that is with guitar flat on knees turner played a square neck national style 2 tri cone metal body guitar and used a glass medicine bottle as a slide turner was also a good storyteller which enabled him to host a radio program in fort worth called black ace his career effectively ended when he entered military service in 1943 his album i am boss card in your hand contained turner s original 1930s recordings as well as new songs recorded in 1960 turner was featured in a 1962 documentary film entitled blues freddie roulette born frederick martin roulette is a san francisco based lap steel blues artist who became interested in lap steel guitar at an early age and became proficient enough to play in chicago blues clubs with prominent players he earned a spot in earl hooker s band and recorded with hooker in 1960s roulette had played lap steel in other genres before focusing on said this helped him add more complex chords to basic blues played by hooker and said it worked roulette was recruited to san francisco in mid 1970s by blues hall of famer charlie musselwhite in 1997 he recorded a solo album back in chicago jammin with willie kent and gents which won best blues album of 1997 by living blues magazine roulette s contribution to lap slide guitar was to prove that a lap played instrument was capable of holding its own in chicago blues style slides and steels a slide used around a player s finger can be made with any type of smooth hard material that allows tones to resonate different materials cause subtle differences in sustain timbre and loudness glass or metal are most common choices longer slides are used to bridge across all six guitar strings at once but take away fretting ability of that finger entirely a shorter slide allows fingertip to protrude from slide and allow that finger to be used to fret improvised slides are common including pipes rings knives spoons and glass bottle necks early blues players sometimes used a knife such as blind willie johnson pocket or penknife and davis duane allman used a glass medicine bottle pink floyd founder syd barrett was fond of using a zippo lighter as a slide but this was largely for special effects jimi hendrix also used a cigarette lighter for part of his solo on all along watchtower it is one of few recordings with hendrix on slide and biographer harry shapiro notes he performed it with guitar on his lap for guitars designed to be played on lap performer uses a solid piece of steel rather than a hollow tube choice of shape and size is a matter of personal preference most common steel is a solid metal cylinder with one end rounded into a dome shape some lap slide guitar players choose a steel with a deep indentation or groove on each side so it can be held firmly and may have squared off ends better grip may facilitate playing rapid vibratos in blues music this design facilitates
