jackie and they join others on cable junction to await rescue cast production development and writing universal wanted a sequel to jaws early into success of original film producers brown and zanuck realized that someone else would produce film if they did not and preferred to be in charge of project themselves in october 1975 steven spielberg told san francisco film festival that making a sequel to anything is just a cheap carny trick and that he did not even respond to producers when they asked him to direct jaws 2 he claimed that planned plot was to involve sons of quint and brody hunting a new shark brown said that spielberg did not want to direct sequel because he felt that he had done definitive shark movie director later added that his decision was influenced by problems jaws production faced i would have done sequel if i hadn t had such a horrible time at sea on first film despite spielberg s rejection studio went ahead with plans to make sequel leading to an arduous 18 month pre production process howard sackler who had contributed to first film s script but chose not to be credited was charged with writing first draft he originally proposed a prequel based on sinking of uss indianapolis story relayed by quint in first film although universal president sidney sheinberg thought sackler s treatment for film was intriguing he rejected idea on sackler s recommendation theatre and film director john d hancock was chosen to helm picture sackler later felt betrayed when dorothy tristan hancock s wife was invited to rewrite his script film under hancock s direction and tristan s writing had originally a different tone and premise than what would eventually be seen in final film two had envisioned amity as a sort of ghost town when film opened with several businesses shuttered and island s overall economy in ruins due to events seen in first film new resort and condos built on island by developer len peterson were to help celebrate its rebirth giving island s economy a much needed boost tristan had borrowed a subplot from original jaws novel and from a discarded early draft of first film in which amity officials were in debt to mafia both mayor vaughn and len peterson were anxious for new island resort to be a success not only to revive amity but to pay back loans from mob that helped build it thus leading to vaughn s and peterson s ignoring of brody s warning tristan and hancock felt this treatment would lead to more character development that would make overall story that much more believable hancock began filming in june 1977 however after nearly a month of filming universal and mca executives disliked dark subtle tone that film was taking and wanted a more lighthearted and action oriented story additionally hancock ran into trouble with sheinberg who suggested to hancock and tristan that his sheinberg s wife actress lorraine gary ellen brody should go out on a boat and help to rescue kids when told of idea zanuck replied over my dead body next draft of film s screenplay was turned in with gary not going out to sea hancock says that this and his later firing of another actress who turned out to be a universal executive s girlfriend contributed to his own dismissal from film hancock began to feel pressure of directing his first epic adventure film with only three film credits and all small scale dramas producers were unhappy with his material and on a saturday evening in june 1977 after a meeting with producers and universal executives director was fired he and his wife left for rome and production was shut down for a few weeks couple had been involved in film for eighteen months hancock blamed his departure on mechanical shark telling a newspaper that it still could not swim or bite after a year and a half you get a couple of shots and shark breaks echoing first film s production carl gottlieb was enlisted to further revise script adding humor and reducing some of violence gottlieb wrote on location at fort walton beach florida it cost producers more money to hire gottlieb to do rewrite than it would have if they had hired him in first place at this point spielberg considered returning to direct sequel over bicentennial weekend in 1976 spielberg had hammered out a screenplay based on quint s indianapolis speech because of his contract for close encounters of third kind however he would not be able to work on film for a further year a gap too long for producers production designer joe alves who would direct jaws 3 d and verna fields who had been promoted to vice president at universal after her acclaimed editing on first film proposed that they co direct it request was declined by directors guild of america partly because they would not allow a dga member to be replaced by someone who was not one of its members and partly because they in wake of events on set of outlaw josey wales had instituted a ban on any cast or crew members taking over as director during a film s production reins were eventually handed to jeannot szwarc best known for film bug and whom alves knew from working on tv series night gallery szwarc recommenced production by filming complicated water skier scene giving gottlieb some time to complete script he reinstated character of deputy hendricks played by jeffrey kramer who had been missing from earlier script many of teenagers were sacked with remaining roles developed jaws 2 a portrait by actor keith gordon jaws 2 dvd written directed and produced by laurent bouzereau three sharks were built for film first was platform shark also referred to as luxurious shark special mechanical effects supervisor robert mattey and roy arbogast used same body mould used for shark in first film sharks from original film had rotted behind sheds on lower lot of universal studios in intervening years and only pieces that were salvageable were tube frames mattey s design was much more complicated and ambitious than first film same male body was used but a brand new head was made by sculptor chris mueller which made use of an all new mouth mechanism one which incorporated jowls to disguise pinching of cheeks that had proven to be a problem with shark in original film sharks for jaws 2 were known as bruce two sharks for original film had been nicknamed bruce after steven spielberg s lawyer but on set they were referred to as fidel and harold latter after david brown s beverly hills lawyer other shark props used were a fin and a full shark both of which could be pulled by boats cable junction island shown in film s climax was actually a floating barge covered with fiber glass rocks this was created in order to enable shark platform to be positioned to it as close as possible a real island would have hindered this due to upward slope of seabed making shark platform visible like first film footage of real sharks filmed by australian divers ron valerie taylor was used for movement shots that could not be convincingly achieved using mechanical sharks although first film was commended for leaving shark to imagination until two thirds of way through szwarc felt that they should show it as much as possible because dramatic first image of it coming out of water in first film could never be repeated szwarc believed that reduction of first film s hitchcockian suspense was inevitable because audience already knew what shark looked like from first film reviewers have since commented that there was no way that they were ever going to duplicate original s effectiveness filmmakers gave new shark a more menacing look by scarring it in early boat explosion like first film shooting on water proved challenging scheider said that they were always contending with tides surf and winds jellyfish sharks waterspouts and hurricane warnings after spending hours anchoring sailboats wind would change as they were ready to shoot blowing sails in wrong direction saltwater s corrosive effect damaged some equipment including metal parts in sharks susan ford daughter of u s president gerald ford was hired to shoot publicity photographs many of these appeared in ray loynd s jaws 2 log a book documenting film s production similar to what carl gottlieb had done for first film location martha s vineyard was again used as location for town scenes and emerald coast was included on this film although some residents guarded their privacy many islanders welcomed money that company was bringing shortly after production arrived in june 1977 local newspaper grapevine wrote many residents enjoyed being cast as extras some people however were less pleased by film crew s presence and refused to cooperate only one drugstore allowed its windows to be boarded up for moody look that hancock wanted universal go home t shirts began appearing on streets in mid june 1977 thumb right majority of filming was at navarre beach in florida when szwarc took over majority of film was shot at navarre beach in florida because of warm weather and water s depth being appropriate for shark platform company was at this location from august 1 until december 22 1977 production was a boost to local economy because local boaters extras and stand ins or doubles were hired universal brought in actors directors producers and their wives camera and crew people who needed housing food and clothing for movie services were needed for laundry dry cleaning and recreation navarre s holiday inn was used as film s headquarters with ground floor converted into production offices and some of gulf front suites remodelled for david brown and roy scheider universal rented 100 of hotel s 200 rooms spending 1 million holiday inn was destroyed in 2004 atlantic hurricane season boats and parts for their maintenance were purchased from local businesses one proprietor said that he sold universal approximately 400 000 worth of boats and equipment on one occasion cable junction island set which was built on a barge broke loose from its anchorage and had to be rescued szwarc was contacted one night and told that his island was drifting towards cuba real hammerhead sharks circled teen actors during filming of one shot because characters they were playing were meant to be in distress crew filming from a distance did not realize that actors were genuinely calling for help gilpin marc interviewed for shark is still working documentary retrieved 7 january 2007 interior shots of teen hang out where they play pinball were filmed in original location of hog s breath saloon on okaloosa island this restaurant later relocated to destin florida as its original building was susceptible to hurricane damage production company had to seek dredge and fill permits from florida s department of environmental regulation to sink revised platform that controlled shark on sea bottom principal photography ended three days before christmas 1977 on choctawhatchee bay near destin florida actors had to put ice cubes in their mouths to prevent their breath showing on camera final sequence to be filmed was shark being electrocuted on cable in mid january crew reconvened in hollywood with some of teenage actors for five weeks of post production photography jaws 2 cost 30 million to produce over three times more than original david brown says that they did not budget film because universal would never have given a green light to a 30 million budget in those days marine division head for universal on location philip kingry says that it cost approximately 80 000 per day to make that movie when kingry asked brown what his budget was producer responded we re not wasteful but we re spending profit from jaws and it will take what it takes casting roy scheider reluctantly returned to reprise his role as martin brody in 1977 he had quit role of michael vronsky in deer hunter two weeks before start of filming because of creative differences scheider was contracted to universal at time for a three picture deal but studio offered to forgive his failure to fulfill his contractual obligation if he agreed to appear in jaws 2 actor heavily resisted film claiming that there was nothing new to create and that people would be watching film to see shark not him according to his biographer scheider was so desperate to be relieved from role that he pleaded insanity and went crazy in beverly hills hotel however he was given an attractive financial package for appearing in jaws 2 he quadrupled his base salary from first film and negotiated points a percentage of film s net profits star newspaper reported that scheider received 500 000 for 12 weeks work plus 35 000 for each additional week that schedule ran over despite his reluctance scheider pledged to do best job that he could wanting to make brody believable however atmosphere was tense on set and he often argued with szwarc on one occasion scheider complained in front of extras that szwarc was wasting time with technical issues and extras while ignoring principal actors a meeting was called with two david brown and verna fields in which scheider and szwarc were encouraged to settle their differences discussion became heated and a physical fight broke out which brown and fields broke up rift was also articulated in written correspondence in a letter to szwarc scheider wrote that working with jeannot szwarc is knowing he will never say he is sorry or ever admitting he overlooked something well enough of that shit for me he requested an apology from director for not consulting him szwarc s reply focused upon completing film to best possible standard many extras were recruited from gulf breeze high school students were paid 3 per hour well above minimum wage at time 2 65 hr and revelled in being able to miss classes casting director shari rhodes requested members of gulf breeze band perform as amity high school band seen in an early scene in film showing opening of holiday inn amity shores amity scholarship fund benefit gbhs band consisted of approximately 100 members and band director john henley chose 28 student musicians including band s section known as henley s universal scheduled their involvement for mid afternoons to prevent them missing too much time in school universal made a contribution of 3 500 to school and band for their part in film several other gbhs students were hired as stand ins or doubles for teenage actors to appear in water scenes and to maintain and sail boats richard dreyfuss who played matt hooper in jaws said he chose not to return in jaws 2 due to spielberg not directing it music soundtrack john williams returned to score jaws 2 after winning an academy award for best original score for his work on first film williams says that it was assumed by everyone that music would come back also and be part of cast it would require new music certainly but signature music of jaws should be used as well he compares this to great tradition for repeating musical themes in hollywood serials such as roy rogers and lone ranger in addition to familiar themes szwarc says williams also composed a youthful counterpoint to shark that is always around when kids are sailing or going out to sea it was very inventive music of jaws 2 jaws 2 dvd written directed and produced by laurent bouzereau szwarc said that sequel s music should be more complex because it was a more complex film williams says that this score is broader allowing him to make more use of orchestra and use longer notes and fill space created by director williams used a larger ensemble than for first film and orchestral palette may have been broader or had longer notes delays in shooting meant that williams was forced to start working on score before film was completed szwarc discussed film with composer showing him edited sequences and storyboards director praises williams in being able to work under such difficult conditions critic mike beek suggests these time constraints enabled williams to create themes based on ideas and suggestions rather than a locked down print critics have praised williams score comparing it favorably to original williams uses a few basic elements of original obligatory shark motif for one and takes music off in some new and interesting directions score is more disturbing in places than original and williams some new and hugely memorable out to sea adventure music because jaws 2 isn t a film that requires subtlety williams pulls out all stops to make it as exciting and hair raising as possible according to liner notes on soundtrack album williams sense of dramatic coupled with his exquisite musical taste and knowledge of orchestra definitely stamp this score as truly one of his best it is brilliantly performed by a mini symphony made up of finest instrumentalists to be found anywhere john fadden mike beek makes positive comments about film saying that music certainly elevates it to a level it would otherwise never have achieved in 2015 intrada records issued a two disc edition with williams complete score in chronological order on first disc and original 1978 soundtrack album on second

production marvel comics published a comic book adaptation of film by writer rick marschall and artists gene colan and tom palmer in marvel super special 6 also based on earlier script marvel super special 6 at grand comics database critical reception film throughout years has received mixed reviews though it is widely regarded as best of jaws sequels critic john kenneth muir comments that opinions towards jaws 2 depend upon which side of series it is being compared against spielberg s original it is an inferior sequel to a classic but comparison with subsequent films jaws 3 d and jaws revenge shows szwarc s film to be a decent sequel and one produced before franchise hit troubled waters jaws 2 he says is at deep end of pool better than its two shallow follow ups and there is enough of jaws lingering greatness floating about to make it an entertaining and exciting two hours review aggregator website rotten tomatoes reports an approval rating of 60 based on 30 reviews with an average rating of 5 39 10 site s critics consensus reads jaws 2 never approaches lingering thrills of its classic predecessor but it s reasonably entertaining for a sequel that has no reason to exist dvd authority says after this one other jaws movies seemed to just not be as good one review says it s obviously not a patch on spielberg s classic but it s about as good as could be hoped for with some excellent sequences almost worthy of original several genuine shocks a different enough story and some pretty decent characters performances of scheider gary and hamilton have been particularly praised among contemporary reviews roger ebert described film as pure trash gene siskel gave it two and a half stars out of four in his print review writing that film is worth watching only when its leading player is on camera and that when teenage characters were not being attacked jaws 2 offers teenage action even less inspired than beach blanket bingo siskel gene june 16 1978 jaws 2 just too shallow for its own deep water terror chicago tribune section 3 p 2 vincent canby of new york times wrote some of action sequences have been well staged but they ve been dropped into film so indiscriminately that jaws 2 never builds to a particular climax it simply drones on and on like a television movie someone also made a mistake in showing us so much of mechanical shark so early in film canby vincent june 16 1978 film another snap of jaws great white redux new york times c10 charles champlin of los angeles times stated maybe because familiarity breeds indifference more you see of shark this time more it seems to have wandered away from universal studios tour manmade and mechanical champlin charles june 16 1978 jaws 2nd time around los angeles times part iv p 1 tom of monthly film bulletin wrote less a sequel than a remake jaws 2 is a tiresomely foregone conclusion to anyone who has seen spielberg s film even worse since events of first film are acknowledged in this one refusal of mayor and council to act on brody s warning a second time round makes them appear idiotic to a degree that effectively sabotages any halfway serious dramatic interest george morris for texas monthly preferred jaws 2 over original because it is less insidious in its methods of manipulation and because director jeannot szwarc streamlines terror by crosscutting among teenagers scheider and officials efforts to rescue them szwarc works up enough suspense to keep adrenaline going however morris review is not entirely complimentary he would have preferred shark to have been seen less positing producers and audiences alike seem to have forgotten that greatest suspense derives from unseen and unknown and that imagination is capable of conceiving far worse than materialization of a mere mechanical monster similarly john simon felt that shark s waning is caused by a decline in direction jeannot szwarc has none of steven spielberg s manipulative cleverness for one thing he allows us close and disarming close ups of shark almost immediately simon praises scheider and hamilton but is less complimentary about gary a reviewer for bbc complained that additional screen time awarded to shark makes it seems far less terrifying than its almost mystical contemporary radio times was not pleased with jaws 2 calling it a pale imitation of classic original and stating that suspense comes unglued because film floats in all too familiar waters you just know how everyone is going to react from stars to director and even mechanical shark although many critics identify some flaws often comparing szwarc negatively to spielberg they say that this sequel does have some redeeming qualities going for it that make it a good movie in its own right richard dreyfuss and robert shaw are missed especially since teenage characters are labeled largely annoying afterschool special archetypes who are irritating and incessantly screaming and don t make for very sympathetic victims because of its emphasis upon teenage cast some critics have compared film to popular slasher films that would soon follow also comparing film s interchangeable teens to slasher films particularly friday 13th franchise muir says that it feels wrong for a jaws film to dwell in that shallow domain however critic also commends teen characters comradeship and heroism citing girl killed when saving sean from shark film s tagline just when you thought it was safe to go back in water has become one of most famous in film history andrew j kuehn who developed first film s trailer is credited with coining phrase it has been parodied in numerous films most notably tagline of 1996 feature film adaptation of television series flipper this summer it s finally safe to go back in water home media in 1980 mca home video then known as mca videocassette inc released jaws 2 on vhs betamax and laserdisc following its 1980 theatrical re release in 1990s mca universal home video reissued it on vhs and laserdisc film received a dvd release on may 22 2001 many reviewers praised it for quantity of special features with dvd authority asserting that it had more than a lot of titles labeled as special edition discs it includes a 45 minute documentary produced by laurent bouzereau who is responsible for many of documentaries about universal s films actor keith gordon reminisces in a short feature and szwarc explains phonetic problem with its original french title les dents de la mer 2 as it sounded like it ended with expletive merde mer deux this was combated by using suffix part 2 french joke jaws 2 dvd written directed and produced by laurent bouzereau disc also contains a variety of deleted scenes these scenes show animosity between brody and his wife s boss len peterson joseph mascolo brody explaining to ellen that he is not about to take any chances letting mike go sailing saying that smell of death is same in amity as it is in new york and selectmen voting to fire brody mayor murray hamilton is only person to vote to save him these scenes were cut because they were slowing film s pace also included is footage of shark attacking coast guard pilot underwater after his helicopter had capsized scene was cut because of struggle with ratings board to acquire a pg certificate in storyboard it is shown that helicopter pilot would have escaped and saved marge martha from being eaten after she saves sean and saves himself as well although audio was presented in dolby digital 2 0 mono a reviewer for film freak central comments that
