ron hamence was a member of donald bradman s famous australian cricket team of 1948 which toured england and was undefeated in its 34 matches as a result of this unprecedented feat by a test side touring england team earned nickname invincibles a right handed middle order batsman hamence was not instrumental in team s success regarded as last batsman to be chosen for team his selection was subject of controversy because many batsmen who had scored more runs in preceding australian season had been overlooked hamence and colin mccool were only squad members who did not play a test on tour hamence was used in non test tour matches so that leading batsmen could conserve energy for tests as play was scheduled for six days a week along with doug ring hamence and mccool called themselves ground staff because of their scant playing duties in major matches and they often created and sang ironic songs about their lack of opportunities bradman was reluctant to risk team s unbeaten record and as a result hamence did not receive many opportunities to bat high in order something that was subject of criticism hamence scored 582 runs at a batting average of 32 33 with a top score of 99 he was only frontline australian batsman not to score a century remaining eight frontline batsmen each scored at least 973 runs and all averaged no less than 47 30 hamence also occasionally opened bowling in tour matches with his gentle medium pace allowing team s leading bowlers to recuperate between tests background during preceding 1947 48 season in australia hamence was dropped from national team he had played sporadically in test team being selected in three of ten matches in previous two seasons in those three tests he scored a total of 81 runs at an average of 27 00 returning to domestic cricket following his omission hamence scored 85 and 66 against queensland a performance which kept him in running for a place in national team his selection for 1948 tour of england under bradman was subject of considerable controversy as many other batsmen were overlooked despite being more productive during australian summer for his part bradman described his middle order hamence among them as an array of batsmen who could scarcely fail bradman p 153 from start hamence was on outer with regards to selection in tests perry 2008 p 6 he was not selected for any of tests during english campaign but in a 2008 interview emphasised that he felt no resentment over his omission hamence was a popular member of touring party and his cheerful nature and splendid tenor voice added to good spirits of team perry 2008 p 323 his roommate during tour was seamer ernie toshack perry 2008 p 10 early tour australia traditionally fielded its first choice team in tour opener which was customarily against worcestershire being a fringe member of squad and having made only sporadic test appearances in previous seasons hamence was not selected australia promptly crushed hosts by an innings hamence made his debut on english soil in second tour match against leicestershire batting at no 6 he came in at 4 notation means that four wickets were lost while 344 runs were scored and made only seven his dismissal triggered a collapse of 5 38 as australia were bowled out for 448 before winning by an innings next match against yorkshire on a damp pitch that suited slower bowling was closest australia came to defeat on tour fingleton pp 53 55 batting at no 4 hamence made 12 in first innings as australia replied to yorkshire s 71 with 101 he batted slowly coming in at 2 24 before departing at 7 74 after australia dismissed hosts for 89 in their second innings australia collapsed to 3 13 in pursuit of 60 for victory hamence came in and scored one before he was run out after being slow to set off for a quick single australia collapsed to 6 31 to make matters worse sam loxton was injured and could not bat so australia effectively had only three wickets in hand and faced their first loss to an english county since 1912 fingleton p 55 however australia scraped home by four wickets after a counterattack by neil harvey and don tallon aided by a dropped catch and missed stumping fingleton p 56 hamence was rested as australians travelled to london to defeat surrey at oval by an innings he returned for next match against cambridge university elevated to no 3 by stand in captain lindsay hassett hamence came in at 1 64 and put on a partnership of 176 with bill brown ending with 92 as australia piled on 4 414 and won by an innings hamence scored mainly from back foot perry 2008 p 56 and jack fingleton opined a nice innings it was too in its neat fingleton p 64 hamence also bowled for first time on tour sending down three overs for seven runs in second innings without taking a wicket in following match australia crushed essex by an innings and 451 runs their largest winning margin for summer on first day australia set a world record by scoring 721 most first class runs added in one day fingleton pp 65 67 halfway through day at 2 364 all rounder keith miller came to crease a cavalier and carefree character miller resented bradman s ruthless attitude towards annihilating opposition and often refused to try when australia were in an unassailable position he deliberately let ball hit stumps and was out for a golden duck fingleton p 67 perry 2005 p 227 hamence came in and struck 46 adding 146 runs for fifth wicket with sam loxton partnership took only an hour fingleton p 65 and australia went on to win by an innings miller later said that one of his reasons for gifting his wicket was to protest lack of opportunities given to hamence and other fringe batsmen batting at no 5 in next match against oxford university hamence made only three as australia made 431 and proceeded to another innings victory next match was against marylebone cricket club mcc at lord s mcc fielded seven players who would represent england in tests n and were basically a full strength test team while australia fielded their first choice team it was a chance to gain a psychological advantage given hamence s early struggles in english conditions which saw him make only 161 runs at 26 83 in his first six innings while all of australia s first choice top six had made centuries n he was not selected australia amassed 552 and won by an innings recalled for next match against lancashire at old trafford in manchester hamence scored two while batting at no 7 in first innings and an unbeaten 49 at no 6 in second putting on an unbeaten century partnership with harvey as match ended in a draw after entire first day s play was lost to rain his second innings was praised for aesthetic quality perry 2008 p 82 it was first match on tour that australia had failed to win hamence was rested for following match against nottinghamshire which was again drawn before returning against hampshire he made five as australia were dismissed for 117 in reply to home side s 195 first time tourists had conceded a first innings lead during season he did not get another chance with bat as australia recovered to win by eight wickets hamence had one last chance to make his case for test selection in match against sussex at hove last county fixture before first test at trent bridge he came to crease at 4 453 and made 34 in a stand of 96 with harvey his dismissal and harvey reaching his 100 prompted australia to declare at 5 549 bradman said that hamence was unlucky player of match and that he was standing on balcony ready to declare when hamence fell on last ball of over bradman p 175 australia went on to complete an innings victory in second innings hamence opened bowling with ray lindwall he took an early wicket before ending innings by claiming last man to fall a stumping by ron saggers standing up to stumps test omission since world war ii first five positions in australia s test batting order had regularly consisted of arthur morris sid barnes bradman hassett and miller while sixth position saw many occupants perry 2005 pp 216 218 all of first five were selected for matches against worcestershire and mcc and retained their positions for first test this left one position for remaining batsmen in squad up to this point brown had scored 800 runs on tour at an average of 72 72 with four centuries and was on his third tour of england perry 2000 pp 172 177 brown had played in first choice team in matches against worcestershire and mcc harvey had accumulated 296 runs at 42 29 all rounder loxton had 310 runs at 51 66 but was injured while hamence had made only 251 runs at 27 88 and was only one of four to not have scored a century hamence was overlooked while brown gained selection in first test at trent bridge batting out of position in middle order while barnes and morris were preferred as first choice opening pair whereas harvey was dropped despite making a century in australia s most recent test against india perry 2002 p 100 this was exact situation that had unfolded in worcestershire and mcc matches where australia fielded their first choice team brown batted in middle order bradman explained decision in his memoirs hamence was not in good enough form and harvey scarcely ready bradman p 176 during opening stages of tour bradman spent little time talking to hamence at practice sessions leading analysts to conclude that australian skipper viewed hamence as being highly unlikely to play in tests perry 2008 p 25 australia went on to defeat england by eight wickets although brown struggled and made only 17 between tests hamence earned selection for match against northamptonshire batting at no 4 and scoring 34 he partnered acting captain hassett in a stand of 104 for third wicket he took 1 11 in second innings as australia won by an innings in second match before second test which was against yorkshire hamence made 48 and six not out and took a total of 1 17 as game ended in a draw he batted slowly and cautiously bradman gave him few opportunities so he had to make most of them fingleton p 195 first innings 48 was a determined performance on a sticky wicket that helped australia to 249 perry 2008 p 122 bradman felt that hamence s grit was a notable factor in australia managing to pass 200 bradman p 182 harvey made 49 and 56 while brown made 19 and 113 as an opener this was enough for brown to retain his middle order position for second test at lord s where australia fielded an unchanged team australia went on to a crushing win by 409 runs but brown made only 24 and 32 next match was against surrey and started day after second test as test players were tired bradman gave them a lighter workload and assigned hamence and loxton to open bowling both took two wickets and hamence snared opposing captain laurie fishlock and eric bedser to end with 2 24 brown injured a finger while fielding so he was not able to bat in australia s first innings hamence was thus elevated to open batting hamence made a duck but australia nevertheless took a 168 run lead hamence opened bowling for second time although he was unable to take a wicket and ended with 0 30 in second innings harvey volunteered to play as a makeshift opener alongside loxton and they chased down 122 runs for victory in less than an hour to complete a 10 wicket win for following match against gloucestershire before third test brown and hamence did not play harvey made 95 and loxton ended on 159 not out as australia reached 7 774 declared its highest of tour underpinning an innings victory as a result of performance loxton seized brown s middle order position for third test at old trafford perry 2000 p 176 during drawn third test opening batsman sid barnes was injured this opened up a vacancy for fourth test hamence made 30 as australia defeated middlesex by ten wickets in their only county match before fourth test at headingley hamence was overlooked for vacancy as harvey was called in australia scored 3 404 to set a world record for highest successful test run chase harvey scored a century immediately after test hamence made 21 at no 6 as australia amassed 456 and defeated derbyshire by an innings in next match against glamorgan hamence was yet to bat when rain ended match at 3 215 in australia s first innings he was rested as australia defeated warwickshire by nine wickets hamence was recalled as australia faced and drew with lancashire for second time on tour he made 14 in first innings and was unbeaten on 10 in second when australia declared having batted at no 5 both times in last match before fifth test a non first class fixture against durham hamence scored 24 batting at no 6 in australia s 282 match was a rain affected draw that did not reach second innings hamence was overlooked for fifth test as australia won by an innings to seal series 4 0 drawn third test was australia s only non victory later tour matches seven matches remained on bradman s quest to go through a tour of england without defeat australia batted first against kent and hamence made 38 hamence was ninth man to fall as partners ran out and australia lost their last seven wickets for 89 to end at 361 despite this they completed an innings victory in next match against gentlemen of england hamence batted at no 7 and only had a limited opportunity to contribute coming in at 5 532 and scoring 24 before bradman declared at 5 610 when hassett reached 200 hamence bowled in both innings for a total of 1 41 as australia won by an innings in next match against somerset hamence put on 195 for fifth wicket with ian johnson to take australia to 4 501 with his score on 99 other batsmen had all made centuries and australian players were keen to see hamence do same with his score on 99 rest of team left their card games in readiness to applaud his impending milestone however hamence hit two balls from middle of bat only to see them travel directly to fielder yielding no runs anxious to reach his century hamence then charged down pitch and was then stumped for 99 his highest score for season perry 2008 p 253 according to bradman hamence fell to what everyone said was best ball all day bradman p 216 nevertheless australia won by an innings and 374 runs in following match against south of england hamence made seven as australia declared at 7 522 match was washed out hamence bowled three overs without success in hosts only innings australia s biggest challenge in post test tour matches was fixture against leveson gower s xi during last tour in 1938 this team was effectively a full strength england outfit but this time bradman insisted that only six players currently in england s test team be allowed to play for hosts fingleton pp 207 209 bradman then fielded a full strength team perry 2005 pp 253 254 so hamence was left out australia led by 312 on first innings and were well in control but match ended in a draw after multiple rain delays tour ended with two non first class matches against scotland hamence batted once in each match scoring six and 15 as australia ended tour with two innings victories role 300px right thumb a chart showing hamence s batting performance during tour bars with red bars being test innings and pink bars being other first class innings represent runs scored per innings blue line is average of five most recent innings and dots indicate not outs alt hamence started with three scores below 20 before making 92 and a score in 40s after consecutive single figure scores he makes four scores between 30 and 50 in five innings eh then made six innings in a row below 30 before scoring 99 near end of sequence during tour hamence played 19 first class matches and scored 582 runs at an average of 32 33 an occasional bowler who delivered 56 3 overs of medium pace during tour he took seven wickets at 21 42 and completed nine catches he was most successful of specialist batsmen with ball occasionally opening bowling in tour matches such as in both innings of second match against surrey and second innings of second match against yorkshire this allowed bradman to rest his first choice bowlers to keep them fresh for tests hamence s primary role was to allow leading batsmen an opportunity to conserve energy for tests australians generally had six days of play scheduled every week in most of matches hamence batted in middle order at nos 5 6 and 7 n along with loxton he was given 22 first class opportunities with bat whereas other eight frontline batsmen had at least 26 innings loxton scored 973 runs while others all scored more than 1 000 all of batsmen other than loxton averaged at least 47 30 and as australia won many of their matches by an innings or by eight or more wickets he seldom batted in second innings on four occasions he was unbeaten when australia either declared reached their target or time ran out teammate sid barnes criticised omission of hamence from much meaningful cricket on tour referring to match against gentlemen of england barnes criticised fact that bradman hassett and himself all made centuries while hamence was only given a short innings in lower order and was not out on 24 when australia declared as tourists were already in a strong position barnes reasoned that hamence could have been sent in at first wicket down where he batted with his interstate team despite this hassett still went in before hamence in next game against somerset hamence batted no 6 but he should have been sent in no 3 barnes p 180 no 6 and no 3 refer to positions in batting order no 3 batsman bats after first wicket in innings has fallen i e third in order after two opening batsmen no 6 batsman will bat after fourth wicket has fallen barnes reported that hamence along with other frequent omissions colin mccool and doug ring termed themselves ground staff he added in dressing room during county games they would break out into ironic song about few chances they got loxton reported that these songs included odd risque limerick perry 2008 p 57 bradman did later state that because of strong array of batsman ahead of him hamence seldom had an opportunity to make big scores but was an extremely useful reserve who could have been played in tests with confidence following 1948 tour bradman described hamence as a fine batsman of strictly orthodox type very sound and reliable with his game based on driving and a very safe fieldsman bradman p 226 bradman added that hamence had few opportunities because of australia s batting strength but always batted well and often at a critical moment made valuable runs bradman p 230 bradman said that hamence could have been played in tests with confidence and praised his contributions to team morale bradman p 231 fingleton said there was criticism of his selection in this side but had war not intervened he undoubtedly would have made a n ashes trip before fingleton p 208 notes statistical
