european federation which giuseppe mazzini and other european patriots had been promoting for more than three decades in spring of 1834 while at berne mazzini and a dozen refugees from italy poland and germany founded a new association with grandiose name of young europe its basic and equally grandiose idea was that as french revolution of 1789 had enlarged concept of individual liberty another revolution would now be needed for national liberty and his vision went further because he hoped that in no doubt distant future free nations might combine to form a loosely federal europe with some kind of federal assembly to regulate their common interests his intention was nothing less than to overturn european settlement agreed to in 1815 by congress of vienna which had reestablished an oppressive hegemony of a few great powers and blocked emergence of smaller nations mazzini hoped but without much confidence that his vision of a league or society of independent nations would be realized in his own lifetime in practice young europe lacked money and popular support for more than a short term existence nevertheless he always remained faithful to ideal of a united continent for

a powerful state could challenge old alliances and spheres of influence established in 1815 second through diplomatic maneuvering a skillful leader could create an environment in which a rival state would declare war first thus forcing states allied with victim of external aggression to come to leader s aid finally as prussian military capacity far exceeded that of austria prussia was clearly only state within confederation or among german states generally capable of protecting all of them from potential interference or aggression in 1866 most mid sized german states had opposed prussia but by 1870 these states had been coerced and coaxed into mutually protective alliances with prussia in event that a european state declared war on one of their members they all would come to defense of attacked state with skillful manipulation of european politics bismarck created a situation in which france would play role of aggressor in german affairs while prussia would play that of protector of german rights and liberties howard pp 4 60 spheres of influence fall apart in spain at congress of vienna in 1815 metternich and his conservative allies had reestablished spanish monarchy under

of a hohenzollern sigmaringen king in spain would mean that two countries on either side of france would both have german kings of hohenzollern descent this may have been a pleasing prospect for bismarck but it was unacceptable to either napoleon iii or to agenor duc de gramont his minister of foreign affairs gramont wrote a sharply formulated ultimatum to wilhelm as head of hohenzollern family stating that if any hohenzollern prince should accept crown of spain french government would respond although he left ambiguous nature of such response prince withdrew as a candidate thus

a constitution and administrative apparatus that problem was addressed between 1867 and 1871 yet as germans discovered grand speeches flags and enthusiastic crowds a constitution a political reorganization and provision of an imperial superstructure and revised customs union of 1867 68 still did not make a nation blackbourn long century pp 240 290 a key element of nation state is creation of a national culture frequently although not necessarily through deliberate national policy for more on this idea see for example joseph r llobera and goldsmiths college role of historical memory in

imperial germany and national memory 1871 1918 chapel hill 1999 in new german nation a kulturkampf 1872 78 that followed political economic and administrative unification attempted to address with a remarkable lack of success some of contradictions in german society in particular it involved a struggle over language education and religion a policy of germanization of non german people of empire s population including polish and danish minorities started with language in particular german language compulsory schooling germanization and attempted creation of standardized curricula for those schools to promote and celebrate idea of a shared past finally it extended to religion of new empire s population blackbourn long century pp 243 282 kulturkampf for some germans definition of nation did not include pluralism and catholics in particular came under scrutiny some germans and especially bismarck feared that catholics connection to papacy might make them less loyal to nation as chancellor bismarck tried without much success to limit influence of roman catholic church and of its party political arm catholic center party in schools and education and language related policies catholic center party remained particularly well entrenched in catholic strongholds of bavaria and southern baden and in urban areas that held high populations of displaced rural workers seeking jobs in heavy industry and sought to protect rights not only of catholics but other minorities including poles and french minorities in alsatian lands blackbourn long century pp 283 285 300 may laws of 1873 brought appointment of priests and their education under control of state resulting in closure of many seminaries and a shortage of priests congregations law of 1875 abolished religious orders

remained another vulnerable population in new german nation state since 1780 after emancipation by holy roman emperor joseph ii jews in former habsburg territories had enjoyed considerable economic and legal privileges that their counterparts in other german speaking territories did not they could own land for example and they did not have to live in a jewish quarter also called or jews alley they could also attend universities and enter professions during revolutionary and napoleonic eras many of previously strong barriers between jews and christians broke down napoleon had ordered emancipation of jews throughout territories under french hegemony like their french counterparts wealthy german jews sponsored salons in particular several jewish held important gatherings in frankfurt and berlin during which german intellectuals developed their own form of republican intellectualism throughout subsequent decades beginning almost immediately after defeat of french reaction against mixing of jews and christians limited intellectual impact of these salons beyond salons jews continued a process of germanization in which they intentionally adopted german modes of dress and speech working to insert themselves into emerging 19th century german public sphere religious reform movement among german jews reflected this effort marion kaplan making of jewish middle class women

expulsion of jews from russia in 1880s and 1890s complicated integration into german public sphere russian jews arrived in north german cities in thousands considerably less educated and less affluent their often dismal poverty dismayed many of germanized jews many of problems related to poverty such as illness overcrowded housing unemployment school absenteeism refusal to learn german etc emphasized their distinctiveness for not only christian germans but for local jewish populations as well kaplan in particular pp 4 7 and conclusion writing story of nation another important element in nation building story of heroic past fell to such nationalist german historians as liberal constitutionalist friedrich dahlmann 1785 1860 his conservative student heinrich von treitschke 1834 1896 and others less conservative such as theodor mommsen 1817 1903 and heinrich von 1817 1895 to name two dahlmann himself died before unification but he laid groundwork for nationalist histories to come through his histories of english and french revolutions by casting these revolutions as fundamental to construction of a nation and dahlmann himself viewed prussia as logical agent of unification blackbourn and eley peculiarities p 241 heinrich von treitschke s history of germany in nineteenth century published in 1879 has perhaps a misleading title it privileges history of prussia over history of other german states and it tells story of german speaking peoples through guise of prussia s destiny to unite all german states under its leadership creation of this borussian myth borussia is latin name for prussia established prussia as germany s savior it was destiny of all germans to be united this myth maintains and it was prussia s destiny to accomplish this karin friedrich other prussia royal prussia poland and liberty 1569 1772 new york 2000 p 5 according to this story prussia played dominant role in bringing german states together as a nation state only prussia could protect german liberties from being crushed by french or russian influence story continues by drawing on prussia s role in saving germans from resurgence of napoleon s power in 1815 at waterloo creating some semblance of economic unity and uniting germans under one proud flag after 1871 many modern historians describe this myth without subscribing to it for example rudy koshar germany s transient pasts preservation and national memory in twentieth century chapel hill 1998 hans kohn german history some new german views boston 1954 thomas nipperdey germany history from napoleon to bismarck mommsen s contributions to monumenta germaniae historica laid groundwork for additional scholarship on study of german nation expanding notion of germany to mean other areas beyond prussia a liberal professor historian and theologian and generally a titan among late 19th century scholars mommsen served as a delegate to prussian house of representatives from 1863 1866 and 1873 1879 he also served as a delegate to reichstag from 1881 1884 for liberal german progress party deutsche and later for national liberal party he opposed antisemitic programs of bismarck s kulturkampf and vitriolic
