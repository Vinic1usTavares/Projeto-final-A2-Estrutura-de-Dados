barbara in front of him while at mental hospital stewie makes a reference to movie sling blade brian makes a reference to season three family guy episode to love and die in dixie lois is shown watching game show price is right cavemen who invented singing initially grunt mary had a little lamb before quickly evolving into an a cappella version of billy joel s longest time production thumb robert downey jr voiced patrick in episode origins of episode and character of patrick began when robert downey jr telephoned show production staff and asked if he could produce or assist in an episode creation as his son is a fan of show so producers came up with character of patrick for downey show producer seth macfarlane believes downey did a great job and brought a very kind of half crazy and maybe just eccentric personality to that character that really worked out great when patrick makes his second appearance in season 10 s killer queen he is not voiced by downey instead he is voiced by family guy writer and recurring guest voice actor danny smith bob barker voiced himself presenting price is right but actual sequence took years to make barker has provided his voice for show twice although macfarlane has never met him john voiced bobby mcferrin falling down a flight of stairs ball in a cup scene is commented upon by macfarlane where he states that voice overs work drawings work and that walter murphy did a great job of creating a piece of deliberately annoying music several jokes had been pitched for peter s words after killing an evil dragon but all were dropped as they weren t deemed funny enough by production staff macfarlane notes that he was surprised they were allowed to do pickle gag which consisted of stewie placing a cucumber on sofa where patrick s imaginary wife is sitting but inserting it into her imaginary vagina to see if it would turn into a pickle but suggests that maybe broadcasting standards did not fully understand scene music song by overweight people at a funeral for a murdered obese man was only shown on dvd version and not televised for timing purposes and for potential boredom to viewers musical composition was recorded at fox studios on gary numan stage george w bush is portrayed hiding in a tree house and being informed by brian of hurricane katrina bush was offered opportunity to voice himself but declined a deleted scene had been made which showed family traveling on board an airplane on which peter rather than using airplane toilet as he is too fat to get out of his seat urinates in his seat but unknowingly urinates on brian in process as he is in a dog cage below peter s seat if this scene had been used in episode it was intended for brian after throwing a rock aimed at peter s head to say that s for pissing on me reception in a review of episode tv squad commented positively about storyline noting that unlike simpsons tonight family guy actually did work their two storylines together their first big one was about peter s ever increasing weight problem he skips out on going to his physical so that he and brian can go meet guys at an all you can eat steak restaurant in a review of family guy volume 4 nancy basile regards fat guy strangler as one of her favorite episodes as well as ptv basile moves on to comment that being prejudiced against fat people just isn t talked about but this episode sheds a harsh light on that problem at times episode tries to show people who are fat as being victims of unfair bias but other times just out and out makes fun of them
