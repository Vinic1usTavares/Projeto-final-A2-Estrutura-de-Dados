fonteyn kill alternatively written fonteynkill and also known as fountain kill and mill cove brook is a urban stream or kill flowing through dutchess county new york onto campus of vassar college and into casperkill stream was first on land inhabited by native wappinger band before being transferred to dutch and then british a mill was built along kill by 1714 and stream s presence influenced matthew vassar s decision to locate his college in area artificial vassar lake lies midway down fonteyn kill and was once used for ice skating and boating while historically pure stream now suffers from urban stream syndrome partially due to amount of impervious surfaces within its watershed flowing over glacial till stream s bed is rich in cobbles and kill supports populations of benthic macroinvertebrates trees shrubs fish birds snapping turtles and frogs as of 2016 a vassar cornell university program is monitoring water quality of fonteyn kill course fonteyn kill is long historian helen wilkinson reynolds reported in 1924 that stream is fed by a spring in arlington new york more recently exact source of kill has been reported as unknown historical records indicate a variety of courses once followed by stream a 2010 study observed that fonteyn kill flows from a culvert beneath park avenue in an eastward direction through an urban zone before turning southward and feeding into artificial vassar lake it then flows southeastward beneath raymond avenue through campus of vassar college beneath college s bridge for laboratory sciences and into casperkill just below sunset lake at a location once dubbed meeting of waters fonteyn kill is only perennial tributary of casperkill itself a tributary of hudson river in 1924 fonteyn kill was noted as having several small tributaries primarily small meadow runs largely surface water watershed and hydrology thumb right fonteyn kill looking downstream towards ecological laboratory right from bridge for laboratory sciences alt a stream runs between leafless trees beneath a footbridge and towards a reed heavy area historically fonteyn kill s water has been noted for its cleanness in 1924 stream s purity was noted while an 1867 book describes kill s waters as pellucid more recently stream has been cited as suffering from urban stream syndrome surfaces surrounding fonteyn kill are highly impervious stream drains an urban zone of city of poughkeepsie new york of which over 60 is impervious exact size of kill s watershed is not known an area at least as large as known watershed is presumed to contribute to stream s flow in form of storm drainage in spite of this stream itself is bordered by a combination of residential lots and forested swaths ranging from in width on vassar s campus kill runs along outdoor edith roberts ecological laboratory and past school s shakespeare garden a 2010 study of stream found that fonteyn kill s specific conductance a measure of amount of dissolved road salt in stream s water was nearly 1 0 ms cm higher than any value recorded in casperkill sites upstream of vassar lake were recorded in a separate study as having specific twice as high as locations downstream of lake suggesting a regulating effect caused by water mixing and retention in vassar lake total inorganic nitrogen in kill which is usually correlated with surrounding green cover was about average for measurements taken in fonteyn kill and casperkill in that study study also found that fonteyn kill s score on hilsenhoff family biotic index hbi a scale measuring pollution based on tolerance of endemic benthic macroinvertebrates was approximately six indicating fairly poor water quality with scores for rest of casperkill fonteyn kill watershed were as high as seven poor water quality to as low as four very good water quality in 2015 riverkeeper was alerted of a sewage leak in kill noting high levels of bacteria indicating presence of fecal matter a new york state department of environmental conservation dec investigation found nearby private sewer pipes and manholes to be filled with sludge they were cleaned and plans have been instated to ensure that sewers would stay clear henceforth an oil spill was observed in kill in 2016 and dec staff were again sent to respond dec installed booms to absorb oil and began an investigation into spill s source which was unknown as of december 6 efforts are being made to monitor water quality of fonteyn kill led by vassar college s environmental research institute and cornell university cooperative extension dutchess county environment program three sites are regularly sampled for water quality while devices such as sondes continuously record temperature conductivity and ph benthic macroinvertebrates are frequently counted and fecal coliform counts are also run geography and geology cambrian to ordovician age dolomite part of wappinger group and calcareous shales from hudson river group underlie fonteyn kill between 15 20 kya a glacial lake covered land that would become fonteyn kill till and to a lesser extent other glacial sediments today sit atop dolomite and shale surrounding soils are loamy either silt loam or gravelly loam depending on underlying geology streambed is composed of about 25 sand silt and clay and approximately 75 cobbles quicksand was once common around fonteyn kill and its minor tributaries distance covered by stream is noted as being relatively flat descending between over course of its run vassar lake through which kill passes is a shallow body of water measured in 2013 with a maximum depth of and an average depth of biology thumb right several fish near surface of vassar lake alt several dark fish mill about between a partially submerged log and shore of a brownish body of water fonteyn kill and its riparian zone are home to a variety of species caddisflies clams and mussels crayfish damselflies gammarids isopods oligochaetes black flies leeches bladder snails and other snails were recorded in stream in 2010 trees along banks of fonteyn kill include american elms sugar maples black cherries norway maples and red maples while barberry privet holly japanese knotweed honeysuckle spicebush common reeds and japanese roses make up kill s riparian shrubs carp mallards great blue herons frogs snapping turtles and other birds also reside in and around stream a 1924 source observed that trout fishing occurred on kill history thumb left millstone from fonteynkill mill now in front of rockefeller hall alt a round millstone sits upon a grassy lawn fonteyn kill flows through land originally inhabited by wappinger band which throughout 1600s came under dutch control dutch lost control of territory to british in 1664 and dutchess county was established in 1688 pieter schuyler was granted a title to land through which fonteyn kill runs he split that land and sold fonteyn kill tract soon to be known as or eastward neighborhood in 1699 to and robert sanders a mill was built along stream before 1714 in that year sanders s son thomas sold structure to isaac who in turn sold it to march van bommel in 1717 in 1721 an accurate survey of land was conducted mill on fonteyn kill was discovered to be property of catharine brett who claimed land and sold a farm parcel that included mill in 1754 to johannes swartwout land remained in swartwout s hands until he died in 1805 from his heirs land came to be owned in 1812 by matthew westervelt and then reuben tanner in 1815 tanner controlled fonteyn kill land until 1844 when caleb morgan acquired title to space in 1854 land was transferred to matthew vassar for whom presence of fresh water was an important factor in deciding college s location in 1861 year of vassar college s founding land through which fonteyn kill runs came under ownership of college proper a millstone from fonteyn kill mill is preserved on vassar college campus in front of rockefeller hall thumb right vassar students in 1867 along banks of fonteyn kill alt a line drawing of women in dresses on a sloping lawn terminating in a narrow stream as vassar developed area around fonteyn kill was gradually built up old mill became college s pumping station capable of pumping each day an ice house was also in place just south of kill by 1867 along with a garden storehouse upstream of vassar lake on stream s west side during winter ice was cut from vassar lake and moved to college s main building to keep school s supply of food cold conflict occasionally arose between students who desired a smooth skating rink and staff at college who were tasked with refrigerating vassar s foodstuffs in 1916 college built its shakespeare garden using seeds from many plants referenced in william shakespeare s plays just north of stream in 1920s and 1930s edith roberts environmental laboratory was developed south of kill across from shakespeare garden college constructed olmsted hall along stream in 1972 and more recently bridge for laboratory sciences which opened in 2016 etymology name fonteyn kill is derived from dutch literally meaning spring brook stream s name is also sometimes written without a space as fonteynkill kill has also been known as fountain kill a hybrid name of english and dutch origins in 1800s stream was also recorded as mill cove brook stream s name was settled upon by united states board on geographic names on august 11 2016 and it was assigned geographic names information system id recreation thumb right vassar lake circa 1904 alt a colorized image of a path running along bank of a lake and up towards a dirt road lake is still and glassy and trees and a fence rest along its banks fonteyn kill and vassar lake have been used recreationally since vassar college s establishment in 1860s benson john lossing recorded vassar students in 1867 using vassar lake then known as mill cove lake for rowing and boating in summer months a simple dock was built to allow access to water in winter lake froze over and students at college would ice skate upon surface shallowness of lake became an obstacle to recreational use and while it was suggested by vassar s miscellany news that lake be dredged or removed entirely neither of these options were employed and lake is no longer a recreation site by 1920s fonteyn kill s source spring was being dammed in wintertime flooding a nearby hollow to create an ice skating pond see also list of rivers of new york notes references cited external links category poughkeepsie new york category rivers of new
