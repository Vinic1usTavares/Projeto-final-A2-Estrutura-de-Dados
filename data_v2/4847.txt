rescue professor alembick history background thumb anschluss cheering crowds greet nazis in vienna king ottokar s sceptre was not first tintin adventure to draw specifically on contemporary events herge had for instance previously made use of 1931 japanese invasion of manchuria as a political backdrop for setting in blue lotus herge had closely observed unfolding events surrounding expansionist policies of nazi germany in producing this story he was particularly influenced by anschluss annexation of austria by nazi germany in march 1938 munich agreement and subsequent nazi invasion of sudetenland followed in october 1938 three weeks after king ottokar s sceptre finished serialisation germany invaded poland by this point threat to belgian sovereignty posed by nazi expansionism was becoming increasingly clear by 1939 events surrounding italian annexation of albania made herge insist his editor publish work to take advantage of current events as he felt syldavia is albania later herge denied that he had just one country in mind herge claimed that basic idea behind story had been given to him by a friend biographer benoit peeters suggested that most likely candidate was school and scouting friend philippe gerard who had warned of a second war with germany for years tintin scholars have claimed herge did not develop names syldavia and borduria himself instead country names had supposedly appeared in a paper included in a 1937 edition of british journal of psychology in which author described a hypothetical conflict between a small kingdom and an annexing power reportedly paper by lewis fry richardson and entitled general foreign policy explored nature of inter state conflict in a mathematical way peeters attributed these claims to georges but said that no researcher has confirmed this source instead a paper by richardson entitled generalized foreign politics a story in group psychology was published in british journal of psychology monograph supplements in 1939 but did not mention syldavia or borduria in any case given publication date it is unlikely that it was an influence on king ottokar s sceptre herge designed borduria as a satirical depiction of nazi germany herge named pro bordurian agitator musstler from surnames of nazi leader adolf hitler and italy s national fascist leader benito mussolini name also had similarities with british union of fascists leader oswald mosley and national socialist movement in netherlands leader anton musstler s group was named after iron guard a romanian fascist group that sought to oust king carol ii and forge a romanian german alliance bordurian officers wore uniforms based on those of german ss while bordurian planes are german in design in original version tintin escapes in a heinkel he 112 while in revised version this is replaced by a messerschmitt bf 109 herge adopted basis of borduria s false flag operation to take over syldavia from plans outlined in s del colpo di stato technique of a coup d etat thumb 250px bosnian town of mostar pictured around 1890 1900 has been suggested as a likely influence on herge s depiction of syldavian village syldavia s depiction was influenced by costumes and cultures of romania and neighboring balkan region mosques that appear in herge s syldavia are based on those found throughout balkans while appearance of syldavian village featuring red tiled roofs and minarets may have been specifically inspired by bosnian town of mostar syldavia s mineral rich subsoil could be taken as a reference to uranium deposits found under romania s carpathian mountains later to be mentioned directly in eventual destination moon tintin scholars have noted that black pelican of syldavia s flag resembles black eagle of albania s flag and that romania is only european country to which pelicans are native name syldavia may be a composite of transylvania and moldavia two regions with historical ties to romania czech slovak and bohemian history influenced syldavian names while several medieval bohemian kings were inspiration for name ottokar polish language influenced herge s inclusion of ow endings to names of syldavian places while polish history parallels herge s description of syldavian history syldavian language used in book had french syntax but with vocabulary a joke understood by original brussels based readership however despite its eastern european location syldavia itself was partly a metaphor for belgium syldavian king muskar xii physically resembles king leopold iii of belgium herge s decision to create a fictional eastern european kingdom might have been influenced by fictional country created by anthony hope for his novel prisoner of zenda 1894 which subsequently appeared in film adaptations in 1913 1915 1922 and 1937 many places within syldavia are visually based on pre existing european sites diplodocus in klow natural history museum is based on one in museum fur naturkunde berlin syldavian royal palace is based on both charlottenburg palace berlin and royal palace of brussels and kropow castle is based on castle constructed in fifteenth century savonia a historical province of swedish kingdom located in modern day finland for revised version kropow castle was drawn with an additional tower inspired by vyborg castle russia united kingdom also bore at least one influence on syldavia as king muskar xii s carriage is based on british royal family s gold state coach original publication king ottokar s sceptre was first serialised in le petit vingtieme from 4 august 1938 to 10 august 1939 under title tintin en tintin in syldavia it would prove to be last tintin adventure to be published in its entirety in le petit vingtieme from 14 may 1939 story was also serialised in french catholic newspaper coeurs vaillants in 1939 editions casterman collected story together in a single hardcover volume herge insisted to his contact at casterman charles that they hurry up process due

of arms for title page and tapestry depicting syldavian s 1127 victory over turks in battle of on page 20 herge suggested that for this publication story s title be changed to scepter of ottokar iv casterman changed this to king ottokar s sceptre king ottokar s sceptre introduced recurring character of bianca castafiore to series who appears alongside her pianist igor wagner it also witnessed introduction of antagonist colonel jorgen who reappears in later tintin adventures destination moon and its sequel explorers on moon alembick brothers inclusion echoes balthazar brothers inclusion in broken ear after conclusion of king ottokar s sceptre herge continued adventures of tintin with land of black gold until germany placed belgium under occupation in 1940 and forced closure of adventure land of black gold had to be abandoned second version 1947 story was redrawn and colourised in 1947 for this edition herge was assisted by edgar p jacobs an artist who worked as part of studios herge jacobs oversaw changes to costumes and background of story in 1938 version syldavian royal guards are dressed like british while 1947 version has them dressed in a uniform similar to national guards unit of bulgaria jacobs also inserted a cameo of himself and his wife in syldavian royal court while in that same scene is a cameo of herge his then wife germaine his brother paul and three of his friend s edouard jacques van melkebeke and marcel herge and jacobs also inserted further cameos of themselves at bottom of page 38 where they appear as uniformed officers while character of professor alembick had been given forename of nestor in original version this was changed to hector for second this had been done so as to avoid confusion with character of nestor butler of marlinspike hall whom herge had introduced in secret of unicorn editions casterman published this second version in book form in 1947 subsequent publications and legacy king ottokar s sceptre became first tintin adventure to be published for a british audience when eagle serialised comic in 1951 here names of tintin and milou were retained although characters of dupond and dupont were renamed thomson and thompson latter two names would be adopted by translators leslie lonsdale cooper and michael turner when they translated series into english for methuen publishing in 1958 casterman republished original black and white version of story in 1980 as part of fourth volume in their collection in 1988 they then published a facsimile version of that first edition critical analysis thumb right herge biographer benoit peeters pictured 2010 felt that king ottokar s sceptre showed a political maturity harry thompson described king ottokar s sceptre as a biting political satire and asserted that it was courageous of herge to have written it given that threat of nazi invasion was imminent describing it as a classic locked room mystery he praised its tightly constructed plot ultimately he deemed it one of best three tintin adventures written before world war ii alongside blue lotus and black island he also thought it noteworthy that in 1976 archaeologists discovered a sceptre belonging to a 13th century king ottokar in st vitus cathedral prague herge biographer pierre assouline believed that story had atmosphere of franz s merry widow with added touches from films of erich von stroheim and ernst lubitsch fellow biographer benoit peeters thought that it exhibited a political maturity and originality further he felt that herge was able to break free from narrative limits of too much realism by use of syldavia as a setting jean marc lofficier and randy lofficier called king ottokar s sceptre a hitchcockian thriller which recaptures paranoid ambience of cigars of pharaoh they compared pace of latter part of story to that of steven spielberg s indiana jones films before noting that despite horrors of real world that are present with borduria s inclusion they do not interfere in pure escapist nature of adventure ultimately they awarded it three stars out of five michael farr opined that adventure has a convincingly authentic feel due to satirical portrayal to nazi germany but that this was coupled with sufficient scope for invention with creation of syldavia he compared it to hitchcock s lady vanishes farr preferred colour version assembled with e p jacobs aid however deeming it particularly successful he thought that it was one of most polished and accomplished adventures in series with a perfectly paced and balanced narrative that mixed drama and comedy successfully literary critic jean marie apostolides of stanford university asserted that inclusion of iron guard evoked colonel francois de la s croix de feu noting that figure of musstler was evil one without a face he expressed disbelief regarding herge s depiction of syldavia as there were no apparent economic problems or reasons why musstler s anti monarchist conspiracy was so strong thus mass revolution remains schematic literary critic tom mccarthy identified several instances in story that he argued linked to wider themes within adventures of tintin he identified a recurring host and guest theme in alembick s visit to syldavia and believed that theme of thieving was present in story as alembick s identity is stolen another theme identified within series by mccarthy was that of blurring between sacred and political he saw echoes of this in king ottokar s sceptre as king has to wait three days before appearing to syldavian public on st vladimir s day something that mccarthy thought linked to jesus christ and resurrection mccarthy also opined that a number of characters in book visually resembled captain haddock a character who would be introduced in subsequent tintin adventure crab with golden claws adaptations king ottokar s sceptre was first of adventures of tintin to be adapted for animated series herge s adventures of tintin series was created by belgium s belvision studios in 1957 directed by ray goossens and written by greg studio divided king ottokar s sceptre into six 5 minute black and white episodes that diverted from herge s original plot in many ways it was also adapted into a 1991 episode of adventures of tintin television series by french studio ellipse and canadian animation company nelvana episode was directed by stephane bernasconi and thierry wermuth voiced character of tintin tintin fans adopted syldavian language that appears in story and used it to construct grammars and dictionaries akin to fan following of star
