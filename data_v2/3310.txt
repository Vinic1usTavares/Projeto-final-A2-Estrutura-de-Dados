observer he helped smooth out tensions and hone their multiplatinum sound when recording sessions became contentious finn would often smooth over differences with humor advice and a new perspective

style and influences left thumb finn s recording equipment at conway recording studios in september 2003 finn was known for his dynamic warm guitar sound featured prominently on blink 182 albums and sum 41 s all killer no filler 2001 whenever i could corner him at a party i harassed him about how he gets guitar sounds and how he gets his mixes to sound so punchy said producer john feldmann finn achieved sound by recording instruments through more than one amplifier at same time many engineers try to keep everything separate and add effects later said finn players play to sound so you just have to get a sound and go with it this allows you to mix tones together to get just right sound finn owned reportedly over 100 guitars and would often bring large collections of instruments and amplifiers to studio he estimated that it took him 10 12 days to mix an album though some took less or more upon reviewing rough mixes finn would attempt to craft mix around sound in his head he created in mixing songs finn preferred to first get drums happening to where they have some ambience followed by vocal tracks in terms of mixing bass and drums perhaps most difficult task of a mixing engineer according to bobby owsinski finn preferred to have kick drum and bass occupying their own territory and not fighting each other he felt sound of modern records today is compression every time i try to be a purist and go you know i m not gonna compress that band comes in and goes why isn t that compressed when setting compressor finn would set attack slow and release fast so that all transients are getting through and initial punch is still there but it releases instantly when signal drops below threshold finn called this sound of my mixes it keeps things kinda popping whole time blink 182 bassist mark hoppus called finn meticulous in getting great sounds considering recording drums to be a lost art finn took great interest in this step of process he often focused on room microphones to capture drum ambience naturally this proved frustrating to blink drummer travis barker for hours and hours jerry would be adjusting microphones i d sit around drinking coffee and smoking cigarettes just praying that i d be able to start playing soon as for finn s producing style barker wrote jerry was more about giving us ideas and lending an extra set of ears he d say hey that sounds cool why doesn t that part at end go a little longer or what if this song had an intro frequent collaborators to finn included drum technician mike fasano and engineers sean o dwyer ryan hewitt and joe mcgrath he was also known for working with keyboardist roger joseph manning jr whom he brought into blink 182 alkaline trio and morrissey sessions finn credited john bonham as a musical inspiration growing up and don was ed cherney mick guzauski john and duane baron as influential on his recording techniques legacy finn was known for his genial demeanor and technical prowess according to pierre perrone of independent he could act as a sounding board or confidant and push musicians and singers to perform at their best he would order food and shoot breeze with his clients and generally create a relaxed atmosphere finn would occasionally mix albums for independent bands or friends from anywhere from free to half his rate because he enjoyed music bobby owsinski author of mixing engineer s handbook wrote that finn represented one of new generation of mixers who knows all rules but is perfectly willing to break them after his death alternative press compiled a list of nine classic albums helmed by finn writing that finn s bread and butter during past decade was helping rough punk bands refine their sound and helping them discover power of a good vocal hook finn s impact on blink 182 led bassist mark hoppus to dub him fourth member of band every day i spent with jerry over past 10 years i feel like he taught me something new about music or recording or life he wrote after his passing jerry wasn t some asshole rolling up to studio in a bentley he was one of us he could be honest with us and we would listen to him drummer travis barker remembered in his memoir can i say 2015 when band reconvened to work on their reunion album neighborhoods 2011 band found it very difficult to work without finn they continued to work alone until 2016 when they recruited producer john feldmann for their seventh album california feldmann considered himself a disciple of finn commenting sound of my records was influenced by records jerry made production
