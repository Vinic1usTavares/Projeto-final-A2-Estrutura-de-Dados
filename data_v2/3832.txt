key are contained in rgb encoding of five colors with each color providing three bytes of key byte c0 is appended in lower right corner a controversy surrounding aacs cryptographic key arose in april 2007 when motion picture association of america and advanced access content system licensing administrator llc aacs la began issuing cease and desist letters to websites publishing a 128 bit 16 byte number represented in hexadecimal as 09 f9 11 02 9d 74 e3 5b d8 41 56 c5 63 56 88 c0 commonly referred to as 09 f9 a cryptographic key for hd dvds and blu ray discs letters demanded immediate removal of key and any links to it citing anti circumvention provisions of united states digital millennium copyright act dmca in response to widespread internet postings of key aacs la issued various press statements praising those websites that complied with their requests for acting in a responsible manner and warning that legal and technical tools were adapting to situation controversy was further escalated in early may 2007 when aggregate news site digg received a dmca cease and desist notice and then removed numerous articles on matter and banned users information this sparked what some describe as a digital revolt or cyber riot in which users posted and spread key on digg and throughout internet en masse thereby leading to a streisand effect aacs la described this situation as an interesting new twist background hexadecimal is a base 16 numeral system used in fields of computer programming and mathematics key is an ordinary number most widely known by its hexadecimal representation in decimal notation it is 13 256 278 887 989 457 651 018 865 901 401 704 640 read as thirteen two hundred and fifty six two hundred and seventy eight eight hundred and eighty seven nine

hundred and one million seven hundred and four thousand six hundred and forty because encryption key may be used as part of circumvention technology forbidden by dmca its possession and distribution has been viewed as illegal by aacs as well as by some legal professionals since it is a 128 bit numerical value it was dubbed an illegal number blogger news network illegal number triggers flood of mpaa cease and desist main blog login wordpress com opponents to expansion of scope of copyright criticize idea of making a particular number illegal commercial hd dvds and blu ray discs integrate copy protection technology specified by aacs la there are several interlocking encryption mechanisms such that cracking one part of system does not necessarily crack other parts therefore 09 f9 key is only one of many parts that are needed to play a disc on an unlicensed player aacs can be used to revoke a key of a specific playback device after it is known to have been compromised as it has for windvd compromised players can still be used to view old discs but not newer releases without encryption keys for compromised players if other players are then cracked further revocation would lead to legitimate users of compromised players being forced to upgrade or replace their player software or firmware in order to view new discs each playback device comes with a binary tree of secret device and processing keys processing key in this tree a requirement to play aacs encrypted discs is selected based on device key and information on disc to be played as such a processing key such as 09 f9 key is not revoked but newly produced discs cause playback devices to select a different valid processing key to decrypt discs timeline of aacs cracking 2006 on december 26 2006 a person using alias muslix64 published a utility named backuphddvd and its source code on dvd decryption forum at website doom9 backuphddvd can be used to decrypt aacs protected content once one knows encryption key muslix64 claimed to have found title and volume keys in main memory while playing hd dvds using a software player and that finding them is not difficult 2007 on january 1 2007 muslix64 published a new version of program with volume key support on january 12 2007 other forum members detailed how to find other title and volume keys stating they had also found keys of several movies in ram while

as early as april 17 2007 aacs la had issued dmca violation notices sent by charles s sims of rose following this dozens of notices were sent to various websites hosted in united states on may 1 2007 in response to a dmca demand letter technology news site digg began closing accounts and removing posts containing or alluding to key digg community reacted by creating a flood of posts containing key many using creative ways of disguising key by semi directly or indirectly inserting number such as in song or images either representing digits pictorially or directly representing bytes from key as colors or on merchandise at one point digg s entire homepage was covered with links to hd dvd code or anti digg references eventually digg administrators reversed their position with founder kevin rose stating legal opinions lawyers and other representatives of entertainment industry including michael ayers an attorney for toshiba corporation expressed surprise at digg s decision but suggested that a suit aimed at digg might merely spread information more widely american bar association s published a discussion of controversy in which eric goldman at santa clara university s high tech law institute noted that illegality of putting code up is questionable that section 230 of communications decency act may protect provider when material itself is not copyrighted although continuing to allow posting of key may be risky and entertainment lawyer carole handler noted that even if material is illegal laws such as dmca may prove ineffective in a practical sense impact in a response to events occurring on digg and call to spread this number key was rapidly posted to thousands of pages blogs and across internet reaction was an example of streisand effect intellectual property lawyer douglas j noted people are getting creative it shows futility of trying to stop this once information is out there cease and desist letters are going to infuriate this community more outside internet

press included speculation on development of user driven websites legal liability of running a user driven website perception of acceptance of drm failure as a business model of secrecy based businesses in every aspect in internet era it s no secret code stirs up a web storm and harm an industry can cause itself with harshly perceived legal action in an opposing move carter wood of national association of manufacturers said they had removed digg it link from their weblog media coverage initially avoided quoting key itself however several us based news sources have run stories containing key quoting its use on digg though none are known to have received dmca notices as a result later reports have discussed this quoting key current tv broadcast key during a google current

circumvention tools including encryption keys from a number of web sites and that it had not requested removal or deletion of any discussion or commentary statement continued aacs la is encouraged by cooperation it has received thus far from numerous web sites that have chosen to address their legal obligations in a responsible manner bbc news had earlier quoted an aacs executive saying that
