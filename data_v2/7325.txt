aggregator xbox 360 version of game received an average score of 45 out of 100 based on 7 reviews uk official xbox magazine remarked that blood knights holds as much annoyance as satisfaction while us version of official xbox magazine contended that blood knights is too easy to ever become actively irritating but its deficit of danger makes it too darn dull to hold even a devoted horror nut s attention for long critics took issue with game s lack of originality henry kelly of digital fix comments that character models are quite basic and unimaginative jeremy has typically harsh features and female characters are given skimpy outfits to show off their stereotyped fantasy physiques x one magazine calls game an unashamed clone of diablo which borrows mechanics naming conventions and character archetypes from diablo gameplay was considered by critics to be too easy with a terrible enemy ai that made combat unchallenging interspersed with what henry kelly called painfully simple non puzzles other components that faced criticism included shallowness of rpg elements lack of online co op and dialogue which was considered poorly written and occasionally poorly acted reviewers did however have positive things to say about game s co op system lack of online support notwithstanding cameron lewis of official xbox magazine us in summary of his review noted that complementary characters make local co op effective uk version of magazine called co op pleasant while x one magazine felt that mode gave game more substance notes gamerankings tracks ratings for each platform separately and does not have a page for playstation 3 version metacritic tracks ratings for each platform separately and does not assign aggregate scores for a platform until it receives at least four reviews specific to that platform as metacritic only lists three reviews for pc version and one review for playstation version it has not issued aggregate scores for those platforms references
