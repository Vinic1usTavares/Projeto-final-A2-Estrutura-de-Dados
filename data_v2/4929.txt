hurricane kyle was fifth longest lived atlantic tropical or subtropical cyclone on record eleventh named storm and third hurricane of 2002 atlantic hurricane season kyle developed as a subtropical cyclone on september 20 to east southeast of bermuda looping westward it transitioned into a tropical cyclone and became a hurricane on september 25 for next two weeks kyle tracked generally westward oscillating in strength several times because of fluctuations in environmental conditions on october 11 cyclone turned northeastward and made landfalls near charleston south carolina and long beach north carolina at tropical storm status after lasting as a cyclone for 22 days kyle dissipated on october 12 as it was absorbed by an approaching cold front hurricane brought light precipitation to bermuda but no significant damage was reported there moderate rainfall accompanied its two landfalls in united states causing localized flash flooding and road closures floodwaters forced evacuation of a nursing home and several mobile homes in south carolina kyle spawned at least four tornadoes costliest of which struck georgetown south carolina it damaged 106 buildings and destroyed seven others causing eight injuries overall damage totaled about 5 million 2002 usd usd and no direct deaths were reported however remnants of kyle contributed to one indirect death in british isles meteorological history a cold front stalled and began weakening to southeast of bermuda on september 15 spawning a low pressure area by september 18 a stationary wind circulation developed around low by september 19 aided by a trough aloft to its west convection developed into narrow banding features far from center and overall structure gradually consolidated it is estimated that system developed into a subtropical depression late on september 20 about 490 miles southeast of bermuda it was classified subtropical because of large distance between convection and center uncharacteristic of purely tropical systems cyclone tracked northward within weak steering flow between an upper level low to its south and a trough to its north strengthening gradually depression attained subtropical storm status early on september 21 and as such was named kyle by national hurricane center after being named kyle tracked north northeastward before gradually executing a clockwise loop initially circulation center remained partly exposed to south and west of deep convection on september 22 convection increased around center as system developed a warm thermal core and as a result it was reclassified as a fully tropical cyclone a building anticyclone to northwest turned kyle to southwest after storm briefly weakened previously moderate wind shear began decreasing which allowed convection to deepen and outflow over cyclone to improve tracking over progressively warmer waters kyle began developing a banding eye feature late on september 24 slow strengthening continued and storm attained hurricane status at 1200 utc on september 25 next day kyle reached peak winds of 85 mph 130 km h about 490 miles east southeast of bermuda thumb trmm satellite image of tropical storm kyle on october 3 after maintaining its peak intensity for about 24 hours kyle began weakening on september 27 as increased upper level shear restricted outflow and distorted convection envelope drier air also contributed to weakening on september 28 after turning west northwestward hurricane weakened to tropical storm status and by next day center had become devoid of deep convection a trough passing to its north and a developing ridge to its west left storm nearly stationary for several days weakening rate of kyle was temporarily halted when thunderstorms redeveloped on september 29 and again early next day though late on september 30 storm weakened to tropical depression status circulation had become elongated from northeast to southwest northeastern portion became associated with approaching frontal zone and was briefly monitored for signs of development however southwestern portion redeveloped convection and became dominant circulation remaining a tropical depression for about 18 hours kyle re intensified to tropical storm status on october 1 after redeveloping some thunderstorms southeast of center despite unfavorable wind shear convection became better organized developing into rain bands and wrapping into mid level circulation of storm late on october 2 kyle developed an eye feature in center of storm and winds increased to about 65 mph 105 km h operationally it was forecast to regain hurricane status however storm encountered further wind shear which left center exposed from convection by early on october 4 convection became intermittent and separated from circulation and kyle again weakened to tropical depression status on october 5 by then storm had begun a steady west northwest motion which was followed by a slow turn to north northeast on october 6 a decrease in wind shear allowed cyclone to again reach tropical storm status about 295 miles 475 km west northwest of bermuda around same time system was located in an area of weak steering currents a ridge was to its northeast and southwest an upper level low was to its east southeast and a broad trough was to its northwest by october 7 it began a slow southwestward motion around a ridge to its west circulation became elongated as dry air limited convection and after shear increased on october 8 kyle weakened to tropical depression status by early on october 9 depression consisted of a circulation center without any of associated deep convection that is one of prerequisites of being a tropical cyclone several hurricane forecast models predicted kyle to weaken until dissipation after 24 hours without significant convection thunderstorms reformed to southeast of center on october 10 as depression entered an area of warmer water temperatures environmental conditions became more favorable with weakening wind shear and decreasing dry air depression continued tracking around a ridge turning to west and west northwest toward coast of florida convection increased markedly early on october 11 as it turned northward ahead of an approaching cold front and kyle regained tropical storm status about 35 miles 60 km east of border between florida and georgia left thumb tropical storm kyle making landfall in south carolina on october 11 after re attaining tropical storm status kyle turned more to northeast and parallel to coastline making landfall near mcclellanville south carolina as a minimal tropical storm storm briefly moved over open waters before again making landfall near long beach north carolina late on october 11 by early on october 12 storm had weakened to tropical depression status at time of it moving ashore there was a separate non tropical low to northeast of depression and shear had greatly increased which made re intensification unlikely however convection redeveloped baroclinically with approaching cold front and kyle attained tropical storm status for fifth time over eastern pamlico sound restrengthening was short lived as wind field expanded while convection transitioned into that of a frontal band after emerging into western atlantic ocean tropical storm kyle merged with a cold front late on october 12 remnants of kyle continued eastward executing a loop on october 14 before turning northeastward and impacting azores on october 17 next day remnants of kyle were absorbed by an extratropical cyclone to its northwest which continued northeastward and moved near british isles on october 23 preparations because of uncertainties in its track government of bermuda posted a tropical storm watch for island on september 30 it was discontinued following day as kyle approached coast of florida a tropical storm watch was issued between cocoa beach florida and brunswick georgia and later was extended northward to edisto beach south carolina early on october 11 a tropical storm warning was put in place between brunswick georgia and cape fear north carolina which was later amended to include pamlico sound and coastline through surf city north carolina prior to it making landfall national weather service office in wilmington north carolina issued a flood watch for much of coastline that was ultimately affected in south carolina a flood warning was issued for counties of florence williamsburg and georgetown states of emergencies were declared for ten south carolina counties impact thumb right rainfall totals in united states from kyle on bermuda combination of storm and a cold front to its north produced 2 19 inches 55 6 mm of rainfall in first two days of october which was about half of monthly rainfall total while passing near northeast coast of florida kyle produced a storm surge of 1 31 feet 0 4 m in fernandina beach winds were light with gusts peaking at 32 mph 52 km h in st augustine and precipitation reached 2 05 inches 52 mm in fernandina beach along georgia coastline storm dropped moderate rainfall that peaked at 5 35 inches 136 mm at hunter army airfield most of precipitation fell in a 12 hour period which flooded roads and low lying areas several roads were closed and numerous vehicles stalled in floodwaters moderate rainfall from kyle in south carolina peaked at 6 35 inches 161 mm in edisto beach with precipitation resulting in minor urban flooding in and around st stephen flooding reached several feet in depth in roads and buildings there a nursing home had to be evacuated because of flooding high waters in manning severely damaged 17 mobile homes forcing about 50 people to move to shelters ten car accidents were reported in florence tropical storm spawned an f2 tornado in georgetown that remained on ground for about 1 25 miles 2 km at its peak strength tornado overturned five mobile homes and a car tornado destroyed seven homes and damaged 106 buildings 28 severely eight people were injured by tornado left thumb tornado damage in georgetown south carolina in north carolina above normal tides caused minor beach erosion rainfall near coastline reached 5 6 inches 142 mm in greenville moisture from storm led to increased rainfall further inland peaking at 8 72 inches 221 mm in butner raleigh durham recorded a two day rainfall total of 5 79 inches 147 mm which was highest two day total at station since hurricane floyd in 1999 heavy rainfall caused flash flooding in martin county where several roads were closed moderate winds were reported in state with gusts peaking at 49 mph 79 km h on bald head island storm spawned at least three tornadoes in state including an f2 twister near that damaged two houses and a farm moisture from kyle extended into mid atlantic states and southern new york precipitation alleviated rainfall deficits throughout region overall damage amounted to about 5 million 2002 usd usd while no deaths were reported directly from kyle its remnants contributed to one death in stormy seas off british isles records lasting for a total of 22 days hurricane kyle was operationally considered third longest lived tropical cyclone in atlantic basin kyle was behind hurricane ginger in 1971 season with 27 25 days and hurricane inga in 1969 season with 24 75 days however an update to atlantic hurricane best track in 2004 led to san ciriaco hurricane of 1899 to be re analyzed as longest lived atlantic tropical cyclone on record and as a result kyle was dropped to fourth longest lived in september 2012 hurricane nadine surpassed kyle as fourth longest lived cyclone at 22 25 days dropping kyle to fifth longest lived kyle was at time only atlantic tropical cyclone on record to attain tropical storm status on five separate occasions 2010 s hurricane tomas subsequently equalled this feat see also other tropical cyclones named kyle list of tropical cyclones hurricane ginger hurricane
