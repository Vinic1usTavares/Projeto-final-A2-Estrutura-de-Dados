commentators associated with professor genki s shows return to cover competition with tammy tolliver three of four activities are revamped versions of other activities from main game genki apocalypse is a shooting minigame similar to main game s super ethical reality climax where player travels through rooms shooting enemies and targets such as ethical and money shot targets to earn money

unfavorable and mixed reviews for its xbox 360 and playstation versions respectively according to video game review score aggregator metacritic reviewers complained that pack was too short with gamezone david sanchez and gamespot carolyn petit finishing it in under an hour official xbox magazine francesca reyes called it crazy short reviewers thought new activity sad panda skyblazing was highlight of pack though game informer dan ryckert thought it was most annoying of them all critics were dissatisfied by amount of recycled content gamezone sanchez thought that activities were crazy and fun he considered super ethical reality climax among best activities in main game and was not surprised that genki apocalypse was most enjoyable in pack sanchez was frustrated by charging enemies in super ethical pr opportunity and thought sad panda skyblazing was craziest and most unique of four activities fitting in with saints row third insane nature he did not feel that game needed to be included in original release but thought there should have been at least five different opportunities to do each new activity similarly petit of gamespot also thought only sad panda skyblazing matched main game in zaniness and said pack felt mundane overall she said that story is more minor in pack and that it was less funny than main game petit was frustrated by labyrinth like design of some of genki apocalypse levels and was uninterested in super ethical pr opportunity by time activity ended rock paper shotgun john walker wanted something more expansive for first pack and expected something more original and strange along lines of saints row 2 shit spraying activity ugo paul wrote that lack of content is less disappointing if player thinks of genkibowl as a small booster pack gangstas in space a month later gangstas in space was released in three missions players continue saints row third story in a new arc about gangstas in space film referenced in main story in game film about saints is being directed by self interested hollywood director andy zhen and player is acting final scenes of film alongside a female co star making her debut in first level player fights military to save a female alien and controls turret on getaway vehicle in second player is in a shootout in a linear map last mission has player in an aircraft fighting other aircraft while co star uploads viruses to transmitters at time of review player could not revisit old missions to earn missed achievements but was later patched costumes and vehicles are unlocked upon completing pack pack was released in north america on february 21 2012 and in europe next day reception gangstas in space received mixed or average reviews according to video game review score aggregator metacritic reviewers found pack similar in length to its predecessor gamezone david sanchez thought quality was much better than previous pack and that missions were lengthy but still felt game was still too short an hour in duration official xbox magazine josh abrams wrote that pack had foul language cool set pieces and satirical worldview of main game and a grindhouse feel which he appreciated dan ryckert of game informer called story minimal and said that pack s only difference from game was alien skins atop main game s weapons and vehicles he added that if they did not have skins missions would easily be some of most uneventful in game overall ryckert was disappointed with first two content packs andrew smee of rock paper shotgun thought gangstas in space was better of final two packs and praised game s humorous voice acting as best since psychonauts he also found cutscenes fantastic in comparison to bioware s mass effect 3 scenes trouble with clones when saints leader johnny gat died saints fan and stereotypical nerd jimmy torbitson cloned him beginning a three mission series on capturing and quelling superpowered clone who acts like brute enemy type in main game torbitson narrates missions like a superhero film first mission has player fighting off enemy gangs and police and second involves a ploy to calm gat with music while torbitson dancing to distract saints fans and player fans with a bee gun in final mission player drinks torbitson s saints flow granting superpowers such as speed strength and fireballs and player protects clone johnny tag on a bridge from a military onslaught upon completion player unlocks two computer controlled homies for support and a vehicle missions can be replayed pack was released march 20 2012 halfway through thq s promised 40 weeks of additional content reception similar to other packs trouble with clones contained about an hour of gameplay reviewers thought pack was best of set and praised saints flow superpowers sequence multiple reviewers questioned why bee gun and superpowers were not unlocked in main game game informer dan ryckert said he found sprinting with saints flow to be preferable to driving and that portion to be a lot of fun he was disappointed when powers and bee gun did not unlock in main game official xbox magazine josh abrams compared pack to a 1980s film with torbitson s narration and praised both part where a female brute attracts gat and saints flow superpower sequence he lamented not being able to export powers back into main game gamezone david sanchez called bee gun a great deal of fun but praised final mission freaking awesome as bleeding madness that made so many gamers fall in love with saints row third in first place other content nyte blade pack includes a vampire hunter themed sports car and motorcycle and altar boy and bloody canoness costumes explosive combat pack adds a future soldier costume and m2 grenade launcher while z style pack adds a z style suit and bling
