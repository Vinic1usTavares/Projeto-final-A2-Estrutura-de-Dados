king who had previously worked with latifah on all hail queen a writer for vibe believed nature of a sista would have sold better if it had been promoted as an r b release according to latifah album s commercial performance was representative of how female rappers get fewer resources than men she said people wonder why girls don t go platinum but a lot of time we don t get same money for marketing and promotion and that s just a straight up fact according to a writer from boombox music critics had started to ask whether latifah was more focused on developing crossover appeal rather than creating rap music partially because of release of nature of a sista music critics interpreted her 1993 follow up album black reign as a way to deliver something that cemented her credibility as an
