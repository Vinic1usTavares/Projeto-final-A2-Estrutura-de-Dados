pennsylvania station was a historic railroad station in new york city named for pennsylvania railroad prr its builder and original tenant station occupied an plot bounded by seventh and eighth avenues and 31st and 33rd streets in midtown manhattan as terminal shared its name with several stations in other cities it was sometimes called new york pennsylvania station or penn station for short building was designed by mckim mead and white and completed in 1910 enabling direct rail access to new york city from south for first time its head house and train shed were considered a masterpiece of beaux arts style and one of great architectural works of new york city station contained 11 platforms serving 21 tracks in approximately same layout as current penn station original building was one of first stations to include separate waiting rooms for arriving and departing passengers and when built these were among city s largest public spaces passenger traffic began to decline after world war ii and in 1950s pennsylvania railroad sold air rights to property and shrank railroad station starting in 1963 above ground head house and train shed were demolished a loss that galvanized modern historic preservation movement over next six years below ground concourses and waiting areas were heavily renovated becoming modern penn station while madison square garden and pennsylvania plaza were built above them sole remaining portions of original station are underground platforms and tracks as well as scattered artifacts on mezzanine level above it history planning thumb left pennsylvania station plate 20 from bromley george w and bromley walter s atlas of city of new york borough of manhattan volume two philadelphia g w bromley and co 1920 until early 20th century prr s rail network terminated on western side of hudson river once known locally as north river at exchange place in jersey city new jersey manhattan bound passengers boarded ferries to cross hudson river for final stretch of their journey rival new york central railroad s line transported passengers from hudson valley in city s north ran along park avenue in manhattan and terminated at grand central depot later grand central terminal at 42nd street and park avenue many proposals for a cross hudson connection were advanced in late 19th century but financial panics in 1870s and 1890s scared off potential investors in any event none of proposals advanced during this time were considered feasible prr considered building a rail bridge across hudson but state of new york insisted that a cross hudson bridge had to be a joint project with other new jersey railroads who were not interested alternative was to tunnel under river but steam locomotives could not use such a tunnel due to accumulation of pollution in a closed space and new york state legislature prohibited steam locomotives in manhattan after july 1 1908 idea of a midtown manhattan railroad hub was first formulated in 1901 when pennsylvania railroad took interest in a new railroad approach recently completed in paris in parisian railroad scheme electric locomotives were substituted for steam locomotives prior to final approach into city prr president alexander johnston cassatt adapted this method for new york city area in form of new york tunnel extension project which he created and led overall planning effort for prr who had been working with long island rail road lirr on tunnel extension plans made plans to acquire majority control of lirr so that one new terminal could be built in manhattan rather than two corinthian columns of new york penn station s main waiting room thumb right project was to include new york penn station north river tunnels crossing hudson river to west and east river tunnels crossing east river to east original proposal for terminal which was published in june 1901 called for construction of a bridge across hudson river between 45th and 50th streets in manhattan as well as two closely spaced terminals for lirr and prr this would allow passengers to travel between long island and new jersey without having to switch trains in december 1901 plans were modified so that prr would construct north river tunnels under hudson river instead of a bridge over it prr cited costs and land value as a reason for constructing a tunnel rather than a bridge since cost of a tunnel would be one third that of a bridge new york tunnel extension quickly gained opposition from new york city board of rapid transit commissioners who objected that they would not have jurisdiction over new tunnels as well as from interborough rapid transit company which saw new york tunnel extension as a potential competitor to its as yet incomplete rapid transit service city had initially declined to give prr a franchise because city officials believed that prr needed to grant thirteen concessions to protect city interests prr ultimately conceded nine of city s requests project was approved by new york city board of aldermen in december 1902 on a 41 36 vote north and east river tunnels were to be built under riverbed of their respective rivers prr and lirr lines would converge at what would become new york penn station an immense passenger station on east side of 8th avenue between 31st and 33rd streets in manhattan entire project was expected to cost over 100 million cassatt s design for new york penn station was inspired by gare d orsay a beaux arts style station in paris though he planned for new terminal to be twice as large he commissioned charles mckim of new york architectural firm mckim mead white to design terminal mckim envisioned a space that would celebrate entrance to one of great metropolitan cities of world he studied role of public buildings in ancient rome including baths of diocletian cassatt and mckim collaborated closely to define structure of station their original plan called for a structure measuring long by wide with three floors open to passengers and 25 tracks as part of terminal s construction prr proposed that united states postal service construct a post office across from station on west side of 8th avenue in february 1903 u s government accepted prr s proposal and made plans to construct what would later become farley post office prr would also build a train storage yard in queens east of penn station to be used by both prr trains from west and lirr trains from east yard s purpose was to store passenger train cars at beginning or end of their trips as well as to reverse direction of locomotives that pulled these train cars construction land purchases for station started in late 1901 or early 1902 prr purchased a site bounded by seventh and ninth avenues between 31st and 33rd streets this site was chosen over other sites further east such as herald square because these parts of manhattan were already congested penn station proper would be located along eastern part of site between seventh and eighth avenue northwestern block bounded by eighth avenue ninth avenue 32nd street and 33rd street was not part of original plan condemnation of seventeen city owned buildings on terminal s future site an area of four blocks was commenced in june 1903 all of 304 parcels within four block area which were collectively owned by 225 to 250 entities had been purchased by november 1903 prr purchased land west of ninth avenue in april 1904 such that it owned all land between seventh and tenth avenues from 31st to 33rd street this land would allow prr to build extra railroad switches for tracks in penn station prr also made purchases along north side of future station between 33rd and 34th streets so it could create a pedestrian walkway leading directly to 34th street a major crosstown thoroughfare properties between 33rd and 34th street that prr had purchased were transferred to prr ownership in 1908 clearing site entailed displacing thousands of residents from largely african american community in what was once known as tenderloin district in manhattan a 5 million contract to excavate site was awarded in june 1904 marking start of actual construction process overall some 500 buildings had to be demolished to make way for station even as excavation proceeded federal government was still deciding whether to build a post office next to prr station prr planned to turn over air rights to blocks between eighth and ninth avenues to federal government once excavations were completed however prr would still own land below post office and so some congress members opposed post office plan as they believed that government would only own a chunk of space in air above tracks postmaster of new york city william russell willcox ultimately approved post office anyway mckim mead white which had designed penn station was selected to design post office in 1908 by this time excavations were near completion and structural steel for post office building were being laid in june 1906 new york new haven and hartford railroad applied for and received a franchise to operate trains from northeastern suburbs of new york city to new york penn station new haven would be able to accomplish this by constructing a spur from four track new haven railroad and new york central railroad main line in bronx these railroads are now respectively modern day new haven line and harlem line of metro north railroad spur now port morris branch would split north of melrose station in south bronx then merge with harlem river and port chester railroad hr pc now part of northeast corridor just north of harlem river hr pc would pass from bronx to queens via hell gate bridge then continue south through queens eventually connecting to east river tunnels and penn station north river and east river tunnels ran almost in a straight line between queens and new jersey interrupted only by proposed pennsylvania railroad station technology for tunnels connecting to penn station was so innovative that in 1907 prr shipped an actual diameter section of new east river tunnels to jamestown exposition in norfolk virginia to celebrate 300th anniversary of nearby founding of colony at jamestown same tube with an inscription indicating that it had been displayed at exposition was later installed under water and remains in use construction was completed on hudson river tunnels on october 9 1906 and on east river tunnels on march 18 1908 construction also progressed on penn station during this time workers began laying stonework for station in june 1908 and they had completed thirteen months later new york penn station was officially declared complete on august 29 1910 a small portion of penn station was opened nearly two weeks later on september 8 in conjunction with opening of east river tunnels as a result lirr riders gained direct railroad service to manhattan prior to opening of penn station lirr riders entered manhattan via 34th street ferry terminal where they could transfer to an elevated shuttle station rest of station opened on november 27 1910 one hundred thousand people visited station during its first day of full service excluding 25 000 commuters and intercity riders with station s full opening prr became only railroad to enter new york city from south at station s completion total project cost to pennsylvania railroad for station and associated tunnels was 114 million equivalent to billion in according to an interstate commerce commission report railroad paid tribute to cassatt who died in 1906 with a statue designed by adolph alexander weinman in station s grand arcade statue which was preserved at railroad museum of pennsylvania was inscribed operation thumb left one of early electric locomotives arrives at penn station ca 1910 when penn station first opened it had a capacity of 144 trains per hour on its 21 tracks and 11 platforms at start of operations there were 1 000 trains scheduled every weekday of these 600 were lirr trains while other 400 were prr trains commuting times of lirr riders were cut by up to a half hour station was so heavily used that prr soon added 51 trains to its daily schedule station also served new haven trains to westchester county and connecticut after hell gate bridge opened in 1917 during half a century of operation many intercity passenger trains arrived and departed daily to chicago and st louis where passengers could make connection to other railroads along with long island rail road trains penn station saw trains of new haven and lehigh valley railroads a side effect of tunneling project was to open city up to suburbs and within 10 years of opening two thirds of daily passengers coming through penn station were commuters station put pennsylvania railroad at comparative advantage to its competitors offering service to west and south baltimore ohio b o central of new jersey erie and lackawanna railroads began their routes at terminals in new jersey requiring travelers bound for new york city to use ferries or interstate hudson tubes to traverse hudson river during world war i and early 1920s rival b o passenger trains to washington d c chicago and st louis also used penn station initially by order of united states railroad administration until pennsylvania railroad terminated b o s access in 1926 atypically for a public building penn station was well maintained during its heyday such was station s status that whenever president of united states arrived in new york by rail he would arrive and depart on tracks 11 and 12 royalty and leaders of other countries also traveled via penn station thumb right a train approaching station from new jersey 1910 over next few decades alterations were made to penn station in order to increase its capacity lirr concourse waiting room and amenities were expanded platforms were expanded and connections were provided to new york city subway stations at seventh avenue and eighth avenue electrification of penn station was initially 600 v dc third rail it was later changed to 11 000 v ac overhead catenary when electrification of prr s mainline was extended to washington d c in early 1930s by 1935 penn station had served over a billion passengers a greyhound lines bus terminal was built to north of penn station facing 34th street in 1935 however within a decade bus terminal had gone into decline and was frequented by low level criminals and homeless greyhound bus terminal soon saw competition from port authority bus terminal located seven blocks north of penn station which opened in 1950 dispute continued for almost a decade afterward and by 1962 greyhound had closed penn station bus terminal and moved to port authority bus terminal station was busiest during world war ii in 1945 more than 100 million passengers traveled through penn station station s decline came soon afterward with beginning of jet age and construction of interstate highway system however station had already gone into decline as early as 1930s and by 1950s its ornate pink granite exterior had become coated with grime prr recorded its first ever annual operating losses in 1947 and intercity rail passenger volumes continued to decline dramatically over next decade a renovation in late 1950s covered some of grand columns with plastic and blocked off spacious central hallway with clamshell a new ticket office designed by lester c tichy architectural critic lewis mumford wrote in new yorker in 1958 that nothing further that could be done to station could damage it advertisements surrounded station s seventh avenue concourse while stores and restaurants were crammed around eighth avenue side s mezzanine a layer of dirt covered interior and exterior of structure and pink granite was stained with gray another architectural critic ada louise huxtable wrote in new york times in 1963 tragedy is that our own times not only could not produce such a building but cannot even maintain it demolition thumb left seen in 1962 pennsylvania railroad optioned air rights of new york penn station to real estate developer william zeckendorf in 1954 zeckendorf had previously suggested that two block site of main building could be used for a world trade center option allowed for demolition of main building and train shed which could be replaced by an office and sports complex underground platforms and tracks of station would not be modified but station s mezzanines would be reconfigured a blueprint for a palace of progress was released in 1955 but was not acted upon plans for new madison square garden above penn station were announced in 1962 by irving m felt president of graham paige company that purchased air rights to penn station in exchange for air rights pennsylvania railroad would get a brand new air conditioned smaller station completely below street level at no cost and a 25 percent stake in new madison square garden complex a 28 story hotel and 34 story office building now part of penn plaza would be built on eastern side of block facing seventh avenue arena proper would take up most of block facing eighth avenue to west at time one argument made in favor of old penn station s demolition was that cost of maintaining structure had become prohibitive its grand scale made prr devote a fortune to its upkeep as mentioned above head house s exterior had become somewhat grimy those who opposed demolition considered whether it made sense to preserve a building intended to be a cost effective and functional piece of city s infrastructure simply as a monument to past as a new york times editorial critical of demolition noted at time any city gets what it wants is willing to pay for and ultimately deserves editorial goes on to say that we will probably be judged not by monuments we build but by those we have destroyed modern architects rushed to save ornate building although it was contrary to their own styles they called station a treasure and chanted don t amputate renovate at rallies despite controversy generated over demolition felt stated that he believed that gain from new buildings and sports center would more than offset any aesthetic loss he elaborated fifty years from now when it s time for madison square garden to be torn down there will be a new group of architects who will protest despite large public opposition to penn station s demolition new york city department of city planning voted in january 1963 to start demolishing station that summer architects protested politely but to no effect thumb demolition of station in 1966 under leadership of prr president stuart t saunders who later headed penn central transportation demolition of above ground station house began on october 28 1963 a giant steel deck was placed above tracks and platforms allowing rail service to continue with only minor disruptions this was possible because most of rail infrastructure including waiting room concourses and platforms was below street level around five hundred columns were sunk into platforms while passengers were routed around work areas surrounded by plywood madison square garden and two office towers were built above extensively renovated concourses and waiting area new york penn station ny great american stations project amtrak 2013 accessed october 5 2013 first girders for madison square garden were placed in late 1965 and by summer 1966 much of station had been demolished except for seventh avenue entrance by late 1966 much of new station had been built there were three new entrances one from 31st street and eighth avenue another from 33rd street and eighth avenue and a third from a driveway running midblock between seventh and eighth avenues from 31st to 33rd streets

weinman lying in a landfill in new jersey meadowlands inspired new jersey conservation and economic development commissioner robert a roe to salvage some of sculptures new york times architecture critic michael kimmelman compared demolition of head house unfavorably to that of lenox library destroyed to make way for frick collection or old waldorf astoria razed for construction of empire state building he claimed that it broke a long tradition of new yorkers accepting that what replaced a beloved building would be as good or better controversy over original head house s demolition is cited as a catalyst for architectural preservation movement in united states particularly in new york city in 1965 two years after penn station s demolition commenced city passed a landmarks preservation act thereby creating new york city landmarks preservation commission new york city s other major railroad station grand central terminal was also proposed for demolition in 1968 by grand central s owner penn central grand central terminal was ultimately preserved through city s landmarks act despite an unsuccessful challenge from penn central in 1978 present day thumb left amtrak concourse of

of steel of brick and 30 000 light bulbs at time of penn station s completion new york times called it largest building in world ever built at one time exterior exterior of penn station was marked by an imposing sober colonnade of roman unfluted columns based on classical greek doric order these columns in turn were modeled after landmarks such as acropolis of athens rest of facade was modeled from st peter s square in vatican city as well as from bank of england headquarters colonnades embodied sophisticated integration of multiple functions and circulation of people and goods mckim mead white s design combined glass and steel train sheds and a magnificently proportioned concourse with a monumental entrance to new york city station itself had entrances from all four sides twin carriageways from streets modeled after berlin s brandenburg gate led to two railroads station served one carriageway led from north side of building serving lirr trains while other led from south side serving prr trains above each carriageway entrance was a colonnade entrance arcade thumb right main waiting room with bronze statue of prr president alexander johnston cassatt in niche on left main entrance was from a shopping arcade that led westward from intersection of 7th avenue and 32nd street two plaques were placed at seventh avenue entrance of station on one plaque were inscribed names of individuals who had led new york tunnel extension project other plaque contained franchise dates and names of contractors cassatt wanted to give passengers a cultural experience upon their arrival in new york he modeled arcade after those in milan and naples filling it with high end boutiques and shops arcade measured wide a width similar to that of 32nd street and was long entrance to this arcade was considered to be grandest of penn station s entrances colonnade above this entrance was above ground level and doric columns supporting it had diameters of at western end of arcade a

series of glass domes that were held up by plain steel framework lirr trains had exclusive use of station s northernmost four tracks while prr was exclusively assigned southernmost tracks two railroads shared center tracks as necessary lirr commuters could also use an entrance on northern side along 33rd street there was an additional mezzanine level below main concourse and waiting room and it contained two smaller concourses one for each railroad smaller northern mezzanine used by lirr connected to lirr platforms via short stairs and to 33rd street entrance via escalators smaller southern mezzanine used by prr contained stairs and elevators between prr platforms and level of main exit concourse and waiting room at platform level there were 21 tracks serving 11 platforms and
