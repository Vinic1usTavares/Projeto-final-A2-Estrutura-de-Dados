wacht class was a pair of avisos built by imperial german navy in late 1880s class comprised two ships and they were laid down in 1886 and 1887 and completed by 1888 and 1889 respectively ships were based on previous aviso which had proved to be an unsuccessful design due to its lack of torpedo armament as a result wacht class ships were equipped with three torpedo tubes to improve their combat power they were also first german avisos to carry armor protection both ships served in main german fleet for entirety of their active duty careers they were primarily employed in peacetime routine of unit and fleet training maneuvers in september 1901 wacht was accidentally rammed by ironclad during annual fleet maneuvers collision caused serious damage to wacht and she quickly sank jagd continued in service for another three years after which she was withdrawn from service and used in various roles over following sixteen years she was sold for scrapping in 1920 design german kaiserliche marine imperial navy had begun building modern steel hulled avisos in 1880s to serve as fleet scouts and to lead flotillas of torpedo boats first of these were two ships after general leo von caprivi replaced albrecht von stosch as chief of kaiserliche admiralitat imperial admiralty in 1883 navy began to take a turn toward jeune ecole doctrine embracing concept of using small cheap torpedo boats to defend country s coast instead of expensive ironclad warships this strategy found favor in reichstag imperial diet which at that time opposed naval spending caprivi directed that next aviso to be built what became wacht class should be smaller and faster able to keep pace with latest torpedo boats resulting ships proved to be disappointments in service their smaller size rendered them poor sea boats which was revealed only after they had been completed and conducted sea trials additionally their gun battery was too weak to allow them to effectively engage comparable vessels in other fleets both of these defects limited their utility as fleet scouts class did introduce some improvements over previous designs however including an armor deck and protection for conning tower along with electric lighting for ships general characteristics wacht class ships were long at waterline and long overall they had a beam of and a maximum draft of forward and aft they displaced as designed and up to at full combat load their hulls were constructed from transverse steel frames wacht and jagd each had a crew of 7 officers and 134 enlisted men ships carried several smaller boats including one picket boat one yawl one dinghy and one cutter they were poor sea boats they rolled and pitched badly and were very wet they were also not particularly maneuverable vessels machinery their propulsion system consisted of two angled 3 cylinder triple expansion engines that each drove a wide three bladed screw steam for engines was provided by four coal fired locomotive boilers trunked into a single funnel amidships in 1891 1893 new boilers manufactured by schichau werke and kaiserliche werft imperial shipyard in wilhelmshaven were installed ships were equipped with a pair of electric generators with a combined output of at 67 volts ships propulsion system provided a top speed of and was rated at though neither ship reached that horsepower in service they carried up to of coal which enabled them to steam for approximately at steering was controlled by a single rudder armament and armor as built ships were armed with three k l 35 guns placed in single pivot mounts guns were supplied with a total of 180 rounds of ammunition and had a range of wacht and jagd also carried three torpedo tubes one mounted submerged in bow and other two in deck mounted launchers on broadside in 1891 four 8 8 cm sk l 30 quick firing guns in single mounts replaced 10 5 cm guns ships were first german aviso to carry armor a thick deck with thick sloped sides protected magazines and engine rooms conning tower was protected with of armor plating on sides and 10 mm on roof coaming around funnel was thick armor consisted of compound wrought iron for protection against underwater attack hull was divided into twelve watertight compartments below armored deck and ten compartments above it ships shipbuilderlaid downlaunchedcompleted ag weser bremen august 1886 27 august 1887 9 august 1888 ag weser

embarked on a major training cruise to mediterranean sea in company with four ironclad warships and imperial yacht hohenzollern for a series of visits by kaiser wilhelm ii to greece ottoman empire austro hungarian empire and italy by time ships returned to germany jagd had entered service as a guard ship in wilhelmshaven though she escorted wilhelm ii aboard hohenzollern for another pair of cruises in north sea in 1890 and 1891 both ships also took part in peacetime routine of training exercises that culminated in major fleet maneuvers every august and september by 1893 wacht had begun to serve as a flotilla leader for torpedo boats jagd was first vessel to pass through kaiser wilhelm canal in march 1895 before waterway officially opened in june her passage was a test of lock system to ensure that it worked properly in mid 1890s ships began to operate as avisos with capital ships of main fleet in this role they served as scouts relayed signals and screened them from torpedo boat attacks in early 1901 jagd went to britain as part of fleet that represented germany at funeral of queen victoria but by 11 august a survey of ship had determined that she was in poor condition and so she was removed from service on 4 september wacht accidentally collided with ironclad during training exercises sachsens ram bow badly damaged wacht below waterline causing her to rapidly sink though her entire crew was safely evacuated jagd saw little use she was struck from naval register in may 1910 and then used as a torpedo launching platform for torpedo training she was ultimately sold to ship breakers in 1920 notes references category avisos of imperial german navy
