authority over island by singapore and its predecessor united kingdom actions taken included selecting pedra branca as site for horsburgh lighthouse and constructing lighthouse requiring malaysian officials wishing to visit island to obtain permits installing a military rebroadcast station on island and studying feasibility of reclaiming land around island malaysia had remained silent in face of these activities in addition it had confirmed in a 1953 letter that johor did not claim ownership of island and had published official reports and maps indicating that it regarded pedra branca as singapore territory middle rocks and south ledge should be regarded as dependencies of pedra branca malaysia s case was that johor had original title to pedra branca middle rocks and south ledge johor had not ceded pedra branca to united kingdom but had merely granted permission for lighthouse to be built and maintained on it actions of united kingdom and singapore in respect of horsburgh lighthouse and waters surrounding island were not actions of island s sovereign further 1953 letter had been unauthorised and official reports and maps it had issued were either irrelevant or inconclusive on 23 may 2008 court ruled that pedra branca is under singapore s sovereignty while middle rocks belongs to malaysia as regards south ledge court noted that it falls within apparently overlapping territorial waters generated by mainland malaysia pedra branca and middle rocks as it is a maritime feature visible only at low tide it belongs to state in territorial waters of which it

was not resolved by an exchange of correspondence and intergovernmental talks in 1993 and 1994 in first round of talks in february 1993 issue of sovereignty over middle rocks and south ledge was also

captain thomas robertson to produce painting based on an 1850 sketch by thomson pedra branca terra nullius singapore argued that in 1847 pedra branca was terra nullius latin for land belonging to no one as it had never been subject of a prior claim or manifestation of sovereignty by any sovereign entity it denied malaysia s claim that island had been under johor s sovereignty pedra branca case para 40 it contended there was no evidence that johor sultanate had claimed or exercised authority over pedra branca between 1512 and 1641 this period began with fall of malacca sultanate to portuguese in 1512 who continued to harass johor sultanate during this time as did aceh sultanate similarly there was no evidence of johor s sovereignty over pedra branca between 1641 and 1699 when johor s power and influence were at their height between 1699 and 1784 when death of sultan mahmud shah ii in 1699 without a clear heir led to instability during which many vassals broke away from sultanate and between 1784 and 1824 when according to a 1949 annual report of johor government sultanate was in a state of dissolution by beginning of 19th century pedra branca case paras 49 and 51 to support its assertion that sultan of johor did not have sovereignty over pedra branca singapore contended that traditional malay concept of sovereignty was based mainly on control over people and not over territory thus only reliable way to determine whether a particular territory belonged to a ruler was to find out whether inhabitants pledged allegiance to that ruler this was difficult to do with respect to pedra branca since it was isolated and uninhabited and malaysia had not provided clear evidence of a direct claim to or actual exercise of sovereign authority over island pedra branca case paras 76 and 77 in addition singapore claimed that old johor sultanate which controlled a maritime malay empire from a capital on johor river was not same as new johor sultanate occupying only southern tip of malay peninsula that came into existence after signing of anglo dutch treaty of 1824 between united kingdom and netherlands pedra branca case para 84 in its view anglo dutch treaty did not divide up singapore strait in which pedra branca is situated between new johor sultanate under british sphere of influence and riau lingga sultanate under dutch influence instead both britain and netherlands could access strait freely therefore there was a legal vacuum with regard to sovereignty over island enabling british to lawfully take possession of it between 1847 and 1851 pedra branca case paras 93 and 94 following death of sultan mahmud shah iii of johor in 1812 his two sons hussein and abdul rahman vied for throne of johor sultanate united kingdom recognised elder son hussein who was based in singapore as rightful heir while netherlands recognised younger son abdul rahman who was based in riau now bintan indonesia a year after anglo dutch treaty abdul rahman sent a letter dated 25 june 1825 to hussein in it he stated that in complete agreement with spirit and content of treaty concluded between their majesties kings of netherlands and great britain he donated to his older brother t he part of lands assigned to great britain on basis of this letter singapore argued that abdul rahman had only donated mainland territories to hussein and had retained sovereignty over all islands in sea pedra branca therefore never became a part of johor pedra branca case para 111 lawful taking of ownership thumb horsburgh lighthouse a painting by john turnbull thomson showing island of pedra branca in 1851 just after completion of lighthouse he designed in event that court rejected argument that pedra branca was terra nullius in 1847 singapore contended that selection of pedra branca as site for horsburgh lighthouse and construction of lighthouse between 1847 and 1851 constituted a taking of possession of island a titre de souverain with title of a sovereign british crown obtained title over island in accordance with legal principles governing acquisition of territory at that time this title was maintained by united kingdom and its lawful successor republic of singapore pedra branca case paras 39 and 123 singapore claimed that it and its predecessor united kingdom had demonstrated a consistent exercise of authority over island through various acts since 1847 for instance during ceremony for laying of foundation stone of lighthouse on 24 may 1850 pedra branca was described as a dependency of singapore in presence of governor of straits settlements most senior british official in singapore and other british and foreign officials attribution of sovereignty was widely reported in local newspapers but drew no response from johor authorities para 26 of other significant acts included following singapore had investigated shipwrecks in waters around island between 1920 and 1979 pedra branca case para 233 it had exercised exclusive control over use of island and visits to island including requiring malaysian officials wishing to visit island for scientific surveys to obtain permits pedra branca case paras 235 238 see also it had displayed british and singapore ensigns from horsburgh lighthouse furthermore it had acceded to a request by malaysia in 1968 to remove singapore flag from another island pulau pisang which is under malaysian

for project were sought through newspaper advertisements though eventually project was not proceeded with pedra branca case para 249 in addition singapore had on two occasions claimed sea around pedra branca as its territorial waters first occasion was in july 1952 when chief surveyor expressed opinion that singapore should claim a limit around island para 18 of subsequently in 1967 singapore government s marine department also stated in an official memorandum to ministry of foreign affairs singapore that waters within three miles of pedra branca might be considered singapore territorial waters para 32 of malaysia s inaction and acceptance of singapore s sovereignty thumb 21 september 1953 letter from acting state secretary of johor to colonial secretary of singapore indicating that johor does not claim ownership of pedra branca it was also singapore s case that for over 130 years since 1847 malaysia had been silent over singapore s activities and exercise of sovereignty over pedra branca no other state had challenged singapore s claims and she had done so without having to seek approval from any other state during hearing ambassador at large tommy koh highlighted this by saying on 12 june 1953 when singapore was a crown colony its colonial secretary j d higham wrote to british adviser to sultan of johor to clarify status of pedra branca he noted that rock was outside limits ceded by sultan hussein shah and temenggung with island of singapore under 1824 crawfurd treaty they had entered into with east india company pedra branca case para 102 however colonial government had been maintaining lighthouse built on it and t his by international usage no doubt confers some rights and obligations on colony he therefore asked if there is any document showing a lease or grant of rock or whether it has been ceded by government of state of johore or in any other way disposed of pedra branca case para 192 acting state secretary of johor m seth bin replied on 21 september that johore government does not claim ownership of pedra branca pedra branca case para 196 singapore contended that this reply confirmed singapore s sovereignty over island and that johor had no title historic or otherwise to it pedra branca case para 214 colony of singapore became a self governing state in 1959 and left british empire to join federation of malaysia in 1963 two years later in 1965 singapore became a fully independent republic in 1959 in an official publication regarding meteorological information collected on pedra branca malaya listed horsburgh lighthouse as a singapore station together with sultan shoal and raffles lighthouses lighthouse on pedra branca was described in same way in a joint malaysian and singaporean publication in 1966 year after singapore left federation in 1967 when two countries began reporting meteorological information separately malaysia ceased referring to horsburgh lighthouse pedra branca case para 265 in maps published by malayan and malaysian surveyor general and director of general mapping in 1962 1965 1970 1974 and 1975 island was indicated with word singapore or singapura under it same designation was used for an island that was unquestionably under singapore s sovereignty on other hand designation was not used for pulau pisang an island under malaysian sovereignty on which singapore operated a lighthouse pedra branca case para 269 at a news conference in may 1980 attended by malaysia s former prime minister tun hussein onn and singapore s then prime minister lee kuan yew malaysian leader admitted that question of sovereignty over pedra branca was not very clear to malaysia on 19 november 2007 singapore deputy prime minister s jayakumar refuted malaysia s claim that singapore was attempting to subvert status quo by claiming sovereignty of pedra branca he said singapore was an honest law abiding state that has never and will never do anything to endanger navigational safety security arrangements or singapore strait s environment rather it was malaysia that had sought to alter status quo by publishing a map in 1979 that altered maritime boundaries with seven neighbouring countries this was evidenced by a telegram that malaysian government had sent to its overseas missions in december 1979 notifying them that map would affect brunei china indonesia philippines thailand singapore and vietnam pedra branca middle rocks and south ledge one entity singapore took position that pedra branca middle rocks and south ledge should be considered a single group of maritime features as middle rocks and south ledge were dependencies of pedra branca it relied among others on island of palmas case 1932 as regards a group of islands it is possible that a group may under certain circumstances be regarded as in law a unit and that fate of principal part may involve rest reports of international arbitral awards vol ii 1949 p 855 pedra branca case para 280 it argued that three maritime features were geomorphologically same as rock samples showed that they were all composed of a light coarse grained biotite granite pedra branca case para 282 additionally malaysia had not shown any exercise of sovereignty over uninhabited reefs of middle rocks and south ledge while singapore had consistently exercised sovereign authority in surrounding waters since sovereignty over pedra branca belonged to singapore so did sovereignty over middle rocks and south ledge as they were within pedra branca s territorial waters pedra branca case para 283 malaysia s case pedra branca not terra nullius thumb upright detail of a map of dominions of johore and of island of sumatra with adjacent islands 1727 by alexander hamilton showing island of malaysia s case was that it had original title to pedra branca from time immemorial pedra branca case para 48 island could not at any relevant time have been terra nullius as it is and had always been part of johor which is now a state of malaysia nothing that united kingdom or singapore had done had displaced its sovereignty over it pedra branca case para 37 contrary to what singapore had claimed there had been no break between old sultanate of johor and new johor sultanate ruled by sultan hussein that came into existence after signing of 1824 anglo dutch treaty treaty had effect of leaving islands south of singapore strait within dutch sphere of influence riau lingga sultanate while territory and islands in strait and to its north were within british sphere of influence new johor sultanate pedra branca case para 92 see also a few months after conclusion of anglo dutch treaty sultan and temenggung of johor entered into crawfurd treaty with east india company on 2 august 1824 article ii of crawfurd treaty stated since johor could not have ceded singapore island and islets in its vicinity to british if it lacked title to them this was evidence that united kingdom recognised prior and continuing sovereignty of johor sultanate over all islands in and around singapore strait pedra branca case paras 104 105 see also malaysia challenged singapore s contention that pedra branca never became part of new johor sultanate because 25 june 1825 letter from sultan abdul rahman of riau lingga to sultan hussain showed that abdul rahman had only donated territories on mainland of malay peninsula to hussein and had retained sovereignty over all islands in sea malaysia submitted abdul rahman s statement that his territory extends out over islands of lingga bintan galang bulan and all other islands had to be read in context of article xii of 1824 anglo dutch treaty which guaranteed that no british establishment would be made on carimon isles or on island of bantam bintang lingin or on any of other islands south of straits of singapore three of islands mentioned by abdul rahman bintan and lingga were islands that british had agreed were not within their sphere of influence while other two bulan and galang lay south of singapore strait therefore phrase all other islands in abdul rahman s letter referred only to islands lying within dutch sphere of influence letter was simply formal recognition that abdul rahman did not claim sovereignty over johor pedra branca case para 112 johor sultanate s title to island was also confirmed by ties of loyalty that existed between sultanate and orang laut a nomadic sea people who in past had inhabited maritime areas of singapore strait carrying out fishing and piracy and had visited pedra branca quite frequently this was evidenced by three 19th century letters written by british officials including one dated november 1850 by john turnbull thomson government surveyor of singapore which had reported on need to exclude orang laut from pedra branca where horsburgh lighthouse was being built thomson noted that they frequently visit rock so their visits should never be encouraged nor any trust put in them in straits and islets of neighbouring shores and islands many lives are taken by these people pedra branca case paras 70 71 74 75 malaysia rejected singapore s argument that traditional malay concept of sovereignty was based mainly on control over people and not over territory it stated that authority in states throughout world is based on a combination of control over people and territory and that this applies to malay states as it does to any other state since johor sultanate was established in 16th century it always had rulers who were recognised as such and who thus commanded people s allegiance and therefore controlled territory where those people lived pedra branca case para 78 actions of united kingdom and singapore those of lighthouse operator malaysia averred that actions of united kingdom and its successor singapore in constructing and maintaining horsburgh lighthouse on pedra branca were actions of operator of lighthouse and not sovereign of island johor had at no time ceded island to united kingdom but instead had merely granted permission for lighthouse to be built and maintained on it pedra branca case para 118 see also para 18 of captain james horsburgh a scottish hydrographer to british east india company who had prepared many charts and sailing instructions for east indies china new holland cape of good hope and other intermediate ports died in may 1836 merchants and

by 1844 preference had been expressed for romania outer island or peak rock pedra branca case para 128 some time in november 1844 governor of straits settlements william john butterworth wrote to sultan and temenggung of johor regarding matter his letters have not been found but english translations of replies dated 25 november 1844 exist sultan said temenggung responded thus three days later on 28 november 1844 governor wrote to secretary of government in india to recommend that lighthouse be sited on peak rock among other things he said that t his rock is part of territories of rajah of johore who with tamongong have willingly consented to cede it gratuitously to east india company and enclosed replies received from sultan and temenggung nonetheless malaysia argued that sultan and temenggung s letters amounted to no more than permission to united kingdom to build and operate a lighthouse on peak rock or some other suitable location pedra branca case para 135 see also paras 8 and 9 of on 13 november malaysia s agent ambassador at large abdul kadir mohamad alleged that singapore was trying to subvert a 150 year old arrangement under which singapore operated horsburgh lighthouse on pedra branca which was malaysia s territory he also suggested that if permitted to do so singapore would upset peace and stability of area where island is located he said that if singapore reclaimed land around pedra branca q apart from possible effects on environment and navigation in strait this could lead to potentially serious changes to security arrangements in eastern entrance of strait according to malaysian attorney general abdul gani patail singapore had first raised issue of sovereignty over pedra branca on 13 april 1978 during a meeting between officials saying it had incontrovertible legal evidence of its sovereignty over island though it had never produced any documents in support prior to that sovereignty of island had never been disputed 1980 statement by then malaysian prime minister tun hussein onn concerning unclear position of island had also been premised on these documents which former singapore prime minister lee kuan yew had claimed were in singapore s possession statement was therefore merely a friendly and respectful statement of a visiting prime minister at a press conference which had no probative value in court all hussein onn had meant was that matter required further discussion between two countries 1953 letter by acting state secretary of johor unauthorised concerning letter of 21 september 1953 in which acting state secretary of johor informed colonial secretary of singapore that johore government does not claim ownership of pedra branca malaysia submitted that colonial secretary s enquiry of 12 june 1953 about status of pedra branca showed that singapore authorities had no conviction that island was part of its territory pedra branca case para 209 further acting state secretary was definitely not authorized and did not have legal capacity to write 1953 letter or to renounce disclaim or confirm title of any part of territories of johor under two treaties of 21 january 1948 johor agreement between british crown and sultan of johor and federation of malaya agreement between british crown and nine malay states including johor johor transferred all its rights power and jurisdiction on matters relating to defence and external affairs to united kingdom these powers were exercisable by federal high commissioner appointed by united kingdom and not by johor state secretary pedra branca case para 211 acting state secretary had improperly taken it upon himself to reply to colonial secretary s letter and had not submitted a copy of it to chief secretary of johor there was no evidence that chief secretary or high commissioner was aware of its contents singapore s actions in respect of pedra branca not as sovereign regarding singapore s contentions that it had exercised sovereign authority over pedra branca in various ways malaysia responded as indicated below investigation of shipwrecks in vicinity of pedra branca singapore had duties to investigate hazards to navigational safety and to publish information about such hazards in its capacity as a lighthouse operator and under united nations convention on law of sea and convention on safety of life at sea therefore by investigating and reporting on shipwrecks and maritime hazards within pedra branca s territorial waters singapore had acted in accordance with best practice and not a titre de souverain circumstances of particular investigations also meant that singapore s ability to carry them out was not based on its sovereignty over island pedra branca case para 222 display of british and singapore ensigns on island ensigns associated with maritime matters are marks of nationality and not sovereignty singapore had also not demonstrated any sovereign intent in flying of british and singapore ensigns from horsburgh lighthouse pulau pisang incident was not an acknowledgement by malaysia of singapore s sovereignty over pedra branca it had been a matter of domestic political sensibility pulau pisang is much larger than pedra branca and has a small local population pedra branca case para 245 see also installation of military communications equipment and plans to reclaim land malaysia alleged that singapore s installation of military communications equipment on pedra branca was done secretly and that it had only learned about this when it received singapore s memorial in case as regards singapore s plans to reclaim land around island malaysia said it could not have reacted to some of documents as they had been secret meteorological reports irrelevant maps inconclusive in response to singapore s contention in respect of meteorological reports published by malaysia that had indicated pedra branca as a singapore station malaysia said fact that it recognised horsburgh lighthouse as a singapore rainfall station did not amount an acknowledgement of sovereignty six maps that it had published between 1962 and 1975 which had printed word singapore or singapura beneath island were inconclusive this was because annotating could be assessed differently maps contained disclaimers stating they could not be considered an authority on delimitation of international or other boundaries and maps do not create title and cannot amount to admissions unless incorporated into treaties or used in inter state negotiations pedra branca case paras 270 and 271 middle rocks and south ledge belong to malaysia malaysia contended that pedra branca middle rocks and south ledge were not a single identifiable entity historical record showed that three maritime features were never formally described as a single island with islands or as a group of islands middle rocks and south ledge were therefore under johor sovereignty at time of 1824 anglo dutch treaty and fell within british sphere of influence under treaty pedra branca case paras 284 and 285 malaysia had exercised consistent acts of sovereignty over them within limits of their character for instance in 1968 malaysian government used and granted petroleum concessions which extended to area of middle rocks and south ledge pedra branca case paras 251 252 pedra branca case para 286 also an internal confidential document dated 16 july 1968 entitled letter of promulgation by chief of royal malaysian navy included charts showing that pedra branca middle rocks and south ledge were within malaysia s territorial waters pedra branca case para 242 and features were included within malaysian fisheries waters in fisheries act 1985 singapore had neither protested against these manifestations of sovereignty nor advanced any claims over middle rocks and south ledge in 1980 when it began claiming that pedra branca belonged to it pedra branca case para 287 controversies reliability of malaysia s photograph of pedra branca in course of hearing to demonstrate pedra branca s proximity to johor mainland malaysia produced a photograph taken of pedra branca with point romania and a hill named mount berbukit both in johor in background however on 19 november 2007 singapore produced another photograph taken using a camera that approximated what human eye sees and pointed out that in it mount berbukit appeared much smaller it alleged that malaysia s photograph had been taken using a telephoto lens which had exaggerated height of mount berbukit by about seven times singapore s then attorney general chao hick tin said that photograph had been an attempt to convey a subliminal message of proximity between pedra branca and coast of johor but it was not an accurate reflection of what visitors to pedra branca would see if they were looking towards johor malaysia claimed its photograph was obtained from an online blog singapore called blog most unusual noting that it had been created only a month earlier that photograph had only been uploaded on 2 november four days before oral proceedings in case had commenced and that there was no information on blogger s identity in its rebuttal on 24 november malaysia said that difference between photographs was all a question of perspective and that matter was not worth discussing missing 1844 letters a key thrust of malaysia s case was that british had received explicit permission from johor to build a lighthouse on pedra branca which proved that british had recognised johor s sovereignty over island it submitted that this was evidenced by november 1844 letters that governor butterworth had written to sultan and temenggung of johor regarding construction of lighthouse malaysia said it had written to singapore asking for copies of letters because if letters still existed they were probably in singapore s archives in a file entitled letters to native rulers however singapore had never replied singapore s response was that it did not have copies of letters its archives were incomplete and searches for them in other archives had been in vain furthermore letters were more likely to be in malaysia s possession as governor had sent them to johor rulers in his rebuttal of malaysia s case on 19 november 2007 singapore s deputy prime minister and minister for law s jayakumar expressed disappointment with malaysia s insinuation that singapore had concealed letters from court which he termed most disturbing baseless and distracting malaysia did not mention matter further in its rebuttal on 24 november icj decision icj rendered its decision on 23 may 2008 it held by 12 votes to four that sovereignty over pedra branca belongs to singapore it further held by 15 votes to one that sovereignty over middle rocks belongs to malaysia and sovereignty over south ledge belongs to state in territorial waters of which it is located pedra branca case operative clause see also pedra branca originally under sovereignty of johor sultanate court agreed with malaysia that johor sultanate had original title to pedra branca rejecting singapore s argument that island was terra nullius pedra branca case para 69 it found it was not disputed that johor had established itself as a sovereign state with a certain territorial domain in southeast asia since it came into existence in 1512 pedra branca case para 52 as pedra branca had always been known as a navigational hazard in singapore strait which was a vital channel for international navigation in east west trade between indian ocean and south china sea it was inconceivable that island had remained undiscovered by local community it was therefore reasonable to infer that pedra branca lay within general geographical scope of johor sultanate pedra branca case para 61 further during existence of old johor sultanate there was no evidence of any competing claims over islands in singapore strait pedra branca case paras 62 and 68 citing legal status of eastern greenland 1933 permanent court of international justice series a b no 53 and island of palmas case reports of international arbitral awards vol ii 1949 p 855 it also agreed with malaysia s submission that descriptions of relationship between sultan of johor and orang laut in 19th century official british reports proved that sultan exercised sovereign authority over orang laut since orang laut made islands in singapore strait their habitat this confirmed ancient original title of johor sultanate to those islands including pedra branca pedra branca case paras 74 and 75 as regards singapore s argument that traditional concept of malay sovereignty was based on control over people rather than territory court observed that sovereignty comprises control over both persons and territory however it was not necessary to deal with point further as it had already found that johor had territorial sovereignty over pedra branca pedra branca case para 79 purpose of 1824 anglo dutch treaty was to finally settle disputes that had arisen between united kingdom and netherlands relating to their territorial possessions and commercial interests in east indies it was thus most unlikely that parties had left maritime features in singapore straits outside their spheres of influence as singapore had contended pedra branca case para 96 under article xii of treaty britain had agreed that no british establishment shall be made on carimon isles or on island of bantam bintang lingin or on any of other islands south of straits of singapore islands and islets within straits therefore fell within british sphere of influence this included pedra branca which remained part of territorial domain of new johor sultanate pedra branca case para 100 that this was british understanding of treaty was confirmed by a letter dated 4 march 1825 from government of india to john crawfurd british resident in singapore which read o ur acquisition of these islets under crawfurd treaty is not at variance with obligations of treaty concluded at london in march last 1824 anglo dutch treaty as they are all situated north of southern limits of straights of singapore emphasis added therefore britain s position was that every island north of southern limits of singapore strait fell within its sphere of influence pedra branca case para 101 court s reading of anglo dutch treaty was reinforced by letter of 25 june 1825 from sultan abdul rahman to his brother sultan hussain which did not have effect singapore attributed to it pedra branca case para 115 contrary to malaysia s submission court found that crawfurd treaty did not show that britain recognised johor s sovereignty over all islands in and around singapore strait article ii only referred to cession by sultan and temenggung of johor of island of singapore together with adjacent seas straits and islets to extent of ten geographical miles to british and could not be read as an acknowledgement by united kingdom that johor sovereignty over any other territory pedra branca case para 107 thumb left pedra branca appears to right of this detail of a map of british malaya produced by surveyor general of federated malay states and straits settlements in 1925 sovereignty over pedra branca passed to singapore icj noted that under certain circumstances sovereignty over territory may pass due to failure of state which has sovereignty to respond to other state s conduct a titre de souverain that is concrete manifestations of display of territorial sovereignty by other state island of palmas case reports of international arbitral awards vol ii 1949 p 839 see pedra branca case para 121 because there was no written agreement relating to horsburgh lighthouse and pedra branca court was unable to determine whether november 1844 replies by sultan and temenggung of johor to governor butterworth s query amounted to a cession of place that would be chosen for site of lighthouse or was merely a permission to build maintain and operate a lighthouse there pedra branca case paras 131 and 145 although governor had indicated in his 28 november 1844 letter to secretary of government in india to recommend that replies amounted to a gratuitous cession to east india company this understanding was not communicated to sultan and temenggung pedra branca case para 136 similarly fact that britain had not informed johor about its decision to site lighthouse on pedra branca might be seen either as recognition that britain only had consent to build and operate it or that johor no longer had rights over island on evidence adduced court was unable to reach a conclusion on issue pedra branca case para 148 it also did not draw any conclusions about construction and commissioning of lighthouse stating only that it saw events as bearing on issue of evolving views of authorities in johor and singapore about sovereignty over pedra branca pulau batu puteh it noted though that apart from a two day visit by temenggung and his followers to island in early june 1850 johor had no involvement in project pedra branca case para 162 court declined to accept malaysia s argument that singapore colonial secretary s query about status of pedra branca in 1953 indicated that united kingdom had no conviction that island was part of its territory it felt letter of inquiry showed singapore authorities were not clear about events that had occurred over a century earlier and that they were unsure their records were complete which was understandable in circumstances it also disagreed that acting state secretary of johor who had stated in his letter of reply that johor did not claim ownership of island had acted without authority johor agreement was irrelevant as colonial secretary was a representative of united kingdom government which was not a foreign state in relation to johor at time there was no question of united kingdom having to consent to johor issuing reply federation of malaya agreement also did not assist malaysia because action of responding to a request for information was not an exercise of executive authority further since malaysia had not invoked this argument in its negotiations with singapore and in icj proceedings until late in oral phase singapore was entitled to presume that acting state secretary had acted within his authority pedra branca case paras 218 and 219 meaning of reply was clear as of 1953 johor understood it did not have sovereignty over pedra branca and thus singapore authorities had no reason to doubt that island belonged to united kingdom pedra branca case para 223 see also court regarded as conduct a titre de souverain singapore s investigation of six shipwrecks in vicinity of pedra branca between 1920 and 1993 its exclusive control over visits to island installation of military rebroadcast station on island in 1977 and proposed reclamation of land around it pedra branca case paras 233 234 239 248 and 250 malaysia was correct in asserting that flying of an ensign was not normally a manifestation of sovereignty and that difference in size between pulau pisang and pedra branca had to be recognised nonetheless some weight could be given to fact that malaysia had not requested for singapore ensign flying at horsburgh lighthouse to be taken down pedra branca case para 246 fact that malaysia had referred to lighthouse as a singapore station in 1959 and 1966 meteorological reports and had omitted it from 1967 malaysian report favoured singapore s case pedra branca case para 266 maps published by malaysia between 1962 and 1975 tended to confirm that it considered pedra branca to fall under singapore sovereignty singapore or singapura annotations on maps in respect of island were clear and supported singapore s case maps gave a good indication of malaysia s official position on matter and could amount to an admission see e g frontier dispute benin niger icj report 2005 p 119 para 44 finally malaysia could not rely on disclaimers on maps as present matter did not concern a boundary but a distinct island in any case maps were statements of geographical fact particularly since malaysia had itself produced and disseminated it against its own interest decision regarding delimitation of border between state of eritrea and federal democratic republic of ethiopia 13 april 2002 p 28 para 3 28 see pedra branca case para 271 in view of above court held that by 1980 sovereignty over pedra branca had passed from malaysia to singapore pedra branca case para 276 sovereignty over middle rocks and south ledge none of conduct by united kingdom and singapore that led to icj to conclude that singapore had gained sovereignty over pedra branca applied to middle rocks since johor held ancient original title to middle rocks court held that this title remains with malaysia as successor to johor sultanate pedra branca case paras 289 and 290 south ledge falls within apparently overlapping territorial waters generated by mainland of malaysia pedra branca and middle rocks although in special agreement and in their final submissions malaysia and singapore had asked court to decide which state had sovereignty over pedra branca middle rocks and south ledge court had not been mandated to delimit extent of territorial waters of two states in area in question therefore it simply held that south ledge as a low tide elevation belongs to state in territorial waters of which it is located pedra branca case paras 297 299 reactions and further developments reactions on 23 may 2008 malaysian foreign minister rais yatim described icj decision as creating a win win situation and that both countries would forge ahead in their bilateral relationship deputy prime minister najib tun razak called judgment a balanced decision as malaysia had been partly successful in its territorial claims interviewed by journalists at hague singapore deputy prime minister s jayakumar said we are pleased with judgment because court has awarded sovereignty over pedra branca which is main feature in dispute to singapore prime minister of singapore lee hsien loong said he was pleased with result and commented that bringing dispute to icj was a good way for malaysia and singapore to resolve disagreements or problems while maintaining good relations with each other see also malaysia on day icj released its judgment rais yatim asserted that since south ledge was within territorial waters of middle rocks malaysia appears to be sovereign holder a week later foreign ministry of malaysia asked malaysian media to cease using malay word pulau island for pedra branca and to refer to it as batu puteh or pedra branca icj s decision is final and not subject to appeal statute of international court of justice art 60 in addition malaysia and singapore stated in art 6 of special agreement that they would accept judgment of court as final and binding on them pedra branca case para 2 see also nevertheless in june 2008 rais yatim stated that malaysia had renewed its search for letter written by governor butterworth to sultan and temenggung of johor seeking permission to build horsburgh lighthouse on pedra branca he noted that rules of icj allowed a case to be reviewed within ten years if new evidence was adduced article 61 1 of statute of international court of justice states an application for revision of a judgment may be made only when it is based upon discovery of some fact of such a nature as to be a decisive factor which fact was when judgment was given unknown to court and also to party claiming revision always provided that such ignorance was not due to negligence application for revision must be made at latest within six months of discovery of new fact and no application for revision may be made after lapse of ten years from date of judgment articles 61 4 and 5 see in response singapore s law minister k shanmugam said that city state would wait to see what new evidence malaysian government could come up with several malaysian members of parliament have urged federal government to assert sovereignty over pulau pisang which also has a lighthouse on it that is operated by singapore or to take over administration of lighthouse concerns were also expressed for pulau merambong near western boundary of malaysia and singapore menteri besar of johor abdul ghani othman assured public that pulau pisang belongs to johor under a 1900 agreement between sultan ibrahim of johor and british administrators in colonial singapore nonetheless malaysian agencies have taken up efforts to stake claims over a hundred islands reefs rocks and other features in south china sea malacca straits and off sabahan waters that malaysia could lose to china indonesia and vietnam two of these islands are pulau off eastern sabah near indonesian border and pulau perak to west of penang at opening of johor s 12th state assembly in june 2008 sultan iskandar of johor pledged to reclaim island whatever it takes speaking impromptu at end of a prepared speech sultan said in malay let us be reminded that i do not forget pulau batu puteh pulau batu puteh is not singapore s but it belongs to johor it does not matter how long it may take i will find way to get back island which belongs to johor malaysian newspaper star reported that sultan said bila masa saya cari hatta balik benda itu ke johor menteri besar of johor said state government had clearly heard what sultan said but did not elaborate on 3 september 2008 tengku razaleigh hamzah a kelantan prince and mp from state sent a letter to rais yatim claiming that johor s interests had not been raised before icj he alleged that seas surrounding pedra branca had always been in johor s hands and had never been surrendered to british or to singapore and by accepting icj decision and participating in technical discussions with singapore malaysian government had infringed johor s constitutional rights responding rais said letter seemed designed for political mileage and that johor had been fully involved in proceedings he told straits times everybody has his opinion on such matters but i as foreign minister have to abide by dictate of law i have to see letter first but it s rather late in day to express disappointment singapore on 21 july 2008 in response to questions from singapore members of parliament about pedra branca senior minister of state for foreign affairs balaji sadasivan stated that maritime territory around island included a territorial sea of up to and an exclusive economic zone this was condemned by malaysia s foreign minister rais yatim as against spirit of asean and legal structure as claim was unacceptable and unreasonable and contradicts principles of international law see also in response a singapore ministry of foreign affairs spokesman said that singapore first stated its claim to a territorial sea and exclusive economic zone on 15 september 1980 and reiterated this claim on 23 may 2008 following icj s judgment both statements had made clear that if limits of singapore s territorial sea or exclusive economic zone overlapped with claims of neighbouring countries singapore would negotiate with those countries to arrive at agreed delimitations in accordance with international law see also in august 2008 rais said malaysia took view that singapore was not entitled to claim an exclusive economic zone around pedra branca as it considered that maritime feature did not meet internationally recognised criteria for an island that is land inhabited by humans that had economic activity see also at launch of s jayakumar and tommy koh s book pedra branca road to world court on 19 december 2008 chief justice chan sek keong commented pedra branca case is likely to be a unique event in history of singapore as it is unlikely that singapore will ever again need to seek confirmation of her title to territory under international law resolution of outstanding issues malaysia and singapore have established what they have named joint technical committee to delimit maritime boundary in area around pedra branca and middle rocks and to determine ownership of south ledge see also following a meeting on 3 june 2008 committee agreed that a technical sub committee would be established to oversee conduct of joint survey works to prepare way for talks on maritime issues in and around area if any incident occurred in and around waters of pedra branca middle rocks and south ledge either side would provide humanitarian assistance to vessels involved finally both malaysian and singaporean fishermen could continue traditional fishing activities in those waters in september 2008 joint technical committee reported that its sub committee on joint survey works was finalising technical preparations for a hydrographic survey that would provide data for future delimitation discussions a sub committee on maritime and airspace management and fisheries had also been formed and after a meeting on 20 august 2008 it decided that traditional fishing activities by both countries should continue in waters beyond off pedra branca middle rocks and south ledge application requesting interpretation of 2008 judgment and subsequent withdrawal on 2 february 2017 malaysia applied to icj pursuant to article 61 of statute of icj for revision of 2008 judgment on basis of three documents it had obtained from national archives of uk between august 2016 and january 2017 documents were internal correspondence of singapore s colonial government in 1958 an incident report submitted by a british naval officer in same year and a 1960s map of naval operations bearing annotations malaysian government said that these documents indicated that officials at highest levels in british colonial and singaporean administration appreciated that pedra branca pulau batu puteh did not form part of singapore s sovereign territory during relevant period therefore court would have been bound to reach a different conclusion on question of sovereignty over pedra branca pulau batu puteh had it been aware of this new evidence however according to shahriman lockman a senior analyst at malaysia s institute of strategic and international studies there s very little precedent for revisions to icj judgments reports suggest that timing of application coincides with upcoming elections in malaysia as ruling barisan nasional coalition which is currently under pressure over imdb scandal could use renewed legal fight over pedra branca as a means to show it was best placed to display strong leadership in country s foreign policy so as to safeguard malaysia s sovereignty singapore s foreign ministry said that a team including attorney general lucien wong and chan sek keong s jayakumar and tommy koh who had represented singapore at original icj hearing had been appointed to study and respond to claim on 5 february 2017 law and home affairs minister k shanmugam commented that on a cursory examination of documents without detailed legal advice he did not see how documents would make any difference to icj s judgment on 2 march foreign minister dr vivian balakrishnan said in parliament that singapore legal team has studied malaysia s application carefully including three documents relied on by malaysia to support its application and strongly believes that documents relied on by malaysia do not satisfy criteria under article 61 singapore has until 14 june to submit to icj its comprehensive and compelling rebuttal to malaysia s application on 30 june 2017 malaysia applied to icj to request for an interpretation of icj s 2008 judgment this application is separate and autonomous from 2 february application for revision of same judgment application invokes article 60 of statute of court and article 98 of rules of court according to malaysian attorney general mohamed apandi ali malaysia and singapore set up a joint technical committee jtc for implementation of 2008 icj judgment according to malaysia jtc reached an impasse in november 2013 as both parties had been unable to agree over meaning of 2008 judgement as it concerns south ledge and waters surrounding pedra branca explaining malaysia s position malaysian general apandi said malaysia considers that it is necessary to request an interpretation of 2008 judgement from icj as it would serve as a basis for maintenance of orderly and peaceful relations between parties in management of their respective maritime zones and airspace in future singapore s ministry of foreign affairs mfa noted in a press statement that icj s judgement was final and without appeal as well as clear and unambiguous as a result mfa said malaysia s request for icj to interpret judgement is puzzling singapore will therefore oppose malaysia s application for interpretation which we consider to be both unnecessary and without merit malaysia s new government withdrew their application for review on 30th may 2018 a move which was welcomed by singapore s mfa as 10 year period had lapsed putting matter to rest https www straitstimes com politics malaysia withdraws pedra branca case
