battles in triple battles both teams must send out three pokemon in a row at once some moves only allow pokemon on left or right side to attack opponent s pokemon on same side or in center changing position takes up one turn in rotation battles each side sends out three pokemon at once but they are arranged in a circle that can be rotated at will black has more rotation battles than triple battles and opposite is true in white another introduction is combination moves a starter pokemon can be taught one of three moves and using them together in double or triple battles produces more powerful attacks in wild walking through darker colored tall grass can trigger double battles against wild pokemon rather than only single battles with lighter colored grass occasionally player can find rustling patches of grass and rippling water where they can encounter either a rare pokemon a pokemon more common in opposite game version or highest evolutionary form of a pokemon whose lower forms can normally be found in area this is only way to capture pokemon such as and also dust clouds in caves and shadows of flying pokemon on certain bridges can be entered to either find a rare item

urban setting and is region s central metropolis black and white are set in unova region a continental mass located far away from previous regions kanto johto hoenn and sinnoh unlike previous regions which were based on real locations in japan unova is modeled after new york city an idea developed by game director junichi masuda when he visited city for launch of diamond and pearl one particular example of this is castelia city which serves as region s central metropolis and had such inspirations as its brooklyn bridge style suspension bridge and its huge skyscrapers masuda also wanted to convey a feeling of communities in castelia s streets unova is host to large urban areas a harbor an airport an amusement park several bridges and several mountain ranges in addition to a diversity of new landscapes unova region is also home to a diversity of people who vary in skin tone and occupation region s japanese name is derived from japanese words and many kinds of people and pokemon seen up close look like only one kind of life from afar story like previous pokemon games black and white both follow a linear storyline main events occur in a fixed order protagonist of pokemon black and white is a teenager who sets out on a journey through unova to become pokemon master at beginning of games player chooses either snivy tepig or oshawott as their starter pokemon as a gift from professor juniper protagonist s friends cheren and bianca are also rival pokemon trainers who occasionally battle player cheren will choose pokemon with a type advantage against player s while bianca will choose pokemon with a type disadvantage player s primary goal is to obtain eight gym badges of unova and ultimately challenge elite four of pokemon league and its champion to complete main story

who claim that pokemon are oppressed by humanity and seek to liberate them from their trainers team plasma is led by n a young man who was brought up alongside pokemon and sees them as friends rather than tools for sport throughout game player has some encounters with n who claims that by capturing one of legendary pokemon reshiram and zekrom of unova and defeating pokemon champion alder he will be recognized as unova s hero and will be able to convince humans to part with their pokemon depending on game version n will capture zekrom in black or reshiram in white after player defeats elite four and enters champion s chamber he or she finds that n has defeated alder and become newest pokemon champion soon after he summons a large castle that surrounds pokemon league challenging player to find him to take part in one final battle when player finally reaches him reshiram in black or zekrom in white appears before player and player must capture legendary pokemon before challenging n after his defeat n laments possibility that his ideals are mistaken ghetsis intrudes and angrily reveals that his true intentions were to use n to ensure that he would be only human left with control over pokemon and use them to rule world in his rage ghetsis challenges player to battle after ghetsis s defeat he is arrested allowing alder to resume his position as pokemon champion of unova region n then thanks player for helping realize his mistake about nature of relationship between people and their pokemon before leaving castle on his captured pokemon to a far off land after team plasma s

obtainable in blue yellow and all subsequent main series games however pikachu will not be obtainable in black and white from start of game it was later confirmed that black and white are region locked on nintendo dsi and 3ds game director and composer junichi masuda stated that to keep games fresh he looks at every previous element to decide what to adapt to new game stating people may not like what they like in past trend wise he explained new battle styles stating that while triple battles take more strategy rotation battles take more luck to win masuda stated that their goal when making games was to make it fun for new players but they also wanted to get players who have not played series in a while to come back he said that it was hard to find that balance to satisfy both kinds of players for new players there is good explanation in how to play while for old players they incorporated c gear which makes ability to trade and battle easier when asked about decision to introduce over 150 new species of pokemon masuda stated that they did this so old players would not be able to know what is a good pokemon to use and it would level playing ground for new players

feeling like it was too similar to all previous pokemon games he further went on to say that evs and ivs invisible mechanics in game are not necessarily beneficial by contrast he noted that it would be great to new players he also compared it to pokemon mystery dungeon games and final fantasy xiii arguing that they all share common element of being bad before they get good fellow retronauts
