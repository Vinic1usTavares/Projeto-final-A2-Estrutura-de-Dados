augusta class of steam corvettes were a pair of vessels acquired by prussian navy in 1860s class comprised two ships and ships were originally secretly ordered by confederate states navy in 1863 from arman brothers shipyard in bordeaux france purportedly for japanese fleet ships intended to be named mississippi and louisiana were given cover names yeddo and osaka in an attempt to hide their destination but their delivery was blocked by french emperor napoleon iii in 1864 both ships were sold to prussian navy in may 1864 as prussians had been in search of vessels to strengthen their fleet before and during second schleswig war against denmark though they entered service too late to see action in conflict ships were intended to be used as blockade runners but once they entered service they were too slow to be used in that capacity augusta and victoria spent most of their careers abroad they saw no action during austro prussian war in 1866 and thereafter began a series of deployments overseas augusta caused a minor diplomatic incident with costa rica and united states in 1868 over an attempt to secure a naval base in caribbean sea and victoria joined her there later in year during franco prussian war in 1871 augusta was used as a commerce raider and had some success off french atlantic coast but victoria did not see action during war both ships went on deployments abroad in mid and late 1870s with destinations including caribbean mediterranean sea and pacific ocean by early 1880s ships were withdrawn from front line service victoria was decommissioned in 1882 and slated to become a training ship but german navy decided that she could not adequately perform task so she was instead used as a fishery protection ship very intermittently through rest of 1880s in 1885 augusta was sent to carry a set of replacement crews for ships that were deployed to south pacific but she sank in a cyclone in gulf of aden with loss of all aboard victoria continued in service until 1890 she was stricken from naval register in 1891 and sold to ship breakers in 1892 design order for what became augusta class came from confederate states navy during american civil war french shipbuilder arman brothers of bordeaux accepted secret order nominally for japan design for ships was prepared in 1863 same year construction began on vessels under contract names of yeddo and osaka ships were intended to be named mississippi and louisiana in confederate service ships were intended to be used as blockade runners to smuggle supplies through union blockade though they proved to be slow for such a purpose in service before ships could be delivered to confederate navy french emperor napoleon iii intervened however and blocked final delivery to confederate navy and prussian navy acquired ships instead prussian government expected second schleswig war against denmark then ongoing to last much longer than it did and so it started to look for warships being built in britain and france either speculatively or for a buyer that might not be able to pay for them when it became known that had blocked sale of yeddo and osaka prussia purchased ships and ex confederate ironclad warship cheops in may 1864 to strengthen its fleet augusta was delivered without issue but by time victoria was approaching completion denmark had lobbied french government to prevent delivery of ship supported by great britain french government initially refused to deliver ship but prussian chancellor otto von bismarck was able to convince french to allow unarmed vessel to be transferred to netherlands under a french flag from where it could be picked up by a prussian crew and taken to bremerhaven characteristics augusta and victoria were long at waterline and were long overall they had a beam of and a draft of forward and aft they displaced as designed and up to at full load ships hulls were carvel built with timber construction hulls were coppered to protect them from biofouling on extended cruises abroad where regular maintenance would not be possible ship s crew consisted of 15 officers and 215 enlisted men both vessels carried six boats one larger and six smaller of unrecorded type ships were poorly built and they did not handle well under sail they suffered from severe weather helm they pitched badly and they shipped water over bow they also maneuvered poorly under sail though this improved considerably under steam power steering was controlled with a single rudder machinery thumb illustration of augusta steaming 1885 augusta class ships were powered by a single horizontal 2 cylinder marine steam engine that drove a pair of 2 bladed screw propellers that were in diameter steam was provided by four coal fired fire tube boilers that were manufactured by of le havre boilers were ducted into a single retractable funnel amidships as built augusta and victoria were equipped with a full ship rig but in 1871 augusta had her main mast removed and victorias rig was reduced to that of a barque in 1879 their propulsion system was rated to give ships a top speed of at 400 nominal horsepower but on trials both ships reached a speed of at engines proved to be a disappointment in service since ships were not particularly fast especially for vessels that had been built as blockade runners they had a storage capacity for of coal which gave them a cruising radius of at a speed of armament ships of augusta class were armed with a battery of eight 24 pounder guns and six 12 pounder guns all guns after 1872 these guns were replaced with four 22 caliber cal six 23 cal guns and a single 23 cal gun these were more modern breechloading built up guns 15 cm guns were supplied with a total of 440 shells and they had a range of and 12 cm guns had 660 rounds of ammunition and a maximum range of later in their careers they had six hotchkiss revolver cannon installed ships namebuilderlaid yeddo arman brothers bordeaux 1863 1864 13 may 1864 osaka 1863 1864 13 may 1864 service history augusta thumb augusta at some point before 1871 augusta arrived too late to see action in second schleswig war and she operated in prussian waters after war she was activated during austro prussian war of 1866 but since austrian navy was occupied with italian fleet in adriatic sea she saw no activity during that war either in december 1867 she embarked on first of three major overseas cruises under what was now north german federal navy with secret objective of securing a naval base in central america ship s commander attempted to secure a lease on port of puerto limon costa rica in 1868 but costa rican government refused and informed united states which viewed it as an encroachment on its sphere of influence and led to a minor diplomatic incident otto von bismarck german chancellor abandoned idea in favor of maintaining good relations with united states during franco prussian war of 1870 1871 augusta was used as a commerce raider against neutral vessels carrying arms and other contraband to france she captured three vessels two of which were taken as war prizes with third being sunk she then went to coal in vigo spain and was blockaded there by a superior french naval force until end of war ship went on two more cruises abroad first in 1874 1876 and second in 1876 1878 first cruise again went to central american waters but also involved a patrol off coast of spain to protect german interests amidst unrest in country during third carlist war later in deployment she went to uruguay and colombia during periods of unrest in those countries second cruise saw augusta travel to pacific ocean where her captain negotiated trade agreements with chiefs in samoa she also spent time in china enforcing treaties signed with chinese government in 1885 augusta embarked on one last voyage to bring replacement crews to several german ships in australia but she sank in a cyclone in gulf of aden while en route no trace of vessel or her crew of 222 was ever found her sinking was one of worst peacetime disasters of german navy at time victoria thumb victoria in port in 1880 like her sister victoria arrived too late to see action in second schleswig war she spent almost her entire active career abroad with short stints in commission in german waters after briefly serving in home waters in mid 1860s ship went on three extended overseas deployments all to west indies station first began in 1868 and while in caribbean sea ship protected german economic interests in cuba and haiti she returned to germany in 1869 and remained out of service through mid 1870s during this period she was commissioned but not actively used in franco prussian war of 1870 1871 in 1875 she was reactivated for another deployment to west indies during which she observed conflicts in central america in event that violence spread to germans in region while touring ports in caribbean she was transferred to mediterranean sea in 1877 during russo turkish war which german government feared might result in riots against europeans living within ottoman empire no incidents resulted that threatened german interests while she was in area and ship returned to germany in 1879 victoria was sent on her third deployment in 1880 again assigned to west indies station she spent most of her time abroad elsewhere however as international incidents required her presence in 1880 she was sent to mediterranean where she forced local ottoman government to respond to an attack on german explorer friedrich gerhard later that year she joined an international fleet in adriatic sea aimed at forcing ottoman empire to comply with terms of 1878 congress of berlin and in late 1880 she steamed to liberia in western africa to retaliate for an attack on a german merchant vessel that had become stranded in country earlier in year her time in west indies station was confined to a tour of south american ports in mid 1881 after which she returned to liberia to force government to comply with german demands for restitution she returned to germany in 1882 and was slated to become a training ship following year but navy decided her crew spaces were too small and so used another vessel instead victoria served intermittently as a fishery protection vessel between 1884 and 1890 before being stricken from naval register in april 1891 and sold
