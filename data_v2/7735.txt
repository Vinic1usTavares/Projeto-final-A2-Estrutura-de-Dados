hospital in basingstoke script was written by usual eight person team led by victoria pile and produced and directed by same people who recorded all previous episodes special was recorded at same time as second series exterior scenes were harder to shoot in beginning funeral scene one of mourners is alan yentob who had been filming an episode of bbc one documentary series imagine stephen mangan said that martin s mime during funeral was one of his favourite moments in green wing opening titles of episode differ from others as it does not use normal theme tune last week as it is named in original television soundtrack and instead uses track camel there were some improvised scenes these included a scene in beginning of episode where alan and joanna are in a middle of a field and scene begins with a low angle shot later when alan is humping joanna scene suddenly becomes a crane shot this is because crew at time had a crane camera after they had finished filming final scenes in series 2 where alan joanna and martin are teetering over edge of a cliff in stolen camper van camper van scenes were hardest to shoot especially scene where van explodes as this had to be done in one take another problem was smell of van which pippa haywood said smelt of old dogs van also suffered other problems such as bits of steering wheel and gear stick coming off julian rhind tutt commented that scene where alan and boyce talk together for last time was one of most moving scenes in whole of green wing wedding was shot at hall of bayham abbey in kent where crew had difficulty filming due to bad weather show also features a guest appearance from jeremy sheffield near end of episode as sue s new boyfriend dvd of special was released on 8 january four days after its premiere in uk features include alternate ending a behind scenes featurette 20 minutes of deleted scenes and commentary from many of main cast which includes commentary from some foreign relatives of michelle gomez who had not seen show before three extra deleted scenes from special were later released in definitive collection dvd boxset alternative ending an alternative ending was made for special which was never broadcast but was put as an extra on dvd in this version of ending when mac sees caroline floating away he runs down stairs and out of castle to save her caroline begins to descend and both mac and guy grab hold of one her legs to bring her down but instead they are lifted into air with her while three fly away caroline exclaims we re all going to die to which mac quite sternly says caroline there s something i ve been meaning to tell you opening possibility that mac is not going to die meanwhile alan and joanna after walking into sea are last seen hanging onto a buoy waiting to drown they are still talking and waiting for ocean to drown them this ending was favourite amongst actors mangan said that alternative ending was best moment in whole of green wing however alternative ending was rejected and writers favoured ending that was eventually broadcast it is believed that alternative ending would have been broadcast if a third series was being made as that ending was much more ambiguous since alan and joanna are still seen alive and mac tells caroline that he still has something to say reception when special was first broadcast it was watched by 1 7 million viewers 11 of total audience however these ratings are poor compared to other programmes for example an episode of desperate housewives shown previous night attracted 2 8 million viewers responses from critics were mixed matt baylis said like a homegrown er on laughing gas this show will be sorely missed and ian johns said it was like a richard curtis romcom albeit one force fed magic mushrooms sam wollaston in guardian wrote that it was one of funniest shows on british television alongside satirical sitcom thick of it saying thick of it is clever funny green wing is mad funny wollaston said that while dramatic element of show such as mac s death were good it was alan and joanna s storyline that was most entertaining mark heap and pippa haywood who play them have been shining lights in an already glittering show they and it will be sorely missed he said david butcher in radio times said that green wing s sublime comic acting and a vein of shrieking madness in writing make it very hard to beat paul whitelaw however attacked both series and special saying this final installment was typically awful more so considering its length fans of show thought that while special was good it was not greatest episode of green wing made some thought special concentrated too much on drama instead of comedy some were confused by final ending and others complained about lack of appearances made by
