dubrovnik itself siege was accompanied by a yugoslav navy blockade jna s bombardment of dubrovnik including that of old town a unesco world heritage site culminated on 6 december 1991 bombardment provoked international condemnation and became a public relations disaster for serbia and montenegro contributing to their diplomatic and economic isolation as well as international recognition of croatia s independence in may 1992 jna retreated to bosnia and herzegovina less than from coast in some places and handed over its equipment to newly formed army of republika srpska vrs during this time croatian army hv attacked from west and pushed back jna vrs from areas east of dubrovnik both in croatia and in bosnia and herzegovina and by end of may linked up with hv unit defending city

numerous homes businesses and public buildings were looted or torched operation was part of a plan drawn up by jna aimed at securing dubrovnik area and then proceeding north west to link up with jna troops in northern dalmatia via western herzegovina offensive was accompanied by a significant amount of war propaganda in 2000 montenegrin president milo dukanovic apologized for siege eliciting an angry response from his political opponents and from serbia international criminal tribunal for former yugoslavia icty convicted two yugoslav officers for their involvement in siege and handed a third over to serbia for prosecution icty indictment stated that offensive was designed to detach dubrovnik region from croatia and integrate it into a serb dominated state through an unsuccessful proclamation of dubrovnik republic on 24 november 1991 in addition montenegro convicted four former jna soldiers with prisoner abuse at morinj camp croatia also charged several former jna or yugoslav navy officers and a former bosnian serb leader with war crimes but no trials have yet resulted from these indictments background in august 1990 an insurrection took place in croatia centred on predominantly serb populated areas of dalmatian hinterland around city of knin parts of lika kordun and banovina regions and settlements in eastern croatia with significant serb populations these areas were subsequently named republic of serbian krajina rsk and after declaring its intention to integrate with serbia government of croatia declared rsk a rebellion by march 1991 conflict had escalated and croatian war of independence erupted in june 1991 croatia declared its independence as yugoslavia disintegrated a three month moratorium followed after which decision came into effect on 8 october rsk then initiated a campaign of ethnic cleansing against croat civilians expelling most non serbs by early 1993 by november 1993 fewer than 400 ethnic croats remained in united nations un protected area known as sector south and a further 1 500 2 000 remained in sector north as yugoslav people s army jna increasingly supported rsk and croatian police were unable to cope with situation croatian national guard zng was formed in may 1991 in november zng was renamed croatian army hv development of military of croatia was hampered by a un arms embargo introduced in september while

neutralized to ensure montenegro s territorial integrity to prevent ethnic clashes and to preserve socialist federal republic of yugoslavia montenegrin prime minister milo dukanovic stated that croatian borders needed be revised attributing existing border line to poorly educated bolshevik cartographers propaganda compounded by jna colonel general pavle strugar s allegations that 30 000 croatian troops and 7 000 terrorists and kurdish mercenaries were about to attack montenegro and seize bay of kotor led many in montenegro to believe that croatia had actually started an invasion newspaper pobjeda was most significant media source that contributed to spread of propaganda in july 1991 high ranking serbian official said at a political rally in niksic that a serbian state was to be established west of montenegro extending to neretva river with niksic at its capital on 16 september 1991 jna mobilized in montenegro citing deteriorating situation in croatia despite a radio broadcast appeal by jna 2nd titograd corps on 17 september considerable numbers of reservists refused to respond to call up on 18 september dukanovic threatened harsh punishment of deserters and those refusing to respond to mobilization mobilization and propaganda were in contrast with assurances from yugoslav federal authorities in belgrade that there would be no attack against dubrovnik jna s strategic plan to defeat croatia included an offensive to cut off southernmost parts of croatia including dubrovnik from rest of country on 23 september jna artillery attacked village of vitaljina in

weapons that was stationed in napoleonic era fort imperial atop srd hill overlooking dubrovnik rest of troops in area were poorly armed because croatian territorial defence had been disarmed by jna in

available to defend dubrovnik on 26 september 200 rifles and four artillery pieces captured from jna on island of korcula were sent to reinforce city guns were a mix of 76 mm and 85 mm soviet world

scale looting by jna troops and artillery bombardment of dubrovnik especially its old town reaction of international media and media coverage of siege reinforced an opinion already taking shape since fall of vukovar that conduct of jna and serbs was barbaric and intent on dominating croatia regardless of destruction of priceless cultural heritage that occurred in process serbian authorities thought international community had no moral grounds to judge because they did not interfere when hundreds of thousands of serbs were killed in croatian concentration camps during world war ii besides protests made by mayor zaragoza vance and ecmm 104 nobel prize laureates published a full page advertisement in new york times on 14 january 1992 at incentive of linus pauling urging governments throughout world to stop unrestrained destruction by jna because siege shaped international opinion of croatian war of independence it became a major contributor to a shift in international diplomatic and economic isolation of serbia and rump yugoslavia which came to be viewed as an aggressor state in west on 17 december 1991 european economic community agreed to recognize independence of croatia on 15 january 1992 between october and december 1991 jna captured approximately of territory around of which hv recaptured in its may 1992 counterattack as jna pulled back east of dubrovnik and in

distributed to serbian refugees by a special jna administration set up on 15 december 1991 it is probable however that looted property ended up in private homes or was sold on black market dubrovnik s cilipi airport was also targeted and its equipment taken to podgorica and tivat airports following attempts to justify jna offensive authorities in serbia and montenegro tried to deny damage to old town radio television of serbia said that smoke rising from old town was result of automobile tyres set on fire by population of dubrovnik echoing kadijevic officials and media in montenegro referred

croatia s genocide case against serbia before international court of justice icj croatia claimed 123 civilians from dubrovnik were killed during siege croatia presented letters from croatian police to support these claims however in its 2015 judgment court noted that all these letters were prepared much later specifically for case were unsigned and failed to indicate circumstances under which 123 were supposedly killed citing strugar and jokic icty judgments on dubrovnik icj in its own judgment recognized that at least two civilian deaths were caused by unlawful shelling of dubrovnik on 6 december and one further on 5 october 1991 however these verdicts were incomplete did not encompass entire period of siege save for these two days and were restricted only to old town and not to city of dubrovnik as a whole judgement stated that court concludes from foregoing that it has been established that some killings were perpetrated by jna against croats of dubrovnik between october and december 1991 although not on scale alleged by croatia footnotes references books news reports other sources category 1991 in croatia category 1992 in croatia category 1991 in yugoslavia category
