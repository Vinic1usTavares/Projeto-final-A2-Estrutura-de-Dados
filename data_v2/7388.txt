68 pounder cannon was an artillery piece designed and used by british armed forces in mid 19th century cannon was a smoothbore muzzle loading gun manufactured in several weights most common being and fired projectiles of colonel william dundas designed 112 cwt version in 1841 and it was cast following year most common variant weighing 95 cwt dates from 1846 it entered service with royal artillery and royal navy and saw active service with both arms during crimean war over 2 000 were made and it gained a reputation as finest smoothbore cannon ever made gun was produced at a time when new rifled and breech loading guns were beginning to make their mark on artillery at first 68 pounder s reliability and power meant that it was retained even on new warships such as hms warrior but eventually new rifled muzzle loaders made all smoothbore muzzle loading guns obsolete however large surplus stocks of 68 pounders were given new life when converted to take rifled projectiles cannon remained in service and was not declared obsolete until 1921 design cannon was designed in response to need for heavier weaponry as armour on ships of line improved colonel william dundas government s inspector of artillery between 1839 and 1852 designed cannon in 1846 it was cast by low moor iron works in bradford in 1847 and entered service soon after like numerous cannon before it it was a cast iron smoothbore loaded from muzzle hogg p 37 cannon was relatively cheap to produce royal commission on defence of united kingdom estimated that each cannon cost approximately ps167 hogg p 25 2010 over 2000 were cast before p 99 and its exceptional durability range and accuracy earned it a reputation as finest smoothbore cannon ever made lambert p 82 operation thumb right a 68 pounder on a replica carriage gun was a traditional it needed to be loaded from front end of barrel cantwell p 21 before it could be loaded bore of barrel was cleaned with a sponge after which a propellant charge gunpowder in a cloth bag was rammed down into breech this was followed by a projectile often encased in wadding winton 1987 p 30 gun was primed using a metal spike inserted through vent that pierced charge and fired using a percussion cap which ignited charge and forced projectile out of barrel cantwell p 28 68 pounder had an effective range of approximately however at its maximum elevation of 15 degrees it had a maximum range of a distance that projectile would cover in 15 seconds with a powder charge far charge although gun was proofed to 25 lb charges lambert pp 86 87 cannon fired a solid shot at a muzzle velocity of cannon could fire solid shot explosive shells grapeshot case shot and martins liquid iron shell thin walled shells filled with molten iron intended to serve as heated shot although cannon s barrel bore was both shot and shells were in diameter this allowed a windage gap of around projectile enough to aid loading process but not enough to seriously diffuse propellant gasses thumb 150px left a muzzle loaded cannon 1 projectile shot 2 powder charge 3 vent official weight of shot was listed at 68 lbs but in reality this varied according to material of shot itself cast iron shot weighed wrought iron shot and steel shot weighed and chilled steel weighed it was estimated that one 68 pound shot had destructive power equivalent to five 32 pound shot winton 1987 p 29 explosive shells were primed with of gunpowder they were fitted with simple fuses that were ignited by flash of charge early wooden fuses were eventually replaced by more reliable fuses designed by captain edward boxer in 1849 gun crew still had to gauge best length of fuse for range they were firing ideally shell should explode just before hitting its target to prevent shell exploding in barrel it was fitted with a sabot to ensure fuse faced away from charge on land a minimum crew of nine men usually commanded by a non commissioned officer was required to fire gun which was normally mounted on a traversing gun carriage on board a ship gun crew could be doubled to 18 men who needed to traverse gun carriage by hand using hand spikes and rope tackles extra crew was on account of fact that sailing ships usually only fired their cannon from one side of deck in unlikely event of both sides being in action at once nine men would be detached to man gun opposite in both cases gun was elevated using wooden wedges driven under breech of barrel by brute force it was aimed using an advanced hexagonal sighting mechanism marked with elevation on one face and gun s range according to different weights of cartridge charges on other five faces winton 1987 p pp 21 28 service cannon was put to use both on land and at sea it was fitted to numerous royal navy warships of different sizes such as and conqueror class ships of line several of these ships saw action during crimean war where 68 pounder was used extensively during siege of sevastopol winton 2001 p 112 along with 32 pounders and lancaster guns they were taken from their ship mountings and dragged up to siege batteries by naval brigade from where they regularly bombarded russian positions for next year cannon was also fitted in large numbers to aetna class ironclad floating batteries although these had little impact on war thumb right a typical land based traversing carriage this is actually a 64 pounder rifled muzzle loading cannon displayed at fort nelson most notably 68 pounder was fitted to s and originally it was intended to fit forty 68 pounders primarily on one gun deck but this specification changed during their building and they were finally equipped with twenty six 68 pounders 13 on each side winton 1987 p 6 alongside these ships were equipped with new rifled breech loading armstrong guns of two types 7 inch and 40 pounders although armstrong guns represented a new direction in artillery breech loading mechanism meant that they were unable to withstand explosion of a heavy cartridge smaller cartridge charges were therefore required and gun s muzzle velocity suffered as a result hogg p 37 ironically armstrong guns were therefore incapable of penetrating armour fitted to warrior class ships while 68 pounder with its high muzzle velocity could cantwell p 31 as late as 1867 it was planned to fit new s with 68 pounders but they were instead completed with a rml 7 inch gun and a rml 64 pounder 64 cwt gun on land 68 pounder was used extensively in british coastal defences constructed during 1850s notably at forts like gomer and elson defending portsmouth and forts victoria albert and freshwater redoubt defending needles passage 1859 royal commission envisaged arming numerous new forts they proposed with 68 pounder cannon and costed for them accordingly introduction of armstrong gun initially led many to think that weapon would be used instead but whilst forts were being built armstrong gun s weaknesses were exposed and military reverted to using muzzle loaded weapons however advantages of rifling and armstrong s wrought iron construction were retained leading to a new design of artillery piece rifled muzzle loaders conversion to rifled muzzle loader thumb

pounder and other smoothbores still existed in large numbers and various attempts were made to adapt guns to fire new projectiles eventually captain william palliser patented a method of boring out gun barrel and inserting a wrought iron rifled liner this allowed rifled shot and shells to be fired from old smoothbore cannon and experiments revealed that it made them even more powerful than they had been before hogg p 40 introduced in 1872 68 pounders adapted in this way had a calibre of and were known as a rml 68 pounder or officially as rml 80 pounder 5 ton with a powder charge they could fire an projectile at a muzzle velocity of they were deployed as coast defence and garrison artillery around british empire and remained in service until eventually declared obsolete in 1921 hogg p
