michael fields episode marked thomas s ninth writing credit ruggiero s seventeenth installment of series and fields s eighth episode scene in which veronica rebukes logan was included because writers thought that it would be a good note on which to end a season even though it would not be two characters final interaction in series fields was heavily involved with actors during filming of this scene thomas highlighted scene in which logan attacks castle member for showcasing romantic ambiguity between logan veronica and piz thomas counseled lowell about his facial expression before filming and he was pleased with end result stating that it breaks my heart while editing final script thomas and ruggiero had to remove roughly seven minutes from original draft including a scene featuring dialogue between veronica and leo later thomas thought that removing this scene made one voiceover by veronica too sudden thomas called scene in which keith makes veronica dinner quintessential keith and indicative of his lasting commitment to his daughter despite knowing that episode could be series finale thomas did not want it to completely resolve all plot lines his intention was to keep viewers guessing and prevent conclusion from being too bland or typical he ultimately felt that final shot of veronica walking away from voting booth in rain was a pretty melancholy way to go out song it never rains in southern california by albert hammond plays during final scene in promotional advertising for episode cw billed it as a season finale despite fact that series had already been cancelled fbi pitch left 200 px alt thumb series creator rob thomas created fbi concept before cancellation thomas proposed his idea for season four to take place in fbi academy prior to airing of un american graffiti enrico colantoni stated that cw had seen filmed first ten pages and reacted negatively however thomas denied this assertion and commented that cw had not yet seen fbi pitch he added that it would be presented on may 2 day after series came off a two month hiatus thomas s statement was confirmed by a representative for network thomas filmed a twelve minute teaser for his new concept and presented it to cw teaser was later released on veronica mars third season dvd and internet clip begins in medias res with veronica pretending to be a high schooler talking to a teacher teaser flashes back to her first fbi meeting and viewers discover that she is investigating teacher for sexual abuse allegations she successfully catches teacher on camera and at fbi she runs into a former acquaintance named seth she investigates a potential bomber with another novice agent and they speak to a man who appears to be innocent however he points a gun at veronica s partner as clip ends thomas had initially planned for veronica to be in fbi during a hypothetical seventh or eighth season of veronica mars he accelerated his initial vision of show in an attempt to prevent its cancellation although he believed that new concept would appeal to cw executives he commented i d be thrilled for veronica to come back in any incarnation teaser was presented to network on may 2 2007 nellie andreeva of hollywood reporter wrote that dawn ostroff president of cw at time had responded positively to new concept series s title might have been changed if fbi idea had been accepted cw had recently cancelled gilmore girls leading some news outlets to speculate that veronica mars might be renewed in order to fill a schedule hole several cast members including gonzalo and lowell had taken other acting opportunities in anticipation of series s cancellation nevertheless thomas stated i don t think we re dead i kind of like our chances cancellation 200 px alt thumb michael ausiello initially reported on series s cancellation veronica mars was one of roughly five series being considered for cancellation by network in 2007 at cw s upfront conference critic michael ausiello asked ostroff about fate of show she responded that thomas and bell could work together on another show for network but she thought that this possibility was unlikely she said that it could come back in some form but i don t know what form that would be thomas responded i assume that anything dawn would be talking about in realm of a rob kristen project would involve a new from scratch pilot as they don t have me in a deal and they ll lose kristen in a couple of weeks at conference ostroff officially cancelled series saying about fbi idea that it s not going to happen upon cancellation of series a group of fans who called themselves cloud watchers sent more than 10 000 mars bars to cw hoping that network would reverse its decision and renew series several years after cancellation thomas expressed interest in creating a feature film based on show analysis several reviewers have commented on themes of episode topics of discussion included relationship between parents and children class relations scene in which logan attacks perpetrator in veronica s sex tape case and final scene in relation to overall moral of series according to rowan kaiser of a v club episode contained a role reversal between veronica and keith with keith violating law he noted scene in which keith erases surveillance tapes of veronica as illustrating theme that two aren t so different after all roger holland of popmatters thought that episode demonstrated that veronica and keith s relationship was central component of show it was all about veronica and keith and beyond that about parents children and myriad ways they can fuck each other up stephanie zacharek writing for salon thought that final scenes of bitch is back cement dour reality posited at very beginning of series that rich are always going to be ones in charge holland referred to veronica s line i don t want his apology in scene in which logan assaults gorya sorokin as indicative of one of main themes of series she s not interested in apologies she s driven by a nihilistic need for action and payback eric goldman of ign wrote that scene had an air of ambiguity that could be interpreted in many ways reviewer elaborated that veronica s smile could have indicated further romantic interest or that logan might have been killed in retaliation for attacking gorya zacharek stated that episode s ending felt truncated unfinished it gave us no clear signposts telling us where exactly these characters are headed next where they ll end up holland said that theme of final scene seemed emphatically clear and accurate life s a bitch until you die goldman wrote that ending was fitting for series veronica mars wasn t exactly a show that was driven by happy thoughts or events even though we wouldn t have minded characters ending up happy reception ratings on its initial showing bitch is back was viewed by 2 15 million viewers ranking 74th of 85 in weekly rankings this figure was an increase from previous episode weevils wobble but they don t go down which aired immediately prior and garnered 1 78 million watchers however this number was a ratings decrease from both third season premiere welcome wagon and previous season finale not pictured which received 3 36 and 2 42 million viewers respectively reviews 200 px alt thumb enrico colantoni s performance was frequently singled out for praise episode received mostly positive reviews from television critics eric goldman of ign graded episode an 8 3 out of 10 indicating that it was great he thought that finale did not resolve every plot line by end of episode however he did not blame writers because they were not planning for episode to be a series finale he enjoyed final scene between logan veronica and piz because of variety of different ways in which it could be interpreted while he expressed some frustration over keith s criminal charges and ambiguity regarding outcome of sheriff s election he opined that one could still take away important messages from show because of keith s actions in episode reviewer also lauded final scene writing that melancholy feeling of final scene with veronica walking through rain having cast a vote for her dad that is probably meaningless felt right for series amy ratcliffe of ign listed bitch is back as eighth best episode of veronica mars she wrote that episode brings show full circle returning veronica to position of a social outcast and concluded by describing episode as a winner alan sepinwall on his blog what s alan watching praised episode stating that it was one of his favorite installments of series he thought that series s early film noir influences returned in finale a choice he lauded in addition he commended bell and colantoni s performances stating that final scene is a bleak ending but strangely appropriate television without pity graded episode an a rowan kaiser writing for a v club praised finale writing that it functioned well within context of series and season we get significant emotional resolution between keith and veronica whose relationship is core of show we get to see veronica being a badass which is when veronica mars is at its most entertaining all supporting characters get something defining to do show engages with its history and most importantly it s a fantastic episode he went on to laud interaction between veronica and keith and latter s eventual sacrifice for his daughter in addition he felt that supporting characters including wallace parker and piz also received appropriate he later ranked episode as his fifth favorite of series kelly west of cinema blend gave a mixed review she enjoyed elements that resembled first season such as return of jake kane and portrait of lilly she thought that bitch is back was satisfying within context of season but that it was too ambiguous for a series finale how can show not come back how can they leave us with veronica and logan still apart stephanie zacharek of salon felt positively about episode itself but ambivalent about lack of resolution stating i m not sure if tuesday night s finale is a deeply unsatisfying way to close out a series that s ending before its time or only way to end such a series however she blamed network for this ending she also commented on tone and themes of episode arguing that one of series s main takeaways was that rich would always be in charge however she did not view finale as being spiteful and pessimistic veronica mars has always been a clear eyed show never a bitter one tanner stransky of entertainment weekly felt unsatisfied with episode s conclusion partially because veronica and logan did not resume dating however he praised sex tape mystery and plot involving castle because of their similarities to earlier seasons he also praised keith s actions stating okay maybe i m a sap but this tugged at my heartstrings a bit and left me relieved there wasn t a dreaded veronica keith battle at end stransky concluded by saying that end is fine sydney of zap2it felt disappointed because of ambiguous endings of keith s arc and veronica s love triangle although she was positive towards bitch is back as a standalone episode she found herself hoping that there were another episode to season watching veronica walk out into pouring rain all alone after casting a probably insignificant vote for her dad was depressing symbolic rain in socal and just downright unsatisfying roger holland of popmatters praised episode he wrote that finale took us all way back to heart of veronica mars although he also commented on lack of closure in bitch is back he still believed that finale highlighted some of main themes of series final scenes of veronica mars offered no sense of closure rather we were left with sense that we d been denied a genuinely thrilling fourth season tv addict lauded episode for returning to tone and themes of first season calling it perfect mix of mystery excitement romance and snappy one liners publication also praised bell and colantoni s performances jesse of popmatters graded episode an 8 out of 10 kath skerry of give me my remote expressed dissatisfaction with cw for cancelling series but she praised episode as a standalone installment as for final two episodes themselves they would have been magnificent season finales it was classic veronica mars drama comedy inside jokes and callbacks to yesteryear on his blog cultural learnings critic myles mcnutt said that colantoni should have been nominated for a primetime emmy award for outstanding lead actor in a drama series for his performance in episode saying that this final sacrifice is colantoni s strongest character arc all season and is proper episode selection for actor on a ranking of all 64 veronica mars episodes buzzfeed ranked episode 54th declaring that it was extremely disappointing and pretty dull references external links bitch is back at mars investigations category 2007 american
