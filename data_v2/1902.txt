australians won by 8 wickets 11 september south v australians oval london australians won by an innings and 5 runs test series first test this was inaugural old trafford test and as chris harte described it first time that a match of such importance had been staged outside of london harte p 133 selection of an england home test team in 19th century was privilege of host club and lancashire selected five local players in their squad of twelve although jack crossland missed out and was made twelfth man barlow hornby pilling and steel all played as it was believed their presence would boost gate receipts mortimer old trafford p 3 chris harte commented that match was also origin of old trafford s reputation for wet weather game being drawn after rain had made first day unplayable match was therefore reduced to two days play and it was reported that wicket dried much quicker than expected and conditions were never difficult for batting even so england were all out for 95 in their first innings boyle taking six wickets for 42 runs conceded i e 6 42 with his medium paced spin and spofforth 4 42 shrewsbury displaying masterly technique scored 43 to save his team from real embarrassment in their first innings australia hit with more vigour and confidence than their opponents and scored 182 a lead of 87 their top scorer was midwinter with 37 mortimer old trafford p 4 wicket had dried out on final day and england were able to bat out time and secure draw scoring 180 for loss of 9 wickets i e 180 9 grace was top scorer with a patient 31 and joey palmer was best of australian bowlers with his controlled off and leg cutters second test this was inaugural lord s test and england won by an innings after a century by a g steel and fine bowling by ted peate and george ulyett game ended just after lunch on third day wisden recorded that main elements of england s success were magnificent batting of a g steel and bowling of ulyett batting first australia were reduced to 160 9 despite an innings of 63 by giffen but then scott and boyle added 69 for final wicket wisden reporting that scott played cool confident skilful cricket in an innings of 75 at close of play on first day england were 90 3 so match was evenly poised with lucas on 28 and shrewsbury on 27 steel commenced his innings on second morning and shared successful partnerships with ulyett barlow and lyttelton while steel was in 261 runs were added and he made 148 including thirteen boundaries it was highest score made against australians during season by close of play australia had lost four wickets in their second innings for only 73 runs barlow later recorded that score was 135 5 when he went out to join steel and recalled lord harris england captain saying to him for heaven s sake barlow stop this rot barlow and steel added 98 for sixth wicket despite another good effort by scott on final day australia failed to avoid innings defeat ulyett bowled very well but may have been helped by state of ground however ulyett is best remembered in this match for taking what pelham warner called one of historic catches of cricket when he caught and bowled bonnor noted for his powerful hitting warner recorded of steel s innings that george giffen talked about it most enthusiastically as late as 1911 when two were in conversation at adelaide warner p 82 when scott was dismissed for 75 in australian first innings he was caught by his own captain murdoch off bowling of steel murdoch was on as a substitute for an injured english player and this was first time in test cricket that a batsman was dismissed by a catch taken by a substitute fielder robinson p 24 soon afterwards london press reported that entire proceeds of match a sum of ps1 334 had been awarded to australians this had been agreed beforehand by alexander and harris to enable tourists to cover their costs but press disapproved and accused australians of being mercenary and acting outside spirit of game harte commented on extreme bias of press as in all their other games australians received only a share of gate money an arrangement appreciated by county clubs as visitors popularity always boosted takings harte pp 133 134 in fact alexander had attempted to secure payment of half whole gate main stands and outer grounds for every match but counties refused to share main stand revenue agreement brokered by lord harris was for australians to receive half of all outer ground revenue plus entire gate for lord s test third test final test at oval was played in hot weather and murdoch created a then record score of 211 first double century in test cricket murdoch was helped by three missed chances off bowling of ulyett when he had made 46 171 and 205 england followed on but had only lost two wickets when time ran out and match was drawn after mcdonnell had made 103 out of 158 murdoch and scott completed first double century partnership in test cricket england as score mounted used 11 bowlers first time in test cricket that an entire team including wicketkeeper was called upon to bowl on this occasion wicketkeeper lyttelton was most successful bowler taking 4 19 grace keeping wicket to lyttelton took a catch to dismiss midwinter mortimer oval p 9 two main features of england s first innings were scotton s stonewalling and read s batting at number ten hard and rapid hitting mortimer oval p 10 scotton s 90 in six hours and read s 117 in two enabled england to reach a respectable 346 but they still had to follow on 205 runs behind but time taken by scotton s innings left australia with not enough time to bowl england out again and result was a draw australian innings of 551 is still test match record for highest total without a bowler conceding 100 runs e peate had an analysis of 2 99 other matches tour began well for australians with an innings victory in their opening match at uckfield against a team chosen by lord sheffield which included w g grace george ulyett billy barnes alfred shaw and arthur shrewsbury although fred spofforth harry boyle and billy midwinter were all playing australian bowling was performed by george giffen and joey palmer only and they both took ten wickets in match however key performance in conditions that helped bowling was alick bannerman s innings of 94 which alone outscored sheffield xi s first innings total of 86 australians had mixed success in their next five matches winning against surrey and an all england xi but losing to oxford mcc and gentlemen an innings of 71 by tup scott in a low scoring match was key to defeating surrey by 8 wickets centuries by grace a g steel and barnes gave mcc an innings victory at lord s and warner described this feat as remarkable next ten matches prior to old trafford test were played mainly in north of england and australians did very well in this period through june and into early july they lost only to north by an innings at old trafford when their batting struggled against ted peate and ulyett while good scores by a n hornby and barnes ensured north s victory giffen had a memorable game when australians played lancashire at old trafford taking a hat trick in lancashire innings and then scoring 113 that match was drawn but australians defeated both nottinghamshire and yorkshire by same three wicket margin spofforth palmer peate and tom emmett dominated match at bradford in which only 255 runs were scored in total at trent bridge bowling of giffen and palmer enabled australians to recover from a first innings deficit of 39 and win in return match against gentlemen at oval last three english batsmen including lord harris were all stumped by jack blackham robinson p 43 between first and second tests australian victory over middlesex whose batting could not cope with spofforth was their only win in four matches at lord s australians struggled in a drawn game against sussex for whom george wyatt and henry phillips both scored centuries spofforth with 14 wickets and george bonnor with an innings of 68 in a low scoring match put australians back on track when they easily defeated a strong players xi at oval an innings of 60 by lord harris helped kent recover from a first innings deficit before australians batting last collapsed to lose by 96 runs at canterbury first match against gloucestershire was drawn w g grace scoring 116 not out for his county australians won second match convincingly with an innings total of 402 giffen 91 billy murdoch 89 before dismissing gloucestershire for only 83 this began a good finish to tour as australians won five of last seven matches following third test they twice defeated south by an innings spofforth taking a total of 24 wickets in these two matches but were again beaten by north for whom dick barlow scored a century and took ten wickets in match statistical summary murdoch percy mcdonnell and giffen all scored 1 000 runs for australians in 1884 season while scott bannerman and bonnor topped 900 murdoch scored two centuries including his 211 at oval giffen mcdonnell and scott one apiece outstanding bowler as on previous tours was spofforth who took 205 wickets for australians at an average of 12 50 with a best performance of 8 62 palmer took 130 wickets at 16 14 and other main bowlers were giffen 81 wickets and boyle 62 midwinter took 15 wickets while other players bowled occasionally only blackham was wicket keeper in 28 out of 31 first class matches murdoch standing in for him in other three blackham held 23 catches and completed 16 stumpings eight fielders held more than twenty catches each most being bonnor s 31 putting australian performances into perspective only eight englishmen made 1 000 runs and only harris scored more than murdoch louis hall with four completed most centuries while harris grace ulyett and billy bates made three apiece spofforth was easily highest wicket taker beating best english bowler ted peate by 70 while palmer was third overall seven other englishmen managed 100 wickets in season in his history harry altham wrote that 1884 australians have been equated with 1882 team but he himself disagreed with that assessment he added that george giffen considered england s team in final test to have been strongest of nineteenth century altham p 159 controversy and aftermath although there had been a prior agreement on matter bad feeling about proceeds from lord s test lingered and at end of their tour fourth australians faced more recriminations from british press among other things they were accused of introducing a bloodthirsty spirit and playing too obviously for money s sake this criticism was countered by australasian of 11 october whose cricket writer tom horan though himself no supporter of murdoch s team objected to spiteful criticism from certain portions of english press and pointed out narrow minded and insulting abuse levelled at australian cricketers in his history of lord s however warner stated that australians had evidently come into favour and that rows and of past were happily over and done with warner p 84 problems spilled over into next australian season when an english team formed by alfred shaw james lillywhite and arthur shrewsbury toured a disagreement between alexander and lillywhite led to members of fourth australians refusing to play against tourists in certain matches and then being banned by colonial authorities from playing in others having agreed contracts for matches with colonial authorities lillywhite offered alexander 30 of gate receipts from first two tests but murdoch and rest of team insisted on 50 one outcome was that australia had to make eleven changes to their team for second test after terms could not be agreed with fourth australians fourth australians had made up team in first test but refused to play in second test in which nine debutants were necessary alongside tom horan and sammy jones harte pp 136 139 when fifth australians toured england in 1886 team was selected and managed by melbourne club which was mindful of past controversy as a result murdoch mcdonnell and bannerman were omitted despite still being leading batsmen harte p 141 boyle was unavailable as were horan and massie who had toured in 1882 while alexander cooper and midwinter were no longer in contention for places scott was appointed captain and other survivors of 1884 were blackham bonnor giffen palmer and spofforth references footnotes notes sources further reading category 1884 in australian cricket category 1884 in ceylon
