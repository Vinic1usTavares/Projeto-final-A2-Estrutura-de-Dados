andrew gordon ganteaume 22 january 1921 17 february 2016 was a trinidadian cricketer who played one test match for west indies in 1948 as a batsman he scored 112 in his only test innings which left him with highest test batting average in history having not played at least 20 innings ganteaume played for trinidad from a young age and was chosen to play in a test match against england following his good batting form in 1948 however his slow scoring probably cost him his place and he never played another test although he toured england with west indies in 1957 at time of his death ganteaume was oldest surviving west indies test cricketer early life ganteaume was born in belmont port of spain trinidad and tobago he had no formal cricket coaching but made his first class debut for trinidad as a wicketkeeper in 1941 as a 19 year old he scored 87 batting at number eight over next few seasons ganteaume played regularly for trinidad in first class competition and for north trinidad in a non first class island competition he also played football for trinidad team around this time but his time for sport was restricted by his career in civil service from batting in middle order ganteaume was eventually promoted to open batting as a theory at time suggested that wicketkeepers might make good openers as they became accustomed to conditions while keeping wicket ganteaume neither believed this theory nor enjoyed being an opener he scored his maiden first class century in 1946 a second followed later in year test match call up in 1947 48 season england cricket team toured west indies when team played in trinidad ganteaume scored 101 and 47 not out in first match but journalists criticised him for scoring slowly in easy batting conditions in a second match against touring side he scored 5 and 90 but was not selected in team for test match which followed ganteaume later suggested his non selection was a result of his underprivileged background however an injury to jeff stollmeyer one of west indies opening batsmen before game meant that ganteaume was called up into side england batted first to score 362 but when west indies batted ganteaume and his opening partner george carew shared a partnership of 173 once more ganteaume was criticised for slow batting although he later suggested that he had concentrated on scoring singles to allow his in form partner to face bowling on third day he carried on batting to reach his century first in a test match by a trinidadian in trinidad innings took around 270 minutes but he slowed down as he neared three figures and west indies captain sent out a note asking batsmen to score faster other batsmen also batted slowly and ganteaume later claimed that england used negative run saving tactics to slow scoring rate he did not bat in second innings when west indies needed to score runs quickly in an unsuccessful attempt to win game match was drawn having been earlier interrupted by rain which cut playing time but in knowledge that quick scoring was vital ganteaume s slow batting adversely affected west indies chances of victory ganteaume did not play in next test match he was replaced by john goddard who came into team as part of a pre arranged scheme to rotate captaincy he was chosen in a preliminary 24 man squad to tour india and pakistan in 1948 49 but did not make final selection of 16 players and was overlooked for 1950 tour of england he continued to play irregularly for trinidad in following years but played no further representative cricket until 1957 later career ganteaume was selected to tour england with west indies team in 1957 at age of 36 he played 19 first class matches on tour and scored 800 runs at an average of 27 58 he passed fifty in seven innings with a top score of 92 against glamorgan norman preston editor of wisden cricketers almanack suggested neither ganteaume nor any of other three specialist opening batsmen in team came up to expectations forcing frank worrell to open batting he never came close to selection for a test match after tour ganteaume played just twice more for trinidad in first class cricket and ended his career with 2 785 first class runs at an average of 34 81 and five centuries having played just one test innings ganteaume was left with a test batting average of 112 this is higher than that of donald bradman who has highest average of those to play more than 20 innings in a test career as of 2013 his average is highest by a former player to have appeared in a solitary test in their career there are several possible reasons why ganteaume played no further test cricket after his single match apart from slow pace of his batting during that hundred goddard later suggested that it would have been better for ganteaume s career to score a rapid 60 than a slow hundred west indies batting was strong at time and there was plenty of competition for places in team even so his teammate and later west indies captain jeff stollmeyer suggested that he was unlucky to be left out of subsequent teams it is also possible that ganteaume s career was affected by his attitude to authority cricket journalist martin williamson suggests ganteaume probably paid as much for his anti establishment attitude as for slow scoring he was certainly not someone who was going to bow and scrape to white players who still dominated region s cricket in later years ganteaume served as a test selector and was west indies manager in 1973 74 in 2007 his autobiography my story other side of coin was published in which he criticised west indies establishment of his playing days he died at age of 95 on 17 february 2016 at time of his death he was oldest surviving west indies test cricketer and second oldest in world see also one test wonder
