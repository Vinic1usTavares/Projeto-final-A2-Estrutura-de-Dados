thumb 350px original charter s 416 in british library written by aethelstan a in 931 aethelstan a is name given by historians to an unknown scribe who drafted charters or diplomas by which king made grants of land for king aethelstan of england between 928 and 935 they are an important source for historians as they provide far more information than other charters of period showing date and place of grant and having an unusually long list of witnesses including welsh kings and occasionally kings of scotland and strathclyde aethelstan a charters commence shortly after king aethelstan conquered northumbria in 927 making him first king to rule whole of england diplomas give king titles such as king of english and king of whole of britain and this is seen by historians as part of a rhetoric which reflected his master s claim for a new status higher than previous west saxon kings diplomas are written in elaborate latin known as hermeneutic style which became dominant in anglo latin literature from mid tenth century and a hallmark of english benedictine reform scholars vary widely in their views of his style which has been described as pretentious and almost impenetrable but also as poetic and as enduringly fascinating as it is complex aethelstan a ceased to draft charters after 935 and his successors returned to a simpler style suggesting that he was working on his own rather than being a member of a royal scriptorium background after death of bede in 735 latin prose in england declined it reached its lowest level in ninth century when few books and charters were produced and they were of poor quality king aethelstan s grandfather alfred great 871 899 embarked on an extensive programme to improve learning and by 890s standard of latin in charters was improving few charters survive from reigns of alfred and his son edward elder 899 924 and none from 909 to 925 until then charters had generally been plain legal documents and king aethelstan s early diplomas were similar until about 900 diplomas appear to have been drawn up in varying traditions and circumstances but in later anglo saxon times c 900 1066 charters can be more clearly defined according to simon keynes in this period a diploma can be characterised as a formal and symbolic record in latin of an occasion when king acting in a royal assembly and with consent of ecclesiastical and secular orders created an estate of bookland at a specified place and conveyed it on privileged terms defined by book or diploma to a named beneficiary this act of establishing a particular estate as bookland so that it could be held henceforth on these privileged terms could be performed only by king in a royal assembly but diploma itself served hereafter as title deed for land in question it established that land was to be held with its appurtenances free from imposition of worldly burdens with exception of military service bridge work and fortress work and with power to give it to anyone of its owner s choosing identity of aethelstan a in late nineteenth and twentieth centuries there was a debate among historians as to whether late anglo saxon charters were produced by a royal chancery or by monasteries on behalf of beneficiaries in 1910s w h stevenson argued that charters in different areas of england were drawn up by same hand which would be unlikely if they were drawn up locally supporting case that writers were royal clerks german scholar richard drogereit followed this up in 1935 by examining original charters between 931 and 963 and identified three scribes from their handwriting whom he called aethelstan a aethelstan c and edmund c other charters which only existed in copies he allocated to these and other scribes on basis of their style in 2002 keynes listed twenty aethelstan a charters of which two are original and rest copies boundary clauses of aethelstan a charters were written in correct old english so it is unlikely that he was of foreign origin witness lists of aethelstan a charters consistently place bishop aelfwine of lichfield in mercia in a higher position than his rank warranted king aethelstan was probably brought up in mercia and in sarah foot s view he was probably intimate with aelfwine before king edward s death as aelfwine disappeared from witness lists at same time as aethelstan a charters ended she suggests that he may have been aethelstan a keynes thinks it more likely aethelstan a was a king s priest from mercia who acquired his learning in a mercian religious house and respected aelfwine as a fellow mercian that aethelstan a entered aethelstan s service before he became king and was in permanent attendance on him david woodman also considers a mercian origin likely pointing out that some mercian ninth century charters have borrowings from aldhelm an important source of aethelstan a s style woodman also puts forward alternative idea that aethelstan a had a connection with glastonbury abbey in wessex which appears to have been a centre of learning at this time and certainly housed many of texts which informed aethelstan a s idiosyncratic latin style significance of charters thumb aethelstan presenting a book to st cuthbert illustration in a gospel book presented by aethelstan to saint s shrine in chester le street earliest surviving portrait of an english king first charter produced by aethelstan a in 928 described king as rex anglorum king of english first time that title had been used by 931 he had become king of english elevated by right hand of almighty to throne of whole kingdom of britain some charters were witnessed by welsh kings and occasionally by kings of scotland and strathclyde signifying acceptance of aethelstan s lordship in keynes s view it cannot be a coincidence that charters commenced immediately after conquest of northumbria and aethelstan a s primary aim was to display grandeur of aethelstan s kingship foot argues that king s inner circle quickly seized on potential of conquest for ideological aggrandizement of king s public standing to keynes diplomas are symbolic of a monarchy invigorated by success developing pretensions commensurate with its actual achievements and clothing itself in trappings of a new political order he sees fifty years from 925 to 975 as golden age of anglo saxon royal diploma before 928 charters had been produced in various ways sometimes by royal priests sometimes by other priests on behalf of beneficiaries aethelstan a was solely responsible for production of charters between 928 and 934 king aethelstan thus took unprecedented control over an important part of his functions in 935 aethelstan a shared work with other scribes and he then apparently retired his charters have exceptionally long witness lists with 101 names for a grant by king to his thegn wulfgar at in devon in 931 and 92 for a grant to aelfgar at winchester in 934 witness lists of king aethelstan s father and grandfather were much shorter with longest in alfred great s reign having only 19 names in john maddicott s view long lists in aethelstan s reign reflect a change of direction to larger assemblies king established a novel system with his scribe travelling with him from meeting to meeting and a uniform format of charters dating clause showed regnal year indiction and age of moon in keynes s view nothing quite like them had been seen before and they must have seemed magnificent even intimidating in their formality and their grandeur a unique feature is that three charters in favour of a religious community require it to sing a specified number of psalms for king indicating a particular interest in psalmody by king or scribe frankish annalists usually recorded a king s location at easter and christmas but this was not a practice of english chroniclers and only period in tenth and eleventh centuries for which historians can construct a partial itinerary of king s movements is provided by location of assemblies recorded in aethelstan a s charters of 928 to 935 other charters rarely named place of assembly apart from a group in 940s and early 950s known as alliterative charters in 935 a new simplified format was introduced by other scribes apparently while aethelstan a was still active and became standard until late 950s this coincided with disappearance of wulfstan i archbishop of york from witness lists and greater prominence of bishops of london and bishop of winchester and new format may have reflected a change of outlook at court as charters were no longer written in his distinctive style when he ceased producing them it is likely he was working on his own rather than heading a royal scriptorium style of charters standard of latin prose improved in tenth century especially after about 960 when leaders of benedictine reform movement adopted elaborate and ornate style of latin now called by historians hermeneutic style use of this style influenced especially by aldhelm s de virginitate dates back to king aethelstan s reign aethelstan a borrowed heavily from aldhelm he would not copy whole sentences only a word or a few words incorporating them in a structure reminiscent of aldhelm s works in woodman s view aethelstan a varied language in each charter out of a delight in experimentation and to demonstrate his literary ability florid style of seventh century irish texts known as hiberno latin was influential on continent due to work of irish missionaries in europe some works were known to english writers such as aldhelm in same century but it is likely that aethelstan a learnt of them from continental scholars such as israel grammarian who brought texts influenced by hiberno latin to king aethelstan s court woodman states that whilst it is true that main impetus for literary revival of latin prose occurred from mid tenth century beginnings of this style of latin can actually be found rather earlier and in most unlikely of places in fact it is diplomas of 920s and 930s that are first to display this distinctive latin in its most exuberant form according to scott thompson smith aethelstan a s diplomas are generally characterised by a rich pleonastic style with aggressively literary proems and anathemas ostentatious language and imagery throughout decorative rhetorical figures elaborate dating clauses and extensive witness lists these are clearly documents with stylistic ambitions few listeners would have understood them when they were read out at royal assemblies in charter s 425 of 934 second of two originals to survive aethelstan a wrote in smith s translation wanton fortune of deceiving world not lovely with milky white radiance of unfading lilies but odious with galling bitterness of woeful corruption raging with venomous jaws tears with its teeth sons of fetid flesh in vale of tears although with its smiles it may be alluring to unfortunate it brazenly leads down to lowest depths of unless offspring of high thunderer should intervene and so because that ruinous fortune mortally fades away in its failing one must especially hasten to pleasant fields of ineffable joy where angelic music of hymnal jubilation and mellifluous scent of blooming roses are sensed as sweet beyond measure by good and blessed noses and heard by ears as delights of musical instrument without end in s 416 of 931 first original to survive after boundary clause in old english he reverted to latin for anathema against anyone who set aside charter if however god forbid anyone swollen with diabolic spirit should be tempted to diminish or annul this brief document of my arrangement and confirmation let him know that on final and great day of judgment when archangel s shrill trumpet rings out when graves burst open by themselves and give up bodies now revived when every element trembles with traitor judas who is called son of perdition by sower s merciful offspring he is to perish in eternal confusion within hungry flames of unspeakable torments some scholars are not impressed michael lapidge describes aethelstan a s style as pretentious and according to gretsch diplomas are composed in almost impenetrable latin their proems consist of long convoluted sentences parading an ostentatious display of greek and glossary based vocabulary and containing numerous unmistakable verbal reminiscences of aldhelm s writings nothing similar had previously been attempted in anglo saxon diplomatic and although later in tenth century other charters affecting hermeneutic style were composed ferocious lexical and syntactical difficulties of these aethelstan charters were never to be surpassed on other hand drogereit describes aethelstan a s style as having a poetic quality and woodman describes him as an author of no little genius a man who not only overhauled legal form of diploma but also had ability to write latin that is as enduringly fascinating as it is complex in woodman s view never before had royal diploma s rhetorical properties been exploited to such a degree and it seems no coincidence that these documents appeared following king aethelstan s momentous political conquest of north in 927 list of charters keynes
