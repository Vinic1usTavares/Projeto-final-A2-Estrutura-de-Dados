is repeated in full musicologist markus rathey notes that in secular model tonet ihr pauken bach had not initially thought of beginning with timpani alone but arrived at present version in a later revision rathey suggests that bach sought a more dramatic way to begin with reduced force and let music increase in keeping with his endeavor to transfer operatic features from dresden to leipzig rathey observes how contemporary listeners may interpret dominant trumpets as royal instruments here three trumpets and timpani corresponding to obbligato trumpet in aria grosser herr uns starker konig which addresses newborn as king and saviour 2 tenor begins with secco recitative it came to pass at that time from luke 2 1 3 6 it is one of longest recitatives in oratorio beginning with decree

again but there is no record of it although performances of jauchzet frohlocket in services on christmas day have become rare they are regularly held in leipzig where work was first performed cantata
