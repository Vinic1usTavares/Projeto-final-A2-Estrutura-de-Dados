subtropical storm andrea was first named storm and first subtropical cyclone of 2007 atlantic hurricane season andrea developed out of a non tropical low on may 9 about 150 miles 240 km northeast of daytona beach florida three weeks before official start of season after encountering dry air and strong vertical wind shear andrea weakened to a subtropical depression on may 10 while remaining nearly stationary and national hurricane center discontinued advisories early on may 11 andrea s remnant was subsequently absorbed into another extratropical storm on may 14 andrea was first pre season storm to develop since tropical storm ana in april 2003 additionally storm was first atlantic named storm in may since tropical storm arlene in 1981 storm produced rough surf along coastline from florida to north carolina causing beach erosion and some damage in some areas waves eroded up to 20 feet 6 m of beach leaving 70 homes in danger of collapse offshore north carolina high waves of 34 feet 10 m and tropical storm force winds damaged three boats their combined nine passengers were rescued by coast guard although all nine sustained injuries light rainfall was also reported in some coastal locations damage was minimal but six people drowned as a result of storm meteorological history in early may an upper level trough dropped southward through western atlantic ocean forcing a back door cold front a cold front that moves southwestward ahead of a building surface ridge to its north or northeast southward for several days forecast models had anticipated for trough to evolve into a closed low pressure area and on may 6 a frontal low with a large and well defined circulation developed about 90 miles 140 km east of cape hatteras low maintained scattered convection around its circulation center and in conjunction with strong high pressure to its north a very tight pressure gradient produced gale force winds near coastline extratropical storm tracked southeastward and later turned to southwest while steadily deepening on may 7 it attained hurricane force winds with a lack of tropical moisture its corresponding convection was minimal and scattered national hurricane center first mentioned possibility of tropical cyclogenesis on may 8 while storm was located about 230 miles 370 km east southeast of south carolina coastline its associated convection had steadily increased as it tracked slowly westward at 5 10 mph 8 16 km h system changed little in organization throughout day though by following morning hurricane specialists indicated low was acquiring subtropical characteristics as it tracked over progressively warmer waters early on may 9 a hurricane hunters flight into system revealed winds of 45 mph 70 km h and a flat thermal core which indicated system was neither warm core nor cold core in addition satellite imagery indicated a consolidation of convection near center as well as hints of upper level outflow and a contraction of radius of maximum winds from more than 115 miles 185 km to about 70 miles 120 km based on observations and hybrid structure of system national hurricane center classified low as subtropical storm andrea at 1500 utc on may 9 about 150 miles 240 km northeast of daytona beach florida during a subsequent analysis of storm researchers estimated that storm had transitioned into a subtropical cyclone nine hours earlier as andrea developed before june 1 traditional start of hurricane seasons in atlantic ocean it became first pre season storm since tropical storm ana in april 2003 additionally storm was first atlantic named storm in may since tropical storm arlene in 1981 right thumb a satellite animation of formation of subtropical storm andrea as seen in water vapor imagery upon first becoming a subtropical cyclone andrea was embedded within a large nearly stationary deep layer trough resulting in a westward movement drifting over sea surface temperatures of no more than 77 deg f 25 degc organization of system deteriorated with a significant decrease in convection by early on may 10 much of associated weather was located to east of cyclone within a band of moderate convection due to a brief spell of westerly vertical wind shear center of circulation had become disorganized with several small cloud swirls within larger circulation this disorganization of center combined with increasing wind shear and dry air suppressing convective activity caused it to begin weakening later that morning by 1500 utc on may 10 only a few thunderstorms remained near center and thus nhc downgraded andrea to subtropical depression status though a few intermittent thunderstorms persisted over eastern semicircle depression remained disorganized and weak national hurricane center discontinued advisories early on may 11 after it had been without significant deep convection for 18 hours about 80 miles 125 km northeast of cape canaveral florida later on may 11 convection re fired over center as system drifted south southeastward though it lacked sufficient organization to qualify as a tropical cyclone by may 12 shower activity had organized greatly to east of center and national hurricane center remarked that a small increase in convection would result in formation of a tropical depression it accelerated east northeastward away from continental united states without redeveloping and after passing over cooler waters remnants of andrea merged with an approaching cold front on may 14 preparations due to rough surf from precursor low local national weather service offices issued a high surf advisory for much of coastline from florida through north carolina upon first becoming a subtropical cyclone national hurricane center issued a tropical storm watch from mouth of altamaha river in georgia southward to flagler beach florida watch was discontinued after andrea weakened to a subtropical depression additionally a gale warning was issued for much of south carolina coastline at isle of palms in south carolina workers and dozens of firefighters prepared sandbags in preparation for high tide after waves from storm previously caused moderate beach erosion as a precaution officials there intentionally cut power and gas to multiple uninhabited buildings officials closed schools in dare county north carolina due to threat for high winds from storm north carolina department of transportation also canceled ferry transportation to and from ocracoke and knotts island north carolina impact right thumb subtropical storm andrea shortly after being classified on may 9 prior to becoming a subtropical cyclone low produced gale force winds and dangerous surf near coast from north carolina through georgia and later along coast of florida significant swells were also reported in bahamas waves caused beach erosion and washed up against coastal houses along southeast coast of united states southeastern u s off coast of north carolina storm produced 34 foot 10 m waves and storm force winds which damaged three boats their combined nine passengers were rescued by coast guard all nine were injured to some degree three endured hypothermia one received a broken rib and one coast guardsman experienced back injuries from surf another boat and its four occupants were reported missing and after twelve days they remain missing rough waves from precursor low left two kayakers missing near seabrook island south carolina one was found next day and other was found dead a week later onshore winds reached 52 mph 84 km h in norfolk virginia with an unofficial report of 57 mph 92 km h near virginia beach similar observations occurred along outer banks with winds knocking some tree limbs onto power lines some isolated power outages were reported wind damage included some roofs losing shingles from winds in elizabeth city north carolina an outer rainband dropped 0 5 inches 10 mm of precipitation in about two hours as well as several lightning strikes one bolt of lightning injured two firefighters winds covered portions of north carolina highway 12 with sand and for a day route was closed after waves from storm washed out about 200 feet 60 m of roadway in some locations waves eroded up to 20 feet 6 m of beach leaving 70 homes in imminent danger on st simons island in georgia storm produced a storm tide of 8 09 feet 2 43 m trace amounts of rainfall occurred in southeastern portion of state florida in florida waves of over 10 feet 3 m in height capsized a boat near lantana two occupants were rescued without injury additionally waves displaced a sailboat that had previously been washed ashore in juno beach large waves flooded a parking lot and destroyed several fences and tree branches at jupiter beach which resulted in its temporary closure nearby a maintenance shed was destroyed eight leatherback sea turtle nests in boca raton were destroyed after surf reached dunes due to high surf beach pier at flagler beach was closed for about a day minor to moderate beach erosion caused florida department of transportation to fill in areas near seawall with sand one death occurred when a surfer drowned in rough waves off coast at new smyrna beach in volusia county outer rainbands produced light rainfall with highest report in jacksonville national weather service area of responsibility totaling 0 77 inches 20 mm bands also caused tropical storm force wind gusts in northeastern portion of state winds spread smoke from local brush fires through tampa bay area to miami high winds from andrea were
