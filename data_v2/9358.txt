manufacturing by 1878 firm was producing 200 000 tons of iron per annum bell was a professional metallurgist and industrial chemist constantly pioneering processes such as recycling of heat from escaping flue gases and trialling many process improvements 1n 1859 bell opened britain s first factory able to manufacture aluminium a metal which had been as costly as gold because of difficulty of chemically reducing metal from an oxide on day it opened at washington bell toured newcastle in his carriage saluting crowds with an aluminium top hat plant used new deville sodium process durham

of recently discovered element thallium when british association met in newcastle that autumn metal was obtained from flue deposits mainly lead sulphate from manufacture of sulphuric acid from pyrites one of products of washington works all credit was given to researcher henri who was chief of laboratories at washington having experienced languor and headache then known to be caused by breathing thallium fumes cleveland ironstone had been considered inferior for steelmaking as it contained a relatively high percentage of phosphorus at 1 8 to 2 0 weakening resulting iron bell directed large scale experiments at a cost of up to ps50 000 equivalent to ps3 million in 2004 adjusted for rpi resulting in a basic steel process which produced steel rails containing no more than 0 07 phosphorus his obituary in times of 1904 noted as a sign of progress that bell himself had brought about that bell could recall seeing wooden rails in use on tramroads by which coal was brought down to river tees in 1867 and 1868 bell gave papers on state of manufacture of iron and that of foreign competitors in particular france belgium and germany britain s great strength lay in its incomparable fields of coal which constitute so important a feature in our mineral wealth he stated that although price and quality of coal were better in britain cost of labour could be as much as 20 25 lower

industrialist among his friends were famous victorians such as charles darwin thomas huxley william morris and john ruskin howell 2008 p4 however howell writes lowthian was admired rather than loved
