acting style and reputation cooper s acting style consisted of three essential characteristics his ability to project elements of his own personality onto characters he portrayed to appear natural and authentic in his roles and to underplay and deliver restrained performances calibrated for camera and screen acting teacher lee strasberg once observed simplest examples of stanislavsky s ideas are

characters meyers 1998 p 156 film director francois truffaut ranked cooper among greatest actors because of his ability to deliver great performances without direction this ability to project elements

d swear it s worst job of acting in history of motion pictures meyers 1998 p 165 fellow actors admired his abilities as an actor commenting on her two films playing opposite cooper actress ingrid
