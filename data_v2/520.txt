tower became tallest building in perth it is also currently equal tenth tallest building in australia and tallest building in western half of australia diagrams skyscraperpage com approval of tower was controversial due to plot ratio concessions made by perth city council to developers these concessions enabled developers to construct a tower more than twice height which would otherwise be allowable on site there was also opposition to council s decision to ignore its own town planning experts in allowing a large car park to be constructed underneath site thumb en central park tower taken from st george s building is formed by a composite steel and concrete frame with various setbacks in its profile meaning upper floors are much smaller in area than lower levels outrigger trusses

history department stores from as early as 1930s site was home to a foy gibson department store which was known by locals as foy s store extended all way through from st georges terrace to hay street featured a popular cafeteria and had great areas of window display with island windows beyond street frontage store changed to a david jones department store upon purchase by that chain of foy s western australian operations by late 1970s david jones had withdrawn from western australian market and site stood vacant after decades as a landmark of st georges terrace site was later acquired by central park developments a joint venture of superannuation board of western australia bond corporation and l r connell and partners and in 1986 had a value of a 20 million planning approval a planned 150 million redevelopment of site was announced in october 1985 plans included a 45 storey office tower underground car parking a landscaped park and extension of hay street mall westwards to alongside development demolition of site had started by october 1986 by which time planned tower had been expanded slightly to 47 floors 1987 approval of redevelopment by perth city council was controversial council s own town planning scheme imposed a limit on number of parking bays in central business district to ensure that city streets could handle increased traffic levels coming from extra parking under scheme site was only entitled to 300 car parking bays developers sought approval for 1 175 car parking bays which council planning experts had said would cause traffic to back up to king street waiting for entry council wanted developers to consider constructing a road tunnel from mounts bay road to underground parking to reduce traffic congestion around tower however developers only agreed to consider building a pedestrian underpass beneath st georges terrace final planning approval for redevelopment was ultimately passed by council in an 18 9 decision on 19 october 1987 after a discussion of over two hours council made various planning concessions to allow development to have 1 175 car parking bays and exceed allowable plot ratio and they were really excited about that council allowed developers to transfer 15 storeys worth of plot ratio from landscaped park at corner of william and hay streets and gave bonuses of 10 storeys for actually building park and 4 storeys for public space and quality of development as a result more than half of tower s eventual 51 floors came from these planning concessions councillors peter gallagher les johnston and michael hale argued that approval of redevelopment set a dangerous precedent and state s planning minister bob pearce said that building was too big and that council should not have granted extra parking bays to developers at time of planning approval site was owned by amp reserve bank of australia and central park developments bond connell corporation state government approved plans in
