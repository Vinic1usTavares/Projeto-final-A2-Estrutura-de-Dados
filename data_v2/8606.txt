right thumb 200px a rochdale corporation pail closet seated area is on right chamber on left was for disposal of common household waste a pail closet or pail privy was a room used for disposal of human excreta under pail system or rochdale system of waste removal closet a word which had long had one meaning as toilet was a small outhouse privy which contained a seat underneath which a portable receptacle was placed this bucket pail into which user would defecate was removed and emptied by local authority on a regular basis contents known euphemistically as night soil would either be incinerated or composted into fertiliser although more advanced water closet flush toilet was popular in wealthy homes lack of an adequate water supply and poor sewerage meant that in 19th century england in working class neighbourhoods towns and cities often chose dry conservancy methods of waste disposal pail closet was an evolution of midden closet privy midden an impractical and unsanitary amenity considered a nuisance to public health pail system was popular in france and england particularly in historic lancashire town of rochdale from which system commonly took its name pail closet was not without its own problems if pail was not emptied on a regular basis it overflowed and became unhygienic some manufacturers lined pail with absorbent materials and other designs used mixtures of dry earth or ash to disguise smell improved water supplies and sewerage systems in england led directly to replacement of pail closet during early 20th century municipal collection of pail toilets continued in australia into second half of twentieth century in western world pail closet has now been almost completely replaced by flush toilet however similar systems still exist in poor countries and are discussed at sanitation before pail closet pail closets were used to dispose of human excreta dirty water and general household waste such as kitchen refuse and sweepings pail closet system was one of several methods of waste disposal in common use in 19th century others of which were privy midden system pail system and dry earth system middens right thumb diagram of a midden closet in nottingham by 1869 manchester had a population of about 354 000 people who were served by about 10 000 water closets flush toilets and 38 000 middensteads an investigation of condition of city s sewer network revealed that it was choked up with an accumulation of solid filth caused by overflow from middens middens and middensteads both refer to ash pits or refuse heaps such problems forced city authorities to consider other methods of dealing with human excretion although water closet was used in wealthy homes concerns over river pollution costs and available water supplies meant that most towns and cities chose more labour intensive dry conservancy systems manchester was one such city and by 1877 its authorities had replaced about 40 000 middens with pail and midden closets rising to 60 000 by 1881 soil surrounding old middens was cleared out connections with drains and sewers removed and dry closets erected over each site a contemporary estimate stated that installation of about 25 000 pail closets removed as much as of urine and accompanying faeces from city s drains sewers and rivers midden closet was a development of privy which had evolved from primitive fosse ditch midden closets were still used in latter part of 19th century but were rapidly falling out of favour a mr redgrave in a speech to institution of civil engineers in 1876 said that midden closet represented standard of all that is utterly wrong constructed as it is of porous materials and permitting free soakage of filth into surrounding soil capable of containing entire dejections from a house or from a block of houses for months and even years 1868 rivers pollution commission reported two years later privies and are continually to be seen full to overflowing and as filthy as can be these middens are cleaned out whenever notice is given that they need it probably once half yearly on an average by a staff of night men with their attendant carts midden closets were therefore generally insanitary and were also difficult to empty and clean later improvements such as a midden closet built in nottingham used a brick raised seat above a concave receptacle to direct excreta toward centre of pit which was lined with cement to prevent leakage into surrounding soil this closet was also designed with a special opening through which material could be scattered over top of pit a special ventilation shaft was also installed design offered a significant improvement over less advanced midden privy but problems of emptying and cleaning such pits remained and thus pail system with its easily removable container became more popular types right thumb a full pail complete with lid left and an empty pail ready to be returned these are rochdale pails made from wood manchester s

industrially produced sanitary ware now in gladstone pottery museum rochdale system rochdale system was first used in 1869 it used a wooden tub or pail sometimes half of a petroleum barrel which was placed under closet seat pails were often circular to aid cleaning and were designed to be easily handled and of a size that encouraged regular collections top of pail carried a cast iron rim about 3 inches deep to receive a tight fitting inner lid pails were collected on a weekly basis during day each pail was secured by its lid and loaded onto a sealed 24 bay wagon to be taken to a depot where they were emptied cleaned and returned while pail was removed from closet a replacement was installed in its place in 1874 rochdale corporation employed five such wagons in full time service collecting from 3 354 privies spread across town by contrast with a much larger population manchester corporation employed 73 wagons by 1875 4 741 pails were in use and in 1876 number was 5 566 a separate cart accompanied wagon to collect other household refuse which was collected from a separate chamber in pail closet about of night soil were collected in rochdale each year from a population of about 64 000 roughly per person at depot night soil was emptied into a storage tank pails were washed in a large trough using a mixture of chloride of lime and water night soil was then dried in revolving cylinders using furnace heat from other borough refuse before being transferred to so called drying plates gases were burnt in a furnace fumes escaping up a chimney clinker from remains of burnt refuse was used to make mortar manure works was a filthy environment filled with dust enginemen were paid 7 1 4d firemen 6 1 2d and general labourers 4 1 2d fertiliser was transported from works via railway to local filtration plots for disposal some pails were supplied with such as iron sulphate manchester corporation attempted to remove smell of putrefaction by attaching cinder to their closets so that fine ash could be poured on top of excrement goux system invented in 1860s by pierre nicholas goux a landowner near paris and widely used in france overcame some of more common problems associated with pail closets by lining pail with an absorbent material rochdale corporation experimented with goux s design for several months but settled instead on a system which used smaller pails goux s system did however find a home in halifax where it was used in more than 3 000 closets after 1870 wooden pails used in halifax were oval in cross section about 24 by 19 inches and 16 inches deep each was lined at sides and bottom with a mixture of refuse such as straw grass street sweepings wool hair and even seaweed this lining which was formed by a special mould and to which sulphate of lime was added was designed to help remove smell of urine slow putrefaction and keep excreta dry pails were collected between 7 am and 5 30 pm members of public occasionally complained about smell which usually occurred when a pail was left to overflow such as in winter 1875 when severe weather conditions prevented horse pulled collection wagons from reaching closets earth closet system thumb upright henry moule s dry earth closet this example is from around 1875 in some areas an earth closet was used invented by henry moule this system used a metal container as with pail system but small amounts of a mixture of peat dry earth and ashes were used to cover excreta removing any smells almost immediately these were often applied with a small scoop or shovel but more elaborate systems existed where powder was kept in a box near seat with a small handle to control amount deposited on excrement charcoal which could be obtained cheaply from street sweepings and sawdust were also used to good effect process was more expensive than simpler pail system mixture of earth and excreta could often be dried and re used but fear of infections meant that it was sometimes used instead as a garden fertiliser earth closets were usually housed in a separate building from main structure and were well ventilated as with pail system earth closet containers were designed to be emptied frequently earth closet was popular and was used in private houses military camps hospitals and extensively in india it remained in use well into 1930s disadvantages from a sanitary perspective pail system of waste removal was imperfect excreta and other general waste were often left above ground for hours sometimes even days at a time in his report on goux system used in salford epidemiologist john radcliffe commented in every instance where a pail had been in use over two or three days capacity of absorption of liquid dejections claimed by patentee for absorbent material had been exceeded and whenever a pail had been four or five days a week in use it was filled to extent of two thirds or more of its cavity with liquid dejections in which solid excrement was floating pail closet contained several important design considerations in his 1915 essay to american public health association author richard messer described some of more commonly encountered problems popularity following successes seen in various northern towns about 7 000 pail closets were introduced in 1871 in leicester where implementation of water closets had been hindered by refusal of water company to provide adequate supplies use of pail closets reduced demand placed upon area s inadequate sewerage system but town suffered with difficulties in collection and treatment of night soil initially night soil was collected by contractors but after 1873 local authority became responsible authority found dealing with night soil an expensive and difficult business and following legal proceedings against corporation in 1878 transport of night soil was transferred from railway system to canal barges this however led to complaints that canal was being polluted in 1886 authority found that river soar was badly polluted by sewage and so they built a sewage farm at beaumont leys by end of 19th century this and construction of a new sewer system enabled all pail closets to be phased out and replaced by water closets in manchester faced with phenomenal population growth council attempted to retain pail closet system but following exposure of dumping of of human faeces into medlock and irwell rivers at their holt town sewage works council was forced to change their plans originally they had intended to build incinerators but public objections to dumping of waste into rivers forced council instead to purchase carrington moss in 1886 and chat moss in 1895 which were both developed as refuse disposal sites but by 1930s neither site was still receiving night soil water closet having replaced dry conservancy in manchester geographic spread pail system was used throughout europe in french cities such as marseille and le havre and english towns and cities such as leeds birmingham and manchester but it was popular in town of rochdale from which rochdale system of pail collection took its name it was widespread in australia too decline and end in coventry number of pail closets in use declined from about 712 in 1907 to 92 in 1912 and only 16 by 1926 pail toilets with municipal collection persisted in australia well into second half of twentieth century brisbane its third most populous city relied on dunny carts until 1950s one source says until 1970s because population was so dispersed it was difficult to install sewerage tar creosote and disinfectant kept smell down academic george seddon claimed that typical australian back yard in cities and country towns had throughout first half of twentieth century a dunny against back fence so that pan could be
