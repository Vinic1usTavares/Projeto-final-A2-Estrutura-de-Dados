ethics and animal cognition situating animals in two level utilitarianism of r m hare was published in 2012 by oxford university press varner 2012 varner had been working on questions about r m hare and animals since 2001 when he taught a graduate class exploring subject given that peter singer was a student of hare varner was interested in exploring whether hare s philosophy endorsed singer s conclusions about animal liberation varner 2012 pp xi xii a project entitled animals situating animals in two level utilitarianism of r m hare was submitted to oxford university press but this was subsequently split into two books personhood ethics and animal cognition was first while second forthcoming sustaining animals envisioning humane sustainable communities in under contract with publisher varner gary biographical narrative texas a m university accessed november 13 2016 while personhood ethics and animal cognition addresses theoretical issues in hare s philosophy sustaining animals is more practically focussed exploring applicability of harean philosophy developed in personhood ethics and animal cognition to real world issues concerning human animal relationships in 2017 varner s defending biodiversity environmental science and ethics co authored with university of guelph ecologist jonathan newman and guelph philosopher stefan linquist was published by cambridge university press thought biocentric individualism varner s in nature s interests offers a resolution of debate between individualistic approaches to animal rights and holistic accounts of environmental ethics varner defends an interest based biocentric individualism according to which all living beings including 2000 p 235 have morally significant interests that ground prima facie though duties rowlands 2000 p 598 approach follows in tradition of work of kenneth goodpaster and paul w taylor though varner s approach differs from taylor s in its focus on interests rather than duties with varner showing clear utilitarian commitments varner begins by critiquing holistic approaches to environmental ethics using j baird s as his example he argues that burden of proof is with to defend claim that ecosystems have interests or have value for some other reason he next considers desires as paradigmatic basis of interests exploring which beings have desires nonetheless he argues that desires cannot be sole basis of interests 19th century mariners for instance had an interest in using ascorbic acid to avoid scurvy though they could not have desired acid as they did not know about it instead such people had a biological interest in acid it is varner argues presence of biological interests that separates living beings from artifacts this grounds varner s argument for biocentrism which mark rowlands summarises as follows nothing at or below level of a fish possesses desires nevertheless all living things possess biological needs and these needs are plausibly construed as interests welfare of an organism o is at least in part to be understood in terms of interests rather than desires of o therefore all living things have a welfare therefore all living things are morally considerable rowlands 2000 p 599 rowlands argues that problem with book s central approach is that it assumes that all interests have a clear relation to welfare and thus moral considerability an assumption which he argues is partially undermined by introduction of biological interests rowlands 2000 pp 599 601 jon jensen who reviewed book for ethics and environment raised a similar worry arguing that varner did not sufficiently justify his claim that biological interests are inherently morally significant jensen 2000 p 237 a distinctive aspect of varner s theory as presented in in nature s interests is hierarchy of interests that he proposes biological interests are least important with desire based interests of greater significance and ground projects possessed only by humans these are a nexus of an individual s most important desires of most weight jensen 2000 pp 237 8 thus varner defends a kind of axiological anthropocentrism this can be distinguished from valuational anthropocentrism according to which only humans have inherent value jensen 2000 p 238 book also has a practical dimension presenting debates between anthropocentric and non anthropocentric approaches to environmental ethics as of little practical consequence and suggesting that animal rights goals can be consistent with holistic environmentalist goals jensen 2000 p 236 jensen argues that varner s own discussion of reconciliation of environmentalism and animal advocacy is too narrow but that nonetheless varner s own biocentric individualism offers potential in this area even despite limited engagement in book with practical animal related issues jensen 2000 pp 238 9 two level utilitarianism hare s philosophy of two level utilitarianism has been a focus of varner s since early 2000s and was subject of his personhood ethics and animal cognition in book varner breaks with his previous biocentrism instead endorsing idea that sentience is necessary and sufficient for moral considerability prescriptivism and two level utilitarianism attfield and humphreys 2012 p 493 book is split into three parts hare s two level utilitarianism persons near persons and merely sentient and formulating ils intuitive level system rules for persons near persons and merely sentient first part offers a reconstruction and analysis of hare s philosophy while latter two offer an original position on animal ethics and personhood kadlac 2015 p 247 in part i varner offers considerable endorsement of harean philosophy varner interprets hare as understanding that utilitarianism derives from prescriptivism and affirms hare s argument on this point he goes on to discuss utility of intuitive level system ils rules attfield and humphreys 2012 p 494 these are rules that one lives by in day to day life which though ultimately justified by it do not derive their content from utilitarian calculation varner 2012 chap 3 there are for varner four key kinds of ilss common morality personal morality professional ethics and laws though these are deontological in flavor following precepts of these ilss is generally justified under two level utilitarianism kadlac 2015 p 248 further arguments these are original rather than being derived from hare s own are then offered for hare s prescriptivism attfield and humphreys 2012 pp 494 5 in part ii varner adopts a higher order thought theory of consciousness and reviews evidence for animal consciousness he argues that according to contemporary science vertebrates are conscious i e sentient able to feel pain but few invertebrates are cephalopods are an exception andrews 2014 p 491 he goes on to argue that most animals lack a biographical sense of self something possessed by paradigmatic humans a good life for human persons consequently consists in living a good story attfield and humphreys 2012 p 495 meaning that persons can be harmed in ways that non persons cannot kadlac 2015 p 249 varner denies that nonhuman animals lack psychological sophistication necessary for personhood but argues that some nonetheless may be near persons this means that they lack a biographical sense of self but possess consciousness possible candidates include nonhuman primates as well as cetacea and elephantidae and rats and parrots andrews 2014 p 690 varner frames lives of near persons as of less significance than lives of persons but of greater significance than lives of other animals who are nonetheless sentient attfield and humphreys 2012 p 496 distinctions drawn in part ii are logically independent of any commitment to utilitarianism harean or otherwise in part iii varner explores argument idea that it would be ethically acceptable to painlessly kill beings if it was immediately replaced with a new equally happy being in context of two level utilitarianism at critical level he argues that both humans and animals are replaceable however he argues that intuitive level idea that humans are not replaceable should be respected moss 2015 p 227 animals typically kept on farms are for varner replaceable meaning that certain forms of animal agriculture are permissible varner s also claims that there is a prima facie good in creating more happy animals and more happy humans latter meaning that there is a prima facie good in human procreation and a prima facie wrong in abortion this however applies only to critical level thinking and good intuitive level theorising he argues would typically leave these decisions up to individuals moss 2015 p 228 varner also explores issue of marginal cases given that he holds that lives of nonhuman non persons and nonhuman near persons are of lesser value than those of human persons it may seem that varner has to accept that lives of human non persons and human near persons are of less value than lives of human persons or else face charge of speciesism or inconsistency however varner argues that human non and near persons should be given equal rights to life as human persons on basis that first human persons have strong relationships with human non persons and second human persons may fear becoming human non persons varner then considers a range of proposals for sustainable humane agriculture including replacing cattle with buffalo and engineering blind chickens varner defends demi vegetarianism holding that humans should eat less meat and be more selective about where their meat comes from kadlac 2015 pp 249 50 factory farming for example is likely unacceptable andrews 2014 p 659 book closes with a consideration of relationship between a harean approach to animal ethics and singer s approach varner argues that singer has employed two level utilitarianism and implicitly supports idea of near persons also argues that singer despite latter s advocacy for vegetarianism presents a theory that supports certain forms of humane agriculture attfield and humphreys 2012 pp 496 7 selected bibliography varner gary 1990 biological functions
