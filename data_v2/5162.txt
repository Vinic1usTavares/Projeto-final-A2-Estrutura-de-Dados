saab jas 39 gripen english griffin is a light single engine multirole fighter aircraft manufactured by swedish aerospace company saab it was designed to replace saab 35 draken and 37 viggen in swedish air force flygvapnet gripen has a delta wing and canard configuration with relaxed stability design and fly by wire flight controls it is powered by volvo rm12 and has a top speed of mach 2 later aircraft are modified for nato interoperability standards and to undertake air to air refuelling in 1979 swedish government began development studies for an aircraft capable of fighter attack and reconnaissance missions to replace saab 35 draken and 37 viggen a new design from saab was selected and developed as jas 39 first flying in 1988 following two crashes during flight development and subsequent alterations to aircraft s flight control software gripen entered service with swedish air force in 1996 upgraded variants featuring more advanced avionics and adaptations for longer mission times began entering service in 2003 to market aircraft internationally saab formed partnerships and collaborative efforts with overseas aerospace companies one example of such efforts was gripen international a joint partnership between saab and bae systems formed in 2001 gripen international was responsible for marketing aircraft and was heavily involved in successful export of type to south africa organisation was later dissolved amidst allegations of bribery being employed to secure foreign interest and sales on export market gripen has achieved moderate success in sales to nations in central europe south africa and southeast asia bribery has been suspected in some of these but authorities closed investigation in 2009 a further version designated gripen jas 39e f is beginning deliveries to swedish and brazilian air forces as of 2019 it has previously been referred to as gripen ng or super jas changes include adoption of a new powerplant general electric f414g an active electronically scanned array radar and significantly increased internal fuel capacity saab has proposed other derivatives including a navalised gripen maritime for carrier operations and an optionally manned aircraft for unmanned operations sweden and brazil have ordered gripen e f and switzerland initially selected it for procurement as of september 2019 298 gripens have been built development origins in late 1970s sweden sought to replace its ageing saab 35 draken and saab 37 viggen swedish air force required an affordable mach 2 aircraft with good short field performance for a defensive dispersed basing plan in event of invasion plan included 800 m long by 17 m wide rudimentary runways that were part of bas 90 system one goal was for aircraft to be smaller than viggen while equalling or improving on its payload range characteristics early proposals included saab 38 also called intended as an attack aircraft and trainer and a 20 a development of viggen that would have capabilities as a fighter attack and sea reconnaissance aircraft several foreign designs were also studied including general dynamics f 16 fighting falcon mcdonnell douglas f a 18 hornet northrop f 20 and dassault mirage 2000 ultimately swedish government opted for a new fighter to be developed by saab svenska aeroplan in 1979 government began a study calling for a versatile platform capable of jas standing for air to air attack air to surface and reconnaissance indicating a multirole or fighter aircraft that can fulfill multiple roles during same mission several saab designs were reviewed most promising being project 2105 redesignated project 2108 and later project 2110 recommended to government by defence materiel administration forsvarets or fmv in 1980 jas ig jas jas industry group was established

were weight reduction and lowering component count on 30 june 1982 with approval from riksdag fmv issued contracts worth sek 25 7 billion to saab covering five prototypes and an initial batch of 30 production aircraft by january 1983 a viggen was converted to a flying test aircraft for jas 39 s intended avionics such as fly by wire controls jas 39 received name gripen griffin via a public competition which is heraldry on saab s logo testing production and improvements saab rolled out first gripen on 26 april 1987 marking company s 50th anniversary originally planned to fly in 1987 first flight was delayed by 18 months due to issues with flight control system on 9 december 1988 first prototype serial number 39 1 took its 51 minute maiden flight with pilot stig holmstrom at controls during test programme concern surfaced about aircraft s avionics specifically fly by wire flight control system fcs and relaxed stability design on 2 february 1989 this issue led to crash of prototype during an attempted landing at linkoping test pilot lars radestrom walked away with a broken elbow cause of crash was identified as pilot induced oscillation caused by problems with fcs s pitch control routine in response to crash saab and us firm calspan introduced software modifications to aircraft a modified lockheed nt 33a was used to test these improvements which allowed flight testing to resume 15 months after accident on 8 august 1993 production aircraft 39102 was destroyed in an accident during an aerial display in stockholm test pilot radestrom lost control of aircraft during a roll at low altitude when aircraft stalled forcing him to eject saab later found problem was high amplification of pilot s quick and significant stick command inputs ensuing investigation and flaw correction delayed test flying by several months resuming in december 1993 first order included an option for another 110 which was exercised in june 1992 batch ii consisted of 96 one seat jas and 14 two seat jas jas 39b variant is 66 cm 26 in longer than jas 39a to accommodate a second seat which also necessitated deletion of cannon and a reduced internal fuel capacity by april 1994 five prototypes and two series production gripens had been completed but a beyond visual range missile bvr had not yet been selected a third batch was ordered in june 1997 composed of 50 upgraded single seat jas 39cs and 14 jas 39d two seaters known as turbo gripen with nato compatibility for exports batch iii aircraft delivered between 2002 and 2008 possess more powerful and updated avionics in

sell a large portion of its stake in saab and that saab would take full responsibility for marketing and export orders of gripen in june 2011 saab announced that an internal investigation revealed evidence of acts of corruption by bae systems including money laundering in south africa one of gripen s customers on 26 april 2007 norway signed a million joint development agreement with saab to co operate in development programme of gripen including integration of norwegian industries in development of future versions of aircraft in june of same year saab also entered an agreement with thales norway a s concerning development of communications systems for gripen fighter this order was first awarded under provisions of letter of agreement signed by norwegian ministry of defence and gripen international in april 2007 as a result of united states diplomatic cables leak in 2010 it was revealed that us diplomats had become concerned with co operation between norway and sweden on topic of gripen and had sought to exert pressure against a norwegian purchase of aircraft in december 2007 as part of gripen international s marketing efforts in denmark a deal was signed with danish technology supplier a s that lets them participate in an industrial co operation programme over next 10 15 years total value of programme is estimated at over billion and is partly dependent on a procurement of gripen by denmark controversies scandals and costs developing an advanced multi role fighter was a major undertaking for sweden predecessor viggen despite being less advanced and less expensive had been criticised for occupying too much of sweden s military budget and was branded a cuckoo in military nest by critics as early as 1971 at 1972 party congress of social democrats dominant party in swedish politics since 1950s a motion was passed to stop any future projects to develop advanced military aircraft in 1982 gripen project passed in riksdag by a margin of 176 for and 167 against with entire social democratic party voting against proposal due to demands for more studies a new bill was introduced in 1983 and a final approval was given in april 1983 with condition that project was to have a predetermined fixed price contract a decision that would later be criticised as unrealistic due to later cost overruns according to annika brandstrom in aftermath of 1989 and 1993 crashes gripen risked a loss of credibility and weakening of its public image there was public speculation that failures to address technical problems exposed in first crash had directly contributed to second crash and thus had been avoidable brandstrom observed that media elements had called for greater public accountability and explanation of project ill informed media analysis had also distorted public knowledge of gripen sitting conservative government quickly endorsed and supported gripen minister of defense anders bjorck issued a public reassurance that project was very positive for sweden in connection to gripen s marketing efforts to multiple countries including south africa austria czechia and hungary there were reports of widespread bribery and corruption by bae systems and saab in 2007 swedish journalists reported that bae had paid bribes equivalent to millions of dollars following criminal investigations in eight countries only one individual in austria alfons was prosecuted for bribery scandal tarnished international reputation of gripen bae systems saab and sweden gripen s cost has been subject to frequent attention and speculation in 2008 saab announced reduced earnings for that year partly attributing this to increased marketing costs for aircraft in 2008 saab disputed norway s cost calculations for gripen ng as overestimated and in excess of real world performance with existing operators a 2007 report by european union institute for security studies stated total research and development costs of gripen were eur1 84 billion according to a study by jane s information group in 2012 gripen s operational cost was lowest among several modern fighters it was estimated at 4 700 per flight hour swedish ministry of defense estimated cost of full system comprising 60 gripen e f at sek 90 billion distributed over period 2013 42 swedish armed forces estimated that maintaining 100 c d model aircraft until 2042 would cost sek 60 billion while

overview thumb underside of a gripen in flight 2012 alt jet aircraft performing rolls while climbing alt light grey aircraft banking tightly revealing its underside gripen is a multirole fighter aircraft intended as a lightweight and agile aerial platform with advanced highly adaptable avionics it has canard control surfaces that contribute a positive lift force at all speeds while generous lift from delta wing compensates for rear stabiliser producing negative lift at high speeds increasing induced drag being intentionally unstable and employing digital fly by wire flight controls to maintain stability removes many flight restrictions improves manoeuvrability and reduces drag gripen also has good short takeoff performance being able to maintain a high sink rate and strengthened to withstand stresses of short landings a pair of air brakes are located on sides of rear fuselage canards also angle downward to act as air brakes and decrease landing distance it is capable of flying at a 70 80 degrees angle of attack to enable gripen to have a long service life roughly 50 years saab designed it to have low maintenance requirements major systems such as rm12 engine and ps 05 a radar are modular to reduce operating cost and increase reliability gripen was designed to be flexible so that newly developed sensors computers and armaments could be integrated as technology advances aircraft was estimated to be roughly 67 sourced from swedish or european suppliers and 33 from us one key aspect of gripen program that saab have been keen to emphasise has been technology transfer agreements and industrial partnerships with export customers gripen is typically customised to customer requirements enabling routine inclusion of local suppliers in manufacturing and support processes a number of south african firms provide components and systems including communications suite and electronic warfare systems for gripens operated by south african air force operators also have access to gripen s source code and technical documentation allowing for upgrades and new equipment to be independently integrated some export customers intend to domestically assemble gripen it has been proposed that brazilian aerospace manufacturer embraer may produce gripens for other export customers as well avionics and sensors all of gripen s avionics are fully integrated using five mil std digital data buses in what is described as sensor fusion total integration of avionics makes gripen a programmable aircraft allowing software updates to be introduced over time to increase performance and allow for additional operational roles and equipment ada programming language was adopted for gripen and is used for primary flight controls on final prototypes from 1996 onwards and all subsequent production aircraft gripen s software is continuously being improved to add new capabilities as compared to preceding viggen which was updated only in an 18 month schedule much of data generated from onboard sensors and by cockpit activity is digitally recorded throughout length of an entire mission this information can be replayed in cockpit or easily extracted for detailed post mission analysis using a data transfer unit that can also be used to insert mission data to aircraft gripen like viggen was designed to operate as one component of a networked national defence system which allows for automatic exchange of information in real time between gripen aircraft and ground facilities according to saab gripen features world s most highly developed data link gripen s tactical navigation system combines information from multiple onboard systems such as air data computer radar altimeter and gps to continuously calculate gripen s location gripen entered service using ps 05 a pulse doppler x band multi mode radar developed by ericsson and gec marconi which is based on latter s advanced blue vixen radar for sea harrier that also served as basis for eurofighter s captor radar all weather radar is capable of locating and identifying targets 120 km 74 mi away and automatically tracking multiple targets in upper and lower spheres on ground and sea or in air it can guide several beyond visual range air to air missiles to multiple targets simultaneously saab stated ps 05 a is able to handle all types of air defence air to surface and reconnaissance missions

during cold war swedish armed forces were to be ready to defend against a possible invasion this scenario required defensive force dispersal of combat aircraft in bas 90 system to maintain an air defence capacity thus a key design goal during gripen s development was ability to take off from snow covered landing strips of only furthermore a short turnaround time of just ten minutes during which a team composed of a technician and five conscripts would be able to re arm refuel and perform basic inspections and servicing inside that time window before returning to flight during design process great priority was placed on facilitating and minimising aircraft maintenance in addition to a maintenance friendly layout many subsystems and components require little or no maintenance at all aircraft are fitted with a health and usage monitoring system hums that monitors performance of various systems and provides information to technicians to assist in servicing it saab operates a continuous improvement programme information from hums and other systems can be submitted for analysis according to saab gripen provides 50 lower operating costs than its best competitor a 2012 jane s aerospace and defense consulting study compared operational costs of a number of modern combat aircraft concluding that gripen had lowest cost per flight hour cpfh when fuel used pre flight preparation and repair and scheduled airfield level maintenance together with associated personnel costs were combined gripen had an estimated cpfh of us 4 700 whereas next lowest f 16 block 40 50 had
