powerful class were a pair of first class protected cruisers built for royal navy rn in 1890s designed to hunt down enemy commerce raiders both ships served on china station and participated in second boer war of 1899 1900 went on to help suppress boxer rebellion a few months later served as flagship of australia station in 1905 1912 shortly after her return home she became a training ship and remained in that role until she was sold for scrap in 1929 terrible was mostly in reserve after she returned home in 1902 and was often used as an accommodation ship during first world war she was disarmed and made one voyage as a troop transport in 1915 ship became a depot ship when she returned home and then became a training ship in 1918 terrible was sold for scrap in 1932 background thumb left 300px right elevation deck plan and armament layout from brassey s naval annual 1897 impetus for construction of powerful class began with laying down russian armoured cruiser in 1890 that was intended to be used as a commerce raider although admiralty was fully occupied with extensive naval construction mandated by naval defence act 1889 and could do nothing in response at that time some preliminary discussions occurred in november 1891 but it was not until following year that william white director of naval construction was told to prepare sketch designs for a ship more heavily armed at least as well armoured faster and with greater endurance than rurik and her successors russian attempts to seize fast ocean liners in 1885 and convert them into armed merchant cruisers also dictated that new ships needed to be fast enough to catch them white s preliminary studies had led him to conclusion a very large amount of coal would be needed to permit a high speed pursuit of a commerce raider without losing time to re coal coupled with large number of boilers needed to achieve speed required which meant that a very large ship was necessary more than longer than s then under construction to ensure that cruisers could maintain high speed in bad weather white gave them a high freeboard which made them very seaworthy white believed that design required lightweight efficient belleville water tube boilers if it was to achieve its requirements but conservatives in parliament and admiralty resisted idea given rn s failures with water tube boilers in past until extensive trials were conducted by torpedo gunboat and proved to be a complete success admiralty approved design on 23 october 1893 and they were ordered in 1893 1894 naval estimates observers criticised these ships for their light armament given their size in magazine engineer white rebutted their arguments by pointing out that it was impossible to add additional ammunition which made addition of more guns pointless he added that armament of powerfuls accounted for 27 percent more of displacement than preceding and was protected by of armour as against in edgars admiralty did not find ships satisfactory as they required a crew 64 percent larger than edgars cost 61 percent more and had very nearly same armament naval historian antony preston commented powerful and terrible also mark extreme folly of building cruisers to match specific opponents in practice intended opponents never meet and it is always wiser to build affordable ships in large numbers no navy could afford to build large numbers of powerful type and even british empire at height of its power found them too expensive description powerful class displaced at normal load they had an overall length of a beam of and a draught of as they were intended for overseas service their steel hulls were sheathed in wood to prevent biofouling hull had a double bottom and was subdivided into 236 watertight compartments at deep load terrible had a metacentric height of while powerfuls was their designed complement consisted of 894 officers and ratings largest crew in rn at that time ships were propelled by a pair of vertical inverted four cylinder triple expansion steam engines each driving one propeller using steam provided by 48 belleville boilers with a working pressure of these were first cruisers in royal navy with four funnels their engines were designed to produce a total of using forced draught for a maximum speed of ships reached a maximum speeds of from during their sea trials they normally carried of coal which gave them a range of at but they had a maximum capacity of largest coal bunkers of any ship in rn at that time armament and protection main armament of powerful class cruisers consisted of two 40 calibre bl mk viii guns in single gun turrets one each fore and aft of superstructure mounts could elevate up to 15deg and guns fired a projectile with a muzzle velocity of to a maximum range of their secondary armament of a dozen 40 calibre quick firing qf mk i or ii guns was arranged in casemates amidships end casemates were first two storey guns on main and upper decks casemates in rn guns had a maximum range of at an elevation of 15deg from their shell at a muzzle velocity of for defence against torpedo boats sixteen 12 pounder 12 cwt cwt is abbreviation for hundredweight 12 cwt referring to weight of gun guns were fitted eight of these guns were mounted in embrasures at ships bow and stern on main and upper decks and remaining eight guns were placed amidships on upper deck their shells had a range of at an elevation of 20deg at a muzzle velocity of ships were equipped with a dozen 3 pounder hotchkiss guns mounted in pair of fighting tops on military fore and mainmasts two additional 12 pounder 8 cwt guns could be dismounted for service ashore ships also mounted four submerged 18 inch 450 mm torpedo tubes a pair on each broadside ships generally used harvey armour gun turrets were 6 inches thick on their face and sides with a roof their barbettes and casemates were protected by 6 inch armour plates and latter had rear plates conning tower was protected by plates they had a curved armoured deck that had its crown in middle of ship above waterline and edges were below waterline deck was thick over machinery thick over magazines and thick in middle of ship bottom of protective deck was only 2 5 inches thick modifications after completing their sea trials funnels were heightened by to improve draught of boilers mark i wireless telegraph radio sets were installed in each ship in 1900 1901 ships were refitted in 1902 1903 and four more six inch guns were added in casemates amidships at that time although no additional ammunition could be accommodated three pounders were removed from powerfuls upper fighting tops in 1904 1905 and both ships were fitted with fire control equipment in upper fore and lower main tops in 1905 1906 all of terribles three pounders had been removed by 1910 but powerful retained her remaining guns as late as february 1912 torpedo tubes were removed from both ships in 1914 ships following table gives build details and

participated in fleet review commemorating queen victoria s diamond jubilee in 1897 they both served on china station and powerful went out later that year terrible had engine problems and was not commissioned until following year she set a record ferrying relief crews for mediterranean fleet from portsmouth to malta in only 121 hours in late 1898 ship was ordered to relieve powerful in far east in late 1899 but they were both diverted to south africa in light of rising tensions between british and boers ships arrived in mid october a few days after second boer war began terribles captain percy scott then improvised field carriages for some naval guns to satisfy a request for more long range artillery powerfuls captain hon hedworth lambton led a naval brigade and some of percy s guns to reinforce garrison of ladysmith in late november terrible contributed a naval brigade and guns of her own during relief of ladysmith in december 1899 march 1900 performance of gun crews from both ships inspired rn s field gun competition ships continued on their respective voyages after ladysmith was in march powerful to much acclaim in england and terrible to china where her crew and guns helped to suppress boxer rebellion a few months later they were part of relief force that reached foreign quarter of tientsin in june as well as expedition that defeated chinese forces in city of tientsin in mid july and then they participated in second relief expedition to peking in august before returning to ship in september afterwards scott devoted himself and his crew to gunnery training and later had his methods adopted by entire royal navy upon returning home both ships paid off and received long refits in 1902 1903 they spent next several years in reserve powerful became flagship of australia station in 1905 until her return home in 1912 and then became a training ship until 1929 when she was sold for scrap terrible was principally in reserve after her return from china in 1902 and then served as an accommodation ship during first world war she had most of her armament removed and briefly served as a troop transport before becoming a depot ship terrible then served as a training ship from 1918 until 1932 when in her turn she was sold for scrap notes citations references external links powerful class cruiser on dreadnought project category cruiser classes category
