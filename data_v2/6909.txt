combination of band and audience song was written for end of opera after main character bobby is killed and universal chord is sounded main characters disappear leaving behind government and army who are left to bully each other townshend described song as one that screams defiance at those who feel any cause is better than no cause he later said that song was not strictly anti revolution despite lyric we ll be fighting in streets but stressed that revolution could be unpredictable adding don t expect to see what you expect to see expect nothing and you might gain everything bassist john entwistle later said that song showed townshend saying things that really mattered to him and saying them for first time townshend had been reading universal sufism founder inayat khan s mysticism of sound and music which referred to spiritual harmony and universal chord which would restore harmony to humanity when sounded townshend realised that newly emerging synthesizers would allow him to communicate these ideas to a mass audience he had met bbc radiophonic workshop which gave him ideas for capturing human personality within music townshend interviewed several people with general practitioner style questions and captured their heartbeat brainwaves and astrological charts converting result into a series of audio pulses for demo of won t get fooled again he linked a lowrey organ into an ems vcs 3 filter that played back pulse coded modulations from his experiments he subsequently upgraded to an arp 2500 synthesizer did not play any sounds directly as it was instead it

who s first attempt to record song was at record plant on w 44 street new york city on 16 march 1971 manager kit lambert had recommended studio to group which led to his producer credit though de facto work was done by felix pappalardi this take featured pappalardi s mountain band mate leslie west on lead guitar lambert proved to be unable to mix track and a fresh attempt at recording was made at start of april at mick jagger s house stargroves using rolling stones mobile studio glyn johns was invited to help with production and he decided to re use synthesized organ track from townshend s original demo as re recording of part in new york was felt to be inferior to original keith moon had to carefully synchronise his drum playing with synthesizer while townshend and entwistle played electric guitar and bass townshend played a 1959 gretsch 6120 chet atkins hollow body guitar fed through an edwards volume pedal to a fender bandmaster amp all of which he had been given by joe walsh while in new york this combination became his main electric guitar recording setup for subsequent albums although intended as a demo recording end result sounded so good to band and johns they decided
