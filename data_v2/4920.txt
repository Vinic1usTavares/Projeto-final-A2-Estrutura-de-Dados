and goddesses worshipped in ancient egypt beliefs and rituals surrounding these gods formed core of ancient egyptian religion which emerged sometime in prehistory deities represented natural forces and phenomena and egyptians supported and appeased them through offerings and rituals so that these forces would continue to function according to maat or divine order after founding of egyptian state around 3100 bc authority to perform these tasks was controlled by pharaoh who claimed to be gods representative and managed temples where rituals were carried out gods complex characteristics were expressed in myths and in intricate relationships between deities family ties loose groups and hierarchies and combinations of separate gods into one deities diverse appearances in art as animals humans objects and combinations of different forms also alluded through symbolism to their essential features in different eras various gods were said to hold highest position in divine society including solar deity ra mysterious god amun and mother goddess isis highest deity was usually credited with creation of world and often connected with life giving power of sun some scholars have argued based in part on egyptian writings that egyptians came to recognize a single divine power that lay behind all things and was present in all other deities yet they never abandoned their original polytheistic view of world except possibly during era of atenism in 14th century bc when official religion focused exclusively on impersonal sun god aten gods were assumed to be present throughout world capable of influencing natural events and course of human lives people interacted with them in temples and unofficial shrines for personal reasons as well as for larger goals of state rites egyptians prayed for divine help used rituals to compel deities to act and called upon them for advice humans relations with their gods were a fundamental part of egyptian society definition beings in ancient egyptian tradition who might be labeled as deities are difficult to count egyptian texts list names of many deities whose nature is unknown and make vague indirect references to other gods who are not even named egyptologist james p allen estimates that more than 1 400 deities are named in egyptian texts whereas his colleague christian says there are thousands upon thousands of gods egyptian language s terms for these beings were ntr god and its feminine form goddess scholars have tried to discern original nature of gods by proposing etymologies for these words but none of these suggestions has gained acceptance and terms origin remains obscure hieroglyphs that were used as ideograms and determinatives in writing these words show some of traits that egyptians connected with divinity most common of these signs is a flag flying from a pole similar objects were placed at entrances of temples representing presence of a deity throughout ancient egyptian history other such hieroglyphs include a falcon reminiscent of several early gods who were depicted as falcons and a seated male or female deity feminine form could also be written with an egg as determinative connecting goddesses with creation and birth or with a cobra reflecting use of cobra to depict many female deities egyptians distinguished ntrw gods from rmt people but meanings of egyptian and english terms do not match perfectly term ntr may have applied to any being that was in some way outside sphere of everyday life deceased humans were called ntr because they were considered to be like gods whereas term was rarely applied to many of egypt s lesser supernatural beings which modern scholars often call demons egyptian religious art also depicts places objects and concepts in human form these personified ideas range from deities that were important in myth and ritual to obscure beings only mentioned once or twice that may be little more than metaphors confronting these blurred distinctions between gods and other beings scholars have proposed various definitions of a deity one widely accepted definition suggested by jan assmann says that a deity has a cult is involved in some aspect of universe and is described in mythology or other forms of written tradition according to a different definition by dimitri meeks ntr applied to any being that was focus of ritual from this perspective gods included king who was called a god after his coronation rites and deceased souls who entered divine realm through funeral ceremonies likewise preeminence of great gods was maintained by ritual devotion that was performed for them across egypt origins first written evidence of deities in egypt comes from early dynastic period c 3100 2686 bc deities must have emerged sometime in preceding predynastic period before 3100 bc and grown out of prehistoric religious beliefs predynastic artwork depicts a variety of animal and human figures some of these images such as stars and cattle are reminiscent of important features of egyptian religion in later times but in most cases there is not enough evidence to say whether images are connected with deities as egyptian society grew more sophisticated clearer signs of religious activity appeared earliest known temples appeared in last centuries of predynastic era along with images that resemble iconographies of known deities falcon that represents horus and several other gods crossed arrows that stand for neith and enigmatic set animal that represents set thumb upright left alt crude stone statue of a baboon late predynastic statue of baboon god wer many egyptologists and anthropologists have suggested theories about how gods developed in these early times gustave for instance thought egyptians first revered primitive fetishes then deities in animal form and finally deities in human form whereas henri frankfort argued that gods must have been envisioned in human form from beginning some of these theories are now regarded as too simplistic and more current ones such as siegfried morenz hypothesis that deities emerged as humans began to distinguish themselves from and personify their environment are difficult to prove predynastic egypt originally consisted of small independent villages because many deities in later times were strongly tied to particular towns and regions many scholars have suggested that pantheon formed as disparate communities coalesced into larger states spreading and intermingling worship of old local deities others have argued that most important predynastic gods were like other elements of egyptian culture present all across country despite its political divisions final step in formation of egyptian religion was unification of egypt in which rulers from upper egypt made themselves pharaohs of entire country these sacred kings and their subordinates assumed right to interact with gods and kingship became unifying focus of religion new deities continued to emerge after this transformation some important deities such as isis and amun are not known to have appeared until old kingdom c 2686 2181 bc places and concepts could inspire creation of a deity to represent them and deities were sometimes created to serve as opposite sex counterparts to established gods or goddesses kings were said to be divine although only a few continued to be worshipped long after their deaths some non royal humans were said to have favor of gods and were venerated accordingly this veneration was usually short lived but court architects and amenhotep son of were regarded as gods centuries after their lifetimes as were some other officials through contact with neighboring civilizations egyptians also adopted foreign deities who is first mentioned in old kingdom may have come from nubia and baal anat and astarte among others were adopted from canaanite religion during new kingdom c 1550 1070 bc in greek and roman times from 332 bc to early centuries ad deities from across mediterranean world were revered in egypt but native gods remained and they often absorbed cults of these newcomers into their own worship characteristics modern knowledge of egyptian beliefs about gods is mostly drawn from religious writings produced by nation s scribes and priests these people were elite of egyptian society and were very distinct from general populace most of whom were illiterate little is known about how well this broader population knew or understood sophisticated ideas that elite developed commoners perceptions of divine may have differed from those of priests populace may for example have mistaken religion s symbolic statements about gods and their actions for literal truth but overall what little is known about popular religious belief is consistent with elite tradition two traditions form a largely cohesive vision of gods and their nature roles alt relief of a seated woman with an elaborate headdress in her lap is a child with a cap shaped crown whose head she cradles thumb upright right isis a mother goddess and a patroness of kingship holds pharaoh seti i in her lap most egyptian deities represent natural or social phenomena gods were generally said to be immanent in these phenomena to be present within nature types of phenomena they represented include physical places and objects as well as abstract concepts and forces god shu was deification of all world s air goddess oversaw a limited region of earth theban necropolis and god sia personified abstract notion of perception major gods were often involved in several types of phenomena for instance khnum was god of elephantine island in midst of nile river that was essential to egyptian civilization he was credited with producing annual nile flood that fertilized nation s farmland perhaps as an outgrowth of this life giving function he was said to create all living things fashioning their bodies on a potter s wheel gods could share same role in nature ra atum khepri horus and other deities acted as sun gods despite their diverse functions most gods had an overarching role in common maintaining maat universal order that was a central principle of egyptian religion and was itself personified as a goddess but some deities represented disruption to maat most prominently apep was force of chaos constantly threatening to annihilate order of universe and set was an ambivalent member of divine society who could both fight disorder and foment it not all aspects of existence were seen as deities although many deities were connected with nile no god personified it in way that ra personified sun short lived phenomena such as rainbows or eclipses were not represented by gods neither were fire water or many other components of world roles of each deity were fluid and each god could expand its nature to take on new characteristics as a result gods roles are difficult to categorize or define despite this flexibility gods had limited abilities and spheres of influence not even creator god could reach beyond boundaries of cosmos that he created and even isis though she was said to be cleverest of gods was not omniscient richard h wilkinson however argues that some texts from late new kingdom suggest that as beliefs about god amun evolved he was thought to approach omniscience and omnipresence and to transcend limits of world in a way that other deities did not deities with most limited and specialized domains are often called minor divinities or demons in modern writing although there is no firm definition for these terms some demons were guardians of particular places especially in duat realm of dead others wandered through human world and duat either as servants and messengers of greater gods or as roving spirits that caused illness or other misfortunes among humans demons position in divine hierarchy was not fixed protective deities bes and taweret originally had minor demon like roles but over time they came to be credited with great influence most feared beings in duat were regarded as both disgusting and dangerous to humans over course of egyptian history they came to be regarded as fundamentally inferior members of divine society and to represent opposite of beneficial life giving major gods yet even most revered deities could sometimes exact vengeance on humans or each other displaying a demon like side to their character and blurring boundaries between demons and gods behavior divine behavior was believed to govern all of nature except for few deities who disrupted divine order gods actions maintained maat and created and sustained all living things they did this work using a force egyptians called heka a term usually translated as magic heka was a fundamental power that creator god used to form world and gods themselves alt fresco of a woman with stars on her body and a red sun near her mouth thumb upright sky goddess nut swallows sun which travels through her body at night to be reborn at dawn gods actions in present are described and praised in hymns and funerary texts in contrast mythology mainly concerns gods actions during a vaguely imagined past in which gods were present on earth and interacted directly with humans events of this past time set pattern for events of present periodic occurrences were tied to events in mythic past succession of each new pharaoh for instance reenacted horus s accession to throne of his father osiris myths are metaphors for gods actions which humans cannot fully understand they contain seemingly contradictory ideas each expressing a particular perspective on divine events contradictions in myth are part of egyptians many faceted approach to religious belief what henri frankfort called a multiplicity of approaches to understanding gods in myth gods behave much like humans they feel emotion they can eat drink fight weep sicken and die some have unique character traits set is aggressive and impulsive and thoth patron of writing and knowledge is prone to long winded speeches yet overall gods are more like archetypes than well drawn characters different versions of a myth could portray different deities playing same archetypal role as in myths of eye of ra a feminine aspect of sun god who was represented by many goddesses deities mythic behavior is inconsistent and their thoughts and motivations are rarely stated most myths lack highly developed characters and plots because their symbolic meaning was more important than elaborate storytelling first divine act is creation of cosmos described in several creation myths they focus on different gods each of which may act as creator deities eight gods of who represent chaos that precedes creation give birth to sun god who establishes order in newly formed world ptah who embodies thought and creativity gives form to all things by envisioning and naming them atum produces all things as emanations of himself and amun according to theology promoted by his priesthood preceded and created other creator gods these and other versions of events of creation were not seen as contradictory each gives a different perspective on complex process by which organized universe and its many deities emerged from undifferentiated chaos period following creation in which a series of gods rule as kings over divine society is setting for most myths gods struggle against forces of chaos and among each other before withdrawing from human world and installing historical kings of egypt to rule in their place a recurring theme in these myths is effort of gods to maintain maat against forces of disorder they fight vicious battles with forces of chaos at start of creation ra and apep battling each other each night continue this struggle into present another prominent theme is gods death and revival clearest instance where a god dies is myth of osiris s murder in which that god is resurrected as ruler of duat sun god is also said to grow old during his daily journey across sky sink into duat at night and emerge as a young child at dawn in process he comes into contact with rejuvenating water of nun primordial chaos funerary texts that depict ra s journey through duat also show corpses of gods who are enlivened along with him instead of being immortal gods periodically died and were reborn by repeating events of creation thus renewing whole world but it was always possible for this cycle to be disrupted and for chaos to return some poorly understood egyptian texts even suggest that this calamity is destined to happen that creator god will one day dissolve order of world leaving only himself and osiris amid primordial chaos locations alt relief showing four people with varying sets of hieroglyphs on their heads thumb right deities personifying provinces of egypt gods were linked to specific regions of universe in egyptian tradition world includes earth sky and duat surrounding them is dark formlessness that existed before creation gods in general were said to dwell in sky although gods whose roles were linked with other parts of universe were said to live in those places instead most events of mythology set in a time before gods withdrawal from human realm take place in an earthly setting deities there sometimes interact with those in sky duat in contrast is treated as a remote and inaccessible place and gods who dwell there have difficulties in communicating with those in world of living space outside cosmos is also said to be very distant it too is inhabited by deities some hostile and some beneficial to other gods and their orderly world in time after myth most gods were said to be either in sky or invisibly present within world temples were their main means of contact with humanity each day it was believed gods moved from divine realm to their temples their homes in human world there they inhabited cult images statues that depicted deities and allowed humans to interact with them in temple rituals this movement between realms was sometimes described as a journey between sky and earth as temples were focal points of egyptian cities god in a city s main temple was patron deity for city and surrounding region deities spheres of influence on earth centered on towns and regions they presided over many gods had more than one cult center and their local ties changed over time they could establish themselves in new cities or their range of influence could contract therefore a given deity s main cult center in historical times is not necessarily his or her place of origin political influence of a city could affect importance of its patron deity when kings from thebes took control of country at start of middle kingdom c 2055 1650 bc they elevated thebes patron gods first war god montu and then amun to national prominence names and epithets in egyptian belief names express fundamental nature of things to which they refer in keeping with this belief names of deities often relate to their roles or origins name of predatory goddess sekhmet means powerful one name of mysterious god amun means hidden one and name of nekhbet who was worshipped in city of nekheb means she of nekheb many other names have no certain meaning even when gods who bear them are closely tied to a single role names of sky goddess nut and earth god geb do not resemble egyptian terms for sky and earth egyptians also devised false etymologies giving more meanings to divine names a passage in coffin texts renders name of funerary god sokar as sk r meaning cleaning of mouth to link his name with his role in opening of mouth ritual while one in pyramid texts says name is based on words shouted by osiris in a moment of distress connecting sokar with most important funerary deity gods were believed to have many names among them were secret names that conveyed their true natures more profoundly than others to know true name of a deity was to have power over it importance of names is demonstrated by a myth in which isis poisons superior god ra and refuses to cure him unless he reveals his secret name to her upon learning name she tells it to her son horus and by learning it they gain greater knowledge and power in addition to their names gods were given epithets like possessor of splendor ruler of abydos or lord of sky that describe some aspect of their roles or their worship because of gods multiple and overlapping roles deities can have many epithets with more important gods accumulating more titles and same epithet can apply to many deities some epithets eventually became separate deities as with an epithet applied to several goddesses meaning great enchantress which came to be treated as an independent goddess host of divine names and titles expresses gods multifarious nature gender and sexuality egyptians regarded division between male and female as fundamental to all beings including deities some deities were androgynous but most examples are found in context of creation myths in which androgynous deity represents undifferentiated state that existed before world was created atum was primarily male but had a feminine aspect within himself who was sometimes seen as a goddess known as iusaaset or nebethetepet creation began when atum produced a sexually differentiated pair of deities shu and his consort tefnut similarly neith was said to possess masculine traits and was sometimes regarded as a creator goddess but she was mainly seen as female sex and gender were closely tied to creation and thus rebirth male gods were often connected with kingship and active role in conceiving children female deities were often relegated to a supporting role stimulating their male consorts virility and nurturing their children although goddesses were given a larger role in procreation late in egyptian history goddesses acted as mythological mothers and wives of kings and thus as prototypes of human queenship hathor who was mother or consort of horus and most important goddess for much of egyptian history exemplified this relationship between divinity and king female deities also had a violent aspect that could be seen either positively as with goddesses wadjet and nekhbet who protected king or negatively myth of eye of ra contrasts feminine aggression with sexuality and nurturing as goddess rampages in form of sekhmet or another dangerous deity until other gods appease her at which point she becomes a benign goddess such as hathor who in some versions then becomes consort of a male god egyptian conception of sexuality was heavily focused on heterosexual reproduction and homosexual acts were usually viewed with disapproval some texts nevertheless refer to homosexual behavior between male deities in some cases most notably when set sexually assaulted horus these acts served to assert dominance of active partner and humiliate submissive one other couplings between male deities could be viewed positively and even produce offspring as in one text in which khnum is born from union of ra and shu relationships egyptian deities are connected in a complex and shifting array of relationships a god s connections and interactions with other deities helped define its character thus isis as mother and protector of horus was a great healer as well as patroness of kings such relationships were base material from which myths were formed alt statue of a man with a crown standing between a man holding a staff and a woman with head of a lioness thumb right gods ptah and sekhmet flank king who takes role of their child nefertum family relationships are a common type of connection between gods deities often form male and female pairs families of three deities with a father mother and child represent creation of new life and succession of father by child a pattern that connects divine families with royal succession osiris isis and horus formed quintessential family of this type pattern they set grew more widespread over time so that many deities in local cult centers like ptah sekhmet and their child nefertum at memphis and amun mut and khonsu at thebes were assembled into family triads genealogical connections like these are changeable in keeping with multiple perspectives in egyptian belief hathor could act as mother to any child god including child form of sun god although in other circumstances she was sun god s daughter other divine groups were composed of deities with interrelated roles or who together represented a region of egyptian mythological cosmos there were sets of gods for hours of day and night and for each nome province of egypt some of these groups contain a specific symbolically important number of deities paired gods sometimes have similar roles as do isis and her sister nephthys in their protection and support of osiris other pairs stand for opposite but interrelated concepts that are part of a greater unity ra who is dynamic and light producing and osiris who is static and shrouded in darkness merge into a single god each night groups of three are linked with plurality in ancient egyptian thought and groups of four connote completeness rulers in late new kingdom promoted a particularly important group of three gods above all others amun ra and ptah these deities stood for plurality of all gods as well as for their own cult centers major cities of thebes heliopolis and memphis and for many threefold sets of concepts in egyptian religious thought sometimes set patron god of nineteenth dynasty kings and embodiment of disorder within world was added to this group which emphasized a single coherent vision of pantheon nine product of three and three represents a multitude so egyptians called several large groups enneads or sets of nine even if they had more than nine members most prominent ennead was ennead of heliopolis an extended family of deities descended from atum which incorporates many important gods term ennead was often extended to include all of egypt s deities this divine assemblage had a vague and changeable hierarchy gods with broad influence in cosmos or who were mythologically older than others had higher positions in divine society at apex of this society was king of gods who was usually identified with creator deity in different periods of egyptian history different gods were most frequently said to hold this exalted position horus was most important god in early dynastic period ra rose to preeminence in old kingdom amun was supreme in new and in ptolemaic and roman periods isis was divine queen and creator goddess newly prominent gods tended to adopt characteristics from their predecessors isis absorbed traits of many other goddesses during her rise and when amun became ruler of pantheon he was conjoined with ra to become a solar deity manifestations and combinations alt relief of a man with an erection wearing a headdress of two feathers and a disk thumb upright amun ra a form of amun with solar characteristics of ra and procreative powers connected with min solar disk on his headdress is taken from ra and his erect phallus comes from iconography of min gods were believed to manifest in many forms egyptians had a complex conception of human soul consisting of several parts spirits of gods were composed of many of these same elements ba was component of human or divine soul that affected world around it any visible manifestation of a god s power could be called its ba thus sun was called ba of ra a depiction of a deity was considered a ka another component of its being which acted as a vessel for that deity s ba to inhabit cult images of gods that were focus of temple rituals as well as sacred animals that represented certain deities were believed to house divine bas in this way gods could be ascribed many bas and kas which were sometimes given names representing different aspects of god s nature everything in existence was said to be one of kas of atum creator god who originally contained all things within himself and one deity could be called ba of another meaning that first god is a manifestation of other s power divine body parts could act as separate deities like eye of ra and hand of atum both of which were personified as goddesses gods were so full of life giving power that even their bodily fluids could transform into other living things humankind was said to have sprung from creator god s tears and other deities from his sweat nationally important deities gave rise to local manifestations which sometimes absorbed characteristics of older regional gods horus had many forms tied to particular places including horus of nekhen horus of buhen and horus of edfu such local manifestations could be treated almost as separate beings during new kingdom one man was accused of stealing clothes by an oracle supposed to communicate messages from amun of pe he consulted two other local oracles of amun hoping for a different judgment gods manifestations also differed according to their roles horus could be a powerful sky god or vulnerable child and these forms were sometimes counted as independent deities gods were combined with each other as easily as they were divided a god could be called ba of another or two or more deities could be joined into one god with a combined name and iconography local gods were linked with greater ones and deities with similar functions were combined ra was connected with local deity sobek to form sobek ra with his fellow ruling god amun to form amun ra with solar form of horus to form ra horakhty and with several solar deities as khepri ra atum on rare occasion even deities of different sexes were joined in this way producing combinations like osiris neith and mut min this linking of deities is called syncretism unlike other situations for which this term is used egyptian practice was not meant to fuse competing belief systems although foreign deities could be syncretized with native ones instead syncretism acknowledged overlap between deities roles and extended sphere of influence for each of them syncretic combinations were not permanent a god who was involved in one combination continued to appear separately and to form new combinations with other deities but closely connected deities did sometimes merge horus absorbed several falcon gods from various regions such as khenti and khenti kheti who became little more than local manifestations of him hathor subsumed a similar cow goddess bat and an early funerary god khenti amentiu was supplanted by osiris and anubis aten and possible monotheism in reign of akhenaten c 1353 1336 bc in mid new kingdom a single solar deity aten became sole focus of state religion akhenaten ceased to fund temples of other deities and erased gods names and images on monuments targeting amun in particular this new religious system sometimes called atenism differed dramatically from polytheistic worship of many gods in all other periods whereas in earlier times newly important gods were integrated into existing religious beliefs atenism insisted on a single understanding of divine that excluded traditional multiplicity of perspectives yet atenism may not have been full monotheism which totally excludes belief in other deities there is evidence suggesting that general populace was still allowed to worship other gods in private picture is further complicated by atenism s apparent tolerance for some other deities such as maat shu and tefnut for these reasons egyptologist dominic montserrat suggested that akhenaten may have been worshipping a single deity while acknowledging existence of others in any case atenism s aberrant theology did not take root among egyptian populace and akhenaten s successors returned to traditional beliefs unity of divine in traditional religion thumb alt bronze statue of a bearded man with multiple arms wings horns and several animal heads emerging from sides of his head upright right god bes with attributes of many other deities images like this one represent presence of a multitude of divine powers within a single being scholars have long debated whether traditional egyptian religion ever asserted that multiple gods were on a deeper level unified reasons for this debate include practice of syncretism which might suggest that all separate gods could ultimately merge into one and tendency of egyptian texts to credit a particular god with power that surpasses all other deities another point of contention is appearance of word god in wisdom literature where term does not refer to a specific deity or group of deities in early 20th century for instance e a wallis budge believed that egyptian commoners were polytheistic but knowledge of true monotheistic nature of religion was reserved for elite who wrote wisdom literature his contemporary james henry breasted thought egyptian religion was instead pantheistic with power of sun god present in all other gods while hermann junker argued that egyptian civilization had been originally monotheistic and became polytheistic in course of its history in 1971 erik hornung published a study rebutting these views he points out that in any given period many deities even minor ones were described as superior to all others he also argues that unspecified god in wisdom texts is a generic term for whichever deity reader chooses to revere although combinations manifestations and iconographies of each god were constantly shifting they were always restricted to a finite number of forms never becoming fully interchangeable in a monotheistic or pantheistic way hornung says describes egyptian religion better than other labels an egyptian could worship any deity at a particular time and credit it with supreme power in that moment without denying other gods or merging them all with god that he or she focused on hornung concludes that gods were fully unified only in myth at time before creation after which multitude of gods emerged from a uniform nonexistence hornung s arguments have greatly influenced other scholars of egyptian religion but some still believe that at times gods were more unified than he allows jan assmann maintains that notion of a single deity developed slowly through new kingdom beginning with a focus on amun ra as all important sun god in his view atenism was an extreme outgrowth of this trend it equated single deity with sun and dismissed all other gods then in backlash against atenism priestly theologians described universal god in a different way one that coexisted with traditional polytheism one god was believed to transcend world and all other deities while at same time multiple gods were aspects of one according to assmann this one god was especially equated with amun dominant god in late new kingdom whereas for rest of egyptian history universal deity could be identified with many other gods james p allen says that coexisting notions of one god and many gods would fit well with multiplicity of approaches in egyptian thought as well as with practice of ordinary worshippers he says that egyptians may have recognized unity of divine by identifying their uniform notion of god with a particular god depending on particular situation descriptions and depictions egyptian writings describe gods bodies in detail they are made of precious materials their flesh is gold their bones are silver and their hair is lapis lazuli they give off a scent that egyptians likened to incense used in rituals some texts give precise descriptions of particular deities including their height and eye color yet these characteristics are not fixed in myths gods change their appearances to suit their own purposes egyptian texts often refer to deities true underlying forms as mysterious egyptians visual representations of their gods are therefore not literal they symbolize specific aspects of each deity s character functioning much like ideograms in hieroglyphic writing for this reason funerary god anubis is commonly shown in egyptian art as a dog or jackal a creature whose scavenging habits threaten preservation of buried mummies in an effort to counter this threat and employ it for protection his black coloring alludes to color of mummified flesh and to fertile black soil that egyptians saw as a symbol of resurrection most deities were depicted in several ways hathor could be a cow cobra lioness or a woman with bovine horns or ears by depicting a given god in different ways egyptians expressed different aspects of its essential nature gods are depicted in a finite number of these symbolic forms so they can often be distinguished from one another by their iconographies these forms include men and women anthropomorphism animals and more rarely inanimate objects combinations of forms such as deities with human bodies and animal heads are common new forms and increasingly complex combinations arose in course of history with most surreal forms often found among demons of underworld some gods can only be distinguished from others if they are labeled in writing as with isis and hathor because of close connection between these goddesses they could both wear cow horn headdress that was originally hathor s alone thumb alt bronze statue of a crocodile inlaid with gold left statue of crocodile god sobek in fully animal form certain features of divine images are more useful than others in determining a god s identity head of a given divine image is particularly significant in a hybrid image head represents original form of being depicted so that as egyptologist henry fischer put it a lion headed goddess is a lion goddess in human form while a royal sphinx conversely is a man who has assumed form of a lion quoted in divine headdresses which range from same types of crowns used by human kings to large hieroglyphs worn on gods heads are another important indicator in contrast objects held in gods hands tend to be generic male deities hold was staffs goddesses hold stalks of papyrus and both sexes carry ankh signs representing egyptian word for life to symbolize their life giving power forms in which gods are shown although diverse are limited in many ways many creatures that are widespread in egypt were never used in divine iconography others could represent many deities often because these deities had major characteristics in common bulls and rams were associated with virility cows and falcons with sky hippopotami with maternal protection felines with sun god and serpents with both danger and renewal animals that were absent from egypt in early stages of its history were not used as divine images for instance horse which was only introduced in second intermediate period c 1650 1550 bc never represented a god similarly clothes worn by anthropomorphic deities in most periods changed little from styles used in old kingdom a kilt false beard and often a shirt for male gods and a long tight fitting dress for goddesses basic anthropomorphic form varies child gods are depicted nude as are some adult gods when their procreative powers are emphasized certain male deities are given heavy bellies and breasts signifying either androgyny or prosperity and abundance whereas most male gods have red skin and most goddesses are yellow same colors used to depict egyptian men and women some are given unusual symbolic skin colors thus blue skin and paunchy figure of god alludes to nile flood he represents and nourishing fertility it brought a few deities such as osiris ptah and min have a appearance with their limbs tightly swathed in cloth although these gods resemble mummies earliest examples predate cloth wrapped style of mummification and this form may instead hark back to earliest limbless depictions of deities some inanimate objects that represent deities are drawn from nature such as trees or disk like emblems for sun and moon some objects associated with a specific god like crossed bows representing neith r24 or emblem of min r22 symbolized cults of those deities in predynastic times in many of these cases nature of original object is mysterious in predynastic and early dynastic periods gods were often represented by divine standards poles topped by emblems of deities including both animal forms and inanimate objects interactions with humans relationship with pharaoh alt relief of a man with a crown holding a tray of food in front of a seated man with head of a ram thumb right ramesses iii presents offerings to amun in official writings pharaohs are said to be divine and they are constantly depicted in company of deities of pantheon each pharaoh and his predecessors were considered successors of gods who had ruled egypt in mythic prehistory living kings were equated with horus and called son of many male deities particularly osiris and ra deceased kings were equated with these elder gods king s wives and mothers were likened to many goddesses few women who made themselves pharaohs such as hatshepsut connected themselves with these same goddesses while adopting much of masculine imagery of kingship pharaohs had their own mortuary temples where rituals were performed for them during their lives and after their deaths but few pharaohs were worshipped as gods long after their lifetimes and non official texts portray kings in a human light for these reasons scholars disagree about how genuinely most egyptians believed king to be a god he may only have been considered divine when he was performing ceremonies however much it was believed king s divine status was rationale for his role as egypt s representative to gods as he formed a link between divine and human realms egyptians believed gods needed temples to dwell in as well as periodic performance of rituals and presentation of offerings to nourish them these things were provided by cults that king oversaw with their priests and laborers yet according to royal ideology temple building was exclusively pharaoh s work as were rituals that priests usually performed in his stead these acts were a part of king s fundamental role maintaining maat king and nation he represented provided gods with maat so they could continue to perform their functions which maintained maat in cosmos so humans could continue to live presence in human world although egyptians believed their gods to be present in world around them contact between human and divine realms was mostly limited to specific circumstances in literature gods may appear to humans in a physical form but in real life egyptians were limited to more indirect means of communication ba of a god was said to periodically leave divine realm to dwell in images of that god by inhabiting these images gods left their concealed state and took on a physical form to egyptians a place or object that was dsr sacred was isolated and ritually pure and thus fit for a god to inhabit temple statues and reliefs as well as particular sacred animals like apis bull served as divine intermediaries in this way dreams and trances provided a very different venue for interaction in these states it was believed people could come close to gods and sometimes receive messages from them finally according to egyptian afterlife beliefs human souls pass into divine realm after death egyptians therefore believed that in death they would exist on same level as gods and fully understand their mysterious nature alt statues of four seated

with images of gods most important temple image was cult statue in inner sanctuary these statues were usually less than life size and made of same precious materials that were said to form gods bodies many temples had several sanctuaries each with a cult statue representing one of gods in a group such as a family triad city s primary god was envisioned as its lord employing many of residents as servants in divine household that temple represented gods residing in temples of egypt collectively represented entire pantheon but many deities including some important gods as well as those that were minor or hostile were never given temples of their own although some were represented in temples of other gods to insulate sacred power in sanctuary from impurities of outside world egyptians enclosed temple sanctuaries and greatly restricted access to them people other than kings and high priests were thus denied contact with cult statues only exception was during festival processions when statue was carried out of temple but still enclosed in a portable shrine people did have less direct means of interaction more public parts of temples often incorporated small places for prayer from doorways to freestanding chapels near back of temple building communities also built and managed small chapels for their own use and some families had shrines inside their homes intervention in human lives egyptian gods were involved in human lives as well as in overarching order of nature this divine influence applied mainly to egypt as foreign peoples were traditionally believed to be outside divine order in new kingdom when other nations were under egyptian control foreigners were said to be under sun god s benign rule in same way that egyptians were thoth as overseer of time was said to allot fixed lifespans to both humans and gods other gods were also said to govern length of human lives including meskhenet and renenutet both of whom presided over birth and shai personification of fate thus time and manner of death was main meaning of egyptian concept of fate although to some extent these deities governed other events in life as well several texts refer to gods influencing or inspiring human decisions working through a person s heart seat of emotion and intellect in egyptian belief deities were also believed to give commands instructing king in governance of his realm and regulating management of their temples egyptian texts rarely mention direct commands given to private persons and these commands never evolved into a set of divinely enforced moral codes morality in ancient egypt was based on concept of maat which when applied to human society meant that everyone should live in an orderly way that did not interfere with well being of other people because deities were upholders of maat morality was connected with them for example gods judged humans moral righteousness after death and by new kingdom a verdict of innocence in this judgment was believed to be necessary for admittance into afterlife in general however morality was based on practical ways to uphold maat in daily life rather than on strict rules that gods laid out alt gold pendant with a figure of a child standing on a crocodile grasping snakes and gazelles thumb right amulet of god shed humans had free will to ignore divine guidance and behavior required by maat but by doing so they could bring divine punishment upon themselves a deity carried out this punishment using its ba force that manifested god s power in human world natural disasters and human ailments were seen as work of angry divine bas conversely gods could cure righteous people of illness or even extend their lifespans both these types of intervention were eventually represented by deities shed who emerged in new kingdom to represent divine rescue from harm and an apotropaic god from late eras of egyptian history who was believed to avenge wrongdoing egyptian texts take different views on whether gods are responsible when humans suffer unjustly misfortune was often seen as a product of isfet cosmic disorder that was opposite of maat and therefore gods were not guilty of causing evil events some deities who were closely connected with isfet such as set could be blamed for disorder within world without placing guilt on other gods some writings do accuse deities of causing human misery while others give in gods defense beginning in middle kingdom several texts connected issue of evil in world with a myth in which creator god fights a human rebellion against his rule and then withdraws from earth because of this human misbehavior creator is distant from his creation allowing suffering to exist new kingdom writings do not question just nature of gods as strongly as those of middle kingdom they emphasize humans direct personal relationships with deities and gods power to intervene in human events people in this era put faith in specific gods who they hoped would help and protect them through their lives as a result upholding ideals of maat grew less important than gaining gods favor as a way to guarantee a good life even pharaohs were regarded as dependent on divine aid and after new kingdom came to an end government was increasingly influenced by oracles communicating gods will worship official religious practices which maintained maat for benefit of all egypt were related to but distinct from religious practices of ordinary people who sought gods help for their personal problems official religion involved a variety of rituals based in temples some rites were performed every day whereas others were festivals taking place at longer intervals and often limited to a particular temple or deity gods received their offerings in daily ceremonies in which their statues were clothed anointed and presented with food as hymns were recited in their honor these offerings in addition to maintaining maat for gods celebrated deities life giving generosity and encouraged them to remain benevolent rather than vengeful alt painted wood panel showing a woman with arms upraised toward a man with a falcon s head and a sun disk crown chains of flowers like shapes radiate from disk toward woman s face thumb left a woman worships ra horakhty who blesses her with rays of light festivals often involved a ceremonial procession in which a cult image was carried out of temple in a barque shaped shrine these processions served various purposes in roman times when local deities of all kinds were believed to have power over nile inundation processions in many communities carried temple images to riverbanks so gods could invoke a large and fruitful flood processions also traveled between temples as when image of hathor from dendera temple visited her consort horus at temple of edfu rituals for a god were often based in that deity s mythology such rituals were meant to be repetitions of events of mythic past renewing beneficial effects of original events in khoiak festival in honor of osiris his death and resurrection were ritually reenacted at a time when crops were beginning to sprout returning greenery symbolized renewal of god s own life personal interaction with gods took many forms people who wanted information or advice consulted oracles run by temples that were supposed to convey gods answers to questions amulets and other images of protective deities were used to ward off demons that might threaten human well being or to impart god s positive characteristics to wearer private rituals invoked gods power to accomplish personal goals from healing sickness to cursing enemies these practices used heka same force of magic that gods used which creator was said to have given to humans so they could fend off misfortune performer of a private rite often took on role of a god in a myth or even threatened a deity to involve gods in accomplishing goal such rituals coexisted with private offerings and prayers and all three were accepted means of obtaining divine help prayer and private offerings are generally called personal piety acts that reflect a close relationship between an individual and a god evidence of personal piety is scant before new kingdom votive offerings and personal names many of which are suggest that commoners felt some connection between themselves and their gods but firm evidence of devotion to deities became visible only in new kingdom reaching a peak late in that era scholars disagree about meaning of this change whether direct interaction with gods was a new development or an outgrowth of older traditions egyptians now expressed their devotion through a new variety of activities in and around temples they recorded their prayers and their thanks for divine help on stelae they gave offerings of figurines that represented gods they were praying to or that symbolized result they desired thus a relief image of hathor and a statuette of a woman could both represent a prayer for fertility occasionally a person took a particular god as a patron dedicating his or her property or labor to god s cult these practices continued into latest periods of egyptian history these later eras saw more religious innovations including practice of giving animal mummies as offerings to deities depicted in animal form such as cat mummies given to feline goddess bastet some of major deities from myth and official religion were rarely invoked in popular worship but many of great state gods were important in popular tradition worship of some egyptian gods spread to neighboring lands especially to canaan and nubia during new kingdom when those regions were under pharaonic control in canaan exported deities including hathor amun and set were often syncretized with native gods who in turn spread to egypt egyptian deities may not have had permanent temples in canaan and their importance there waned after egypt lost control of region in contrast many temples to major egyptian gods and deified pharaohs were built in nubia after end of egyptian rule there imported gods particularly amun and isis were syncretized with local deities and remained part of religion of nubia s independent kingdom of kush these gods were incorporated into nubian ideology of kingship much as they were in egypt so that amun was considered divine father of king and isis and other goddesses were linked with nubian queen kandake some deities reached farther taweret became a goddess in minoan crete and amun s oracle at siwa oasis was known to and consulted by people across

worship of native gods was not swallowed up by that of foreign ones instead greek and roman gods were adopted as manifestations of egyptian ones egyptian cults sometimes incorporated greek language philosophy iconography and even temple architecture meanwhile cults of several egyptian deities particularly isis osiris anubis form of horus named harpocrates and fused greco egyptian god serapis were adopted into roman religion and spread across roman empire roman emperors like ptolemaic kings before them invoked isis and serapis to endorse their authority inside and outside egypt in empire s complex mix of religious traditions thoth was transmuted into legendary esoteric teacher hermes trismegistus and isis who was venerated from britain to mesopotamia became focus of a greek style mystery cult isis and hermes trismegistus were both prominent in western esoteric tradition that grew from roman religious world temples and cults in egypt itself declined as roman economy deteriorated in third century ad and beginning in fourth century christians suppressed veneration of egyptian deities last formal cults at philae died out in fifth or sixth century most beliefs surrounding gods themselves disappeared within a few hundred years remaining in magical texts into seventh and eighth centuries in contrast many of practices involved in their worship such as processions and oracles were adapted to fit christian ideology and persisted as part of coptic church given great changes and diverse influences in egyptian culture since that time scholars disagree about whether any modern coptic practices are descended from those of pharaonic religion but many festivals and other traditions of modern egyptians both christian and muslim resemble worship of their
