modern chinese varieties make frequent use of what are called classifiers or measure words one of basic uses of classifiers is in phrases in which a noun is qualified by a numeral when a phrase such as one person or three books is translated into chinese it is normally necessary to insert an appropriate classifier between numeral and noun for example in standard mandarin all examples given in this article are from standard mandarin chinese with pronunciation indicated using pinyin system unless otherwise stated script would often be identical in other varieties of chinese although pronunciation would vary first of these phrases would be yi ren where yi means one but is generally pronounced yi due to sandhi ren means person and ge is required classifier there are also other grammatical contexts in which classifiers are used including after demonstratives zhe zhe zhe this and na na that however when a noun stands alone without any such qualifier no classifier is needed there are also various other uses of classifiers for example when placed after a noun rather than before it or when repeated a classifier signifies a plural or indefinite quantity terms classifier and measure word are frequently used interchangeably as equivalent to chinese term liangci which literally means measure word sometimes however two are distinguished with classifier denoting a particle without any particular meaning of its own as in example above and measure word denoting a word for a particular quantity or measurement of something such as drop or liter latter type also includes certain words denoting lengths of time units of currency etc these two types are alternatively called count classifier and mass classifier since first type can only meaningfully be used with count nouns while second is used particularly with mass nouns however grammatical behavior of words of two types is largely identical most nouns have one or more particular classifiers associated with them often depending on nature of things they denote for example many nouns denoting flat objects such as tables papers beds and benches use classifier zhang whereas many long and thin objects use tiao total number of classifiers in chinese may be put at anywhere from a few dozen to several hundred depending on how they are counted classifier pronounced or in mandarin apart from being standard classifier for many nouns also serves as a general classifier which may often but not always be used in place of other classifiers in informal and spoken language native speakers tend to use this classifier far more than any other even though they know which classifier is correct when asked mass classifiers might be used with all sorts of nouns with which they make sense for example he box may be used to denote boxes of objects such as lightbulbs or books even though those nouns would be used with their own appropriate count classifiers if being counted as individual objects researchers have differing views as to how classifier noun pairings arise some regard them as being based on innate semantic features of noun for example all nouns denoting long objects take a certain classifier because of their inherent while others see them as motivated more by analogy to prototypical pairings for example dictionary comes to take same classifier as more common word book there is some variation in pairings used with speakers of different dialects often using different classifiers for same item some linguists have proposed that use of classifier phrases may be guided less by grammar and more by stylistic or pragmatic concerns on part of a speaker who may be trying to foreground new or important information many other languages of mainland southeast asia linguistic area exhibit similar classifier systems leading to speculation about origins of chinese system ancient classifier like constructions which used a repeated noun rather than a special classifier are attested in old chinese as early as 1400 bce but true classifiers did not appear in these phrases until much later originally classifiers and numbers came after noun rather than before and probably moved before noun sometime after 500 bce use of classifiers did not become a mandatory part of old chinese grammar until around 1100 ce some nouns became associated with specific classifiers earlier than others earliest probably being nouns that signified culturally valued items such as horses and poems many words that are classifiers today started out as full nouns in some cases their meanings have been gradually bleached away so that they are now used only as classifiers usage in chinese a numeral cannot usually quantify a noun by itself instead language relies on classifiers commonly also referred to as measure words across different varieties of chinese classifier noun clauses have slightly different interpretations particularly in interpretation of in classified nouns as opposed to bare nouns but requirement that a classifier come between a number and a noun is more or less same in major varieties when a noun is preceded by a number a demonstrative such as this or that or certain quantifiers such as every a classifier must normally be inserted before noun thus while english speakers say one person or this person mandarin chinese speakers say yi ren one person or zhe ren this person respectively if a noun is preceded by both a demonstrative and a number demonstrative comes first this is just as in english e g these three cats if an adjective modifies noun it typically comes after classifier and before noun general structure of a classifier phrase is tables below give examples of common types of classifier phrases examples are adapted from those given in and while most english nouns do not require classifiers or measure words in english both five and five cups of coffee are grammatically correct nearly all chinese nouns do thus in first table phrases that have no classifier in english have one in chinese english equivalent three cat three cats this cat this cat three three of them three black cat three black cats this three black cat these three black cats three black three black ones when cats is already evident from context as in how many cats do you have i have three three when an adjective in chinese appears by itself with no noun after it is added to identify it as an adjective because many nouns can be used as verbs adjectives and or adverbs e g tong yi unite can be used as verb adjective and adverb hei black can be used as noun as color verb transferred meanings defame and hack into but cannot be used as to make something black adjective and adverb use of in this example is not related to presence of classifiers number english equivalent five cattle five head of cattle this cattle this head of cattle five five head five big cattle five head of big cattle this five big cattle these five head of big cattle five big five head of big ones when cattle is already evident from context as in how many cattle do you have i have five head when an adjective in chinese appears by itself with no noun after it is added use of in this example is not related to presence of classifiers on other hand when a noun is not counted or introduced with a demonstrative a classifier is not necessary for example there is a classifier in san liang che three car three cars but not in wo de che me possessive car my car furthermore numbers and demonstratives are often not required in chinese so speakers may choose not to use one and thus not to use a classifier for example to say zhangsan turned into a tree both zhangsan biancheng le yi shu zhangsan become past one tree and zhangsan biancheng le shu zhangsan become past tree are acceptable use of classifiers after demonstratives is in fact optional it is also possible for a classifier alone to qualify a noun numeral one being omitted as in mai ma mai ma buy horse i e buy a horse specialized uses right thumb phrase che car has classifier after noun it could refer for example to cars on road alt a traffic jam in addition to their uses with numbers and demonstratives classifiers have some other functions a classifier placed after a noun expresses a plural or indefinite quantity of it for example shu book means books e g on a shelf or in a library whereas standard pre nominal construction yi shu one book means one book many classifiers may be reduplicated to mean every for example ren person signifies every person although is more generally used to mean every person in this case finally a classifier used along with yi yi one and after a noun conveys a meaning close to all of or entire or a full of sentence yi yun sky one cloud meaning sky was full of clouds uses classifier pian slice which refers to sky not clouds see for example similar results in chinese corpus of center for chinese linguistics at peking university tian kong yi pian retrieved on 3 june 2009 types vast majority of classifiers are those that count or classify nouns nominal classifiers as in all examples given so far as opposed to verbal classifiers these are further subdivided into count classifiers and mass classifiers described below in everyday speech people often use term measure word or its literal chinese equivalent liangci to cover all chinese count classifiers and mass classifiers also see usage in and most introductory chinese textbooks but types of words grouped under this term are not all same specifically various types of classifiers exhibit numerous differences in meaning in kinds of words they attach to and in syntactic behavior chinese has a large number of nominal classifiers estimates of number in mandarin range from several dozen or about 50 to over 900 range is so large because some of these estimates include all types of classifiers while others include only count classifiers in addition to count mass distinction and nominal verbal distinction described below various linguists have proposed many additional divisions of classifiers by type contains a review of these and because idea of what constitutes a classifier has changed over time today regular dictionaries include 120 to 150 classifiers word syllabus of graded words and characters for chinese syllabus of graded words and characters for chinese proficiency is a standardized measure of vocabulary and character recognition used in people s republic of china for testing middle school students high school students and foreign learners most recent edition was published in 2003 by testing center of national chinese proficiency testing committee lists 81 and a 2009 list compiled by gao ming and barbara malt includes 126 number of classifiers that are in everyday informal use however may be lower linguist mary erbaugh has claimed that about two dozen core classifiers account for most classifier use as a whole though classifier system is so complex that specialized classifier dictionaries have been published including following count classifiers and mass classifiers within set of nominal classifiers linguists generally draw a distinction between count classifiers and mass classifiers true count classifiers have also been called individual classifiers qualifying classifiers and just classifiers are used for naming or counting a single count noun and have no direct translation in english for example yi shu one book can only be translated in english as one book or a book furthermore count classifiers cannot be used with mass nouns just as an english speaker cannot ordinarily say five muds a chinese speaker cannot say wu ni five mud for such mass nouns one must use mass classifiers mass classifiers have also been called measure words massifiers non individual classifiers and quantifying classifiers term mass classifier is used in this article to avoid ambiguous usage of term measure word which is often used in everyday speech to refer to both count classifiers and mass classifiers even though in technical usage it only means mass classifiers mass classifiers true measure words do not pick out inherent properties of an individual noun like count classifiers do rather they lump nouns into countable units thus mass classifiers can generally be used with multiple types of nouns for example while mass classifier he box can be used to count boxes of lightbulbs yi dengpao one of lightbulbs or of books yi jiaocai one of textbooks each of these nouns must use a different count classifier when being counted by itself yi dengpao one lightbulb vs yi jiaocai one textbook while count classifiers have no direct english translation mass classifiers often do phrases with count classifiers such as yi ren one person can only be translated as one person or a person whereas those with mass classifiers such as yi ren one person can be translated as a crowd of people all languages including english have mass classifiers but count classifiers are unique to certain classifier languages and are not a part of english grammar apart from a few exceptional cases such as head of livestock within range of mass classifiers authors have proposed subdivisions based on manner in which a mass classifier organizes noun into countable units one of these is measurement units also called standard measures which all languages must have in order to measure items this category includes units such as kilometers liters or pounds see list like other classifiers these can also stand without a noun thus for example bang pound may appear as both san rou three of meat or just san three never san units of currency behave similarly for example shi shi ten which is short for for example shi ren min bi shi renminbi ten of renminbi other proposed types of mass classifiers include collective also called aggregate or group measures mass classifiers such as yi ren a of people which group things less precisely and container mass classifiers which group things by containers they come in as in yi zhou a of porridge or yi tang a of sugar difference between count classifiers and mass classifiers can be described as one of quantifying versus categorizing in other words mass classifiers create a unit by which to measure something i e boxes groups chunks pieces etc whereas count classifiers simply name an existing item most words can appear with both count classifiers and mass classifiers for example pizza can be described as both yi bisa one pizza literally one of pizza using a count classifier and as yi bisa one of pizza using a mass classifier in addition to these semantic differences there are differences in grammatical behaviors of count classifiers and mass classifiers for example mass classifiers may be modified by a small set of adjectives as in yi da ren a big of people whereas count classifiers usually may not for example yi da ren is never said for a big person instead adjective must modify noun yi da ren another difference is that count classifiers may often be replaced by a general classifier ge with no apparent change in meaning whereas mass classifiers may not lisa cheng and propose that count classifiers and mass classifiers have different underlying syntactic structures with count classifiers forming classifier phrases classifier phrases are similar to noun phrases but with a classifier rather than a noun as head and mass classifiers being a sort of relative clause that only looks like a classifier phrase distinction between count classifiers and mass classifiers is often unclear however and other linguists have suggested that count classifiers and mass classifiers may not be fundamentally different they posit that count classifier and mass classifier are extremes of a continuum with most classifiers falling somewhere in between verbal classifiers there is a set of verbal classifiers used specifically for counting number of times an action occurs rather than counting a number of items this set includes ci bian hui and xia which all roughly translate to times for example wo qu guo san beijing i go past three beijing i have been to beijing three these words can also form compound classifiers with certain nouns as in ren ci person time which can be used to count for example visitors to a museum in a year where visits by same person on different occasions are counted separately another type of verbal classifier indicates tool or implement used to perform action an example is found in sentence ta ti le wo yi jiao he kicked me or more literally he kicked me one foot word jiao which usually serves as a simple noun meaning foot here functions as a verbal classifier reflecting tool namely foot used to perform kicking action relation to nouns different classifiers often correspond to different particular nouns for example books generally take classifier ben flat objects take zhang animals take zhi machines take tai large buildings and mountains take zuo etc within these categories are further subdivisions while most animals take zhi domestic animals take tou long and flexible animals take tiao and horses take pi likewise while long things that are flexible such as ropes often take tiao long things that are rigid such as sticks take gen unless they are also round like pens or cigarettes in which case in some dialects they take zhi classifiers also vary in how specific they are some such as duo for flowers and other similarly clustered items are generally only used with one type whereas others such as tiao for long and flexible things one dimensional things or abstract items like news reports this may be because official documents during han dynasty were written on long bamboo strips making them strips of business are much less restricted furthermore there is not a one to one relationship between nouns and classifiers same noun may be paired with different classifiers in different situations specific factors that govern which classifiers are paired with which nouns have been a subject of debate among linguists categories and prototypes while mass classifiers do not necessarily bear any semantic relationship to noun with which they are used e g box and book are not related in meaning but one can still say a box of books count classifiers do precise nature of that relationship however is not certain since there is so much variability in how objects may be organized and categorized by classifiers accounts of semantic relationship may be grouped loosely into categorical theories which propose that count classifiers are matched to objects solely on basis of inherent features of those objects such as length or size and prototypical theories which propose that people learn to match a count classifier to a specific prototypical object and to other objects that are like that prototype categorical classical view of classifiers was that each classifier represents a category with a set of conditions for example classifier tiao would represent a category defined as all objects that meet conditions of being long thin and one dimensional and nouns using that classifier must fit all conditions with which category is associated some common semantic categories into which count classifiers have been claimed to organize nouns include categories of shape long flat or round size large or small consistency soft or hard animacy human animal or object and function tools vehicles machines etc on other hand proponents of prototype theory propose that count classifiers may not have innate definitions but are associated with a noun that is prototypical of that category and nouns that have a family resemblance with prototype noun will want to use same classifier theory described in and is also referred to within those works as a prototype theory but differs somewhat from version of prototype theory described here rather than claiming that individual prototypes are source for classifier meanings these authors believe that classifiers still are based on categories with features but that categories have many features and prototypes are words that have all features of that category whereas other words in category only have some features in other words there are core and marginal members of a category a member of a category does not necessarily possess all properties of that category for instance classifier ke is used for category of trees which may have features such as has a trunk has leaves and has branches is deciduous maple trees would be prototypes of category since they have all these features whereas palm trees only have a trunk and leaves and thus are not prototypical for example horse in chinese uses classifier pi as in san ma three horses in modern chinese word has no meaning nevertheless nouns denoting animals that look like horses will often also use this same classifier and native speakers have been found to be more likely to use classifier closer an animal looks to a horse furthermore words that do not meet criteria of a semantic category may still use that category because of their association with a prototype for example classifier ke is used for small round items as in yi zidan one bullet when words like atomic bomb were later introduced into language they also used this classifier even though they are not small and round therefore their classifier must have been assigned because of words association with word for bullet which acted as a prototype this is an example of generalization from prototypes erbaugh has proposed that when children learn count classifiers they go through stages first learning a classifier noun pair only such as yu fish then using that classifier with multiple nouns that are similar to prototype such as other types of fish then finally using that set of nouns to generalize a semantic feature associated with classifier such as length and flexibility so that classifier can then be used with new words that person encounters some classifier noun pairings are arbitrary or at least appear to modern speakers to have no semantic motivation for instance classifier bu may be used for movies and novels but also for cars and telephones some of this arbitrariness may be due to what linguist james tai refers to as fossilization whereby a count classifier loses its meaning through historical changes but remains paired with some nouns for example classifier pi used for horses is meaningless today but in classical chinese may have referred to a team of two horses a pair of horse skeletons or pairing between man and horse apparent disagreement between definitions provided by different authors may reflect different uses of these words in different time periods it is well attested that many classifiers underwent frequent changes of meaning throughout history so pi may have had all these meanings at different points in history arbitrariness may also arise when a classifier is borrowed along with its noun from a dialect in which it has a clear meaning to one in which it does not in both these cases use of classifier is remembered more by association with certain prototypical nouns such as horse rather than by understanding of semantic categories and thus arbitrariness has been used as an argument in favor of prototype theory of classifiers gao and malt propose that both category and prototype theories are correct in their conception some classifiers constitute well defined categories others make prototype categories and still others are relatively arbitrary neutralization in addition to numerous specific count classifiers described above also called classifiers chinese has a general classifier pronounced ge in mandarin kathleen ahrens claimed in 1994 that classifier for animals pronounced zhi in mandarin and jia in taiwanese is in process of becoming a second general classifier in mandarin spoken in taiwan and already is used as general classifier in taiwanese itself this classifier is used for people some abstract concepts and other words that do not have special classifiers such as yi bao bao hamburger and may also be used as a replacement for a specific classifier such as zhang or tiao especially in informal speech in mandarin chinese it has been noted as early as 1940s that use of is increasing and that there is a general tendency towards replacing specific classifiers with it numerous studies have reported that both adults and children tend to use when they do not know appropriate count classifier and even when they do but are speaking quickly or informally replacement of a specific classifier with general is known as classifier neutralization in chinese literally classifier ge this occurs especially often among children and individuals with damage to language relevant areas of brain although normal speakers also neutralize frequently it has been reported that most speakers know appropriate classifiers for words they are using and believe when asked that those classifiers are obligatory but nevertheless use without even realizing it in actual speech as a result in everyday spoken mandarin general classifier is hundreds of times more frequent than specialized ones nevertheless has not completely replaced other count classifiers and there are still many situations in which it would be inappropriate to substitute it for required specific classifier there may be specific patterns behind which classifier noun pairs may be neutralized to use general classifier and which may not specifically words that are most prototypical for their categories such as paper for category of nouns taking flat square classifier zhang may be less likely to be said with a general classifier variation in usage it is not case that every noun is only associated with one classifier across dialects and speakers there is great variability in way classifiers are used for same words and speakers often do not agree which classifier is best for example for cars some people use bu others use tai and still others use liang cantonese uses even within a single dialect or a single speaker same noun may take different measure words depending on style in which person is speaking or on different nuances person wants to convey for instance measure words can reflect speaker s judgment of or opinion about object an example of this is word for person ren which uses measure word ge normally but uses measure kou when counting number of people in a household and wei when being particularly polite or honorific and ming in formal written contexts likewise a group of people may be referred to by massifiers as yi ren a of people or yi ren a of people first is neutral whereas second implies that people are unruly or otherwise being judged poorly some count classifiers may also be used with nouns that they are not normally related to for metaphorical effect as in yi a of worries troubles finally a single word may have multiple count classifiers that convey different meanings altogether in fact choice of a classifier can even influence meaning of a noun by way of illustration san ke means three class periods as in i have three classes today whereas san ke means three courses as in i signed up for three courses this semester even though noun in each sentence is same purpose in research on classifier systems and chinese classifiers in particular it has been asked why count classifiers as opposed to mass classifiers exist at all mass classifiers are present in all languages since they are only way to count mass nouns that are not naturally divided into units as for example three of mud in english three muds is ungrammatical on other hand count classifiers are not inherently mandatory and are absent from most languages although english does not have a productive system of count classifiers and is not considered a classifier language it does have a few constructions mostly archaic or specialized that resemble count classifiers such as x head of cattle furthermore count classifiers are used with an unexpectedly low frequency in many settings speakers avoid specific classifiers by just using a bare noun without a number or demonstrative or using general classifier ge linguists and such as joseph greenberg have suggested that specific count classifiers are semantically redundant repeating information present within noun count classifiers can be used stylistically though and can also be used to clarify or limit a speaker s intended meaning when using a vague or ambiguous noun for example noun ke class can refer to courses in a semester or specific class periods during a day depending on whether classifier men or jie is used one proposed explanation for existence of count classifiers is that they serve more of a cognitive purpose than a practical one in other words they provide a linguistic way for speakers to organize or categorize real objects an alternative account is that they serve more of a discursive and pragmatic function a communicative function when people interact rather than an abstract function within mind specifically it has been proposed that count classifiers might be used to mark new or unfamiliar objects within a discourse to introduce major characters or items in a story or conversation or to foreground important information and objects by making them bigger and more salient in this way count classifiers might not serve an abstract grammatical or cognitive function but may help in communication by making important information more noticeable and drawing attention to it history classifier phrases right thumb an oracle bone inscription from shang dynasty such inscriptions provide some of earliest examples of number phrases that may have eventually spawned chinese classifiers alt an off white ovular turtle shell with an inscription in ancient chinese historical linguists have found that phrases consisting of nouns and numbers went through several structural changes in old chinese and middle chinese before classifiers appeared in them earliest forms may have been number noun like english i e five horses and less common noun number horses five both of which are attested in oracle bone scripts of pre archaic chinese circa 1400 bce to 1000 bce first constructions resembling classifier constructions were noun number noun constructions which were also extant in pre archaic chinese but less common than number noun in these constructions sometimes first and second nouns were identical n1 number n1 as in horses five horses and other times second noun was different but semantically related n1 number n2 according to some historical linguists n2 in these constructions can be considered an early form of count classifier and has even been called an echo classifier this speculation is not universally agreed on though although true count classifiers had not appeared yet mass classifiers were common in this time with constructions such as wine six word you represented a wine container meaning six you of wine examples such as this suggest that mass classifiers predate count classifiers by several centuries although they did not appear in same word order as they do today it is from this type of structure that count classifiers may have arisen originally replacing second noun in structures where there was a noun rather than a mass classifier to yield noun number classifier that is to say constructions like horses five horses may have been replaced by ones like horses five possibly for stylistic reasons such as avoiding repetition another reason for appearance of count classifiers may have been to avoid confusion or ambiguity that could have arisen from counting items using only mass classifiers i e to clarify when one is referring to a single item and when one is referring to a measure of items historians agree that at some point in history order of words in this construction shifted putting noun at end rather than beginning like in present day construction number classifier noun according to historical linguist alain peyraube earliest occurrences of this construction albeit with mass classifiers rather than count classifiers appear in late portion of old chinese 500 bce to 200 bce at this time number mass classifier portion of noun number mass classifier construction was sometimes shifted in front of noun peyraube speculates that this may have occurred because it was gradually reanalyzed as a modifier like an adjective for head noun as opposed to a simple repetition as it originally was since chinese generally places modifiers before modified as does english shift may have been prompted by this reanalysis by early part of common era nouns appearing in classifier position were beginning to lose their meaning and become true classifiers estimates of when classifiers underwent most development vary wang li claims their period of major development was during han dynasty 206 bce 220 ce whereas liu estimates that it was southern and northern dynasties period 420 589 ce and peyraube chooses tang dynasty 618 907 ce regardless of when they developed wang lianqing claims that they did not become grammatically mandatory until sometime around 11th century classifier systems in many nearby languages and language groups such as vietnamese and tai languages are very similar to chinese classifier system in both grammatical structure and parameters along which some objects are grouped together thus there has been some debate over which language family first developed classifiers and which ones then borrowed them or whether classifier systems were native to all these languages and developed more through repeated language contact throughout history classifier words most modern count classifiers are derived from words that originally were free standing nouns in older varieties of chinese and have since been to become bound morphemes in other words count classifiers tend to come from words that once had specific meaning but lost it a process known as semantic bleaching many however still have related forms that work as nouns all by themselves such as classifier dai for long ribbon like objects modern word means ribbon in fact majority of classifiers can also be used as other parts of speech such as nouns mass classifiers on other hand are more transparent in meaning than count classifiers while latter have some historical meaning former are still full fledged nouns for example bei cup is both a classifier as in yi cha a of tea and word for a cup as in wine glass it was not always case that every noun required a count classifier in many historical varieties of chinese use of classifiers was not mandatory and classifiers are rare in writings that have survived some nouns acquired classifiers earlier than others some of first documented uses of classifiers were for inventorying items both in mercantile business and in storytelling thus first nouns to have count classifiers paired with them may have been nouns that represent culturally valued items such as horses scrolls and intellectuals special status of such items is still apparent today many of classifiers that can only be paired with one or two nouns such as pi for may also be used for bolts of cloth see list of common nominal measure words on chinesenotes com last modified 11 january 2009 retrieved on 3 september 2009 and shou for songs or poems are classifiers for these same valued items such classifiers make up as much as one third of commonly used classifiers today classifiers did not gain official recognition as a lexical category part of speech until 20th century earliest modern text to discuss classifiers and their use was ma s 1898 ma s basic principles for writing clearly from then until 1940s linguists such as ma wang li and li treated classifiers as just a type of noun that expresses a quantity lu was first to treat them as a separate category calling them unit words in his 1940s outline of chinese grammar and finally measure words liangci in grammar studies he made this separation based on fact that classifiers were semantically bleached and that they can be used directly with a number whereas true nouns need to have a measure word added before they can be used with a number after this time other names were also proposed for classifiers gao called them noun helper words lu counting markers and japanese linguist miyawaki kennosuke called them accompanying words in draft plan for a system of teaching chinese grammar adopted by people s republic of china in 1954 lu s measure words liangci was adopted as official name for classifiers in china this remains most common term in use today general classifiers historically ge was not always general classifier some believe it was originally a noun referring to bamboo stalks and gradually expanded in use to become a classifier for many things with vertical individual or upright ies eventually becoming a general classifier because it was used so frequently with common nouns classifier ge is actually associated with three different homophonous characters used today as traditional character equivalent of and historical linguist lianqing wang has argued that these characters actually originated from different words and that only had original meaning of bamboo stalk she claims was used as a general classifier early on and may have been derived from orthographically similar jie one of earliest general classifiers later merged with because they were similar in pronunciation and meaning both used as general classifiers likewise she claims that was also a separate word with a meaning having to do with partiality or being a single part and merged with for same reasons as did she also argues that was created as early as han dynasty to supersede nor was only general classifier in history of chinese aforementioned jie was being used as a general classifier before qin dynasty 221 bce it was originally a noun referring to individual items out of a string of connected shells or clothes and eventually came to be used as a classifier for individual objects as opposed to pairs or groups of objects before becoming a general classifier another general classifier was mei which originally referred to small twigs since twigs were used for counting items became a counter word any items including people could be counted as one two etc was most common classifier in use during southern and northern dynasties period 420 589 ce but today is no longer a general classifier and is only used rarely as a specialized classifier for items such as pins and badges kathleen ahrens has claimed that zhi in mandarin and jia in taiwanese classifier for animals in mandarin is another general classifier in taiwanese and may be becoming one in mandarin spoken in taiwan variety northern dialects tend to have fewer classifiers than southern ones ge ge is only classifier found in dungan language all nouns could have just one classifier in some dialects such as shanghainese wu mandarin dialect of shanxi and shandong dialects some dialects such as northern min certain xiang dialects hakka dialects and some yue dialects use zhi for noun referring to people rather than ge see also list of chinese
