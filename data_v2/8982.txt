louis david riel 22 october 1844 16 november 1885 was a canadian politician a founder of province of manitoba and a political leader of metis people of canadian prairies he led two rebellions against government of canada and its first post confederation prime minister john a macdonald riel sought to preserve metis rights and culture as their homelands in northwest came progressively under canadian sphere of influence over decades he has been made a folk hero by francophones catholic nationalists native rights activists and new left student movement arguably riel has received more scholarly attention than any other figure in canadian history j m bumstead mahdi of western canada lewis riel and his papers beaver 1987 67 4 pp 47 54 first resistance led by riel became known as red river rebellion of 1869 1870 provisional government established by riel ultimately negotiated terms under which modern province of manitoba entered canadian confederation riel ordered execution of thomas scott and fled to united states to escape prosecution despite this he is frequently referred to as father of manitoba while a fugitive he was elected three times to house of commons of canada although he never assumed his seat during these years he was frustrated by having to remain in exile despite his growing belief that he was a divinely chosen leader and prophet a belief which would later resurface and influence his actions because of this new religious conviction catholic leaders who had supported him before increasingly repudiated him he married in 1881 while in exile in montana in united states he fathered three children in 1884 riel was called upon by metis leaders in saskatchewan to articulate their grievances to canadian government instead he organized a military resistance that escalated into a military confrontation north west rebellion of 1885 ottawa used new rail lines to send in thousands of combat soldiers it ended in his arrest and conviction for high treason despite protests and popular appeals prime minister macdonald rejected calls for clemency and riel was executed by hanging riel was seen as a heroic victim by french canadians his execution had a lasting negative impact on canada polarizing new nation along ethno religious lines although only a few hundred people were directly affected by rebellion in saskatchewan long term result was that prairie provinces would be controlled by anglophones not francophones an even more important long term impact was bitter alienation francophones across canada felt and anger against repression by their countrymen j m bumsted peoples of canada a post confederation history 1992 pp xiii 31 riel s historical reputation has long been polarized between portrayals as a dangerous half insane religious fanatic and rebel against canadian nation or by contrast a heroic rebel who fought to protect his francophone people from unfair encroachments of an anglophone national government he is increasingly celebrated as a proponent of multiculturalism although that downplays his primary commitment to metis nationalism and political independence early life thumb upright louis riel age 14 red river settlement was a community in rupert s land nominally administered by hudson s bay company hbc and largely inhabited by first nations tribes and metis an ethnic group of mixed cree ojibwa saulteaux french canadian scottish and english descent louis riel was born there in 1844 near modern winnipeg manitoba to louis riel sr and julie lagimodiere riel was eldest of eleven children in a locally well respected family his father who was of franco ojibwa metis descent had gained prominence in this community by organizing a group that supported guillaume sayer a metis imprisoned for challenging hbc s historical trade monopoly sayer s eventual release due to agitations by louis sr s group effectively ended monopoly and name riel was therefore well known in red river area his mother was daughter of jean baptiste lagimodiere and marie anne gaboury one of earliest white families to settle in red river settlement in 1812 were noted for their devout catholicism and strong family ties stanley 1963 pp 13 20 riel was first educated by roman catholic priests at st boniface at age 13 he came to attention of alexandre tache suffragan bishop of st boniface who was eagerly promoting priesthood for talented young metis in 1858 tache arranged for riel to attend petit seminaire of college de montreal under direction of sulpician order descriptions of him at time indicate that he was a fine scholar of languages science and philosophy but exhibited a frequent and unpredictable moodiness stanley 1963 pp 26 28 following news of his father s premature death in 1864 riel lost interest in priesthood and withdrew from college in march 1865 for a time he continued his studies as a day student in convent of grey nuns but was soon asked to leave following breaches of discipline he remained in montreal for over a year living at home of his aunt lucie riel impoverished by death of his father riel took employment as a law clerk in montreal office of rodolphe during this time he was involved in a failed romance with a young woman named marie julie this progressed to point of riel having signed a contract of marriage but his fiancee s family opposed her involvement with a metis and engagement was soon broken compounding this disappointment riel found legal work unpleasant and by early 1866 he had resolved to leave canada east stanley 1963 p 33 some of his friends said later that he worked odd jobs in chicago illinois while staying with poet louis honore frechette and wrote poems himself in manner of lamartine and that he was briefly employed as a clerk in saint paul minnesota before returning to red river settlement on 26 july 1868 for this section see stanley louis riel pp 13 34 red river rebellion majority population of red river had historically been metis and first nation people upon his return riel found that religious nationalistic and racial tensions were exacerbated by an influx of anglophone protestant settlers from ontario political situation was also uncertain as ongoing negotiations for transfer of rupert s land from hudson s bay company to canada had not addressed political terms of transfer finally despite warnings to macdonald government from bishop tache and hbc governor william mactavish that any such activity would precipitate unrest canadian minister of public works william mcdougall ordered a survey of area arrival on 20 august 1869 of a survey party headed by colonel john stoughton dennis increased anxiety among metis metis did not possess title to their land which was in any case laid out according to seigneurial system rather than in english style square lots riel emerges as a leader in late august riel denounced survey in a speech and on 11 october 1869 survey s work was disrupted by a group of metis that included riel this group organized itself as metis national committee on 16 october with riel as secretary and john bruce as president when summoned by hbc controlled council of assiniboia to explain his actions riel declared that any attempt by canada to assume authority would be contested unless ottawa had first negotiated terms with metis nevertheless non bilingual mcdougall was appointed lieutenant governor designate and attempted to enter settlement on 2 november mcdougall s party was turned back near canada us border and on same day metis led by riel seized fort garry on 6 november riel invited anglophones to attend a convention alongside metis representatives to discuss a course of action and on 1 december he proposed to this convention a list of rights to be demanded as a condition of union much of settlement came to accept metis point of view but a passionately pro canadian minority began organizing in opposition loosely constituted as canadian party this group was led by john christian schultz charles mair colonel john stoughton dennis and a more reticent major charles boulton mcdougall attempted to assert his authority by authorizing dennis to raise a contingent of armed men but anglophone settlers largely ignored this call to arms schultz however attracted approximately fifty recruits and fortified his house and store riel ordered schultz s home surrounded and outnumbered canadians soon surrendered and were imprisoned in upper fort garry provisional government thumb 300px right metis provisional government hearing of unrest ottawa sent three emissaries to red river including hbc representative donald alexander smith while they were en route metis national committee declared a provisional government on 8 december with riel becoming its president on 27 december meetings between riel and ottawa delegation took place on 5 and 6 january 1870 but when these proved fruitless smith chose to present his case in a public forum smith assured large audiences of government s goodwill in meetings on 19 and 20 january leading riel to propose formation of a new convention split evenly between french and english settlers to consider smith s instructions on 7 february a new list of rights was presented to ottawa delegation and smith and riel agreed to send representatives to ottawa to engage in direct negotiations on that basis www press doi abs 10 3138

execution of scott despite apparent progress on political front canadian party continued to plot against provisional government however they suffered a setback on 17 february when forty eight men including boulton and thomas scott were arrested near fort garry thumb left 250px execution of thomas scott boulton was tried by a tribunal headed by ambroise lepine and sentenced to death for his interference with provisional government he was pardoned but scott interpreted this as weakness by metis whom he regarded with open contempt after scott repeatedly quarreled with his guards they insisted that he be tried for insubordination at his court martial he was found guilty and was sentenced to death riel was repeatedly entreated to commute sentence but riel responded i have done three good things since i have commenced i have spared boulton s life at your instance i pardoned and now i shall shoot scott scott was executed by firing squad on 4 march riel s motivations have been cause of much speculation but his own justification was that he felt it necessary to demonstrate to canadians that metis must be taken seriously protestant canada did take notice swore revenge and set up a

expedition delegates representing provisional government departed for ottawa in march although they initially met with legal difficulties arising from execution of scott they soon entered into direct talks with macdonald and george etienne cartier an agreement enshrining demands in list of rights was quickly reached and this formed basis for manitoba act of 12 may 1870 which formally admitted manitoba into canadian confederation however negotiators could not secure a general amnesty for provisional government as a means of exercising canadian authority in settlement and dissuading american expansionists a canadian military expedition under colonel garnet wolseley was dispatched to red river although government described it as an errand of peace riel learned that canadian militia elements in expedition meant to lynch him and he fled as expedition approached red river arrival of expedition on 20 august marked effective end of red river rebellion intervening years amnesty question it was not until 2 september 1870 that new lieutenant governor adams george archibald arrived and set about establishment of civil government without an amnesty and with canadian militia beating and intimidating his sympathisers riel fled to safety of st joseph s mission across canada us border in dakota territory however results of first provincial election in december 1870 were promising for riel as many of his supporters came to power nevertheless stress and financial troubles precipitated a serious illness perhaps a harbinger of his future mental afflictions that prevented his return to manitoba until may 1871 thumb 200px left louis riel circa 1875the settlement now faced a possible threat from cross border fenian raids coordinated by his former associate william

of armed horsemen were raised including one led by riel when archibald reviewed troops in st boniface he made significant gesture of publicly shaking riel s hand signaling that a rapprochement had been affected this was not to be when this news reached ontario mair and members of canada first movement whipped up anti riel and anti archibald sentiment with federal elections coming in 1872 macdonald could ill afford further rift in quebec ontario relations and so he did not offer an amnesty instead he quietly arranged for tache to offer riel a bribe of 1 000 to remain in voluntary exile this was supplemented by an additional ps600 from smith for care of riel s family richard j gwyn nation maker sir john a macdonald his life our times 1867 1891 2011 2 150 51 nevertheless by late june riel was back in manitoba and was soon persuaded to run as a member of parliament for electoral district of provencher however following early september defeat of george etienne cartier in his home riding in quebec riel stood aside so that cartier on record as being in favour of amnesty for riel might secure a seat in provencher cartier won by acclamation but riel s hopes for a swift resolution to amnesty question were dashed following cartier s death on 20 may 1873 in ensuing by election in october 1873 riel ran unopposed as an independent although he had again fled a warrant having been issued for his arrest in september lepine was not so lucky he was captured and faced trial riel made his way to montreal and fearing arrest or assassination vacillated as to whether he should attempt to take up his seat in house of commons edward blake premier of ontario had announced a bounty of 5 000 for his arrest famously riel was only member of parliament who was not present for great pacific scandal debate of 1873 that led to resignation of macdonald government in november liberal leader alexander mackenzie became interim prime minister and a general election was held in january 1874 although liberals under mackenzie formed new government riel easily retained his seat formally riel had to sign a register book at least once upon being elected and he did so under disguise in late january he was nevertheless stricken from rolls following a motion supported by schultz who had become member for electoral district of lisgar undeterred riel prevailed again in resulting by election and although again expelled his symbolic point had been made and public opinion in quebec was strongly tipped in his favour exile and mental illness during this period riel had been staying with priests of oblate order in plattsburgh new york who introduced him to father fabien martin dit barnabe in nearby village of keeseville it was here that he received news of lepine s fate following his trial for murder of scott which had begun on 13 october 1874 lepine was found guilty and sentenced to death this sparked outrage in sympathetic quebec press and calls for amnesty for both lepine and riel were renewed this presented a severe political difficulty for mackenzie who was hopelessly caught between demands of quebec and ontario however a solution was forthcoming when acting on his own initiative governor general lord dufferin commuted lepine s sentence in january 1875 this opened door for mackenzie to secure from parliament an amnesty for riel on condition that he remain in exile for five years during his time of exile he was primarily concerned with religious rather than political matters spurred on by a sympathetic roman catholic priest in quebec he was increasingly influenced by his belief that he was a divinely chosen leader of metis modern biographers have speculated that he may have suffered from psychological condition megalomania his mental state deteriorated and following a violent outburst he was taken to montreal where he was under care of his uncle john lee for a few months but after riel disrupted a religious service lee arranged to have him committed in an asylum in longue pointe on 6 march 1876 under assumed name louis r david fearing discovery his doctors soon transferred him to asylum near quebec city under name louis larochelle while he suffered from sporadic irrational outbursts he continued his religious writing composing theological tracts with an admixture of christian and judaic ideas he consequently began calling himself louis david riel prophet of new world and he would pray standing for hours having servants help him to hold his arms in shape of a cross nevertheless he slowly recovered and was released from asylum on 23 january 1878 with an admonition to lead a quiet life he returned for a time to keeseville where he became involved in a passionate romance with evelina martin barnabe sister of his friend oblate father fabien barnabe but with insufficient means to propose marriage riel returned to west hoping that she might follow however she decided that she would be unsuited to prairie life and their correspondence soon ended montana and family life thumb right 200px jean louis and marie angelique riel children of louis riel in fall of 1878 riel returned to st paul and briefly visited his friends and family this was a time of rapid change for metis of red river buffalo on which they depended were becoming increasingly scarce influx of settlers was ever increasing and much land was sold to unscrupulous land speculators like other red river metis who had left manitoba riel headed further west to start a new life travelling to montana territory he became a trader and interpreter in area surrounding fort benton observing rampant alcoholism and its detrimental impact on native american and metis people he engaged in an unsuccessful attempt to curtail whisky trade in 1881 he married

before riel was hanged riel soon became involved in politics of montana and in 1882 actively campaigned on behalf of republican party he brought a suit against a democrat for rigging a vote but was then himself accused of fraudulently inducing british subjects to take part in election in response riel applied for united states citizenship and was naturalized on 16 march 1883 with two young children he had by 1884 settled down and was teaching school at st peter s jesuit mission in sun river district of montana north west rebellion grievances in saskatchewan territory following red river rebellion metis travelled west and settled in saskatchewan valley especially along south branch of river in country surrounding saint laurent mission near modern st laurent de grandin saskatchewan but by 1880s it had become clear that westward migration was no panacea for troubles of metis and plains indians rapid collapse of buffalo herd was causing near starvation among plains cree and blackfoot first nations this was exacerbated by a reduction in government assistance in 1883 and by a general failure of ottawa to live up to its treaty obligations metis were likewise obliged to give up hunt and take up agriculture but this transition was accompanied by complex issues surrounding land claims similar to those that had previously arisen in manitoba moreover settlers from europe and eastern provinces were also moving into saskatchewan territories and they too had complaints related to administration of territories virtually all parties therefore had grievances and by 1884 english settlers anglo metis and metis communities were holding meetings and petitioning a largely unresponsive government for redress in electoral district of lorne a meeting of south branch metis was held in village of batoche on 24 march and thirty representatives voted to ask riel to return and represent their cause on 6 may a joint settler s union meeting was attended by both metis and english speaking representatives from prince albert including william henry jackson an ontario settler sympathetic to metis and known to them as honore jackson and james isbister of anglo metis it was here resolved to send a delegation to ask riel s assistance in presenting their grievances to canadian government return of riel head of delegation to riel was gabriel dumont a respected buffalo hunter and leader of saint laurent metis who had known riel in manitoba james isbister was lone anglo metis delegate riel was easily swayed to support their cause which was perhaps not surprising in view of riel s continuing conviction that he was divinely selected leader of metis and prophet of a new form of christianity riel also intended to use new position of influence to pursue his own land claims in manitoba party departed 4 june and arrived back at batoche on 5 july upon his arrival metis and english settlers alike formed an initially favourable impression of riel following a series of speeches in which he advocated moderation and a reasoned approach during june 1884 plains cree leaders big bear and poundmaker were independently formulating their complaints and subsequently held meetings with riel however native grievances were quite different from those of settlers and nothing was then resolved inspired by riel honore jackson and representatives of other communities set about drafting a petition and jackson on 28 july released a manifesto detailing grievances and settler s objectives a joint english metis central committee with jackson acting as secretary worked to reconcile proposals from different communities in interim riel s support began to waver as riel s religious pronouncements became increasingly heretical clergy distanced themselves and father alexis andre cautioned riel against mixing religion and politics also in response to bribes by territorial lieutenant governor and indian commissioner edgar dewdney local english language newspapers adopted an editorial stance critical of riel nevertheless work continued and on 16 december riel forwarded committee s petition to government along with suggestion that delegates be sent to ottawa to engage in direct negotiation receipt of petition was acknowledged by joseph adolphe chapleau macdonald s secretary of state although macdonald himself would later deny having ever seen it by then many original followers had left only 250 remained at batoche when it fell in may 1885 break with church historian donald creighton has argued that riel had become a changed man in 15 years since he had left red river his megalomania had grown greater than ever his ungovernable rages delusions of grandeur messianic claims and dictatorial impulses had all become more extreme but these violent excesses were not only symptoms of his curious mental and moral decline he had lost his shrewd appreciation of realities his sense of direction was confused in his purposes were equivocal he showed at intervals a cynical selfishness and ruthless cupidity although in public he professed that his sole aim was redress of metis grievances and private he was quite ready to promise that if government made him a satisfactory personal payment of a few thousand dollars he would induce his credulous followers to accept almost any settlement federal authorities desired and would quietly leave canada forever donald creighton canada s first century 1867 1967 1970 p 54 while riel awaited news from ottawa he considered returning to montana but had by february resolved to stay without a productive course of action riel began to engage in obsessive prayer and was experiencing a significant relapse of his mental agitations this led to a deterioration in his relationship with catholic hierarchy as he publicly espoused an increasingly heretical doctrine on 11 february 1885 a response to petition was received government proposed to take a census of north west territories and to form a commission to investigate grievances this angered a faction of metis who saw it as a mere delaying tactic they favoured taking up arms at once riel became leader of this faction but he lost support of almost all anglophones and anglo metis catholic church and great majority of indians he also lost support of metis faction supporting local leader charles nolin but riel undoubtedly influenced by his messianic delusions became increasingly supportive of this course of action in church at saint laurent on 15 march riel disrupted a sermon to argue for this position following which he was barred from receiving sacraments he took more and more about his divine revelations but disenchanted with status quo and swayed by riel s charisma and eloquent rhetoric hundreds of metis remained loyal to riel despite his proclamations that bishop ignace bourget should be accepted as pope and that rome has fallen at his trial riel denied allegations that his religious beliefs were as irrational as was being and continue to be alleged he explained as follows i wish to leave rome aside inasmuch as it is cause of division between catholics and protestants i did not wish to force my views if i could have any influence in new world it would be to help in that way even if it takes 200 years to become practical so my children s children can shake hands with protestants of new world in a friendly manner i do not wish those evils which exist in europe to be continued as much as i can influence it among metis i do not wish that to be repeated in america open rebellion on 18 march it became known that north west mounted police garrison at battleford was being reinforced although only 100 men had been sent in response to warnings from father alexis andre and nwmp superintendent l n f crozier a rumour soon began to circulate that 500 heavily armed troops were advancing on territory metis patience was exhausted and riel s followers seized arms took hostages and cut telegraph lines between batoche and battleford provisional government of saskatchewan was declared at batoche on 19 march with riel as political and spiritual leader and with dumont assuming responsibility for military affairs riel formed a council called a neologism meaning those who have left flock and sent representatives to court poundmaker and big bear on 21 march riel s emissaries demanded that crozier surrender fort carlton but this was refused situation was becoming critical and on 23 march dewdney sent a telegraph to macdonald indicating that military intervention might be necessary scouting near duck lake on 26 march a force led by gabriel dumont unexpectedly chanced upon a party from fort carlton in ensuing battle of duck lake police were routed and natives also rose up once news became known die was cast for a violent outcome and north west rebellion was begun in earnest thumb left louis riel imprisoned in middleton s camp at batoche 16 may 1885 riel had counted on canadian government being unable to effectively respond to another uprising in distant north west territories thereby forcing them to accept political negotiation this was essentially same strategy that had worked to such great effect during 1870 rebellion in that instance first troops did not arrive until three months after riel seized control however riel had completely overlooked significance of canadian pacific railway despite some uncompleted gaps first canadian regular and militia units under command of major general frederick dobson middleton arrived in duck lake less than two weeks after riel had made his demands knowing that he could not defeat canadians in direct confrontation dumont had hoped to force canadians to negotiate by engaging in a long drawn out campaign of guerrilla warfare dumont realised a modest success along these lines at battle of fish creek on 24 april 1885 riel however insisted on concentrating forces at batoche to defend his city of god outcome of ensuing battle of batoche which took place from 9 to 12 may was never in doubt and on 15 may a disheveled riel surrendered to canadian forces although big bear s forces managed to hold out until battle of loon lake on 3 june rebellion was a dismal failure for metis and natives alike as they surrendered or fled trial for treason several individuals closely tied to government requested that trial be held in winnipeg in july 1885 some historians contend that trial was moved to regina because of concerns with possibility of an ethnically mixed and sympathetic jury tom flanagan states that an amendment of north west territories act which dropped provision that trials with crimes punishable by death should be tried in manitoba meant that trial could be convened within north west territories and did not have to be held in winnipeg thumb 300px louis riel testifies at his trial prime minister sir john a macdonald ordered trial to be convened in regina where riel was tried before a jury of six english and scottish protestants all from area surrounding city trial began on 28 july 1885 and lasted five days riel delivered two long speeches during his trial defending his own actions and affirming rights of metis people he rejected his lawyer s attempt to argue that he was not guilty by reason of insanity asserting jury found him guilty but recommended mercy nonetheless judge hugh richardson sentenced him to death with date of his execution initially set for 18 september 1885 we tried riel for treason one juror later said and he was hanged for murder of scott george f g stanley louis riel patriot or rebel 1979 p 23 execution boulton writes in his memoirs that as date of his execution approached riel regretted his opposition to defence of insanity and vainly attempted to provide evidence that he was not sane requests for a retrial and an appeal to judicial committee of privy council in britain were denied sir john a macdonald who was instrumental in upholding riel s sentence is famously quoted as saying before his execution riel was reconciled with catholic church and assigned father andre as his spiritual advisor he was also given writing materials so that he could employ his time in prison to write a book louis riel was hanged for treason on 16 november 1885 at north west mounted police barracks in regina right thumb riel s tombstone at st boniface cathedral in winnipeg boulton writes of riel s final moments pere andre after explaining to riel that end was at hand asked him if he was at peace with men riel answered yes next question was do you forgive all your enemies yes riel then asked him if he might speak father andre advised him not to do so he then received kiss of peace from both priests and father andre exclaimed in french meaning so to heaven riel s last words were to say good bye to dr jukes and thank him for his kindness and just before white cap was pulled over his face he said meaning thank ms forget cap was pulled down and while he was praying trap was pulled death was not instantaneous louis riel s pulse ceased four minutes after trap door fell and during that time rope around his neck slowly strangled and choked him to death body was to have been interred inside gallows enclosure and grave was commenced but an order came from lieutenant governor to hand body over to sheriff chapleau which was accordingly done that night boulton 1886 chapter 19 following execution riel s body was returned to his mother s home in st vital where it lay in state on 12 december 1886 his remains were laid in churchyard of saint boniface cathedral following celebration of a requiem mass trial and execution of riel caused a bitter and prolonged reaction which convulsed canadian politics for decades execution was both supported and opposed by provinces for example conservative ontario strongly supported riel s execution but quebec was vehemently opposed to it francophones were upset riel was hanged because they thought his execution was a symbol of english dominance orange irish protestant element in ontario had demanded execution as punishment for riel s treason and his execution of thomas scott in 1870 with their revenge satisfied orange turned their attention to other matters especially jesuit estates proposal in quebec there was no forgetting and politician honore mercier rose to power by mobilizing opposition in 1886 legacy thumb collected writings of riel riel remains controversial j m bumsted in 2000 said that for manitoba historian james jackson murder of scott perhaps result of riel s incipient madness was great blemish on riel s achievement depriving him of his proper role as father of manitoba political saskatchewan metis requested land grants were all provided by government by end of 1887 and government resurveyed metis river lots in accordance with their wishes metis did not understand long term value of their new land however and it was soon bought by speculators who later turned huge profits from it riel s worst fears were realised following failed rebellion french language and roman catholic religion faced increasing marginalisation in both saskatchewan and manitoba as exemplified by controversy surrounding manitoba schools question metis themselves were increasingly forced to live on undesirable land or in shadow of indian reserves as they did not themselves have treaty status saskatchewan did not attain provincehood until 1905 riel s execution and macdonald s refusal to commute his sentence caused lasting discord in quebec and led to a fundamental alteration in canadian political order mason wade french canadians 1760 1967 1968 1 416 23 in quebec honore mercier exploited discontent to reconstitute parti national this party which promoted quebec nationalism won a majority in 1886 quebec election by winning a number of seats formerly controlled by quebec conservative party federal election of 1887 likewise saw significant gains by federal liberals again at expense of conservatives this led to victory of liberal party under sir wilfrid laurier in federal election of 1896 which in turn set stage for domination of canadian federal politics by liberal party in 20th century revoking riel s conviction that riel s name still has resonance in canadian politics was evidenced on 16 november 1994 when suzanne tremblay a bloc quebecois member of parliament introduced private members bill c 228 an act to revoke conviction of louis david riel unsuccessful bill was widely perceived in english canada as an attempt to arouse support for quebec nationalism before 1995

passionately that he is most written about person in all of canadian history doug ed canadian history a reader s guide vol 2 confederation to present 1994 p 18 interpretations have varied dramatically over time first amateur english language histories hailed triumph of civilization represented by english speaking protestants over savagery represented by half breed metis who were catholic and spoke french riel was portrayed as an insane traitor and an obstacle to expansion of canada to west d n sprague canada and metis 1869 1885 1988 p 1 by mid 20th century academic historians had dropped theme of savagery versus civilization deemphasized metis and focused on riel presenting his execution as a major cause of bitter division in canada along ethnocultural and geographical lines of religion and language w l morton says of execution it gave rise to a bitter and prolonged reaction which convulsed course of national politics for next decade in ontario it had been demanded and applauded by orange element as punishment of treason and a vindication of loyalty in quebec riel was defended despite his apostasy and megalomania as symbol indeed as a hero of his race morton argued that riel s demands were unrealistic they did touch on some real grievances such as need for increased representation of people in council of territories but they did not present a program of practical substance which government might have granted without betrayal of its responsibilities canadian government can hardly be blamed for refusing to continue its private negotiations with him or for sending in troops to suppress rebellion catholic bishops had originally supported metis but reversed themselves when they realized that riel was leading a heretical movement they made sure that he was not honored as a martyr roberto perin rome in canada vatican and canadian affairs in late victorian age 1990 p 259 however bishops lost their influence during quiet revolution and activists in quebec found in riel perfect hero with image now of a freedom fighter who stood up for his people against an oppressive government in face of widespread racist bigotry his insanity was ignored and he was

liberation du quebec adopted name louis riel for one of its terrorist cells john t saywell ed canadian annual review of politics and public affairs 1971 1973 p 94 across canada there emerged a new

review of riel and rebellion 1885 reconsidered by thomas flanagan great plains quarterly 1985 5 4 pp 259 60 online however a leading specialist thomas flanagan reversed his views after editing riel s writings as i sifted evidence this became less and less convincing to me until i concluded that opposite was closer to truth that metis grievances were at least partly of their own making that government was on verge of resolving them when rebellion broke out that riel s resort to arms could not be explained by failure of constitutional agitation and that he received a surprisingly fair trial thomas flanagan riel and rebellion 1885 reconsidered 2nd ed u of toronto press 2000 p x as for insanity historians have noted that many religious leaders past have exhibited behavior that looks exactly like insanity flanigan emphasizes that riel exemplified tradition of religious mystics involved in politics especially those with a sense that world was about to be totally transformed by their religious vision in his case it meant his delivering metis from colonial domination more broadly flanagan argues that riel was devoutly religious and rejected equalitarianism which he equated with secularism concluding he was a millenarian sympathetic to ancien regime and opposed to french revolution democracy individualism and secular society thomas flanagan louis riel icon of left
