bleed like me is fourth studio album by american rock band garbage it was released on april 11 2005 by geffen records for this album band chose a straight rock sound reminiscent of their live performances instead of electronica that permeated their previous album beautiful garbage 2001 first recording sessions took place in march 2003 but were mostly unproductive due to passive aggression between band members and a general lack of direction as they struggled to record album garbage quietly split for four months starting in october 2003 they reunited under producer john king in los angeles and following a guest appearance by dave grohl on bad boyfriend they found a renewed focus on production garbage recruited drummer matt walker and bassist justin meldal johnsen for new recording sessions and completed album by late 2004 following critical praise and high chart positions for its lead single why do you love me bleed like me had a strong opening week globally debuting in top five in eight countries including united kingdom australia and united states background garbage s third album beautiful garbage had been promoted by a fourteen month world tour which culminated in a run of north american shows co headlined with no doubt and supported by distillers in october and november 2002 before tour started band spent two weeks at smart studios their recording studio in madison wisconsin to write new material for their upcoming album upon completion of tour in december 2002 group took some time off shirley manson returned to her native scotland while butch vig completed production work on albums by afi and jessy moss band regrouped in february 2003 to perform pride in name of love at a musicares tribute to u2 frontman bono immediately after event they returned to madison to continue working on their follow up record recording and production initial recording and band breakdown on first day in studio garbage composed a new track right between eyes in 30 minutes other tracks written during early sessions were hangin with bitches and never be free with john 5 vig said that quick start made band feel optimistic and gave impression that album would be completed as rapidly as in six months but album took a slow spiral downhill recording for album was halted during summer when manson underwent surgery to remove a cyst on her right vocal cord forcing her to recuperate until august 2003 on september 10 a backhoe careened into outer walls of smart studios causing extensive damage both garbage and band paris texas had been working on their albums in studio sessions were permeated by passive aggressive tensions and an overall lack of artistic focus according to vig there were a lot of personal arguments and we couldn t agree on songs manson suffered writer s block and had trouble writing lyrics and vig did not like way songs sounded drummer said that group frequently argued during production and that entire band almost quit duke erikson said that nobody could agree about music s direction and band was on verge of breaking up he said when you lose that common bond of music you ve got nothing eventually group suffered a complete and utter band meltdown in october leading band members splitting and taking a break from sessions vig left studio and returned to los angeles over christmas period he encountered excited garbage fans eager to hear about album s progress not wanting to disappoint them he disclosed some song titles to them after this encounter he realized that band still had a future during break vig met dave grohl of foo fighters in a party and casually asked if he would perform drums on a garbage track bad boyfriend as vig had been frustrated with song s existing drum track thumb right alt dave grohl playing drums band credited participation of dave grohl who played drums in bad boyfriend as a motivator in getting album finished regrouping at beginning of 2004 band decided to try to salvage album taking their management s suggestion to work with an external producer for first time musicians also decided that neutral territory would be beneficial and went to los angeles john king one half of production duo dust brothers was enlisted to produce bad boyfriend drummer matt chamberlain and bassist justin meldal johnsen were hired to perform on songs recordings were completed in king s studio boat and sound city in los angeles towards end of recording sessions grohl spent a day performing on drums for bad boyfriend band said his performance was raising bar for record and vig said that grohl brought a different energy level to song which erikson and steve marker tried to follow with their guitar playing this influenced most of songs that followed musicians wanted songs to be scrappy and primal sounding experience with king despite only resulting in completion of one track bad boyfriend gave band perspective and direction manson said that because band members still had problems speaking to each other king could not get much work out of band so they realized that they needed to work out their differences and was catalyst for band getting back together and working harmoniously vig said that tensions led band members to become burned out on each other and that reuniting made them feel able to play fast and furious as if our lives depended on it manson overcame her writer s block and began to inject political slants into her lyrics matching them with some new material band wrote immediately after king sessions both metal heart and boys wanna fight referenced 2003 invasion of iraq despite a plan to record some material with producer tony hoffer band decided to complete rest of album themselves erikson later said it was kind of seductive to think that maybe someone else would solve all of our problems but in end you gotta do it yourself feeling that previous album beautiful garbage seemed fractured band decided to use their live sound vig said that he wanted pumping energy that all best raw rock records have band decided that their fourth album would have a straightforward rock sound instead of a reliance upon electronica and computer interventions musicians composed separately at their home studios sending each other tracks through e mail and couriers and band returned to wisconsin to finish album bleed like me emerged from a collage of samples and loops and this time sound was simpler erikson said that rather than production they depended on songs vig opted to focus on production duties and leave drums to guest musicians such as grohl whom he considered better at instrument than him he also played more guitars on album which he found liberating as a result drummer matt walker also played on several tracks on album while meldal johnsen played bass guitar most of manson s vocals were recorded at vig s home studio grungeisdead on october 18 band began mixing album some songs were mixed several times sex is not enemy was re recorded three times during mixing process right between eyes was recalled from mastering twice and band included live strings at last minute on happy home while project s working title was hands on a hard body after 1997 documentary of same name when manson announced album s release in november 2004 she confirmed that it would be titled bleed like me by december 6 2004 album was officially completed it was mastered in new york city initial mastering was completed on december 15 2004 and final master was ready for january 6 2005 composition bleed like me is a departure from heavily electronic music of previous albums version 2 0 and beautiful garbage in favor of a basic alternative rock sound vig said that while band tried to figure out a new sound for record they went back to getting great sounds from guitars band tried a more spontaneous approach manson did most of her singing in first take and drums were recorded in a way that everything was not perfectly balanced and not so electronic band members tried to translate energy of band s live performances onto album marker said that album showed that above all garbage is a loud rock band vig still thought that some of songs resembled band s earlier material such as metal heart with a lot of weird electronics that steve and duke did as well as some pretty gnarly guitar lyrics of bleed like me talk about relationships and political themes manson said last few years have been very worrying and you d have to be dead to not have some kind of political view at moment and that after many years being insecure about articulating her feelings writing lyrics she found herself confident that she could express her ideas and sentiment of being very out of kilter with a lot of common thoughts of today in her music boys wanna fight criticizes world affairs and sex is not enemy is about moral guardians inspired by outcry caused by janet jackson s wardrobe malfunction at 2004 super bowl songs about relationships follow manson s tendency to discuss dark topics and emotions bleed like me problems with empathy and bad boyfriend is about a predatory female meeting a predatory man album closer happy home is about conflict within band and in wider world during production search of forgiveness peace and coming to terms with one s place in a chaotic world promotion tour thumb right garbage performing during bleed like me world tour in copenhagen on june 1 2005 alt garbage performing in a stage garbage launched bleed like me world tour promoting record on march 29 2005 with a concert in paris tour visited north

a press statement saying that band members had overextended themselves tour concluded with a concert in perth australia on october 1 after six months of concerts in 2012 manson recalled making of this record was very sad for me being only girl in a gang of four can get pretty lonely we were all struggling to find our chemistry together and as a result experience of making and promoting this was tense and unenjoyable ironically our shows were selling out every night but after a while we decided that we needed to go home to lick our wounds singles album was preceded by lead single why do you love me which peaked at number seven on uk singles chart garbage s highest charting single since 1996 s stupid girl while reaching number eight on billboards modern rock tracks chart in united states

reviews from mainstream publications album received an average score of 56 based on 18 reviews entertainment weeklys tom sinclair complimented humongous hooks and kerrang described it as most exciting touching and most painfully human material they ve put out in years rolling stones david fricke commented that first two thirds of bleed like me is easily best sustained run of studio garbage since opening half of their 1995 debut but that final tracks had a sameness a feeling of roaring in circles sal cinquemani of slant magazine praised new sound and wrote that a few of songs run baby run and right between eyes in particular have all right ingredients but lack venom present on group s first two releases stephen thomas erlewine of allmusic wrote that album was enjoyable if outdated in its musical approach as if band doesn t quite know how to do anything else but sound like it s heyday of post grunge alt rock this opinion was shared by yahoo music s sharon o connell who wrote that despite intelligent songs with expertise in muscly alt rock lick or bubblegum pop hook bleed like me strikes a depressingly dated note writing for a v club nathan rabin said album s lyrics lacked an emotional punch he wrote stating that it approaches a kind of shimmering technical perfection but remains strangely stubbornly uninvolving betty clarke of guardian wrote while manson s changeling vocals are always worth listening to garbage s songs often aren t philip robertson of popmatters stated music sounds manufactured in its too polished manner and that much of what is brought to fore on this latest musical foray is an earnest attempt at building on marginal success of their previous power pop rock submissions commercial performance bleed like me debuted at number four on billboard
