and yet it moves is a platform video game developed by independent developer broken rules game was released for microsoft windows mac os x and linux on april 2 2009 and a wii port was released on wii shop channel in august 2010 and yet it moves was originally designed as a computer science project at vienna university of technology in 2007 when original prototype won or was nominated for awards at various independent game festivals team decided to create a full version of game and yet it moves focuses on moving player character through a series of hazardous environments player possesses ability to freely rotate entire game world transforming walls into floors and vice versa game s levels and puzzles are designed around this concept game features paper collage styled visuals designed by jan hackl and a beatboxing soundtrack performed by christoph binder both pc and wiiware versions of game received positive reviews with many critics applauding gameplay mechanics and visuals and yet it moves was also released as part of third humble indie bundle gameplay and yet it moves is a single player puzzle platform game set in a world stylized to resemble a paper collage where background elements and characters consist of ripped paper nameless player character who appears as a cutout pencil line drawing on white paper is moved through a series of levels by running and jumping across obstacles and avoiding hazards player possesses ability to spin entire game world in 90 or 180 degree increments at any time because rotation is instantaneous and gravity will always point downward relative to game screen spinning world has physical consequences on player character and on environment walls that are too steep to climb become flat walkable surfaces and objects may move or react to change in gravity all objects retain their momentum relative to their frame of reference thumb left game focuses on rotating world around player character in order to surmount walls too steep to climb or maneuver around complex obstacles levels in and yet it moves are designed such that spinning world at certain moments is required to progress because character will tear into pieces if he falls from too high a distance player must often spin world such that character can safely surmount or descend from large obstacles other hazards such as wild beasts fire and boulders or falling into black void that borders playing field will tear character however player has unlimited lives and will reappear at last checkpoint he passed prior to being torn main campaign mode offers 17 levels that span three different environments there are other gameplay features available such as online leaderboards various time attack modes and optional achievements that are awarded for performing specific objectives in wii version players control game using wii remote held sideways and game world is rotated by twisting controller in various directions nunchuk and classic controller are also compatible for alternate control schemes this version also removes restriction to only rotate in 90 degree intervals and offers three additional levels compared to pc versions development and yet it moves is first video game developed by broken rules an independent game developer based in vienna game began as a bachelor project held by department for design and assessment of technology at vienna university of technology four computer science students involved wanted to design a game that gave player more freedom than possible in normal 2d games a side scrolling platform game with ability to rotate entire game world was chosen a prototype of game took half a year to develop using torque game engine and name and yet it moves was chosen for its ambiguity and it hints at world rotation an allusion to galileo galilei s famous but apocryphal remark eppur si muove prototype was showcased at various independent game development festivals and garnered positive feedback it was a winner in student showcase category of 2007 independent games festival and a nominee for 2007 top talent award interest in title inspired students to develop a full game which took approximately two years broken rules was founded when it was realized that it was a necessity in order to better deal with all organizational financial and juridical hassles that are involved when making business broken rules did not have a dedicated artist so designers chose a graphical style they believed was both aesthetically pleasing and easy to create a pencil on paper look was first attempted but it appeared empty and boring until photographs collected from public sources such as were added style evolved into game s final ripped paper collage look intended to appear rough and analog designer christoph binder created game s background music and sound effects by beatboxing echoing this motif felix bohatsch project lead stated in an interview that adding a narrative or backstory was avoided in favor of prioritizing gameplay he added however that level design follows a leitmotif that conveys a journey from being confined to becoming free as game progresses first beginning in dark caves and ending in a wide blank space in october 2008 nintendo contacted broken rules and asked if a downloadable wiiware version of and yet it moves could be developed for its wii console after seeing a demonstration of game at 2008 indiecade festival in los angeles bohatsch stated that we didn t think long about this decision because we always wanted to bring and yet it moves to a console and i have a sweet spot for wii however pc game s projected release date was april 2 2009 it was too late in development to begin co developing for wii and launch simultaneously on both platforms pc version development was completed first and then wii development started in june because and yet it moves was originally designed to be played with digital controls wii remote s analog motion controls needed to be implemented such that they felt natural and not intrusive broken rules determined following a number of tests that allowing player to freely rotate to any degree best suited motion controls originally player could only rotate in 90 degree intervals four different control schemes were implemented to satisfy a wide number of players three of which either use motion control or wii remote pointer while file size limit imposed on wiiware games was not an issue visuals needed to be to cohere with wii hardware a standard definition television was used in development bohatsch felt visuals looked nicer on sdtv than on a pc or mac with higher display resolution but warned that some might not wii resolution properly recommending that a component cable be used while playing game online leaderboards were omitted from wii version because pc version s leaderboards were not frequently used three new levels unlocked when player completes main campaign mode were added near final version of game was submitted to nintendo s quality assurance team in may 2010 to inspect and find bugs and yet it moves was released on wii shop channel in north america on august 23 2010 and then in europe on august 27 broken rules currently has no plans to develop a sequel to and yet it moves due to time spent on game bohatsch commented that he is unopposed to idea and is amenable to proposals to develop such a game reception and yet it moves received generally favorable reviews pc version gained aggregate scores of 71 50 and 75 on gamerankings and metacritic respectively while wiiware version gained aggregate scores of 85 30 and 83 critics applauded game s unique take on platforming genre and game s paper collage visual style but felt game was too short some critics noted absence of any narrative or backstory but felt that game ultimately didn t need one though gamespot noted it as one of game s weaknesses in his review of pc version ign s daemon hatfield stated that and yet it moves manages to make this quarter century old genre 2d platformer feel new again hatfield praised gameplay which was challenging but avoids being frustrating but felt there wasn t enough content to warrant 15 price despite additional game modes available hatfield scored game 8 4 out of 10 scored pc version 8 0 out of 10 praising gameplay sound controls and use of physics review also stated that players are unlikely to experience motion sickness despite frequent rotating of game screen gamespot scored pc version 7 5 out of 10 stating that while rotation mechanic wears thin toward end of game increasingly exotic level design manages to keep good times rolling until end justin haywald of 1up com stated that even when i felt i had to guess which direction i was supposed to go levels are set up well enough that way forward is always easy to figure out haywald praised visuals as well but stated that as scenery grows more cluttered it also sometimes becomes difficult to find a safe place to land after sending world spinning haywald rated and yet it moves a b rated wiiware version 9 out of 10 stating that new additions and updated controls made it definitive version of game despite omission of online features seen in pc version sales felix bohatsch of broken rules reported in may 2009 that sales of pc version were not at a level we were expecting no digital rights management drm protection was placed on game because we believe that any game will be cracked no matter how we try to protect it so our philosophy is that adding drm or anything similar only annoys people who actually pay for it bootlegging rate was approximately 95 5 meaning for every game sold there are 22 cracked version being played bohatsch speculated that poor sales were partly caused by levels demonstrated in free game demo which did not focus enough on game s puzzles more than 370 000 units of game were sold as part of third humble indie bundle references external links broken rules
