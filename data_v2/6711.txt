included on setlist during rehearsals of madonna s 2004 re invention world tour but it was ultimately not included in show recording and composition love profusion was composed and produced by madonna and mirwais ahmadzai song is dedicated to madonna s then husband director guy ritchie recording sessions for american life started in late 2001 but was put on hold as madonna filmed swept away in malta and starred in west end play up for grabs she returned to olympic recording studios in late 2002 and finished sessions mixing for track was done by mark spike stent at westlake recording studios at west hollywood california and tim young did mastering of song at metropolis studios in london tom hannen and simon changer served as assistant engineers during recording ahmadzai played guitars and provided its backing vocals according to sheet music published at com love profusion is written in common time with a moderately fast tempo of 120 beats per minute according to a writer from arizona republic it is an electronica meets folk song and is composed in key of b minor with madonna s voice spanning from b3 to f5 ahmadzai used technique of making music freeze throughout american life including love profusion one technique was stutter edit which ahmadzai clarified was not characteristic of his production and recording people get upset because they think it is not natural to skip and stutter music but i do it because it is natural stuttering can help you create a new groove he said track starts with a strummy acoustic guitar introduction as described by michael paoletta from billboard on four chord progression of bm fm a e sequence folk rock inspired song has elements of electronica and folk at its core its rhythm is produced by a four piece bass drum which fades in and out abruptly and atmospheric synth strings which are added later in song madonna sings in first verse there are too many options there is no consolation i have lost my illusions what i want is an explanation according to rolling stone although not explicitly stated lines confirm madonna s belief that american culture will not give her an explanation so she had rejected american values and along with them her own values she repeats line i got you under my skin while a male voice acts as backing for track song ends with madonna singing words feel good a capella lyrics of song deals with questions solutions resurrections confusions and other broad topics of a neo philosophical nature edna gundersen of usa today compared its composition and madonna s performance with a love letter advocate called it a plaintive love letter to her husband critical reception love profusion received generally positive reviews from music critics michael paoletta from billboard described song as a sparse number and said that it was a good fit for radio ken tucker from entertainment weekly called it lovely ian youngs of bbc news commented that love profusion is one of highlights from album with layers of dance beats and acoustic guitar that made it a more complete song a writer for daily record described it as a stunningly beautiful ballad and considered it as one of many highlights from american life sal cinquemani from slant magazine called it dull and wrote that it was reinvented into a vibrant piece of guitar driven pop rock by ray carroll ben ratliff from rolling stone deduced that with lyrics like i got you under my skin madonna conveyed theme of gaining transcendence through detachment but finally american life comes across as defeatist more than anything else dan aquilante from new york post was dismissive of track saying that although there was nothing wrong with guitar driven composition of track it was not different from strings and orchestration of other tracks from american life like nothing fails or easy ride robert hilburn while reviewing american life for press of atlantic city listed track as one of songs that could save album from being a profound fail ross raihala writing for olympian listed track as a standout on american life in contrast to dreary directionless dance numbers and plodding ballads on album caroline bansal from musicomh gave a mixed review for song feeling that singer s vocals over spanish guitar was monotonous she felt that chorus was more melodic but it was lyrics and dance beats which did not complete track bansal said that love profusion could have been composed better ed howard from stylus magazine wrote that love profusion along with song intervention address madonna s marriage to director guy ritchie and find once cynical pop star surprisingly open and emotional which prompts her to spit out cliche after cliche as she tells us how happy she is alan braidwood from bbc music felt that song was most straight forward dance track on album he added that this is one of those songs which could become a favorite and it feels like a classic upbeat madonna song it fuses message behind song american life with mirwais beats and acoustic elements really well sean o brien from people complimented song for its great melody and acoustic guitar flavor to it and deduced that it would be a hit in night clubs dan gennoe from dotmusic website gave a positive review of track calling love profusion along with intervention and x static process from american life gracious and beautiful songs in
