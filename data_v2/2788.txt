population and convert them to roman catholicism in apalachee region roughly present day western florida and southwestern georgia there were 14 mission communities with a total population in 1680 of about 8 000 many but not all of these communities were populated by apalachee others were from different tribes that had migrated southward to area boyd et al p 10 spanish had a policy of not arming
