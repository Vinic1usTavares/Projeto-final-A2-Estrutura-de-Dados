specific genres and demographics such as band hero for pop music and lego rock band for younger players were released sales of music games were down in first half of year this decline was attributed to fewer purchases of instrument controllers it was assumed that players had already bought such controllers and were reusing them while analysts had expected that united states sales of guitar hero 5 and beatles rock band would be high close to or exceeding one million units each in first month of their release sales only reached roughly half of those projections failure to meet sales projections was partly attributed to impact of late 2000s recession on video game industry harmonix s ceo alex considered that at time both guitar hero and rock band were most expensive video games on market
