additional turks and daylamites summoned from jibal in early november 936 caliph al radi reigned 934 940 bestowed newly created title of amir al umara commander of commanders on ibn ra iq who was effectively granted absolute control over caliphate this provoked reaction of various provincial governors as well as that of powerful interest groups in baghdad itself such as caliphal bodyguards

leave basra to baridis but bajkam saved situation by scoring two major victories despite being outnumbered that allowed him to take possession of khuzistan hard pressed al baridi now turned to his powerful neighbour buyid ruler of fars ali ibn buya for help ali s brother ahmad soon took over khuzistan and ibn ra iq was forced to offer possession of province as an independent domain if bajkam would recover it bajkam however was repulsed by buyid forces and fell back to wasit ignoring ibn ra iq s orders to retake khuzistan bajkam remained at wasit and began plotting to depose ibn ra iq himself to this end bajkam began seeking allies he offered governorship of wasit to baridis and through former vizier ibn muqla who wished to avenge himself on ibn ra iq for his own downfall and

advance by destroying great dams of nahrawan canal and flooding plain but bajkam s army entered abbasid capital without opposition and al radi immediately transferred ibn ra iq s title of amir al umara to bajkam amir al umara thumb right 250px map of iraq in 9th 10th centuries despite continued relegation of al radi to a ceremonial role relationship between caliph and bajkam was strong with al radi praising bajkam for his harsh discipline and referring to latter as his protege al radi was appreciative of bajkam s respect for his position as caliph and promised his support for amir al umara in october november 938 bajkam and caliph campaigned against influential hamdanid emir of mosul hasan ibn abdallah who had taken advantage of turmoil in iraq to cease forwarding his province s revenue to baghdad although bajkam s army captured mosul hasan fled before him to remotest corners of his domain where bajkam s forces pursued him in vain in meantime local population resented presence of caliphal troops and launched guerilla warfare against them while ibn ra iq used bajkam s absence to take control of baghdad at head of a force these developments forced bajkam to negotiate with his rivals hamdanids were restored in their province in exchange for payment of tax arrears and ibn ra iq was bought off with governorship of provinces of tariq al furat diyar mudar qinnasrin and al awasim which were also claimed by ikhshidids of egypt this arrangement allowed bajkam and caliph to return to baghdad in february 939 muir 1924 pp 569 570 bajkam having consolidated his control over baghdad now turned to face threat posed by buyids to this end he strengthened his ties with baridis of basra by handing over wasit as previously agreed appointing abu abdallah al baridi as vizier of abbasid court although latter remained at wasit and did not visit baghdad and finally by marrying himself to one of al baridi s daughters bajkam s success against buyids was mixed wasit was saved from buyid attack and baridis led a successful campaign in but an expedition into jibal was crushed by third buyid brother hasan alliance with baridis quickly soured however as al baridi still maintained his ambition of replacing bajkam and was aware of this in late august 940 bajkam removed al baridi from vizierate and launched an attack on wasit which baridis abandoned without resistance in meantime baghdad was in turmoil as religious violence had become commonplace with fanatical members of hanbali school imposing their tenets on general populace muir 1924 pp 570 571 in december 940 al radi died

singing he remembered from his earlier visits to caliph among al muttaqi s first actions as caliph was confirmation of bajkam as amir al umara despite al muttaqi s gesture of support bajkam still faced opposition among semi autonomous provincial governors including al baridi death and ensuing anarchy bajkam opened a campaign against al baridi in early spring 941 his lieutenants were at first defeated by baridis whereupon bajkam himself left wasit to take field on his way to join his army however he was informed that his generals had achieved a major victory over baridis and decided to return to wasit on 21 april 941 while travelling he took part in a hunting excursion during which he and his party inadvertently encountered a band of kurdish brigands during a brief skirmish bajkam was slain when one of kurds stabbed him in back with his lance bajkam s unexpected death created a power vacuum in baghdad with disagreements between daylamite and turkish forces prompting former to join defeated al baridi with their assistance he marched on wasit and baghdad capturing them but was soon forced to flee due to disorder that followed his usurpation of power a daylamite chief named replaced him as de facto ruler of baghdad but he imposed tyrannical rule and al muttaqi appealed to former amir al umara ibn ra iq for assistance ibn ra iq soon retook control of baghdad but political turmoil did not cease with his re installation as amir al umara once again al baridi captured city and ibn ra iq fled with caliph to mosul from where hamdanid rulers launched a successful attempt to restore them hamdanid emir hasan after ordering assassination of ibn ra iq was made amir al umara and given laqab of nasir al dawla defender of dynasty in 943 hamdanids were forced to retreat to mosul
