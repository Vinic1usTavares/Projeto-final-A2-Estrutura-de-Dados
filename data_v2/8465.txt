calvatia sculpta commonly known as sculpted puffball sculptured puffball pyramid puffball and sierran puffball is a species of puffball fungus in family agaricaceae attaining dimensions of up to tall by wide pear or egg shaped puffball is readily recognizable because of large pyramidal or polygonal warts covering its surface it is edible when young before spores inside fruit body disintegrate into a brownish powder spores are roughly spherical and have wart like projections on their surfaces originally described from sierra nevada c sculpta is found in mountainous areas in western north america and was found in a brazilian dune in 2008 it may be easily confused with calbovista subsculpta a similar puffball that in addition to differences observable only with a microscope is larger and has slightly raised warts with a felt like texture other similar species include calvatia arctica and immature specimens of amanita magniverrucata taxonomy and naming species was first described in 1885 by american mycologist harvey willson harkness under name lycoperdon sculptum harkness who called it a curious and strikingly beautiful species found fruit bodies growing at elevations between in sierra nevada mountains although he noted that in appearance it differs so much from any species known to us as to be almost deemed worthy of generic rank he thought that placement in puffball genus lycoperdon was most appropriate classification despite its unusual cortex harkness s type collections were destroyed in fires following 1906 san francisco earthquake in 1904 curtis gates lloyd considered species better placed in calvatia because of resemblance of its deeply colored capillitial threads coarse thick walled cells found in gleba to those of calvatia he called species calvatia sculptum mushroom is known by several common names including sculpted puffball sculptured puffball pyramid puffball and sierran puffball in 1992 german mycologist hanns kreisel in his survey of genus calvatia defined section sculpta to contain c sculpta and c subcretacea two years later he merged section into sculpta when it was shown that c subcretacea was synonymous with arctic alpine species c arctica description thumb left gleba of young fruit bodies are firm and yellowish white white pear or egg shaped fruit body of c sculpta may be tall by wide outer layer of tissue known as exoperidium is covered on outer surface with distinctive long pointed pyramid shaped warts either erect or bent over and sometimes connected at tip with other warts warts bear parallel horizontal lines towards base mycologist david arora opined that c sculpta resembled a cross between a geodesic dome and a giant glob of meringue in age peridium sloughs off and exposes a brownish spore mass interior of puffball gleba is firm and yellowish white when young but gradually becomes powdery and deep olive brown as it matures spores are roughly spherical thick walled 3 6 um in diameter although some specimens collected in us range from 7 2 to 9 5 um and are covered with minute spines or warts use of scanning electron microscopy has revealed that these ornamentations on spores are typically 0 95 um long spore ultrastructure is distinctive among calvatia species and has been used to help verify taxonomic groupings and confirm status of species within genus capillitia coarse thick walled hyphae in gleba are septate with branches that are narrowed towards tips they are 3 8 um in diameter when grown in pure culture in laboratory c sculpta is under certain conditions able to grow structures called mycelial strands these are linear aggregates of hyphae whereby older leading hyphae become enclosed by coiled layers of newer hyphae mycelial strands provide a conduit for transporting water and nutrients across non nutrient material allowing fungus to reach new sources of food they are also implicated in formation of fruit bodies and sclerotia mycelia of c sculpta can be induced to form mycelial strands when there is a permeable physical barrier between it and agar substrate wide hyphae in center of mycelial strands contain protein dense structures on their cell walls that are shaped like a torus their function is unknown edibility calvatia sculpta is edible and said to be choice by some authors taste is described as mild and flesh has no distinguishable odor arora recommends eating puffball only when it is firm and white inside as older specimens may have a distasteful iodine like flavor puffball may be preserved by freezing fresh or partially cooked slices but their flavor and texture will deteriorate unless cooked immediately after thawing recommended cooking techniques for puffball slices include and coating in batter before frying c sculpta was used as a traditional food of plains and sierra miwok indians of north america who called fungus or puffballs were prepared by drying them in sun grinding them with a mortar and boiling them before eating with acorn soup similar species giant western puffball calvatia is much larger than c sculpta up to in diameter and tall and has a smoother surface mature specimens of calvatia arctica synonymous with calvatia subcretacea subcretacea and subcretacea can resemble immature specimens of c sculpta it is distinguished from c sculpta by its tough thicker peridial wall and its scales are tipped with gray brown calbovista subsculpta is similar in appearance but has more flattened and less prominent pyramidal warts microscopically its capillitia are thin walled and frequently and irregularly branched in contrast to thick walled infrequently branched capillitia of c sculpta possibly toxic amanita magniverrucata in its embryonic stage has a superficial resemblance as it also has pyramidal cap warts however it grows at different elevations and different seasons than c sculpta further slicing fruit body of a magniverrucata in half will reveal internal structures of cap gills and stem not present in puffballs habitat and distribution sculptured puffball grows solitarily or in small groups in forest duff it is typically associated with coniferous forests at high elevations greater than about on western mountains like sierra nevada and cascade range united states distribution includes states of california oregon washington and idaho an uncommon species it fruits throughout spring summer and fall during wet weather most commonly known from western north america species was reported growing on sandy soil in natal dunes state park in northeastern brazilian state of rio grande do norte in 2008 fruit bodies were associated with roots of native tree species eugenia brasiliensis several hypotheses have been proposed to account for this disjunct distribution species may have been present before americas separated it may have been introduced to brazil by human activity and subsequently adapted to environment there or north and south american populations may represent a cryptic species complex appearing morphologically similar but genetically distinct brazilian population has not been compared genetically with north american specimens notes references category agaricaceae category
