capital of isfahan alone around same time as a result of loan given several years earlier scerimans were given numerous privileges by senate of republic of venice a climactic point was reached in mid 18th century as members of family were raised to class of nobility in numerous italian city states even though their efforts to join venetian patriciate which they had started in early 18th century did not succeed they were well integrated in ruling class of venetian republic via marriage alliances with several noble venetian families their prestige as foreigners in venetian state was also increased by being well integrated into hierarchy of catholic church for example basilio son of gaspar sceriman was according to d maxwell white given position of a monsignor and later even became

their ancestral new julfa as other sceriman branches continued to live there headquarters however were moved to venice and livorno where several sceriman members had settled even though scerimans are mostly known for their tight relations with safavids and later italian city states and austro hungary they were also represented especially through junior members when needed in russia india netherlands burma spain and malacca aslanian cites two reasons why maintaining julfa branch following relocation was of extreme importance to family first reason was that traditionally most lucrative capital generating markets for family were in southeastern asia and india hence a well located regional office in new julfa was pivotal in connecting mediterranean ventures of family with those of gem market around indian ocean second reason was that even though scerimans were eager to integrate and assimilate in italy they still were armenians by origin at least as far as their trading habits were concerned scerimans were a calculating and strategizing group of individuals who not only thought about their future enterprises but were equally concerned about their situation in foreign lands even though they travelled far and wide they remained bound to their original home in new julfa through language personal relationships or otherwise see also list of iranian armenians armenians in italy
