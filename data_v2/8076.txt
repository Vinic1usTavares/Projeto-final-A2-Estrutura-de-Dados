incident at a theater peter and olivia anna torv now married along with astrid jasika nicole and ella emily meade olivia s niece and now a rookie fringe agent find an unactivated container that they believe end of dayers used to trigger breach fringe is unable to determine how container works and peter convinces broyles lance reddick now a senator to allow him to release his father walter noble currently in maximum security prison as punishment for activating doomsday device to help identify its workings after tearfully reuniting with his son and new daughter in law walter discovers device uses a unique radioactive signature that they can track strongest source points to a used campground where peter discovers a key he recognizes key as from walter s old home near reiden lake and travels there alone and finds his biological father walternate present walternate admits to being behind end of dayers group as his revenge for peter activating doomsday device and destroying parallel world that was his home walternate promises that peter will face same pain and suffering he has faced since crossing to prime universe on a mission of mercy one piece at a time peter realizes that walternate is implying a threat to olivia and finds that walternate was speaking to him remotely through a holographic simulation in central park where moreau has set off another breach to expose an existing wormhole olivia is helping to cordon off breach when walternate approaches and shoots her peter and rest of fringe division struggle with her death at her funeral walter continues to study central park wormhole and discovers that it links to past approximately 250 million years ago he comes to realize a temporal paradox a bootstrap paradox he will have sent doomsday device piece by piece into past effectively becoming first people mythos and convinces peter that they can influence peter in past by having him experience end of days himself and make a different decision when he enters machine peter suddenly wakes up to find himself in machine in 2011 only one minute since he entered it and olivia waiting by his side concurrently in parallel universe walternate attempts to convince fauxlivia to help stop machine peter recalls memories from future and uses machine to merge machine rooms from both universes into one thus creating a bridge while olivia and walter and their doppelgangers stare each other down peter convinces two sides to work together to try to repair damage to save both universes then suddenly disappears olivias and walters cautiously agree that they need to put aside their differences to save both worlds apparently unaware of peter s disappearance outside on liberty island in prime universe observers watch as september michael cerveris notes to december eugene lipinski that peter has already been forgotten by his friends his purpose having been served and explains that peter now never existed production casting upright right thumb actress emily meade center appeared in finale as a grown up version of ella dunham now a rookie fbi agent despite show not yet being officially renewed for a fourth season fringe began casting in mid march for a green fbi agent to come aboard for finale and possibly recur next year as reported by e online tvline s michael ausiello announced later in month that actress emily meade has been cast for role describing her character as a wide eyed and eager rookie who s ready to face all of challenges in front of her and that she would make her first appearance in finale in months leading up to finale wyman responded to reports character would be recurring by calling her casting more of a safety net much like seth gabel s casting he did not want to commit himself to her character yet saying we always protect ourselves by saying that because you never know actress was later revealed to be playing a grown up version of olivia s niece ella another casting call for finale was released as show began looking for a well known male japanese actor in his late 40s to late 50s who speaks english to appear as a new character called moreau despite casting call s description they later cast american actor brad dourif for part on whether dourif would be returning executive producer j h wyman commented in a may 2011 interview brad is such a fantastic actor we are keeping our options open writing co showrunners jeff pinkner and j h wyman co wrote episode s teleplay while pinkner wyman and consulting producer akiva goldsman co wrote story executive producer joe chappelle served as director a full season renewal of fringe was announced on march 24 2011 they had written finale without knowing if there would be another season but decided not to make any changes to script even after hearing of its renewal pinkner explained that we wrote episode perhaps foolishly assuming that we would be on for season 4 we never for one second entertained that it would be end of series so therefore we didn t have to change a word in an interview with new york post pinkner warned that events in finale will unfurl in a very unexpected way for characters and audience he also commented that finale hopefully will make you sort of revisit and look at everything that s happened all year through a fresh pair of glasses pinkner stated in another interview that it will be as much as anything about setting up next season and wyman agreed writing it s like when you read a great novel and you finish a chapter you re like oh my gosh something happened that s going to propel me forward that s something we desire to emulate in march 2011 pinkner confirmed with tvline that unlike previous fringe season finales third season s finale would not be two hours long he did however note that last three episodes will be linked in one continuous story arc cast was receptive to finale storyline in an interview with entertainment weekly actor john noble noted he liked how story ultimately ended with having two walters perhaps negotiate a truce and put their minds together through a very inventive intervention by peter who basically took control of destiny and forced his two fathers to look each other in eye as if telling them sort it out gentlemen he later noted we finish finale in a very dramatic place joshua jackson praised role reversal of his character with walter s you had peter wracked with guilt over circumstances tied to decision he made to activate first people s so called doomsday machine and clinging to hope that there might be some way out i can t have made a cosmically bad decision there must be some way to put this right which is fascinating because that s basically been walter for as long as we ve known him so i loved how peter ceases to be so stubborn when it comes to walter comes to understand him and even begins to see things way he does finale contained a new grey credit sequence that was meant to reflect new timeline it contained new scientific words such as thought extraction and dual maternity as well as water and hope wyman explained their reasoning for change credits weren t so much pertinent to finale but for introduction of future of show in past we used words in credit sequence as signposts for episode but this is a new paradigm after finale aired pinkner stated in an interview that one of things we love to play with is notion of choice versus fate synchronicity clearly what peter did at end of that episode is that he fundamentally changed future our team is now on a separate path it is unlikely that we ll get to that specific outcome in 2026 but are events like what happened in detroit inevitable in any version of future tbd marketing leading up to episode s broadcast fox released a promotional trailer that recapped relevant scenes and previewed events in finale fox had previously produced similar trailers for entrada marionette and bloodline three episodes from earlier in season as with other fringe episodes fox released a science lesson plan in collaboration with science olympiad for grade school children focusing on science seen in day we died with intention of having students learn about reverse engineering and disassembling devices reception ratings finale first aired on fox network in united states on may 6 2011 it was watched by an estimated 3 0 million viewers it scored a 1 2 4 ratings share among viewers 18 49 an 8 percent decrease from previous week s episode finale and its lead in kitchen nightmares did however help fox tie for first place in that demographic with abc and cbs rating for this episode almost doubled when dvr time shifted viewing was taken into account because of its comparatively low live ratings sfscope columnist sarah stegall speculated that only core of core audience watched episode as no outsiders could have possibly what went on in that 45 minutes reviews day we died has generally received positive reviews from television critics sam mcpherson from tv overmind graded finale with an a writing from a show known for its mindbending episodes came most mindbending episode of all day we died not only reinvigorated show s fantastic but inevitably aging premise but gave show a breath of life that has me waiting no begging for show s fourth season though he wouldn t call finale best fringe episode yet mcpherson referred to season as best of three and probably best season of television that s aired in recent years entertainment weeklys ken tucker lauded finale commenting in his review s conclusion consider about whole arc of this season and tell me this wasn t one of most moving thrilling funny inspiring chunks of television you ve watched performances by noble torv and jackson were extraordinarily adroit never showy or merely clever i was so glad that by season s end jackson peter had once again taken center stage a central importance to a season that by nature of its design needed to concentrate a lot on walter s and olivia s ign s regular fringe reviewer ramsey isler rated episode 8 10 he compared plot to lost remarking apparently one thoroughly confusing and unnecessarily convoluted tv series wasn t enough but hey i understand why j j and his fringe collaborators might have done this they had kind of written themselves into a corner where one of universes had to go and they couldn t stretch that storyline out forever a restart like this is a good way to allow themselves room to write something new even if it may require some clever thinking to explain themselves out of this situation adequately isler had trouble rating finale noting that he had to see how events are explained in fourth season before he can make a complete judgment noel murray from a v club graded finale with a b he praised writers for once again introducing a new world that feels fully formed with its own rich backstory that they could choose to explore if they have time and inclination murray concluded his review it may be that fringe has bitten off more than it can chew here and storytelling is about to get hopelessly convoluted as it often does once time travel enters picture but for now i m going to enjoy living with and thinking over what i ve seen so far and i m going to trust that no matter how crazy fringes fourth season gets writers are going to keep bringing everything back to less mind bending questions some reviewers questioned logic of peter having never existed though others expressed their trust in writers ability to make it work futon critic and tv com staff highlighted day we died as one of best television episodes of 2010 11 united states network television schedule likewise give me my remote contributor marisa rothman ranked day we died one of best episodes of year explaining between walter s eventual reunion with his loved ones and olivia s tragic demise few episodes were as heartbreaking as day we died not to mention no episode shocked me as much with a plot twist i literally bolted up in my seat when peter vanished into thin air after creating a bridge between universes entertainment weekly included episode s ending in their list of television s best cliffhangers of 2011 and later named it sixteenth best episode of series time gave day we died an honorable mention on their list of best episodes of season awards and nominations at 63rd primetime emmy awards john noble submitted day we died along with entrada
