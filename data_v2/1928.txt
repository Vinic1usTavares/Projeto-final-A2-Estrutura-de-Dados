hms levant was a 28 gun sixth rate frigate of which saw royal navy service against france in seven years war and against france spain and american colonies during american revolutionary war principally a hunter of privateers she was also designed to be a match for small french frigates but with a broader hull and sturdier build at expense of some speed and manoeuvrability launched in 1758 levant was assigned to royal navy s jamaica station from 1759 and proved her worth in defeating nine french vessels during her first three years at sea she was also part of british expedition against martinique in 1762 but played no role in landings or subsequent defeat of french forces at fort royal frigate was decommissioned following britain s declaration of peace with france in 1763 but returned to service in 1766 for patrol duties in caribbean decommissioned for a second time in 1770 she was reinstated at outbreak of american revolutionary war and sent to mediterranean as part of a small british squadron based at gibraltar over next three years she captured or sank a total of fourteen enemy craft including an 18 gun american privateer in 1779 she brought home news of an impending spanish assault on gibraltar ahead of spain s declaration of war on great britain ageing frigate was finally removed from navy service later that year and her crew discharged to other vessels she was broken up at deptford dockyard in 1780 having secured a total of 31 victories over 21 years at sea construction thumb plan of levant levant was an oak built 28 gun sixth rate one of 19

french privateers in her first twelve months at sea winfield 2007 p 227 orders from admiralty to build coventry class vessels were made after outbreak of seven years war and at a time in which royal dockyards were fully engaged in constructing or fitting out navy s ships of line consequently and despite some navy board misgivings contracts for most coventry class vessels were issued to private shipyards with an emphasis on rapid completion of task contract for levants construction were issued on 20 may 1757 to shipwright henry adams of buckler s hard in hampshire it was stipulated that work should be completed within ten months for 28 gun vessel measuring approximately burthen subject to satisfactory completion adams would receive a comparatively modest fee of ps9 5s per ton to be paid through periodic drawn against navy board winfield 2007 pp 1965 pp as private shipyards were not subject to rigorous naval oversight admiralty also granted authority for such alterations as shall be judged necessary in order to cater to preferences or ability of individual shipwrights after consultation with admiralty adams took advantage of this freedom to make four substantive changes to tartar design ship s wheel was moved from behind mizzen mast to before it to improve helmsman s line of sight gardiner 1992 p 76 tiller was also relocated from an exposed position on quarterdeck to a safer location belowdecks and near stern vessel s were relocated from lower to upper deck to allow additional storage space inside hull gardiner 1992 p 18 finally in recognition of vessel s likely role in chasing small enemy craft leading pair of gunports were moved from sides of vessel to bow in order to form a battery of chase guns levants keel was laid down in june 1757 but work proceeded slowly and vessel was not ready for launch until july 1758 as built levant was long with a keel a beam of and a hold depth of after adams modifications she measured 595 tons burthen or nearly ten tons larger than size specified in contract her armament comprised 24 nine pounder cannons located along her gun deck supported by four three pounder cannons on quarterdeck and twelve pounder swivel guns ranged along her sides admiralty designated complement was 200 comprising two commissioned officers a captain and a lieutenant overseeing 40 warrant and petty officers 91 naval ratings 38 marines and 29 servants and other ranks rodger 1986 pp among these other ranks were four positions reserved for widow s men fictitious crew members whose pay was intended to be reallocated to families of sailors who died at sea vessel was named after levant an area of eastern mediterranean in selecting her name board of admiralty continued a tradition dating to 1644 of using geographic features overall ten of nineteen coventry class vessels including levant were named after well known regions rivers or towns with few exceptions remainder of class were named after figures from classical antiquity following a more modern trend initiated in 1748 by john montagu 4th earl of sandwich in his capacity as first lord of admiralty in sailing qualities levant was broadly comparable with french frigates of equivalent size but with a shorter and sturdier hull and greater weight in her broadside guns she was also comparatively broad beamed which when coupled with adams modifications provided ample space for provisions ship s mess and a large magazine for powder and round shot taken together these characteristics would enable levant to remain at sea for long periods without resupply gardiner 1992 pp she was also built with broad and heavy masts which balanced weight of her hull improved stability in rough weather and made her capable of carrying a greater quantity of sail disadvantages of this comparatively heavy design were a decline in manoeuvrability and slower speed when sailing in light winds gardiner 1992 pp 111112 seven years war thumb left guadeloupe where levant was stationed in

philanthropist ralph allen and previously commander of sixth rate winfield 2007 pp there were delays in mustering sufficient crew and frigate was not finally ready to put to sea until june 1759 on 14 june captain tucker received orders to take position off guadeloupe and leeward islands there to join a squadron commanded by commodore john moore levant set sail for this assignment on 23 july british squadron of which levant was part was tasked with disrupting french trade through caribbean and hunting privateers however frigate saw little action in her first six months in region french trade had virtually ceased since outbreak of war with britain while a smallpox outbreak killed some among levants crew it was not until early 1760 that levant defeated her first opponent a 14 gun french privateer which was sunk with loss of 120 of her crew thereafter combat was more frequent two small privateers were captured in early 1760 8 gun poissan volante and 12 gun st pierre and these vessels and their crews were delivered into british custody on leeward islands in june pickering a british merchantman previously captured by french was retaken and sailed to antigua as levants prize a further victory followed on 29 june with capture of french privateer le scipio after which levant was put into harbour in antigua for resupply one contemporary source at this time records her as carrying only 20 of her 28 guns she returned to sea before end of year capturing privateer l union on 18 december british military successes in european waters in 1760 offered freedom for navy to support offensive operations in caribbean in following year in january major general robert monckton set sail from north america to caribbean with 2 000 men and four ships of line for a planned invasion of french dominica robson 2016 p 173 levant saw little action in advance of monckton s arrival and captured only one vessel privateer la catherine on 15 february monckton arrived in antigua shortly after this capture captain tucker was then deputised to carry general aboard levant for a visit to various leeward island settlements while invasion force assembled at guadeloupe monckton departed leeward islands in april and levant resumed her hunt for privateers capturing la dulcinee on 13 july and l aventurier six days later another french privateer conquerant was captured on 19

admiral george rodney robson 2016 pp levant was added to rodney s sizeable command in late 1761 and sailed as part of expedition in january 1762 she was present when british landings commenced but is not recorded as having engaged with enemy forces either there or in subsequent french defeat at fort royal between 25 january and 3 february levant then returned to her station off leeward islands arriving there on 10 february captain tucker had fallen ill with gout and on 20 february he was replaced by captain john laforey previously of sixth rate winfield 2007 p 276 levant made one capture

navy s needs she was in poor condition captain laforey reported to admiralty that rats had eaten through hull and substantial work would be required to keep ship afloat rodger 1986 p 70 repairs were commenced but by april 1763 laforey had departed vessel and command was transferred to captain molyneux shuldham for voyage back to england restored to seaworthiness levant reached portsmouth dockyard in august where she was decommissioned and her crew discharged or reassigned there were rumours that levant would swiftly return to active service but these proved unfounded and she remained tied up at portsmouth her hull and fittings were surveyed in late 1763 to determine maintenance requirements but no repairs were made in september 1763 a member of her skeleton crew was robbed and murdered at liphook a village some distance from portsmouth levant returned to navy service in 1766 under command of captain basil keith and was assigned to patrol and convoy duties on navy s jamaica station in august she docked at deptford to take on crew and supplies setting sail for caribbean on 28 november levant held her jamaica post for three years but this extensive service in tropical waters left her in poor condition in 1770 she returned to deptford dockyard where she was decommissioned and hauled out of water for rebuilding work was granted to shipwright john dudman and took six months from november 1770 to april 1771 repair and rebuilding expenses were ps5 869 with an additional ps3 059 for fitting out amounting to considerably more than vessel s original construction cost of ps5 423 rebuilt frigate was recommissioned in august 1771 under captain samuel thompson after four months in home waters she was assigned to navy s mediterranean squadron and took up position off gibraltar in january 1772 levant remained at this station for three years her uneventful service broken only by a 1773 transfer of command from captain thompson to captain george murray son of former jacobite commander lord murray american revolutionary war levant returned to portsmouth in early 1775 but put to sea again on 22 june amid early stages of american revolutionary war captain murray s orders were to join a mediterranean squadron under overall command of captain robert mann which was tasked with intercepting merchant vessels suspected of supplying american rebels while at sea murray also took opportunity to train his crew in seamanship and battle techniques in preparation for future enemy engagement in march 1776 she anchored in bay of algiers where dey or local ruler received her warmly and provided crew with supplies of bread vegetables and three live sheep mediterranean trade was busy and levant took part in halting and examining vessels with crews of various nationalities including dutch genoese spanish and british caribbean neutral shipping was permitted to continue on its way however levant detained a south carolina merchantman named dolphin in october 1776 on suspicion of being a supply vessel for rebels and sent her into gibraltar along with her cargo of rice clark ed et al 2014 p 939 in november 1776 levant secured a substantial prize with capture of another south carolina vessel argo carrying rice and indigo worth ps37 200 argo was to have exchanged her cargo in bordeaux for clothing and medicine to supply american rebellion further success followed in early 1777 with capture of 18 gun american privateer general montgomery news had reached england that this vessel was off island of madeira in march having sailed from port of philadelphia in february with a crew of 100 men levant was sent in pursuit with her crew sighting general montgomery at midday on 8 march captain murray ordered levant to fly false colours hoisting a dutch flag to avoid alerting privateer s crew general montgomery had also disguised herself by flying a british flag for several hours americans allowed levant to draw near finally turning to flee when murray fired a warning shot a seven hour chase ensued extending into night with two ships often within musket shot but unable to bring their broadside cannons to bear at around 1 00am wind strengthened and levant was able to overhaul her prey forcing out gunned americans to surrender nine of general montgomerys crew enlisted aboard levant with remainder being conveyed to portsmouth where they remained

continued her mediterranean patrols in 1778 and was rewarded on 24 march with recapture of a british merchantman which had been bound for newfoundland when seized by an american privateer off gibraltar on same day as this capture levant fell into company with 28 gun frigate her captain sir thomas rich advised that he was pursuing a 22 gun american privateer with three captured merchant ships in tow on 21 march privateer had surprised and destroyed enterprises tender before escaping into night rich had given chase for next three days murray now added levant to hunt and two british frigates set courses to windward and leeward of americans likely path both sailed through night without sighting their prey in morning of 25 march they encountered one of revenges prizes 16 gun british merchantman hope which promptly surrendered and was returned to gibraltar revenge herself eluded capture and was later reported as having escaped to neutral spanish port of cadiz clark ed et al volume 12 p 525 france entered war against britain after signing a formal treaty with united states in march 1778 there was a subsequent reorganization of royal navy forces in mediterranean with levant joining a squadron of four other vessels based in gibraltar under overall direction of admiral robert duff of this squadron levant was second largest behind only duff s 60 gun flagship in july levant encountered and captured robert an american merchant vessel that had been bound for boston with a cargo of salt in august she took her first french prize of war a merchantman with a cargo of tobacco and recaptured british schooner lively which had previously been seized by an american privateer off scotland s western islands two more french prizes followed victorieux seized en route to marseilles and duchess of grumont which surrendered off toulon captured vessels were sent under guard to gibraltar these ongoing victories belied changing conditions applicable to levants hunt for enemy vessels off gibraltar american vessels had become scarce especially since spain had closed her ports to them in winter of 1777 in retaliation for privateer attacks on spanish ships clark ed et al volume 11 p 860 french trading vessels remained at sea but were occasionally accompanied by naval escorts large enough to prevent their capture by gibraltar s small royal navy squadron levant was careened on a beach at gibraltar over christmas 1778 and then returned to sea but her next capture was not until 14 march 1779 when in company with captain rich s enterprise she seized a french vessel thesee a further victory followed on 1 april when levant still in company with enterprise took eclair a french xebec carrying wine and brandy from marseilles on 12 april 1779 spain signed treaty of aranjuez with france setting terms for a joint military alliance against britain despite treaty spain delayed formal declaration of war until june to give time for better co ordination of its battle

vessel below waterline sinking her levant rescued majority of her crew and transported them to prison in gibraltar captain murray then took levant on a cruise to hunt for french or american vessels off cadiz while pursuing this task in june 1779 he ran across spanish battle fleet comprising 32 ships of line and two frigates heading south towards an unknown destination spain was still nominally a neutral power and after a brief exchange of pleasantries spanish fleet left levant unmolested and continued on its way murray immediately set sail for england to report that spanish were at sea pausing off land s end on 17 july to capture french privateer la revanche levant finally reached portsmouth in late july but by this time murray s news of spanish fleet was out of date spain had
