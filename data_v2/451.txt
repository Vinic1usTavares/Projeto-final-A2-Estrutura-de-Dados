interstate tdr was an early unmanned combat aerial vehicle referred to at time as an assault drone developed by interstate aircraft and engineering corporation during second world war for use by united states navy capable of being armed with bombs or torpedoes 2000 aircraft were ordered but only around 200 were built type saw some service in pacific theater against japanese but continuing developmental issues affecting aircraft along with success of operations using more conventional weapons led to decision being made to cancel assault drone program in october 1944 design and development in 1936 lieutenant commander delmar s proposed that unpiloted remotely controlled aircraft had potential for use by united states navy in combat operations due to limitations of technology of time development of assault drone project was given a low priority but by early 1940s development of radar altimeter and television made project more feasible and following trials using converted manned aircraft first operational test of a drone against a naval target was conducted in april 1942 that same month following trials of naval aircraft factory tdn assault drone interstate aircraft received a contract from navy for two prototype and 100 production aircraft to a simplified and improved design to be designated tdr 1 control of tdr 1 would be conducted from either a control aircraft usually a grumman tbf avenger with operator viewing a tv screen showing view from a camera mounted aboard drone along with radar altimeter s readout or via a pilot on board tdr 1 for test flights powered by two lycoming o 435 engines of each tdr 1 used a remarkably simple design with a steel tube frame constructed by schwinn bicycle company covered with a molded wood skin thus making little use of strategic materials so as not to impede production of higher priority aircraft capable of being optionally piloted for test flights an aerodynamic fairing was used to cover cockpit area during operational missions tdr 1 was equipped with a fixed tricycle landing gear that would be jettisoned in operation after takeoff for improved performance tdr 1s were manufactured by wurlitzer company operational history thumb right interstate xbq 4 under code name operation option navy projected that up to 18 squadrons of assault drones would be formed with 162 grumman tbf avenger control aircraft and 1000 assault drones being ordered zaloga 2008 p 8 however technical difficulties in development of tdr 1 combined with a continued low priority given to project saw contract modified with order reduced to only around 300 aircraft a single tdr 1 was tested by u s army air forces as xbq 4 however no production contract resulted from this testing in 1944 under control of special air task force tdr 1 was deployed operationally to south pacific for operations against japanese newcome 2004 p 68 tdr 1 aircraft equipped a single mixed squadron special air task group 1 along with tbm avenger control aircraft and first operational mission took place on september 27 conducting bombing operations against japanese ships despite this success assault drone program had already been canceled after production of 189 tdr 1 aircraft due to a combination of continued technical problems aircraft failing to live up to expectations and fact that more conventional weaponry was proving adequate for defeat of japan final mission was flown on october 27 with 50 drones having been expended on operations 31 aircraft successfully striking their targets without loss to pilots of stag 1 following war some tdr 1s were converted for operation as private goebel 2010 variants and operators thumb right interstate xtd3r xtdr 1 two prototypes tdr 1 production version of xtdr 1 189 aircraft produced xtd2r 1 variant with two franklin o 805 2 engines two prototypes ordered canceled in favor of td3r xtd3r 1 variant with wright r 975 radial engines three prototypes xtd3r 2 variant of xtd3r 1 one prototype td3r 1 production version of xtd3r 1 40 aircraft ordered but cancelled xbq 4 army designation for tdr 1 one aircraft converted from tdr 1 xbq 5 army designation for xtd2r 1 designation reserved but no aircraft ordered xbq 6 army designation for xtd3r no aircraft produced bq 6a army designation for td3r 1 no aircraft produced operators united states army air forces united states navy aircraft on display thumb right interstate tdr 1 on display at national naval aviation museum a single example of tdr 1 survives and is on display at u s navy s national naval aviation museum in pensacola florida newcome 2004 p 69 specifications tdr 1 thumb right three view of tdr 1 see also references citations bibliography further reading external links tdr category 1940s united states bomber aircraft category unmanned aerial vehicles of united states category world war ii guided missiles of united states category low wing aircraft category aircraft first flown in 1942 category twin piston engined tractor aircraft
