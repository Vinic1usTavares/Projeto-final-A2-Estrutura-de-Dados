thumb tweed an end product manufactured from boreray s wool boreray also known as boreray blackface or hebridean blackface is a breed of sheep originating on st kilda archipelago off west coast of scotland and surviving as a feral animal on one of islands boreray breed was once reared for meat and wool but is now used mainly for conservation grazing boreray is one of northern european short tailed sheep group of breeds it is one of rarest breeds of sheep in united kingdom breed is classed as category 3 vulnerable by rare breeds survival trust because 500 900 breeding ewes are known to exist it had previously been only breed classed in category 2 critical but by 2017 population had grown st kilda sheep st kilda is a remote archipelago west of outer hebrides several types of sheep have been associated with st kilda in addition to boreray these include soay sheep a feral type from soay one of other islands in st kilda archipelago and hebridean sheep which was formerly called st kilda sheep although sheep it was derived from were probably not in fact from st kilda itself history until late eighteenth century domesticated sheep throughout scottish highlands and islands belonged to a type called scottish dunface or old scottish which was probably similar to sheep kept in whole of northern and western europe up to iron age a local variety of dunface was kept on two main st kilda islands of boreray and hirta by crofters of islands who lived on hirta largest island of archipelago modern breeds descended from dunface include boreray and also north ronaldsay and shetland in mid eighteenth century crofters sheep were described as being of smallest kind with short coarse wool and all having horns usually one pair but often two pairs at that time there were about a thousand of these sheep on hirta and about four hundred on boreray in late nineteenth century crofters sheep were cross bred with scottish blackface sheep which by then had replaced dunface throughout mainland scotland before evacuation of st inhabitants these sheep were farmed however when st kilda archipelago s human inhabitants were evacuated in 1930 sheep of hirta were also removed and in 1932 they were replaced by soays which still live there as well as on soay itself meanwhile remaining sheep on boreray were left to become feral these became only survivors of crofters sheep and one of few surviving descendants of dunface this means that they are original unmodified sheep that used to be farmed on island in 1970s half a dozen of them were exported to form basis of a breeding population on mainland but majority of borerays still remain on island characteristics thumb two boreray ewes one with less typical darker colouring despite being partially derived from a long tailed breed scottish blackface borerays display characteristics which group them with other northern european short tailed sheep they are amongst smallest sheep with mature ewes weighing and standing at withers they have naturally short tails which do not require docking they also moult their fleece naturally rather than having to be shorn annually though older individuals do not moult as easily and may require additional shearing fleeces are grey or creamy white on body though darker individuals occur whose colouring is similar to soay sheep rough in quality wool is mostly used in creation of or carpet yarns a tweed is a rough surfaced coarse cloth typically made in scotland its colour is a mix of flecked colours face and legs are wool free and black and white with proportions varying between individuals both sexes of boreray display horns formerly sometimes more than one pair but in modern breed always only one pair horns on ewes tend to be thinner than those on males and while they curve they do not spiral beyond 360 degrees mature rams can grow especially large spiral horns which may be used for crafts such as making shepherd s crooks horns on rams have been described as striking and majestic by one farmer of breed population in 1999 population was estimated to be at less than 84 with 74 ewes in 2002 there were between 92 and 100 animals with 92 ewes and male population estimated to be less than 7 in 2012 204 ewes were registered in herdbooks since 2012 sheep numbers have been increasing year on year and in 2017 rare breeds survival trust rbst moved classification of sheep from category 2 critical to category 3 vulnerable as number of breeding ewes was estimated to exceed 500 this data was collected from herdbooks produced by breed societies listing all registered sheep and multiplying number of registered sheep to account for non registered sheep however in 2017 united nations food and agriculture organisation fao estimated that there are 426 breeding ewes use in farming breed was primarily reared for meat and wool but due to its rarity it is now reared for conservation purposes if reared at all as most of population is thought to be feral due to native conditions of where it developed boreray is very well suited to conservation grazing which is grazing that uses livestock to improve biodiversity and achieve nature conservation in a given area however rare breeds survival trust believe that this could be further capitalised on if breed is developed further see also fauna of scotland references external links borerays british
