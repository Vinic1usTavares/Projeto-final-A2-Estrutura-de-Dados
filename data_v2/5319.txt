served by q train at all times m train during weekends and weekday evenings limited rush hour n trains and one a m rush hour r train in northbound direction only 72nd street has two tracks and one island platform when planning for line started in early 2000s station was originally proposed with 3 tracks and 2 island platforms but this was cut back due to line s rising costs this is southernmost station on first phase of second avenue line south of this station bmt 63rd street line diverges to west towards lexington avenue 63rd street station and bellmouths exist for a future extension to second avenue houston street and hanover square station was not originally proposed as part of program for action in 1968 but a later revision to that plan entailed building a second avenue subway with one of its stops located at 72nd street construction on that project started in 1972 but stalled in 1975 due to lack of funding in 2007 a separate measure authorized a first phase of second avenue line to be built between 65th and 105th streets with stations at 72nd 86th and 96th streets station opened on january 1 2017 with provisions to extend line south to houston street in phase 3 since opening presence of second avenue subway s three phase 1 stations has improved real estate prices along corridor 72nd street station was used by approximately 8 54 million passengers in 2017

1919 as part of a massive expansion of what would become independent subway system ind work on line never commenced as great depression crushed economy numerous plans for second avenue subway appeared throughout 20th century but these were usually deferred due to lack of funds in anticipation of never built new subway line second and third avenue elevated lines were demolished in 1942 and 1955 respectively second avenue elevated had one station at 72nd street and second avenue right above same intersection where current subway station is while third avenue elevated had two nearby stops on nearby third avenue at 67th street and 76th street see planning as part of new york city transit authority s 1968 program for action construction of full length second avenue subway was proposed it was to be built in two phases first phase from 126th to 34th streets second phase from 34th to whitehall streets line s planned stops in manhattan spaced farther apart than those on existing subway lines proved controversial second avenue line was criticized as a rich man s express circumventing lower east side with its complexes of high rise low and middle income housing and slums in favor of a silk stocking route people protested for almost a year over lack of stations at 72nd street and a stop at lenox hill 72nd street station was added in october 1970 in 1999 regional plan association considered a full length second avenue subway which included 72nd street as one of its planned 31 stations metrolink p 20 entrances to 72nd street station were to be located at 70th 72nd and 74th streets final environmental impact statement was released for station in april 2004 initial design of 72nd street station lasted about eight years between 1999 and 2007 in november 2007 mary peters united states secretary of transportation announced that second avenue subway would receive 1 3 billion in federal funding for project s first phase to be funded over a seven year period however due to cost increases for construction materials and diesel fuel affecting prices of contracts not yet signed mta announced in june 2008 that certain features of second avenue subway would be simplified to save money one set of changes which significantly reduces footprint of subway in vicinity of 72nd street is alteration of 72nd street station from a three track two platform design to a two track single island platform design paired with a simplification of connection to broadway line spur june 17 2008 supplemental environmental impact studies covering changes for proposed 72nd street station was completed in june 2009 construction thumb left 250px view of tunnels at end of station cavern thumb left 250px arch form work in march 2007 second avenue subway was revived line s first phase first major expansion to new york city subway in more than a half century included three stations in total at 72nd 86th and 96th streets which collectively cost 4 45 to 4 5 billion its construction site was designated as being from 105th street and second avenue to 63rd street and third avenue mta awarded a 337 million contract one that included constructing tunnels between 92nd and 63rd streets building a launch box for tunnel boring machine tbm at 92nd to 95th streets and erecting access shafts at 69th and 72nd streets to schiavone construction skanska usa civil and j f shea construction on june 5 2009 an apartment building at 1772 second avenue was evacuated by nyc department of buildings dob after it was determined that building was in danger of collapse evacuation of building as well as a mixed use building at 1768 second avenue 301 east 92nd street on june 29 2009 had delayed contractor s plan to use controlled blasting to remove bedrock in southern section of launch box until blasting permits could be issued mta required contractors to use mechanical equipment to remove bedrock which is slower than blasting out rock one building had been shored up and work was in progress on second mta had rescheduled blasting to begin during week of november 2 in may 2010 a tunnel boring machine beginning at 92nd street started to dig down second avenue through 72nd street area to 63rd street and lexington avenue exclusive ground breaking for 2nd avenue subway line weeks away ny1 january 24 2007 on october 1 2010 mta awarded a 431 million contract to ssk constructors a joint venture for mining of tunnels connecting 72nd street station to existing 63rd street station and for excavation and heavy civil structures of 72nd street station construction was to be done through two shafts at 69th and 72nd streets locations of future entrances shaft sinking work was started in late 2010 projected completion of contract was estimated at november 2013 rock around area is mostly manhattan schist and was generally considered to be a stable location for blasting so blasting for station commenced on january 18 2011 on august 8 2012 a controlled blast at 72nd street caused rocks to fly over station site nearly two weeks later on august 21 2012 an uncontrolled blast for second avenue subway station at 72nd street was done incorrectly causing a large explosion that sent debris into air and broke windows of buildings in area and damaged nearby sidewalks cavern drilling was finished in august 2012 however blasting for station entrances was not completed until february 28 2013 demolition of a muck house erected in august 2011 to remove mud from tunnels started in april 2013 and was finished by october 2013 by january 2013 almost 96 3 of excavation was completed with of dirt excavated from station waterproofing was also being done in station and tunnels south of it contract for station s finishing touches including electrical plumbing track and signal systems as well as entrances and exits was awarded to judlau contracting at a price of 258 million in february 2013 mezzanine level of station was completed and being used to store equipment in september station s size was gauged by to be so large that 55 000 elephants could fit within enormous cavern station s ancillaries at 72nd and 69th street were planned to be completed in winter 2014 2015 but by october 2016 finishing touches on ancillaries were still being applied station s mezzanine plumbing electricity and machinery were originally scheduled to be finished in fall 2015 but estimated completion date was pushed back to september 2016 and then later to simply fall of 2016 thumb 250px platform during rush hour station was 56 complete and station was 92 complete however in july 2016 it was reported that station s opening could be delayed because station s elevator had not been delivered and because communication systems at station had yet to be finished elevators and communication systems still needed to be finished by october 2016 and it was possible that station s opening could be delayed with station being delayed possibility of opening other two stations of line in december but skipping this station was being considered on december 14 though mta announced that all of line s stations would open at same time still systems testing at this station had not been completed by december 19 station opened on january 1 2017 phase three thumb left 250px future junction between phase 1 future phase 3 and 63rd street connector once construction on phase 2 of second avenue subway which will run from 105th street to harlem 125th street station at lexington avenue is completed construction is expected to start on phase 3 which would extend second avenue subway south down second avenue to houston street tracks would diverge from tracks that continue to bmt 63rd street line running south on second avenue there is currently a large provisional cavern or bellmouth for this line however no funding has been committed to this phase after phase 3 a new t service will operate from harlem 125th street to houston street an additional two track connection tracks st 1 and st 2 is planned between line toward lower manhattan around 63rd street and ind 63rd street line toward queens using existing bellmouths that are at 63rd street and first avenue current plans do not call for it to be used by regular service but instead to be used for non revenue moves and to provide a connection to jamaica yard maintenance depot connection would allow for trains to run from financial district to queens if capacity of ind queens boulevard line was increased or if queens super express bypass was built station layout thumb left 250px crowds at entrance 2 on opening day 72nd street station is served by q trains at all times some n trains during rush hours one northbound r train during am rush hours and m trains during weekends and evenings it has two tracks and an island platform station is built so that it is more wide open than most other underground subway stations in system like other second avenue subway stations but unlike existing new york city subway stations due to its openness station was likened to a washington metro station by dr michael horodniceanu president of mta capital construction platform is approximately 99 feet 30 m below ground making it deepest of 3 stations built under phase 1 platform for 72nd street station like other second avenue subway stations is wide station has air cooling systems to make it at least cooler than other subway stations during summer this requires station to have large ventilation and ancillary buildings rather than traditional subway grates station is also compliant with current fire codes whereas most existing stations are not additionally station is waterproofed with concrete liners and fully drained track layout diamond crossovers are located in cavern both north and south of station with a flying junction to bmt 63rd street line via tracks g3 and g4 just south of southern crossover station cavern which includes both crossovers is long south of this station there are provisions for second avenue subway to continue further south via second avenue tracks would pass over track g4 which connects bmt 63rd street line to uptown second avenue subway track track s2 72nd street station was conceived as a three track station with two island platforms but prior to construction was reduced to a two track one island platform station due to high cost of building a three track two platform station additionally station s width was shaved back from to although this served to reduce costs it also removed a lot of operational flexibility from 72nd street station since trains cannot be turned back at station without severely disrupting service artwork thumb left 250px perfect strangers station artwork perfect strangers consists of portraits by artist and photographer vik muniz in february 2014 muniz was chosen in a mta arts design competition with more than 100 entrants muniz s artwork comprises 36 mosaic cast portraits of real people who look like they are waiting for a train these portraits based on photographs of his acquaintances are scattered along exits and mezzanine portraits include those of chef daniel boulud and designer waris ahluwalia muniz also has a portrait of himself running after a wayward suitcase while papers fly away behind him a married same sex couple is also depicted marking first permanent non political lgbt art in new york city depiction is based on a photograph of a brooklyn same sex couple and is meant to showcase day to day normalcy of gay new yorkers however jewish magazine forward claimed that work was anti semitic because one of figures was a jewish man holding a globe and luggage exits and ancillary buildings current station layout includes 3 numbered entrances exits containing 11 escalators in addition to 5 elevators there

elevator 1 bank of 5 elevators two ancillary buildings are located at ancillary 1 northwest corner of 69th street and second avenue ancillary 2 northwest corner of 72nd street and second avenue in 2007 some area residents filed a lawsuit in opposition to a proposed entrance at 72nd street between first and second avenues in front of residential buildings at 320 and 340 east 72nd street citing that entrance would take up space on sidewalk due to vocal community opposition mta non publicly revised plans for subway entrance in fall 2007 relocating planned entrance to southeast corner of second avenue and 72nd street two years later in 2009 a finding of no significant impact by federal transit administration found that a proposed entrance at northeast corner of second avenue and 72nd street was unfeasible as was proposed single sidewalk elevator at southeast corner northeast corner entrance within 305 east 72nd street apartment building would have encroached into a portion of cvs pharmacy s ground floor retail space as well as apartment building s basement which contained its laundry room and several of its utility intake pipes building northeast corner entrance would have forced owners of 305 east 72nd street to move their laundry room and utilities into retail space occupied by cvs so plans for northeast corner entrance were canceled site for sidewalk elevator on southeast corner turned out to be located close to a high pressure steam main that was in diameter after a 2007 steam main explosion in midtown utility provider consolidated edison changed its guidelines for clearance around high pressure mains which meant that elevator was now too close to main thus plan was revised to place elevator inside a building of three alternatives presented for combining two entrances mta chose an alternative in which there would be five elevators inside a building at southeast corner of second avenue and 72nd street this required demolition of 300 east 72nd street so that a new building for five elevators could be built in 2013 mta filed to change location of entrance 1 moving it onto from sidewalk away from its original proposed location inside 301 east 69th street this was because designs for entrances inside building failed to both satisfy building s residents as well as meet mta s engineering requirements with new york city department of transportation planning a bike lane along east side of second avenue after construction is finished mta could widen sidewalk to make room for entrances without ultimately disrupting traffic flow effects thumb 70th street entrance under construction business declined during construction and blasting of station with many storefronts losing business and some even being forced to close however starting in 2013 construction of station has caused value of real estate in area to start to rise although surrounding area s real estate prices had been declining since 1990s there had been increases in purchases and leases of residential units around area causing real estate prices to rise again on upper east side prices of real estate west of third avenue had historically been higher than prices east of there but due to subway s construction prices of real estate east of avenue had risen dramatically since station s construction started with opening of new station business owners hoped to see an increase in patronage references further reading nasri v fulcher b redmond r and parikh a 2012 design and construction of 72nd street large and shallow rock cavern station in new york city
