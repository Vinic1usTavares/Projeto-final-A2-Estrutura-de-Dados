levels in beijing on 10 august far exceeded world health organization s safety level rain during women s race decreased smog level in men s race conducted previous day humidity and heat had taken greatest toll on athletes to compensate for expected warm weather some female cyclists chose not to wear undershirts this proved to be a misjudgment as conditions were cooler in great wall section
