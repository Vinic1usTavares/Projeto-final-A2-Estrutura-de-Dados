interdisciplinary degree in religious studies philosophy and cultural anthropology from kansai university which he attended from 1981 to 1984 he never received any form of formal musical training and

hired by square now square enix as a composer after being rejected by his first choice nihon falcom he applied to square without expecting to be hired as they had many applicants for job and he had never played any of company s games at interview however nobuo uematsu was attracted to their shared love of progressive rock and he was chosen over 100 other applicants he started off debugging final fantasy iv and creating sound effects for romancing saga as there were not enough game projects in development to open up new jobs for square s new hires but kikuta was soon given game soundtracks to compose career thumb 150px kikuta in 2008 during his seven years at square kikuta composed soundtracks to only three games secret of mana and trials of mana for super nintendo entertainment system and soukaigi for playstation kikuta says that he was given complete freedom to compose soundtracks in that he was given no direction at all as to how to compose music he began working on music before design of game was finalized this freedom was helped by fact that uematsu ran music group as a separate division in company from game developers kikuta was originally chosen for secret of mana after kenji ito who had composed first game in mana series final fantasy adventure was forced to drop project due to other demands such as soundtrack to romancing saga rather than create midi versions of his compositions like most game composers of that time did and hand these over to sound engineering department kikuta made his own samples that matched hardware capabilities of super nintendo this way he would know exactly how pieces would sound on system s hardware instead of having to deal with audio hardware differences between original composition and super nintendo kikuta spent nearly 24 hours a day in his office working on soundtrack alternating between composing and editing secret of mana led to an arranged album secret of mana which is composed of a single 50 minute track made up of experimental sounds like waterfalls bird calls and cell phone sounds for trials of mana kikuta was assisted by a sound programmer hidenori suzuki which allowed him to compose over three times amount of music he had created for secret of mana move to playstation for soukaigi allowed kikuta to focus on creating live music for soundtrack rather than tweaking synthesizer instruments to make music files fit in game cartridge as he had to for super nintendo he used added audio processing power to expand his musical creativity including pieces such as songs in unintelligible thai and malaysian by japanese singers game itself however was not a success and kikuta decided that he wanted more direct control over next project he worked on after kikuta finished soukaigi he left square and founded video game development company sacnoth assuming position of president and ceo from 1998 to 1999 during this time company created koudelka for playstation kikuta was credited as concept designer game planner scenario writer producer and composer his philosophy in designing video games is that best projects have a limited number of people designing overall experience and making key decisions he tried to follow this philosophy in creating koudelka and tried to bring a sense of obsessive passion to project reading what he claims were over 100 books on british history and taking design team on a trip to wales to study country game was released in december 1999 to poor reviews which criticized game s combat system though they praised concept art direction and music kikuta left sacnoth soon

as overclocked remix kikuta has said that he enjoys listening to these works mentioning overclocked remix by name musical style and influences kikuta finds composing music to be natural like breathing he considers it to be his vocation and contrasts it with designing and creating video games which he calls his wish and finds to be very difficult to do in comparison to composition kikuta does not worry about style of music that he composes considering it to only be a tool or method as a result his music is frequently composed of combinations of styles mixed together he is inspired to create his music by things that he has seen especially while traveling he credits much of musical imagery in secret of mana and trials of mana as being inspired by several islands in fiji he has visited rather than trying to be a pure artist that creates art for art s sake kikuta says that his primary goal in composing is to entertain listeners he has not been influenced by other video game composers though he claims to admire hitoshi sakimoto whom he worked with at square he has named pink floyd as his single biggest musical influence and guitarist allan holdsworth as artist he would most like to
