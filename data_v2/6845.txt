very intense tropical cyclone hary was strongest tropical cyclone in 2001 02 south west indian ocean cyclone season and strongest storm worldwide in 2002 developing on march 5 from monsoon trough storm initially moved generally to west and gradually intensified with favorable conditions hary quickly intensified on march 7 developing an eye and well defined outflow after reaching an initial peak cyclone briefly weakened due to an eyewall replacement cycle by which time storm turned southwestward toward madagascar hary re intensified and attained peak winds of 220 km h 140 mph on march 10 just offshore eastern madagascar which made it first very intense tropical cyclone since 2000 after peaking hary weakened due to land interaction and it struck madagascar southeast of antalaha it was turning south over land and as a result it quickly moved offshore there were three deaths in country one of which from electrocution there was locally heavy crop damage and four bridges were destroyed however damage was considered minimal given intensity of storm after affecting madagascar hary accelerated to southeast and eastern periphery of circulation moved over reunion on mountain peaks of island rainfall reached although it was much less near coast rainfall caused flooding killing one person and 20 000 people were left without power hary became extratropical on march 13 although its remnants continued for several days as a powerful mid latitude storm meteorological history in early march 2002 tropical activity was minimal in southern indian ocean limited to an area of convection or thunderstorms located southwest of diego garcia along monsoon on march 4 a broad and elongated low pressure area developed within system although moderate wind shear in region initially prevented significant development next day circulation became better defined and after being nearly stationary for a few days it began moving steadily to west southwest due to a ridge to southeast on march 5 meteo france mfr classified system as a tropical disturbance and later tropical depression 11 at 0000 utc on march 6 joint typhoon warning center jtwc initiated advisories on tropical cyclone 18s and six hours later mfr upgraded system to moderate tropical storm hary after becoming a tropical storm hary was located beneath an anticyclone and in an area of minimal wind shear it turned to a general westward motion with its convection wrapping into center and developing into a central dense overcast a ragged eye formed on march 7 which gradually became more organized that day jtwc upgraded hary to equivalent of a minimal hurricane with 1 minute winds of 120 km h 75 mph by that time storm had developed good outflow and was in midst of a period of rapid deepening early on march 8 mfr upgraded hary to tropical cyclone status and storm became very compact with gales extending only from center while rounding northwest edge of a ridge hary turned to southwest late on march 8 toward northeast coast of madagascar after reaching 10 minute sustained winds of 205 km h 125 mph hary weakened slightly due to an eyewall replacement cycle which resulted in eye becoming indistinct until it was replaced by a larger outer eyewall after new eye formed cyclone again intensified and hary became a very intense tropical cyclone early on march 10 with peak 10 minute winds of 220 km h 140 mph according to mf it was first very intense tropical cyclone since cyclone hudah in 2000 and made hary strongest storm of season around that time jtwc estimated that hary attained peak 1 minute winds of 260 km h 160 mph around time of its peak intensity hary was located about off east coast of madagascar while approaching coast cyclone was turning toward south although its motion was not southerly enough to keep storm offshore at around 1200 utc on march 10 hary made landfall about southeast of antalaha slightly below peak intensity eye rapidly weakened before landfall possibly due to another replacement cycle and land interaction further deteriorated storm by late on march 10 mfr downgraded hary to tropical cyclone status with winds of 160 km h 100 mph about east of ile sainte marie subsequently hary turned more toward south southeast steered by an approaching trough that increased wind shear cyclone stopped weakening and eye began redeveloping early on march 12 hary passed about west of french island of reunion when jtwc estimated its 1 minute winds were about 185 km h 115 mph later that day combination of increasing wind shear and cooler waters weakened cyclone resulting in cloud structure to deteriorate after circulation became fully exposed from convection mfr estimated hary became extratropical around 1200 utc on march 13 circulation expanded greatly afterward as storm continued generally to southeast remnants of hary re intensified on march 17 while passing about southwest of ile amsterdam in south central indian ocean it moved south of 40th parallel south and continued as a powerful storm in westerlies impact cyclone hary passed about south of agalega islands on march 7 producing winds of only 37 km h 23 mph this was due to cyclone s small size on march 9 as hary intensified to northeast of madagascar officials in antsiranana province placed area under a state of alert following day storm clipped eastern portion of province as a very intense tropical cyclone with maximum winds estimated at 220 km h 140 mph while passing near ile sainte marie storm produced a wind gust of although storm was weakening and located east of island at time hary dropped heavy rainfall in eastern madagascar and a 24 hour peak of was reported in tamatave initially communication difficulties prevented reports of damage from leaving region despite intensity of storm overall damage was minimal and much less than predicted two bridges were destroyed each in antalaha district and fenoarivo atsinanana further south in toamasina high winds downed telephone lines and cut communications hary destroyed a hospital and along its path it severely damaged food crops one person died from electrocution and there were three deaths overall in country although center of cyclone hary passed well to west of reunion heavy rains associated with storm caused significant flooding on island cyclone began affecting island when it was located over madagascar after large circulation spread humid air to area and produced heavy rainfall through orographic lift over a 12 hour span fell in la plaine des and highest rainfall was in during storm s passage heaviest rainfall occurred at high altitudes and along coast rainfall reached about in saint philippe these rains caused ravine du to swell and flood nearby saint denis one person drowned after attempting to cross swollen river several roads were washed out across region cutting off cilaos from nearby areas high winds peaking at associated with hary s passage left approximately 20 000 residences without power hary also produced waves during its passage there was no major damage on reunion which was still recovering from deadly cyclone dina two months prior rainfall from hary spread to nearby mauritius
