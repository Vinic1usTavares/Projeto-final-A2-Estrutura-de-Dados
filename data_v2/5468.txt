state route 54 sr 54 is a state highway in u s state of california that consists of two segments in san diego county westernmost part of highway is known as south bay freeway beginning at interstate 5 i 5 in national city and running along sweetwater river before ending at intersection with sr 125 and jamacha boulevard near spring valley sr 54 then resumes at sr 94 in rancho san diego as an undivided highway that leads to city limits of el cajon county route s17 cr s17 connects two portions of highway center portion of sr 54 was never constructed first section of freeway opened in 1963 east of i 805 extension of freeway west to i 5 was delayed to coincide with construction of sweetwater river flood channel while construction started in 1984 a court stopped process for a few years and this portion was not complete until 1992 final section of freeway which was upgraded from an expressway opened in 2007 to coincide with extension of sr 125 south to otay mesa route description sr 54 starts as a six lane freeway from i 5 near mouth of sweetwater river in national city both directions of freeway are divided by river eastbound traffic traverses south bank and westbound traffic traverses north bank two sides join near junction with i 805 roadway continues east for several miles past westfield plaza bonita mall through suburban paradise hills in san diego as freeway turns north in bay terraces it merges with sr 125 north highways pass west of sweetwater reservoir and sweetwater summit regional park and western segment of sr 54 ends at jamacha boulevard exit in la presa jamacha boulevard veers northeast as an undivided highway through spring valley until it reaches campo road it is only designated as county route s17 cr s17 while some maps do consider this part of sr 54 eastern segment of sr 54 runs concurrently with sr 94 from jamacha boulevard east through unincorporated but commercially developed area of rancho san diego and follows campo road about east passing near cuyamaca college sr 54 and cr s17 continue northeast on six lane jamacha road to el cajon while campo road and sr 94 split off to southeast east of brabham street four lane sr 54 continues through suburban development to where it currently ends at el cajon city limit though jamacha road extends into city to route s previous terminus at intersection with i 8 sr 54 is part of california freeway and expressway system but is not part of national highway system though sr 125 is a network of highways that are considered essential to country s economy defense and mobility by federal highway administration route has three different names including jamacha road from campo road to east main street in el cajon south bay freeway from i 805 to sr 94 and filipino american highway from western terminus to sr 125 in early 2012 interchange with i 5 was among top ten most congested segments of highway in california department of transportation caltrans district 11 which includes san diego metro area in 2014 sr 54 had an annual average daily traffic aadt of 21 800 vehicles at eastern end of route and 131 000 between i 805 and reo drive latter of which was highest aadt for highway history thumb right intersection of former sr 54 with i 8 earliest road with a similar route to sr 54 was mentioned in newspapers in 1908 and was paved by 1935 south bay freeway was constructed next as an expressway from national city to spring valley freeway west to i 5 and sweetwater river flood channel were built at same time although both were delayed due to environmental concerns and litigation in late 1990s and 2000s entirety of western portion of sr 54 was converted to a freeway while entire portion inside el cajon city limits was returned to that city early construction a road through jamacha is mentioned in san diego union as early as february 1908 and was oiled in 1935 from us 80 main street around el cajon to sweetwater valley and in other places by sweetwater river in 1956 route of what would become south bay freeway had been determined it would run from sweetwater road in national city to spring valley and intersection of sweetwater road and jamacha boulevard three years later california state legislature added route 280 from near sweetwater river to el cajon to state highway system south bay freeway was included in county s 1960 1961 budget as most important project by 1961 e street in chula vista continued along sweetwater river it turned northeast and became sweetwater road before it entered into lemon grove bids were accepted in november 1962 for part of freeway from eastern national city and valley road to la presa and jamacha road it was to loosely parallel sweetwater road this portion of freeway opened on september 27 1963 and entire project cost 2 25 million about in dollars however although it was a four lane freeway it was declared as an expressway since all intersections were at grade intersections while road was originally planned to have eight lanes only four were constructed due to additional cost meanwhile sr 54 was officially designated in 1964 state highway renumbering as road from i 5 near sweetwater river to i 8 in el cajon replacing route 280 thumb left south bay freeway east of i 805 sweetwater river channel sr 54 was extended west as a freeway to i 5 from i 805 at same time sweetwater river flood control channel was built state proposed routing flood channel in between two roadways of freeway in 1963 and it would also delineate boundary between cities of chula vista and national city later that year county proposed an extension of freeway east to us 80 and third street in el cajon in 1966 u s army s board of engineers supported construction of flood channel to protect future development in surrounding region from floods integration of sr 54 was included in proposal two years later county officials expressed concerns over delay of state and federal approval and considered building freeway without flood control component of project county hoped to build both projects at same time to save 4 million about in dollars in costs this was since it was estimated to require three years worth of legislation to be accomplished in a single year by county board of supervisors in order to use interstate highway system funds that were set to expire in 1972 congress approved project but in late 1968 target date for completion of system would be pushed back two years by 1971 projected start of construction had slipped to within three to four years from then however caltrans had approved project in july 1974 california coastal commission unanimously decided to halt entire project since many of necessary approvals from governmental bodies had not been obtained this overrode an exemption granted by san diego coast regional commission both mayors of chula vista and national city were dismayed mayor kile morgan of national city stated that we in south bay are getting tired of being kicked around in reference to other stalled projects such as sr 157 and sr 125 meanwhile interchange at i 805 was under construction with completion scheduled for next year a u s fish and wildlife report predicted that project would destroy of marshland and harm three bird species that were endangered among other negative environmental consequences conclusions were disputed by local officials in 1976 caltrans said that sr 54 had not been included in plans for next six years due to a lack of funds and a shift in priorities from new roads to maintenance water subcommittee of u s house of representatives later recommended that wildlife refuge be put on hold since u s army corps of engineers usace had not finished their proposal over next few years support for project was expressed by a local citizens group chula vista city council and san diego chamber of commerce by 1980 usace was working to obtain funds which was major obstacle for completion public concerns about project were that it was not needed and would be too costly usace announced in 1981 that an environmental impact report was necessary before project could begin after endangered species act of 1973 least tern and light footed clapper rail were considered endangered and construction would have affected their habitat next year environmental impact report process began financed by usace work on part west of i 805 and i 5 interchange started in may 1984 with construction of a detour for i 5 usace paid for some of costs and federal funds related to interstate highway system were also used that same year county agreed to create a wildlife preserve on of marshland to resolve environmental concerns meanwhile existing part of south bay freeway had become most dangerous five mile stretch of highway in county as declared by local fire chief due to 282 traffic accidents that had occurred on road from 1977 to january 1985 by early 1986 extension of sr 54 freeway to el cajon was declared a lower priority by caltrans that year sierra club filed a lawsuit that halted progress on project next year due to concerns about damage to least tern and light footed clapper rail bird populations caused by construction of a nearby hotel and roads to it would have chief u s district judge gordon thompson stopped work because preserve had not been created it was estimated that shutdown resulted in state losing 25 000 about in dollars a day as well as over 185 layoffs u s fish and wildlife service received of land in sweetwater marsh from santa fe land company to mitigate environmental damage and lawsuit reached a settlement construction resumed in early november 1989 halt meant that project had to be rebid one bridge was partially completed and was thus known as bridge to nowhere eastbound roadway opened to traffic on december 10 1990 at an approximate cost of 89 3 million about in dollars in 1992 during construction process mastodon bones and stone hammers were found items were dated to be older than 120 000 years old and may be some of earliest signs of human settlement in north america other animal bones were found at site near reo drive in national city including those of a bison a camel a gopher and horses westbound roadway was completed in july 1992 later developments thumb right sr 94 westbound at eastern intersection with sr 54 expressway portion east of i 805 to south worthington street was upgraded to a freeway in late 1990s and an hov lane opened in each direction east of i 805 only first part from i 805 to near woodman street was finished in november 1993 second part was to begin construction phase in 1994 this was complete by 1998 state legislature allowed for relinquishment of sr 54 from el cajon city limit to i 8 to city of el cajon in 1999 and transfer took place that year remaining expressway portion of sr 54 was replaced by a freeway in two phases in late 1990s and 2000s first phase corresponded with construction of sr 125 north of jamacha boulevard to sr 94 construction began in 1996 and was completed in 2003 second phase consisted of construction of sr 125 toll road and opened on november 19 2007 while california transportation ventures owned franchise on tolled portion of sr 125 interchange with sr 54 was constructed with 160 million about in dollars of public finances from 2005 to 2007 of rock were blasted through in 160 separate explosions to allow for interchange to be built project to convert hov lanes to regular mixed traffic lanes was authorized in 2006 caltrans determined that lack of space for law enforcement to pull over carpool lane violators as well as a missing barrier that separated hov lanes from regular traffic made lanes less effective as of october 2014 caltrans had considered relinquishing eastern part of sr 54 from sr 94 junction up to el cajon city limits to county of san diego two years later ctc approved a caltrans proposal to revoke proposed freeway status of unconstructed portion of sr 54 since jamacha boulevard and other existing roads would be able to handle projected traffic load this would allow unused land to be sold major intersections see also
