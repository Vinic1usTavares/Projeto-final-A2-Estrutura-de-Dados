tried in an ecclesiastical court proceeding which is forced by english occupation government english wish to quickly condemn and execute joan since english soldiers are afraid to fight while she remains alive based on their belief that she could supernaturally affect battles even while in prison bishop cauchon expresses his fear of wrongfully executing someone who might have received visions from god about to be burned for heresy joan is distraught that she will be executed without making a final confession bishop tells her she must recant her visions before he can hear her confession

jovovich as joan of arc john malkovich as charles vii of france faye dunaway as yolande of aragon dustin hoffman as conscience andrew birkin as john talbot vincent cassel as gilles de rais pascal greggory as john ii duke of alencon richard ridings as la hire desmond harrington as jean d aulon timothy west as pierre cauchon gina mckee as duchess of bedford as jean de joseph malerba as beaurevoir s guard vincent regan as buck themes luc besson stated that he was not interested in narrating history of joan of arc rather he wanted to pull a message out of history that is relevant for today besson states that in order to achieve this he stepped away from factual narrative of 15th century instead trying to get behind exterior envelope and into both emotional effect and affect of joan in book films of luc besson susan hayward interprets this as meaning besson sought to follow joan emotionally revealing her doubts and demonstrating that one cannot return intact from experience of war as medievalist gwendolyn morgan observes joan s sanity is a continuing theme throughout film beginning with priest questioning her as a child and ending with her conversations with conscience in film s final scenes scholars view conscience as providing a postmodern explanation of joan s visions at time that joan lived her voices and visions would not have been doubted john writing in book a knight at movies stated filmmakers invented conscience to satisfy a modern audience that is aware of mental illness film was also said to have feminist undercurrents after joan witnesses rape of her sister her crusade is said to become a fight against male domination and abuse of women writing in nickolas haydock also considered witnessing of her sister s murder and rape to be an alternate psychological motivation for joan to want to fight english rather than just her visions haydock also considered a theme in film to be inability of church to fulfill individual spiritual needs this is said to be shown through many of joan s encounters with church as a girl she is scolded for going to confession too often denied communion and forced to sneak into church to take it herself and during her trial where she is denied confession until conscience confesses her instead writing in studies in medievalism xiii christa considered anti intellectualism to be present in messenger joan admits to not knowing how to read or write and has not received any formal education military or otherwise yet triumphs over those who have haydock commented that joan possesses a quick wit which she uses against unrelenting accusatory questions provided by her intellectual superiors during trial joan also manages to triumph in battle where those with more experience and knowledge could not made especially apparent by her use of a siege weapon backward to force open a gate production luc besson was originally hired as executive producer for a film that was to be directed by kathryn bigelow bigelow had been developing ideas for a joan of arc film for about a decade her film was to be entitled company of angels with jay cocks hired to write script film was to be made with besson s assistance and financial backing in july 1996 contracts between bigelow and besson were exchanged which gave besson right to be consulted on casting in addition to his personal fee according to bigelow eight weeks prior to filming besson realised that his then wife milla jovovich was not going to be cast as joan and he subsequently withdrew his support from film and with it support of his financial backers bigelow threatened legal action for breach of contract and stealing her research matter was settled out of court after besson left he commenced production of his own joan of arc project messenger with jovovich given lead role production of company of angels disbanded shortly thereafter messenger was intended to follow up success besson and jovovich achieved with their previous collaboration fifth element filming took place in czech republic a stuntman died in an accident during first weeks of filming besson was said to have become completely uncommunicative after incident only appearing on set to shout orders at people soundtrack soundtrack for film was composed by eric serra and released as an album via sony music entertainment it was serra s eighth collaboration with director luc besson having composed soundtracks for seven of besson s previous films including la femme nikita and leon professional album runs for about 64 minutes and some form of music is playing during about 90 percent of film commentators noted change in serra s work which had traditionally relied heavily on synthesizer effects messenger on other hand is a primarily orchestral score as justified by film s historical context though synthesized effects are still used in some tracks writing in films of luc besson mark brownrigg stated serra s score completed his evolution from pop score writer to orchestral film composer serra s previous score for fifth element had also used orchestral elements they gave a favourable review of score though criticised music that is heard during joan s death describing it as an unimaginative paraphrasing of carmina burana heather phares from allmusic gave album 3 out of 5 stars stating it combines orchestral rock and electronic elements for a sweeping cinematic experience dan goldwasser from soundtrack net gave soundtrack 4 out of 5 stating it was very satisfying to listen to though he expressed disappointment with absence on soundtrack of a particular piece of music present during joan s discussion with conscience historical accuracy scene in which joan witnesses her sister s murder and posthumous rape by english soldiers in their village is entirely a fictional construction joan and her family fled their village before it was attacked and it was actually attacked by burgundians not english in film joan is seen experiencing visions as a young child when historical joan asserted that these visions began around age of 13 joan is also seen finding her sword in a field as a child whereas historically it was uncovered many years later on her journey to chinon hayward credits besson with showing collaboration between burgundians and english more accurately than previous filmmakers many lines during scenes of joan s trial are taken verbatim from joan s real trial transcript joan is shown receiving both wounds she was given in real life an arrow above breast and later an arrow to leg and film includes some of 15th century accounts associated with joan such as being able to pick out charles vii from among a group of his courtiers at chinon examining of joan s virginity was a real test joan had to complete to prove her merit release box office film grossed us 14 276 317 in us plus 52 700 000 from rest of world for a combined gross of 66 976 317 critical response messenger received mixed to negative reviews on rotten tomatoes film has a score of 30 based on reviews from 73 critics with consensus heavy handed narrative collapses under its own weight at metacritic film holds a score of 54 based on 33 reviews indicating mixed or average reception roger ebert gave film 2 out of 4 stars stating movie is a mess a gassy costume epic with nobody at center ebert stated film may have been educational for test audience participants who wrote why does she have to die at end on their evaluation cards in a review entitled vivid action can t save miscast joan todd mccarthy praised film s action scenes and technical aspects including thierry arbogast s cinematography though overall gave a negative review he criticised casting of jovovich stating only thing she brought to film was her strikingly tall and skinny physicality which is not exactly how one has been led to picture joan ron wells from film threat however gave film four out of five stars also praising action scenes wells stated that film s main strength was its adult ambiguities and relationships its decision not to portray joan as a super hero but rather to let audience decide whether she was a prophet or merely bipolar concluding this film as most things that involve religion is better understood if you learn not to take everything so literally accolades messenger was nominated for
