banksia petiolaris is a species of flowering plant of family proteaceae native to western australia where it is found in sandy soils in south coastal regions from munglinup east to israelite bay it was first described by victorian state botanist ferdinand von mueller in 1864 and no subspecies are recognised b petiolaris is one of several closely related species that all grow as prostrate shrub with horizontal stems and thick leathery upright leaves those of this species can be viable for up to 13 years longest lived of any flowering plant recorded it bears yellow cylindrical flower spikes known as inflorescences up to high in spring as spikes age they turn grey and develop up to 20 woody seed pods known as follicles each insects such as bees wasps and ants pollinate flowers b petiolaris is nonlignotuberous meaning that it regenerates by seed after bushfire b petiolaris adapts readily to cultivation growing in well drained sandy soils in sunny locations it is suitable for rockeries and as a groundcover description banksia petiolaris is a prostrate shrub that can spread to a diameter of its thick stems grow horizontally on ground and are covered in fine hair new growth is more densely covered with velvety orange brown hair large leathery upright leaves arise vertically on petioles up to high upper surface faces north and is inclined at around 15 degrees off vertical leaf blades can reach in length and wide they are dull green with serrated margins and a white undersurface dead leaves remain on plant flowering occurs in late spring cylindrical inflorescences are yellow in overall colour and range from high as flower spikes age they fade to a greyish colour old flowers persisting up to 20 woody seed pods known as follicles may appear on each spike covered with a fine grey fur they are elliptical in shape and measure in length and in width obovate egg shaped seed is long and fairly flattened it is composed of triangular seed body containing embryonic plant measuring long by wide and a papery wing one side designated outer surface is deeply pitted and other is brown and smooth seeds are separated by a sturdy dark brown seed separator that is roughly same shape as seeds with a depression where seed body sits adjacent to it in follicle first pair of leaves produced by seedlings known as cotyledons are cuneate wedge shaped and measure long by wide they are dull green with a faint net like pattern auricle at base of cotyledon leaf is pointed and measures long first pair of leaves to appear after cotyledons are long and oval in shape with 2 3 lobes or teeth on each side next set are long with 7 10 teeth b petiolaris is fairly uniform across its range though plants may vary in leaf size its yellow flower spikes and white leaf undersurface distinguish it from other prostrate banksias taxonomy thumb right typical prostrate shrub habit banksia petiolaris was first described by victorian state botanist ferdinand von mueller in 1864 its specific name latin for with petioles referring to species long petioles type specimen was most likely collected in 1861 by g maxwell between cape le grand and cape arid and is housed in melbourne george bentham published a thorough revision of banksia in his landmark publication flora australiensis in 1870 in his arrangement bentham defined four sections based on leaf style and pollen presenter characteristics b petiolaris was placed in section cyrtostylis a group of species which did not fit easily into one of other sections no further subspecies or varieties of b petiolaris have been described and it has no taxonomic synonyms its only nomenclatural synonym is sirmuellera petiolaris f muell kuntze which arose from otto kuntze s unsuccessful 1891 attempt to transfer banksia into new name sirmuellera retrieved 27 march 2018 in his 1981 monograph on genus australian botanist alex george placed b petiolaris in b subgenus banksia because its inflorescence is a typical banksia flower spike shape in b section banksia because of its straight styles and banksia series prostratae because of its prostrate habit along with five other closely related species george held it to be most closely related to b blechnifolia in 1996 botanists kevin thiele and pauline ladiges published an arrangement informed by a cladistic analysis of morphological characteristics their arrangement maintained b petiolaris in b subg banksia and series prostratae they found it to be basal earliest offshoot to other prostrate banksias questioning emphasis on cladistics in thiele and ladiges arrangement george published a slightly modified version of his 1981 arrangement in his 1999 treatment of banksia for flora of australia series of monographs placement of b petiolaris in george s 1999 arrangement may be summarised as follows right thumb in bud cultivated in sydney right thumb foliage banksia b subg banksia b sect banksia b ser salicinae 11 species 7 subspecies b ser

subspecies 11 varieties b subg isostylis 3 species since 1998 american botanist austin mast has been publishing results of ongoing cladistic analyses of dna sequence data for subtribe banksiinae which includes banksia with respect to b petiolaris mast s results have some semblance to george and thiele s it is somewhat basal in a group with other prostrate species as well as species in series tetragonae and b elderiana b baueri and b lullfitzii however b repens b chamaephyton and b blechnifolia form a closely knit group within this group and overall inferred phylogeny is very different from george s arrangement early in 2007 mast and thiele initiated a rearrangement of banksiinae by publishing several new names including subgenus spathulatae for species of banksia that have spoon shaped cotyledons in this way they also redefined autonym b subgenus banksia they have not yet published a full arrangement but if their nomenclatural changes are taken as an interim arrangement then b petiolaris is placed in subgenus banksia in a 2013 cladistics study evolutionary scientists marcell cardillo and pratt found that its closest relative is b brevidentata distribution and habitat endemic to western australia banksia petiolaris is found near state s south coast from vicinity of munglinup east to israelite bay concentrated in two disjunct ranges an eastern one around cape arid national park and western one east of scaddan it is found in white sandy soils in kwongan or mallee heathland but sometimes occurs with taller b speciosa it is often locally common with many populations over 100 plants in size pp 186 87 ecology like many plants in australia s southwest banksia petiolaris is adapted to an environment in which bushfire events are relatively frequent most banksia species can be placed in one of two broad groups according to their response to fire reseeders are killed by fire but fire also triggers release of their canopy seed bank thus promoting recruitment of next generation resprouters survive fire resprouting from a lignotuber or more rarely epicormic buds protected by thick bark b petiolaris and related b blechnifolia are in former category rapid growing plants killed by bushfire and regenerating by seed while other prostrate species are slow growing resprouters like other banksias b petiolaris plays host to a variety of pollinators insects such as bees wasps and ants were all recorded in 1988 banksia atlas survey an assessment of potential impact of climate change on this species found that its range is likely to contract by between 30 and 80 by 2080 depending on severity of change many of its western populations are found on road verges rendering them vulnerable to resurfacing or widening of roadways it does however show little susceptibility to soil borne water mould phytophthora cinnamomi unlike many western australian banksias banksia petiolaris has longest lived leaves of any flowering plant so far recorded a study published in 1992 recorded a lifespan of up to 13 years for a single leaf while leaves of 10 years of age ably maintained their ability to photosynthesize compared with young leaves authors concluded that leaf longevity is advantageous in plants in nutrient poor soils as loss of valuable nutrients in leaf loss is minimised leaves store much of a plants nutrients cultivation b petiolaris is grown fairly commonly in australian gardens making an attractive prostrate groundcover or rockery plant it can also be grown on embankments to reduce soil erosion although somewhat resistant to dieback it does require a well drained soil preferably fairly sandy like other banksias it grows best in full sun it is tolerant of alkaline soils with one cultivated specimen recorded tolerating a ph of 9 5 seeds do not require any treatment and take about 18 to 49 days to germinate references external links petiolaris category eudicots of western australia category garden plants
