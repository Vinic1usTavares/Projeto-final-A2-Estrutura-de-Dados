thumb right image of an upper tropospheric cyclonic vortex in western north pacific a cold core low a cold core low also known as an upper level low or cold core cyclone is a cyclone aloft which has an associated cold pool of air residing at high altitude within earth s troposphere without a frontal structure it is a low pressure system that strengthens with height in accordance with thermal wind relationship if a weak surface circulation forms in response to such a feature at subtropical latitudes of eastern north pacific or north indian oceans it is called a subtropical cyclone cloud cover and rainfall mainly occurs with these systems during day severe weather such as tornadoes can occur near center of cold core lows cold lows can help spawn cyclones with significant weather impacts such as polar lows and karman vortices cold lows can lead directly to development of tropical cyclones owing to their associated cold pool of air aloft or by acting as additional outflow channels to aid in further development thumb right an upper tropospheric cyclonic vortex in western north pacific showing high level cloud tops being sucked in characteristics thumb left vertical variation of geostrophic wind in a barotropic atmosphere a and in a baroclinic atmosphere b blue portion of surface denotes a cold region while orange portion denotes a warm region cold cyclones are stronger aloft than at earth s surface or stronger in areas of troposphere with lower pressures per thermal wind relationship and hypsometric equation hypsometric equation dictates that colder atmospheres have less room between pressure surfaces which corresponds to concept of lower atmospheric thickness and thermal wind relation indicates that in this situation wind increases with height it also means that an isolated pool of cold air aloft is associated with feature because of its cold center center shows an area of thickness minimum since temperature at any given radius is similar and parallel to orientation of pressure gradient and therefore wind it is barotropic in nature movement of cold core cyclones can be erratic since they are separated from main belt of westerlies which would otherwise steer them progressively to east most cloud cover and precipitation in association with cold lows occurs during daylight hours as sunlight warms earth s surface destabilizing atmosphere and causing upward vertical motion development of severe weather particularly tornadoes can occur near center of these systems over land during any season of year during winter when cold core lows with temperatures in mid levels of troposphere reach move over open waters deep convection forms which allows polar low development to become possible importance to cyclones within subtropics and mid latitudes thumb right november 4 1995 kona low kona lows most extratropical cyclones and tropical upper tropospheric cyclones are cold core lows in eastern half of north pacific ocean and north indian ocean formation of a weak circulation underneath a mid to upper tropospheric low which has cut off from main belt of westerlies during cold season winter is called a subtropical cyclone in case of north indian ocean formation of this type of vortex leads to onset of monsoon rains during wet season s 1991 climate dynamics of tropics springer pp 244 retrieved on 2009 02 29 east coast lows form

existing area of high pressure those offshore east coast of united states which normally form in months between october and april are termed nor easters not initially associated with weather fronts they form in tandem with blocking anticyclones at higher latitudes which leads to a slow poleward movement up sst gradient east coast lows can persist for up to a week some east coast lows develop

tropospheric trough in southern hemisphere lies over trade wind region of east central pacific and can cause tropical cyclogenesis offshore central america in western pacific tropical upper tropospheric lows are main cause for few tropical cyclones which develop north of 20th parallel north and east of 160th meridian east during la nina events trailing upper cyclones and upper troughs can cause additional outflow channels and aid in intensification process of tropical cyclones developing tropical disturbances can help create or deepen upper troughs or upper lows in their wake due to outflow jet stream emanating from developing tropical disturbance cyclone in western north pacific there are strong reciprocal relationships between areas of formative tropical cyclones and that of lower tropospheric monsoon troughs and tropical upper tropospheric trough tropical cyclone movement can also be influenced by tutt cells within of their position which can lead to non climatological tracks such as eastward movement within tropics or westward movement in an area where westerlies normally dominate normally an ocean temperature of 26 5 degc 79 7 degf spanning through a depth of at least is one of six requirements needed to maintain special mesocyclone that is tropical cyclone cooler air temperatures at a higher altitude e g at 500 hpa level or 5 9 km can lead to tropical cyclogenesis at lower water temperatures than normal as a certain lapse rate is required to force atmosphere to be unstable enough for convection in a moist atmosphere this lapse rate is 6 5 degc km 19 degf mi while in an atmosphere with less than 100 relative humidity required lapse rate is 9 8 degc km 29 degf mi a recent example of a tropical cyclone that maintained itself over cooler waters was alex of 2016 atlantic hurricane season which became a hurricane over waters at only at 500 hpa level air temperature averages 7 degc 18 degf within tropics but air in tropics is normally dry at this level giving air room to wet bulb or cool as it moistens to a more favorable temperature that can then support convection a wetbulb temperature at 500 hpa in a tropical atmosphere of is required to initiate convection if water temperature is and this temperature requirement increases or decreases proportionally by 1 degc in sea surface temperature for each 1 degc change at 500 hpa under a cold cyclone 500 hpa temperatures can fall as low as which can initiate convection even in driest atmospheres this also explains why moisture in mid levels of troposphere roughly at 500 hpa level is normally a requirement for development however when dry air is found at same height temperatures at 500 hpa need to be even colder as dry atmospheres require a greater lapse rate for instability than moist atmospheres at heights near tropopause 30 year average temperature as measured in period encompassing 1961 through 1990 was 77 degc 132 degf references category meteorological phenomena category
