thumb one of four doorways leading to vatadage polonnaruwa vatadage is an ancient structure dating back to kingdom of polonnaruwa of sri lanka it is believed to have been built during reign of parakramabahu i to hold relic of tooth of buddha or during reign of nissanka malla of polonnaruwa to hold alms bowl used by buddha both these venerated relics would have given structure a great significance and importance at time located within ancient city of polonnaruwa it is best preserved example of a vatadage in country and has been described as ultimate development of this type of architecture abandoned for several centuries excavation work at polonnaruwa vatadage began in 1903 built for protection of a small stupa structure has two stone platforms decorated with elaborate stone carvings lower platform is entered through a single entrance facing north while second platform can be accessed through four doorways facing four cardinal points upper platform surrounded by a brick wall contains stupa four buddha statues are seated around it each facing one of entrances three concentric rows of stone columns had also been positioned here presumably to support a wooden roof entire structure is decorated with stone carvings some of carvings at polonnaruwa vatadage such as its sandakada pahanas are considered to be best examples of such architectural features although some archaeologists have suggested that it also had a wooden roof this theory is disputed by others history thumb polonnaruwa vatadage as seen today theories vary among archaeologists and historians regarding who built polonnaruwa vatadage and when one such theory suggests that it was built by parakramabahu i during his reign in 12th century culavamsa an ancient chronicle mentions that he built a circular stone shrine to hold tooth relic of buddha archaeologist harry charles purvis bell believed that this shrine is polonnaruwa vatadage this is contradicted by several ancient sources of island including and which mention that it was built by nissanka malla however according to studies of arthur maurice nissanka malla only renovated an already existing building and made some additions such as entrance and outer porch wilhelm geiger who translated ancient mahavamsa and historian h w codrington both agree with this theory amarasinghe 1998 p 55 a nearby stone inscription set by nissanka malla lists vatadage among his constructions in this he claims that it was built by one of his generals under his own direction amarasinghe 1998 p 56 a unique feature of architecture of ancient sri lanka vatadages were built for protection of small stupas that had an important relic enshrined in them or were built on hallowed ground siriweera 2004 p 285 if polonnaruwa vatadage is shrine built by parakramabahu i relic of tooth of buddha would have been enshrined within it another possibility is that alms bowl used by buddha may have been enshrined here both these relics were important objects in ancient sri lankan culture and would have made polonnaruwa vatadage one of most significant and venerated buildings in country siriweera 2004 p 249 kingdom of polonnaruwa ended in 1215 with an invasion from south india siriweera 2004 p 60 polonnaruwa vatadage appears to have been abandoned with fall of kingdom and there is no mention of it in chronicles in later periods it was not until 1903 that department of archaeology began excavation work at site under bell who noted that it was only a mound of earth at time location and appearance thumb layout of polonnaruwa vatadage with outer circle indicating lower platform and second circle indicating upper platform stupa surrounded by four statues as well as three concentric rows of stone columns are located in upper platform which is accessed through four entrances polonnaruwa vatadage is located in a quadrangular area known as dalada maluva in ancient city of polonnaruwa dalada maluva contains some of oldest and most sacred monuments of city prematilleke and karunaratne 2004 p 10 polonnaruwa vatadage which occupies most of south western area of it is a prominent structure among them prematilleke and karunaratne 2004 p 12 it is best preserved example of a vatadage in country and is somewhat similar in design to those belonging to anuradhapura period especially and amarasinghe 1998 p 58 building has been built around a small stupa with a base diameter of vatadage has two levels lower platform and raised upper platform that contains stupa upper platform is in diameter and lower one lower platform is from ground level and upper platform is from lower basnayake 1986 p 51 circular lower platform is entered through a single entrance on northern side four elaborately constructed doorways lead from it to upper platform which is surrounded by a brick wall on its edge these entrances are oriented to four cardinal directions center of this platform is occupied by stupa which has four buddha statues seated around it each facing one of entrances sarachchandra 1977 p 118 each of these statues are high and are seated on stone seats with a height of each basnayake 1986 p 45 three concentric rows of stone columns had existed on upper platform two of these rows of which nothing remain were within brick wall while third row is just outside it inner row had consisted of 16 columns middle row of 20 and outer row of 32 existing stone columns of outer ring are about in height architecture and stonemasonry thumb left a sandakada pahana at one of entrances employing citizens in construction and repairing works was done in ancient sri lanka as a form of tax payment such labour may also have been used in construction of polonnaruwa vatadage however quality of works indicate that most of task may have been carried out by skilled craftsmen siriweera 2004 p 95 architecture of vatadage type structures was at its peak during polonnaruwa period and polonnaruwa vatadage is considered to be its ultimate development some of most striking features of structure are its elaborate stone carvings sandakada pahana moonstone at northern entrance and two guard stone at eastern entrance are considered to be best examples of such architectural features belonging to polonnaruwa period these elements were commonly placed at entrances to monastic buildings of ancient sri lanka and historians believe that sandakada pahanas depict cycle of samsara in buddhism sarachchandra 1977 p 129 according to bell carvings on sides of upper platform are unrivalled whether at anuradhapura or polonnaruwa and probably in any other buddhist shrine of ceylon 1974 p 151 straight symmetrical stone columns found in polonnaruwa vatadage are quite similar to those seen in buildings of anuradhapura period foot of each column is carved in shape of a lotus flower archaeologist senarath paranavithana has suggested that these stone columns had supported a wooden roof this is widely accepted and nails and roof tiles found in excavations seem to support this however another theory is that vatadage did not have a roof and stone columns were used to hang lamps curtains or buddhist symbols seneviratna and polk 1992 p 64 thumb one of buddha statues on upper platform positioned next to stupa brick wall is visible on background brick wall around platform is in a considerably preserved state as well although parts of it have broken off it is quite thick and was presumably constructed to protect stupa from sides there is evidence that inner surface of wall had been adorned with paintings its lower portion is covered by stone panels with carvings of a flower design below wall side of upper platform itself is decorated with carvings as is side of lower platform sarachchandra 1977 p 119 four buddha statues which depict dhyana mudra are also carved from solid rock two of them are more or less intact today while only parts of other two remain stupa in middle appears to have been of bubble shaped design commonly seen in sri lanka upper part has been destroyed and only dome shaped lower part now remains however it has only two rings found at base of stupas rather than traditional three basnayake 1986 p 44 see also
