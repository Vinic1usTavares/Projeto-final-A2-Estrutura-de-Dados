of memory in modernity in crisis palgrave macmillan new york pp 7 42 19 doi https doi org 10 1057 satirist and millar paul of samosata zenobia and aurelian church local culture and political allegiance in third century syria journal of roman studies vol 61 1971 pp 1 17 who is best known for his characteristic tongue in cheek style with which he frequently ridiculed superstition religious practices and belief in paranormal although his native language was probably syriac all of his extant works are written entirely in ancient greek mostly in atticized dialect popular during second sophistic period everything that is known about lucian s life comes from his own writings which are often difficult to interpret because of his extensive use of sarcasm according to his oration dream he was son of a lower middle class family from village of samosata along banks of euphrates in remote roman province of syria as a young man he was apprenticed to his uncle to become a sculptor but after a failed attempt at sculpting he ran away to pursue an education in ionia he may have become a travelling lecturer and visited universities throughout roman empire after acquiring fame and wealth through his teaching lucian finally settled down in athens for a decade during which he wrote most of his extant works in his old age he may have been appointed as a highly paid government official in egypt after which point he disappears from historical record lucian s works were wildly popular in antiquity and more than eighty writings attributed to him have survived to present day a considerably higher quantity than for most other classical writers his most famous work is a true story a tongue in cheek satire against authors who tell incredible tales which is regarded by some as earliest known work of science fiction lucian invented genre of comic dialogue a parody of traditional platonic dialogue his dialogue lover of lies makes fun of people who believe in supernatural and contains oldest known version of sorcerer s apprentice lucian wrote numerous satires making fun of traditional stories about gods including dialogues of gods icaromenippus zeus rants zeus catechized and parliament of gods his dialogues of dead focuses on cynic philosophers diogenes and menippus philosophies for sale and banquet or lapiths make fun of various philosophical schools and fisherman or dead come to life is a defense of this mockery lucian often ridiculed public figures such as cynic philosopher peregrinus proteus in his letter passing of peregrinus and fraudulent oracle alexander of abonoteichus in his treatise alexander false prophet lucian s treatise on syrian goddess satirizes cultural distinctions between greeks and syrians and is main source of information about cult of atargatis lucian had an enormous wide ranging impact on western literature works inspired by his writings include sir thomas more s utopia works of francois rabelais william shakespeare s timon of athens and jonathan swift s gulliver s travels life biographical sources lucian is not mentioned in any contemporary texts or inscriptions written by others and he is not included in philostratus s lives of sophists as a result of this everything that is known about lucian comes exclusively from his own writings a variety of characters with names very similar to lucian including lucius and syrian appear throughout lucian s writings these have been frequently interpreted by scholars and biographers as masks alter egos or mouthpieces of author daniel s richter criticizes frequent tendency to interpret such lucian like figures as self inserts by author and argues that they are in fact merely fictional characters lucian uses to think with when satirizing conventional distinctions between greeks and syrians he suggests that they are primarily a literary trope used by lucian to deflect accusations that he as syrian author has somehow outraged purity of greek idiom or genre through his invention of comic dialogue british classicist donald russell states a good deal of what lucian says about himself is no more to be trusted than voyage to moon that he recounts so persuasively in first person in true stories and warns that it is foolish to treat information he gives about himself in his writings as autobiography background and upbringing lucian was born in town of samosata located on banks of euphrates river on far eastern outskirts of roman empire samosata had been capital of commagene until 72 ad when it was annexed by vespasian and became part of roman province of syria population of town was mostly syrian and lucian s native tongue was probably syriac a form of aramaic during time when lucian lived traditional greco roman religion was in decline and its role in society had become largely ceremonial as a substitute for traditional religion many people in hellenistic world joined mystery cults such as mysteries of isis mithraism cult of cybele and eleusinian mysteries superstition had always been common throughout ancient society but it was especially prevalent during second century most educated people of lucian s time adhered to one of various hellenistic philosophies of which major ones were stoicism platonism and epicureanism every major town had its own university and these universities often employed professional travelling lecturers who were frequently paid high sums of money to lecture about various philosophical teachings most prestigious center of learning was city of athens in greece which had a long intellectual history according to lucian s oration dream which classical scholar lionel casson states he probably delivered as an address upon returning to samosata at age of thirty five or forty after establishing his reputation as a great orator lucian s parents were lower middle class and his uncles owned a local statue making shop lucian s parents could not afford to give him a higher education so after he completed his elementary schooling lucian s uncle took him on as an apprentice and began teaching him how to sculpt lucian however soon proved to be poor at sculpting and ruined statue he had been working on his uncle beat him causing him to run off lucian fell asleep and experienced a dream in which he was being fought over by personifications of statuary and of culture he decided to listen to culture and thus sought out an education although dream has long been treated by scholars as a truthful autobiography of lucian its historical accuracy is questionable at best classicist simon swain calls it a fine but rather apocryphal version of lucian s education and karin calls it ironical richter argues that it is not autobiographical at all but rather a or playful literary work and a complicated meditation on a young man s acquisition of paideia i e education russell dismisses dream as entirely fictional noting we recall that socrates too started as sculptor and ovid s vision of elegy and tragedy amores 3 1 is all too similar to lucian s education and career thumb speculative portrayal of lucian taken from a seventeenth century engraving by william in lucian s double indictment personification of rhetoric delivers a speech in which she describes unnamed defendant who is described as a syrian author of transgressive dialogues at time she found him as a young man wandering in ionia in asia minor with no idea what he ought to do with himself she describes syrian at this stage in his career as still speaking in a barbarous manner and all but wearing a caftan in assyrian fashion rhetoric states that she took him in hand and gave him paideia scholars have long interpreted syrian in this work as lucian himself and taken this speech to mean that lucian ran away to ionia where he pursued his education richter however argues that syrian is not lucian himself but rather a literary device lucian uses to subvert literary and ethnic norms ionia was center of rhetorical learning at time most prestigious universities of rhetoric were in ephesus and smyrna but it is unlikely that lucian could have afforded to pay tuition at either of these schools it is not known how lucian obtained his education but somehow he managed to acquire an extensive knowledge of rhetoric as well as classical literature and philosophy lucian mentions in his dialogue fisherman that he had initially attempted to apply his knowledge of rhetoric and become a lawyer but that he had become disillusioned by deceitfulness of trade and resolved to become a philosopher instead lucian travelled across empire lecturing throughout greece italy and gaul in gaul lucian may have held a position as a highly paid government professor in around 160 lucian returned to ionia as a wealthy celebrity he visited samosata and stayed in east for several years he is recorded as having been in antioch in either 162 or 163 in around 165 he bought a house in athens and invited his parents to come live with him in city lucian must have married at some point during his travels because in one of his writings he mentions having a son at this point lucian lived in athens for around a decade during which time he gave up lecturing and instead devoted his attention to writing it was during this decade that lucian composed nearly all his most famous works lucian wrote exclusively in ancient greek eerdmans commentary on bible by james d g dunn john william rogerson p 1105 mainly in atticized dialect popular during second sophistic but on syrian goddess which is attributed to lucian is written in a highly successful imitation of herodotus s ionic dialect leading some scholars to believe that lucian may not be real author for unknown reasons lucian stopped writing around 175 and began travelling and lecturing again during reign of emperor commodus 180 192 ad aging lucian may have been appointed to a lucrative government position in egypt after this point he disappears from historical record entirely and nothing is known about his death views right thumb bust of epicurus an athenian philosopher whom lucian greatly admired lucian s philosophical views are difficult to categorize due to his persistent use of irony and sarcasm in fisherman lucian describes himself as a champion of philosophy and throughout his other writings he characterizes philosophy as a morally constructive discipline but he is critical of pseudo philosophers whom he portrays as greedy bad tempered sexually immoral hypocrites lucian was not a member of any of major philosophical schools in his philosophies for sale he makes fun of members of every school and in his he rejects all philosophical systems as contradictory and concludes that life is too short to determine which of them comes nearest to truth so best solution is to rely on common sense nonetheless at other times lucian writes approvingly of individual philosophies according to everett ferguson lucian was strongly influenced by cynics dream or cock timon misanthrope charon or inspectors and downward journey or tyrant all display cynic themes lucian was particularly indebted to menippus a cynic philosopher and satirist of third century bc lucian wrote an admiring biography of philosopher demonax who was a philosophical eclectic but whose ideology most closely resembled cynicism demonax s main divergence from cynics was that he did not disapprove of ordinary life paul turner observes that lucian s reads as a straightforward defense of cynicism but also remarks that lucian savagely ridicules cynic philosopher peregrinus in his passing of peregrinus lucian also greatly admired epicurus whom he describes in alexander false prophet as truly holy and prophetic later in same dialogue he praises a book written by epicurus what blessings that book creates for its readers and what peace tranquillity and freedom it engenders in them liberating them as it does from terrors and apparitions and portents from vain hopes and extravagant cravings developing in them intelligence and truth and truly purifying their understanding not with torches and i e sea onions and that sort of foolery but with straight thinking truthfulness and frankness according to turner although lucian makes fun of skeptic philosophers he displays a temperamental inclination towards that philosophy lucian was skeptical of oracles though he was by no means only person of his time to voice such skepticism lucian rejected belief in paranormal regarding it as superstition in his dialogue lover of lies he probably voices some of his own opinions through his character tychiades perhaps including declaration by tychiades that he does not believe in phantoms or ghosts because he has never seen such things tychiades however still professes belief in gods existence dinomachus in other words you do not believe in existence of gods since you maintain that cures cannot be wrought by use of holy names tychiades nay say not so my dear dinomachus i answered gods may exist and these things may yet be lies i respect gods i see cures performed by them i see their beneficence at work in restoring sick through medium of medical faculty and their drugs asclepius and his sons after him compounded soothing medicines and healed sick without lion s skin and field mouse process lucian lover of lies translated by h w and f g fowler lucian had a generally negative opinion of herodotus and his historiography which he viewed as faulty maxim that eyes are better witnesses than ears is echoed repeatedly throughout several of lucian s dialogues lucian was critical of stoicism and platonism because he regarded them as encouraging of superstition his nigrinus superficially appears to be a eulogy of platonism but may in fact be satirical or merely an excuse to ridicule roman society works over eighty works attributed to lucian have survived these works belong to a diverse variety of styles and genres and include comic dialogues rhetorical essays and prose fiction lucian s writings were targeted towards a highly educated upper class greek audience and make almost constant allusions to greek cultural history leading classical scholar r bracht branham to label lucian s highly sophisticated style comedy of tradition by time lucian s writings were rediscovered during renaissance most of works of literature referenced in them had been lost or forgotten making it difficult for readers of later periods to understand his works a true story thumb illustration from 1894

explanation that story is not at all true and that everything in it is in fact a complete and utter lie narrative begins with lucian and his fellow travelers journeying out past pillars of heracles blown off course by a storm they come to an island with a river of wine filled with fish and bears a marker indicating that heracles and dionysus have traveled to this point and trees that look like women shortly after leaving island they are caught up by a whirlwind and taken to moon where they find themselves embroiled in a full scale war between king of moon and king of sun over colonization of morning star both armies include bizarre hybrid lifeforms armies of sun win war by clouding over moon and blocking out sun s light both parties then come to a peace agreement lucian then describes life on moon and how it is different from life on earth after returning to earth adventurers are swallowed by a 200 mile long whale in whose belly they discover a variety of fish people whom they wage war against and triumph over they kill whale by starting a bonfire and escape by propping its mouth open next they encounter a sea of milk an island of cheese and island of blessed there lucian meets heroes of trojan war other mythical men and animals as well as homer and pythagoras they find sinners being punished worst of them being ones who had written books with lies and fantasies including herodotus and ctesias after leaving island of blessed they deliver a letter to calypso given to them by odysseus explaining that he wishes he had stayed with her so he could have lived eternally they then discover a chasm in ocean but eventually sail around it discover a far off continent and decide to explore it book ends abruptly with lucian stating that their future adventures will be described in upcoming sequels a promise which a disappointed scholiast described as biggest lie of all satirical dialogues in his double indictment lucian declares that his proudest literary achievement is invention of satirical dialogue which was modeled on earlier platonic dialogue but was comedic in tone rather than philosophical to his dialogues of courtesans suggests that lucian acted out his dialogues himself as part of a comedic routine lucian s dialogues of dead is a satirical work centering around cynic philosophers diogenes of sinope and his pupil menippus who lived modestly while they were alive and are now living comfortably in abysmal conditions of underworld while those who had lived lives of luxury are in torment when faced by same conditions dialogue draws on earlier literary precursors including nekyia in book xi of homer s odyssey but also adds new elements not found in them homer s nekyia describes transgressors against gods being punished for their sins but lucian embellished this idea by having cruel and greedy persons also be punished thumb upright 0 8 hermes messenger of gods is a major recurring character throughout many of lucian s dialogues in his dialogue lover of lies lucian satirizes belief in supernatural and paranormal through a framing story in which main narrator a skeptic named tychiades goes to visit an elderly friend named eukrates at eukrates s house he encounters a large group of guests who have recently gathered together due to eukrates suddenly falling ill other guests offer eukrates a variety of folk remedies to help him recover when tychiades objects that such remedies do not work others all laugh at him and try to persuade him to believe in supernatural by telling him stories which grow increasingly ridiculous as conversation progresses one of last stories they tell is sorcerer s apprentice which german playwright johann wolfgang von goethe later adapted into a famous ballad lucian frequently made fun of philosophers and no school was spared from his mockery in dialogue philosophies for sale lucian creates an imaginary slave market in which zeus puts famous philosophers up for sale including pythagoras diogenes heraclitus socrates chrysippus and pyrrho each of whom attempts to persuade customers to buy his philosophy in banquet or lapiths lucian points out hypocrisies of representatives from all major philosophical schools in fisherman or dead come to life lucian defends his other dialogues by comparing venerable philosophers of ancient times with their unworthy contemporary followers lucian was often particularly critical of people who pretended to be philosophers when they really were not and his dialogue runaways portrays an imposter cynic as antithesis of true philosophy his symposium is a parody of plato s symposium in which instead of discussing nature of love philosophers get drunk tell smutty tales argue relentlessly over whose school is best and eventually break out into a full scale brawl in icaromenippus cynic philosopher menippus fashions a set of wings for himself in imitation of mythical icarus and flies to heaven where he receives a guided tour from zeus himself dialogue ends with zeus announcing his decision to destroy all philosophers since all they do is bicker though he agrees to grant them a temporary reprieve until spring is a dialogue written in parallel to icaromenippus in which rather than flying to heaven menippus descends to underworld to consult prophet tiresias lucian wrote numerous dialogues making fun of traditional greek stories about gods his dialogues of gods consists of numerous short vignettes parodying a variety of scenes from greek mythology dialogues portray gods as comically weak and prone to all foibles of human emotion zeus in particular is shown to be a feckless ruler and a serial adulterer lucian also wrote several other works in a similar vein including zeus catechized zeus rants and parliament of gods throughout all his dialogues lucian displays a particular fascination with hermes messenger of gods who frequently appears as a major character in role of an intermediary who travels between worlds dialogues of courtesans is a collection of short dialogues involving various courtesans this collection is unique as one of only surviving works of greek literature to mention female homosexuality it is also unusual for mixing lucian s characters from other dialogues with stock characters from new comedy over half of men mentioned in dialogues of courtesans are also mentioned in lucian s other dialogues but almost all of courtesans themselves are characters borrowed from plays of menander and other comedic playwrights treatises and letters lucian s treatise alexander false prophet describes rise of alexander of abonoteichus a charlatan who claimed to be prophet of serpent god glycon though account is satirical in tone it seems to be a largely accurate report of glycon cult and many of lucian s statements about cult have been confirmed through archaeological evidence including coins statues and inscriptions lucian describes his own meeting with alexander in which he posed as a friendly philosopher but when alexander invited him to kiss his hand lucian bit it instead lucian reports that aside from himself only others who dared challenge alexander s reputation as a true prophet were epicureans whom he lauds as heroes and christians lucian s treatise on syrian goddess is a detailed description of cult of syrian goddess atargatis at hierapolis it is written in a faux ionic dialect and imitates ethnographic methodology of greek historian herodotus which lucian elsewhere derides as faulty for generations many scholars doubted authenticity of on syrian goddess because it seemed too genuinely reverent to have really been written by lucian more recently scholars have come to recognize book as satirical and have restored its lucianic authorship in treatise lucian satirizes arbitrary cultural distinctions between greeks and assyrians by emphasizing manner in which syrians have adopted greek customs and thereby effectively become greeks themselves anonymous narrator of treatise initially seems to be a greek sophist but as treatise progresses he reveals himself to actually be a native syrian scholars dispute whether treatise is an accurate description of syrian cultural practices because very little is known about hierapolis other than what is recorded in on syrian goddess itself coins minted in late fourth century bc municipal decrees from seleucid rulers and a late hellenistic relief carving have confirmed lucian s statement that city s original name was and that city was closely associated with cults of atargatis and hadad a jewish rabbi later listed temple at hierapolis as one of five most important pagan temples in near east macrobii long livers is an essay about famous philosophers who lived for many years it describes how long each of them lived and gives an account of each of their deaths in his treatises teacher of rhetoric and on salaried posts lucian criticizes teachings of master rhetoricians his treatise on dancing is a major source of information about greco roman dance in it he describes dance as an act of mimesis imitation and rationalizes myth of proteus as being nothing more than an account of a highly skilled egyptian dancer he also wrote about visual arts in portraits and on behalf of portraits lucian s biography of philosopher demonax eulogizes him as a great philosopher and portrays him as a hero of boldness of speech in his treatise how to write history lucian criticizes historical methodology used by writers such as herodotus and ctesias who wrote vivid and self indulgent descriptions of events they had never actually seen instead lucian argues that historian never embellish his stories and should place his commitment to accuracy above his desire to entertain his audience he also argues historian should remain absolutely impartial and tell events as they really happened even if they are likely to cause disapproval lucian names thucydides as a specific example of a historian who models these virtues in his satirical letter passing of peregrinus lucian describes death of controversial cynic philosopher peregrinus proteus who had publicly immolated himself on a pyre at olympic games of 165 ad letter is historically significant because it preserves one of earliest pagan evaluations of christianity in letter one of lucian s characters delivers a speech ridiculing christians for their perceived credulity and ignorance but he also affords them some level of respect on account of their morality speaker in letter also refers to jesus describing him as a crucified sophist who had lived in palestine just over a century prior and had taught that his followers would attain immortality in letter against ignorant book collector lucian ridicules common practice whereby near easterners collect massive libraries of greek texts for sake of appearing cultured but without actually reading any of them pseudo lucian some of writings attributed to lucian such as amores and ass are usually not considered genuine works of lucian and are normally cited under name of pseudo lucian ass is probably a summarized version of a story by lucian and contains largely same basic plot elements as golden ass or metamorphoses of apuleius but with fewer inset tales and a different ending amores is usually dated to third or fourth centuries based on stylistic grounds legacy renaissance and reformation thumb upright 1 3 right calumny of apelles by sandro botticelli based on a description of a painting by greek painter apelles of kos found in lucian s ekphrasis on calumny lucian s writings were mostly forgotten during middle ages suda a tenth century byzantine encyclopedia concludes that lucian s soul is burning in hell for his negative remarks about christians in passing of peregrinus lucian s writings were rediscovered during renaissance and almost immediately became popular with renaissance humanists by 1400 there were just as many latin translations of works of lucian as there were for writings of plato and plutarch by ridiculing plutocracy as absurd lucian helped facilitate one of renaissance humanism s most basic themes his dialogues of dead were especially popular and were widely used for moral instruction as a result of this popularity lucian s writings had a profound influence on writers from renaissance and early modern period many early modern european writers adopted lucian s lighthearted tone his technique of relating a fantastic voyage through a familiar dialogue and his trick of constructing proper names with deliberately humorous etymological meanings during protestant reformation lucian provided literary precedent for writers making fun of catholic clergy desiderius erasmus s encomium 1509 displays lucianic influences perhaps most notable example of lucian s impact was on fifteenth and sixteenth centuries was on french writer francois rabelais particularly in his set of five novels gargantua and pantagruel which was first published in 1532 rabelais also is thought to be responsible for a primary introduction of lucian to french renaissance and beyond through his translations of lucian s works jean rebelais works champion publishers 1909 pages 204 m a rebelais ithaca cornell press 1979 pages 7 11 lucian s true story inspired both sir thomas more s utopia 1516 and jonathan swift s gulliver s

several scenes from dialogues of dead christopher marlowe s famous verse was this face that launched a thousand ships and burnt topless towers of ilium is a paraphrase of a quote from lucian francis bacon called lucian a contemplative atheist early modern period thumb monument commemorating lucian of samosata from germany henry fielding author of history of tom jones a foundling 1749 owned a complete set of lucian s writings in nine volumes he deliberately imitated lucian in his journey from this world and into next and in life and death of jonathan wild great 1743 he describes lucian as almost like true father of humour and lists him alongside cervantes and jonathan swift as a true master of satire in convent garden journal fielding directly states in regard to lucian that he had modeled his style upon that very author nicolas boileau despreaux francois bernard le de fontenelle and voltaire all wrote adaptations of lucian s dialogues of dead according to turner voltaire s candide 1759 displays characteristically lucianic theme of refuting philosophical theory by reality voltaire also wrote conversation between lucian erasmus and rabelais in elysian fields a dialogue in which he treats lucian as one of his masters in strategy of intellectual revolution denis diderot drew inspiration from writings of lucian in his socrates gone mad or dialogues of diogenes of sinope 1770 and his conversations in elysium 1780 lucian appears as one of two speakers in diderot s dialogue peregrinus proteus 1791 which was based on passing of peregrinus lucian s true story inspired cyrano de bergerac whose writings later served as inspiration for jules verne german satirist christoph martin wieland was first person to translate complete works of lucian into german and he spent his entire career adapting ideas behind lucian s writings for a contemporary german audience david hume admired lucian as a very moral writer and quoted him with reverence when discussing ethics or religion hume read lucian s kataplous or downward journey when he was on his deathbed modern period kataplous or downward journey also served as source for friedrich nietzsche s concept of ubermensch or overman nietzsche s declaration of a new and super human way of laughing at expense of everything serious echoes exact wording of tiresias s final advice to eponymous hero of lucian s dialogue menippus laugh a great deal and take nothing seriously professional philosophical writers since then have generally ignored lucian but turner comments that perhaps his spirit is still alive in those who like bertrand russell are prepared to flavor philosophy with wit in late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries many classicists viewed lucian s works negatively and read them with preconceived ideas in mind about oriental character many of these ideas were influenced by contemporary antisemitism a reflexive and genteel form of which was common throughout english and german scholarly writings prior to world war ii german classicist eduard norden admitted that he had as a foolish youth wasted time reading works of lucian but as an adult had come to realize that lucian was nothing more than an oriental without depth or character who has no soul and degrades most soulful language rudolf helm one of leading scholars on lucian in early twentieth century labelled lucian as a thoughtless syrian who possesses none of soul of a tragedian and compared him to jewish german poet heinrich heine who was known as mockingbird in german poetry forest in his 1906 publication und helm argued that lucian s claims of generic originality especially his claim of having invented comic dialogue were actually lies intended to cover up his almost complete dependence on menippus whom he asserted was true inventor of genre lucian s syrian identity received renewed attention in early twenty first century as lucian became seen as what richter calls a sort of second sophistic answer to early twenty first century questions about cultural and ethnic hybridity richter states that postcolonial critics have come to embrace lucian as an early imperial paradigm of ethno cultural hybrid
