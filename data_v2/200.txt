asperger syndrome as also known as asperger s is a developmental disorder characterised by significant difficulties in social interaction and nonverbal communication along with restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior and interests as a milder autism spectrum disorder asd it differs from other asds by relatively normal language and intelligence although not required for diagnosis physical clumsiness and unusual use of language are common signs usually begin before two years of age and typically last for a person s entire life exact cause of asperger s is unknown while it is largely inherited underlying genetics have not been determined conclusively environmental factors are also believed to play a role brain imaging has not identified a common underlying condition in 2013 diagnosis of asperger s was removed from diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders dsm 5 and people with these symptoms are now included within autism spectrum disorder along with autism and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified pdd nos it remains within international classification of diseases icd 11 but as a subtype of autism spectrum disorder there is no single treatment and effectiveness of particular interventions is supported by only limited data treatment is aimed at improving poor communication skills obsessive or repetitive routines and physical clumsiness interventions may include social skills training cognitive behavioral therapy physical therapy speech therapy parent training and medications for associated problems such as mood or anxiety nih publication no 05 most children improve as they grow up but social and communication difficulties usually persist some researchers and people on autism spectrum have advocated a shift in attitudes toward view that autism spectrum disorder is a difference rather than a disease that must be treated or cured a preliminary freely readable draft with slightly different wording in quoted text is in in 2015 asperger s was estimated to affect 37 2 million people globally autism spectrum disorder affects males more often than females and females are typically diagnosed at a later age syndrome is named after austrian pediatrician hans asperger who in 1944 described children in his practice who lacked nonverbal communication skills had limited understanding of others feelings and were physically clumsy modern conception of asperger syndrome came into existence in 1981 and went through a period of popularization it became a standardized diagnosis in early 1990s many questions and controversies remain there is doubt about whether it is distinct from high functioning autism hfa partly because of this percentage of people affected is not firmly established classification extent of overlap between as and high functioning autism hfa autism unaccompanied by intellectual disability is unclear asd classification is to some extent an artifact of how autism was discovered and may not reflect true nature of spectrum methodological problems have beset asperger syndrome as a valid diagnosis from outset in fifth edition of diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders dsm 5 published in may 2013 as as a separate diagnosis was eliminated and folded into autism spectrum disorder like diagnosis of asperger syndrome change was controversial and as was not removed from who s icd 10 or icd 11 world health organization who defined asperger syndrome as as one of autism spectrum disorders asd or pervasive developmental disorders pdd which are a spectrum of psychological conditions that are characterized by abnormalities of social interaction and communication that pervade individual s functioning and by restricted and repetitive interests and behavior like other psychological development disorders asd begins in infancy or childhood has a steady course without remission or relapse and has impairments that result from maturation related changes in various systems of brain asd in turn is a subset of broader autism phenotype which describes individuals who may not have asd but do have autistic like traits such as social deficits of other four asd forms autism is most similar to as in signs and likely causes but its diagnosis requires impaired communication and allows delay in cognitive development rett syndrome and childhood disorder share several signs with autism but may have unrelated causes and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified pdd nos is diagnosed when criteria for a more specific disorder are unmet characteristics thumb people with asperger syndrome often display restricted or specialized interests such as this boy s interest in stacking cans alt a young boy is seen stacking several colorful cans on top of each other as a pervasive developmental disorder asperger syndrome is distinguished by a pattern of symptoms rather than a single symptom it is characterized by qualitative impairment in social interaction by stereotyped and restricted patterns of behavior activities and interests and by no clinically significant delay in cognitive development or general delay in language intense preoccupation with a narrow subject one sided verbosity restricted prosody and physical clumsiness are typical of condition but are not required for diagnosis suicidal behavior appears to occur at rates similar to those without asd social interaction a lack of demonstrated empathy affects aspects of communal living for persons with asperger syndrome individuals with as experience difficulties in basic elements of social interaction which may include a failure to develop friendships or to seek shared enjoyments or achievements with others for example showing others objects of interest a lack of social or emotional reciprocity social games give and take mechanic and impaired nonverbal behaviors in areas such as eye contact facial expression posture and gesture people with as may not be as withdrawn around others compared with those with other more debilitating forms of autism they approach others even if awkwardly for example a person with as may engage in a one sided long winded speech about a favorite topic while misunderstanding or not recognizing listener s feelings or reactions such as a wish to change topic of talk or end interaction this social awkwardness has been called active but odd such failures to react appropriately to social interaction may appear as disregard for other people s feelings and may come across as insensitive however not all individuals with as will approach others some of them may even display selective mutism not speaking at all to most people and excessively to specific others some may choose only to talk to people they like cognitive ability of children with as often allows them to articulate social norms in a laboratory context where they may be able to show a theoretical understanding of other people s emotions however they typically have difficulty acting on this knowledge in fluid real life situations people with as may analyze and distill their observations of social interaction into rigid behavioral guidelines and apply these rules in awkward ways such as forced eye contact resulting in a demeanor that appears rigid or socially naive childhood desire for companionship can become numbed through a history of failed social encounters violent or criminal behavior hypothesis that individuals with as are predisposed to violent or criminal behavior has been investigated but is not supported by data more evidence suggests that children diagnosed with asperger syndrome are victims rather than offenders a 2008 review found that an overwhelming number of reported violent criminals with asperger syndrome had also other coexisting psychotic psychiatric disorders such as disorder restricted and repetitive interests and behavior people with asperger syndrome can display behavior interests and activities that are restricted and repetitive and are sometimes abnormally intense or focused they may stick to inflexible routines move in stereotyped and repetitive ways preoccupy themselves with parts of objects or engage in compulsive behaviors like lining objects up to form patterns pursuit of specific and narrow areas of interest is one of most striking among possible features of as individuals with as may collect volumes of detailed information on a relatively narrow topic such as weather data or star names without necessarily having a genuine understanding of broader topic for example a child might memorize camera model numbers while caring little about photography this behavior is usually apparent by age 5 or 6 although these special interests may change from time to time they typically become more unusual and narrowly focused and often dominate social interaction so much that entire family may become immersed because narrow topics often capture interest of children this symptom may go unrecognized stereotyped and repetitive motor behaviors are a core part of diagnosis of as and other asds they include hand movements such as flapping or twisting and complex whole body movements these are typically repeated in longer bursts and look more voluntary or ritualistic than tics which are usually faster less rhythmical and less often symmetrical however in addition to this various studies have reported a consistent comorbidity between as and tourette syndrome in range of 8 20 with one figure as high as 80 for tics of some kind or another for which several explanations have been put forward including common genetic factors and dopamine glutamate or serotonin abnormalities according to adult asperger assessment aaa diagnostic test a lack of interest in fiction and a positive preference towards non fiction is common among adults with as speech and language although individuals with asperger syndrome acquire language skills without significant general delay and their speech typically lacks significant abnormalities language acquisition and use is often atypical abnormalities include verbosity abrupt transitions literal interpretations and miscomprehension of nuance use of metaphor meaningful only to speaker auditory perception deficits unusually pedantic formal or idiosyncratic speech and oddities in loudness pitch intonation prosody and rhythm echolalia has also been observed in individuals with as three aspects of communication patterns are of clinical interest poor prosody tangential and circumstantial speech and marked verbosity although inflection and intonation may be less rigid or monotonic than in classic autism people with as often have a limited range of intonation speech may be unusually fast jerky or loud speech may convey a sense of incoherence conversational style often includes monologues about topics that bore listener fails to provide context for comments or fails to suppress internal thoughts individuals with as may fail to detect whether listener is interested or engaged in conversation speaker s conclusion or point may never be made and attempts by listener to elaborate on speech s content or logic or to shift to related topics are often unsuccessful children with as may have a sophisticated vocabulary at a young age and such children have often been colloquially called little professors but have difficulty understanding figurative language and tend to use language literally children with as appear to have particular weaknesses in areas of language that include humor irony teasing and sarcasm although individuals with as usually understand cognitive basis of humor they seem to lack understanding of intent of humor to share enjoyment with others despite strong evidence of impaired humor appreciation anecdotal reports of humor in individuals with as seem to challenge some psychological theories of as and autism motor and sensory perception individuals with asperger syndrome may have signs or symptoms that are independent of diagnosis but can affect individual or family these include differences in perception and problems with motor skills sleep and emotions individuals with as often have excellent auditory and visual perception children with asd often demonstrate enhanced perception of small changes in patterns such as arrangements of objects or well known images typically this is domain specific and involves processing of fine grained features conversely compared with individuals with high functioning autism individuals with as have deficits in some tasks involving visual spatial perception auditory perception or visual memory many accounts of individuals with as and asd report other unusual sensory and perceptual skills and experiences they may be unusually sensitive or insensitive to sound light and other stimuli these sensory responses are found in other developmental disorders and are not specific to as or to asd there is little support for increased fight or flight response or failure of habituation in autism there is more evidence of decreased responsiveness to sensory stimuli although several studies show no differences hans asperger s initial accounts and other diagnostic schemes include descriptions of physical clumsiness children with as may be delayed in acquiring skills requiring dexterity such as riding a bicycle or opening a jar and may seem to move awkwardly or feel uncomfortable in their own skin they may be poorly coordinated or have an odd or bouncy gait or posture poor handwriting or problems with motor coordination they may show problems with proprioception sensation of body position on measures of developmental coordination disorder motor planning disorder balance tandem gait and finger thumb apposition there is no evidence that these motor skills problems differentiate as from other high functioning asds children with as are more likely to have sleep problems including difficulty in falling asleep frequent nocturnal awakenings and early morning awakenings as is also associated with high levels of alexithymia which is difficulty in identifying and describing one s emotions alexithymia and as although as lower sleep quality and alexithymia are associated with each other their causal relationship is unclear causes hans asperger described common traits among his patients family members especially fathers and research supports this observation and suggests a genetic contribution to asperger syndrome although no specific genetic factor has yet been identified multiple factors are believed to play a role in expression of autism given variability in symptoms seen in children evidence for a genetic link is tendency for as to run in families and an observed higher incidence of family members who have behavioral symptoms similar to as but in a more limited form for example slight difficulties with social interaction language or reading most behavioral genetic research suggests that all autism spectrum disorders have shared genetic mechanisms but as may have a stronger genetic component than autism there is probably a common group of genes in which particular alleles render an individual vulnerable to developing as if this is case particular combination of alleles would determine severity and symptoms for each individual with as a few asd cases have been linked to exposure to teratogens agents that cause birth defects during first eight weeks from conception although this does not exclude possibility that asd can be initiated or affected later it is strong evidence that asd arises very early in development many environmental factors have been hypothesized to act after birth but none has been confirmed by scientific investigation mechanism thumb alt monochrome fmri image of a horizontal cross section of a human brain a few regions mostly to rear are highlighted in orange and yellow functional magnetic resonance imaging provides some evidence for both underconnectivity and mirror neuron theories asperger syndrome appears to result from developmental factors that affect many or all functional brain systems as opposed to localized effects although specific underpinnings of as or factors that distinguish it from other asds are unknown and no clear pathology common to individuals with as has emerged it is still possible that as s mechanism is separate from other asds neuroanatomical studies and associations with teratogens strongly suggest that mechanism includes alteration of brain development soon after conception abnormal migration of embryonic cells during fetal development may affect final structure and connectivity of brain resulting in alterations in neural circuits that control thought and behavior several theories of mechanism are available none are likely to provide a complete explanation underconnectivity theory hypothesizes high level neural connections and synchronization along with an excess of low level processes it maps well to general processing theories such as weak central coherence theory which hypothesizes that a limited ability to see big picture underlies central disturbance in asd a related theory enhanced perceptual functioning focuses more on superiority of locally oriented and perceptual operations in autistic individuals mirror neuron system mns theory hypothesizes that alterations to development of mns interfere with imitation and lead to asperger s core feature of social impairment for example one study found that activation is delayed in core circuit for imitation in individuals with as this theory maps well to social cognition theories like theory of mind which hypothesizes that autistic behavior arises from impairments in ascribing mental states to oneself and others pdf or hyper which hypothesizes that autistic individuals can systematize internal operation to handle internal events but are less effective at empathizing when handling events generated by other agents diagnosis standard diagnostic criteria require impairment in social interaction and repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behavior activities and interests without significant delay in language or cognitive development unlike international standard dsm iv tr criteria also required significant impairment in day to day functioning dsm 5 eliminated as as a separate diagnosis in 2013 and folded it into umbrella of autism spectrum disorders other sets of diagnostic criteria have been proposed by szatmari et al and by gillberg and gillberg diagnosis is most commonly made between ages of four and eleven a comprehensive assessment involves a multidisciplinary team that observes across multiple settings and includes neurological and genetic assessment as well as tests for cognition psychomotor function verbal and nonverbal strengths and weaknesses style of learning and skills for independent living gold standard in diagnosing asds combines clinical judgment with autism diagnostic interview revised adi r a parent interview and autism diagnostic observation schedule a conversation and play based interview with child delayed or mistaken diagnosis can be traumatic for individuals and families for example misdiagnosis can lead to medications that worsen behavior and overdiagnosis may be problems cost and difficulty of screening and assessment can delay diagnosis conversely increasing popularity of drug treatment options and expansion of benefits has motivated providers to asd there are indications as has been diagnosed more frequently in recent years partly as a residual diagnosis for children of normal intelligence who are not autistic but have social difficulties there are questions about external validity of as diagnosis that is it is unclear whether there is a practical benefit in distinguishing as from hfa and from pdd nos same child can receive different diagnoses depending on screening tool debate about distinguishing as from hfa is partly due to a tautological dilemma where disorders are defined based on severity of impairment so that studies that appear to confirm differences based on severity are to be expected differential diagnosis many children with as are initially misdiagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder adhd diagnosing adults is more challenging as standard diagnostic criteria are designed for children and expression of as changes with age adult diagnosis requires painstaking clinical examination and thorough medical history gained from both individual and other people who know person focusing on childhood behavior conditions that must be considered in a differential diagnosis along with adhd include other asds schizophrenia spectrum personality disorders obsessive compulsive disorder major depressive disorder semantic pragmatic disorder nonverbal learning disorder social anxiety disorder tourette syndrome stereotypic movement disorder bipolar disorder social cognitive deficits due to brain damage from alcohol abuse and obsessive compulsive personality disorder screening parents of children with asperger syndrome can typically trace differences in their children s development to as early as 30 months of age developmental screening during a routine check up by a general practitioner or pediatrician may identify signs that warrant further investigation united states preventive services task force in 2016 found it was unclear if screening was beneficial or harmful among children in whom there are no concerns diagnosis of as is complicated by use of several different screening instruments including asperger syndrome diagnostic scale asds autism spectrum screening questionnaire childhood autism spectrum test cast previously called childhood asperger syndrome test cast has been renamed from childhood asperger syndrome test to childhood autism spectrum test reflecting removal of asperger s syndrome from dsm 5 gilliam asperger s disorder scale krug asperger s disorder index kadi and autism spectrum quotient aq with versions for children adolescents and adults none have been shown to reliably differentiate between as and other asds management asperger syndrome treatment attempts to manage distressing symptoms and to teach age appropriate social communication and vocational skills that are not naturally acquired during development with intervention tailored to needs of individual based on multidisciplinary assessment although progress has been made data supporting efficacy of particular interventions are limited therapies ideal treatment for as coordinates therapies that address core symptoms of disorder including poor communication skills and obsessive or repetitive routines while most professionals agree that earlier intervention better there is no single best treatment package as treatment resembles that of other high functioning asds except that it takes into account linguistic capabilities verbal strengths and nonverbal vulnerabilities of individuals with as a typical program generally includes applied behavior analysis aba procedures including positive behavior support pbs or training and support of parents and school faculty in behavior management strategies to use in home and school and social skills training for more effective interpersonal interactions cognitive behavioral therapy to improve stress management relating to anxiety or explosive emotions and to cut back on obsessive interests and repetitive routines medication for coexisting conditions such as major depressive disorder and anxiety disorders occupational or physical therapy to assist with poor sensory processing and motor coordination and social communication intervention which is specialized speech therapy to help with pragmatics and give and take of normal conversation of many studies on behavior based early intervention programs most are case reports of up to five participants and typically examine a few problem behaviors such as self injury aggression noncompliance stereotypies or spontaneous language unintended side effects are largely ignored despite popularity of social skills training its effectiveness is not firmly established a randomized controlled study of a model for training parents in problem behaviors in their children with as showed that parents attending a one day workshop or six individual lessons reported fewer behavioral problems while parents receiving individual lessons reported less intense behavioral problems in their as children vocational training is important to teach job interview etiquette and workplace behavior to older children and adults with as and organization software and personal data assistants can improve work and life management of people with as medications no medications directly treat core symptoms of as although research into efficacy of pharmaceutical intervention for as is limited it is essential to diagnose and treat comorbid conditions deficits in self identifying emotions or in observing effects of one s behavior on others can make it difficult for individuals with as to see why medication may be appropriate medication can be effective in combination with behavioral interventions and environmental accommodations in treating comorbid symptoms such as anxiety disorders major depressive disorder inattention and aggression atypical antipsychotic medications risperidone olanzapine and have been shown to reduce associated symptoms of as risperidone can reduce repetitive and self injurious behaviors aggressive outbursts and impulsivity and improve stereotypical patterns of behavior and social relatedness selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ssris fluoxetine and sertraline have been effective in treating restricted and repetitive interests and behaviors while stimulant medication such as methylphenidate can reduce inattention care must be taken with medications as side effects may be more common and harder to evaluate in individuals with as and tests of drugs effectiveness against comorbid conditions routinely exclude individuals from autism spectrum abnormalities in metabolism cardiac conduction times and an increased risk of type 2 diabetes have been raised as concerns with antipsychotic medications along with serious long term neurological side effects ssris can lead to manifestations of behavioral activation such as increased impulsivity aggression and sleep disturbance weight gain and fatigue are commonly reported side effects of risperidone which may also lead to increased risk for extrapyramidal symptoms such as restlessness and dystonia and increased serum prolactin levels sedation and weight gain are more common with olanzapine which has also been linked with diabetes sedative side effects in school age children have ramifications for classroom learning individuals with as may be unable to identify and communicate their internal moods and emotions or to tolerate side effects that for most people would not be problematic prognosis there is some evidence that children with as may see a lessening of symptoms up to 20 of children may no longer meet diagnostic criteria as adults although social and communication difficulties may persist no studies addressing long term outcome of individuals with asperger syndrome are available and there are no systematic long term follow up studies of children with as individuals with as appear to have normal life expectancy but have an increased prevalence of comorbid psychiatric conditions such as major depressive disorder and anxiety disorders that may significantly affect prognosis although social impairment may be lifelong outcome is generally more positive than with individuals with lower functioning autism spectrum disorders for example asd symptoms are more likely to diminish with time in children with as or hfa most students with as and hfa have average mathematical ability and test slightly worse in mathematics than in general intelligence but some are gifted in mathematics as has potentially been linked to some accomplishments such as vernon l smith winning nobel memorial prize in economic sciences however smith is self diagnosed although many attend regular education classes some children with as may utilize special education services because of their social and behavioral difficulties adolescents with as may exhibit ongoing difficulty with self care or organization and disturbances in social and romantic relationships despite high cognitive potential most young adults with as remain at home yet some do marry and work independently different ness adolescents experience can be traumatic anxiety may stem from preoccupation over possible violations of routines and rituals from being placed in a situation without a clear schedule or expectations or from concern with failing in social encounters resulting stress may manifest as inattention withdrawal reliance on obsessions hyperactivity or aggressive or oppositional behavior depression is often result of chronic frustration from repeated failure to engage others socially and mood disorders requiring treatment may develop clinical experience suggests rate of suicide may be higher among those with as but this has not been confirmed by systematic empirical studies education of families is critical in developing strategies for understanding strengths and weaknesses helping family to cope improves outcomes in children prognosis may be improved by diagnosis at a younger age that allows for early interventions while interventions in adulthood are valuable but less beneficial there are legal implications for individuals with as as they run risk of exploitation by others and may be unable to comprehend societal implications of their actions epidemiology frequency estimates vary enormously in 2015 it was estimated that 37 2 million people globally are affected a 2003 review of epidemiological studies of children found autism rates ranging from 0 03 to 4 84 per 1 000 with ratio of autism to asperger syndrome ranging from 1 5 1 to 16 1 combining geometric mean ratio of 5 1 with a conservative prevalence estimate for autism of 1 3 per 1 000 suggests indirectly that prevalence of as might be around 0 26 per 1 000 part of variance in estimates arises from differences in diagnostic criteria for example a relatively small 2007 study of 5 484 eight year old children in finland found 2 9 children per 1 000 met icd 10 criteria for an as diagnosis 2 7 per 1 000 for gillberg and gillberg criteria 2 5 for dsm iv 1 6 for szatmari et al and 4 3 per 1 000 for union of four criteria boys seem to be more likely to have as than girls estimates of sex ratio range from 1 6 1 to 4 1 using gillberg and gillberg criteria females with autism spectrum disorders may be underdiagnosed anxiety disorders and major depressive disorder are most common conditions seen at same time comorbidity of these in persons with as is estimated at 65 reports have associated as with medical conditions such as aminoaciduria and laxity but these have been case reports or small studies and no factors have been associated with as across studies one study of males with as found an increased rate of epilepsy and a high rate 51 of nonverbal learning disorder as is associated with tics tourette syndrome and bipolar disorder repetitive behaviors of as have many similarities with symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder and obsessive compulsive personality disorder and 26 of a sample of young adults with as were found to meet criteria for schizoid personality disorder which is characterised by severe social seclusion and emotional detachment more than any other personality disorder in sample however many of these studies are based on clinical samples or lack standardized measures nonetheless comorbid conditions are relatively common history named after austrian pediatrician hans asperger 1906 1980 asperger syndrome is a relatively new diagnosis in field of autism though a syndrome like it was described as early as 1925 by grunya sukhareva 1891 1981 as a child asperger appears to have exhibited some features of very condition named after him such as remoteness and talent in language in 1944 asperger described four children in his practice who had difficulty in integrating themselves socially children lacked nonverbal communication skills failed to demonstrate empathy with their peers and were physically clumsy asperger called condition autistic psychopathy and described it as primarily marked by social isolation fifty years later several of as as a medical diagnosis were tentatively proposed many of which diverge significantly from asperger s original work unlike today s as autistic psychopathy could be found in people of all levels of intelligence including those with intellectual disability asperger defended value of high functioning autistic individuals writing we are convinced then that autistic people have their place in organism of social community they fulfill their role well perhaps better than anyone else could and we are talking of people who as children had greatest difficulties and caused untold worries to their care givers asperger also believed some would be capable of exceptional achievement and original thought later in life his paper was published during world war ii and in german so it was not widely read elsewhere lorna wing used term asperger syndrome in 1976 and popularized it to english speaking medical community in her february 1981 publication of a series of case studies of children showing similar symptoms and uta frith translated asperger s paper to english in 1991 sets of diagnostic criteria were outlined by gillberg and gillberg in 1989 and by szatmari et al in same year as became a standard diagnosis in 1992 when it was included in tenth edition of world health organization s diagnostic manual international classification of diseases icd 10 in 1994 it was added to fourth edition of american psychiatric association s diagnostic reference diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders dsm iv hundreds of books articles and websites now describe as and prevalence estimates have increased dramatically for asd with as recognized as an important subgroup whether it should be seen as distinct from high functioning autism is a fundamental issue requiring further study and there are questions about empirical validation of dsm iv and icd 10 criteria in 2013 dsm 5 eliminated as as a separate diagnosis folding it into autism spectrum on a severity scale society and culture thumb 200px students and families walk to support autism awareness month alt three children are seen holding a banner which says different not less we are unified in brightly colored text people identifying with asperger syndrome may refer to themselves in casual conversation as a term first used in print by liane holliday willey in 1999 word neurotypical abbreviated nt describes a person whose neurological development and state are typical and is often used to refer to non autistic or allistic people internet has allowed individuals with as to communicate with each other in a way that was not previously possible because of their rarity and geographic dispersal forming a subculture composed of people with asperger s some autistic people have advocated a shift in perception of autism spectrum disorders as complex syndromes rather than diseases that must be cured proponents of this view reject notion that there is an ideal brain configuration and that any deviation from norm is pathological they promote tolerance for what they call neurodiversity these views are basis for autistic rights and autistic pride movements there is a contrast between attitude of adults with self identified as who typically do not want to be cured and are proud of their identity and parents of children with as who typically seek assistance and a cure for their children some researchers have argued that as can be viewed as a different cognitive style not a disorder and that it should be removed from standard diagnostic and statistical manual much as homosexuality was removed in a 2002 paper simon baron cohen wrote of those with as in social world there is no great benefit to a precise eye for detail but in worlds of maths computing cataloging music linguistics engineering and science such an eye for detail can lead to success rather than failure baron cohen cited two reasons why it might still be useful to consider as to be a disability to ensure provision for legally required special support and to recognize emotional difficulties from reduced empathy baron cohen argues that genes for asperger s combination of abilities have operated throughout recent human evolution and have made remarkable contributions to human history by contrast pier and wrote in 2011 that broad version of neurodiversity claim covering low functioning as well as high functioning autism is problematic only a narrow conception of neurodiversity referring exclusively to high functioning is reasonable they say that higher functioning individuals with autism may not be benefited with such a psychiatric defect based diagnosis some of them are being harmed by it because of disrespect diagnosis displays for their natural way of being but think that it is still reasonable to include other categories of autism in psychiatric diagnostics narrow conception of neurodiversity claim should be accepted but broader claim should not jonathan mitchell an autistic author and blogger who advocates a cure for autism has described autism as having prevented me from making a living or ever having a girlfriend
