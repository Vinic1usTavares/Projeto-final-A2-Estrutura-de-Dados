toyota ts030 hybrid is a le mans prototype 1 lmp1 sports car built by toyota motorsport gmbh and used by manufacturer in fia world endurance championship in 2012 and 2013 it was toyota s first all new prototype since gt one last competed in 1999 and was first petrol hybrid engine car to participate in world endurance championship work on designing car began in late 2010 when early chassis designs were presented to toyota motorsport project was stopped briefly after 2011 tohoku earthquake and tsunami but car s building was approved six months later ts030 hybrid featured a kinetic energy recovery system kers regenerative braking device to charge a super capacitor its engine a naturally aspirated petrol v8 power unit was mounted at a 90 degree angle produced and was based on toyota s super gt project on 24 january 2012 ts030 hybrid was shown to press for first time at circuit paul ricard and team commenced testing at track shortly after its planned debut at 2012 6 hours of spa francorchamps was delayed while car s chassis was rebuilt after a heavy testing crash two ts030 hybrid cars were entered for le mans which saw team fail to finish because of a sizeable accident by anthony davidson in no 8 vehicle and an engine failure for sister no 7 entry after race company fielded a sole ts030 hybrid for rest of season and attracted attention for an innovative rear wing extension it was able to compete successfully against two audi r18 e tron quattro cars securing three victories with drivers nicolas lapierre and alexander wurz ending season second to their rivals in world manufacturers championship further car development was undertaken to minimise impact of 2013 lmp1 technical regulations by focusing on engine fine tuning for improvements in power efficiency and reliability only one ts030 hybrid was entered for entire 2013 world endurance championship because toyota had limited resources though a second car was used in selected races 2012 specification chassis was used in season s first two races with updated 2013 chassis debuting at spa francorchamps ts030 hybrid cars won two of eight rounds contested in season with a second place finish for no 8 vehicle at 24 hours of le mans toyota again finished second behind their rivals audi in manufacturers championship 2014 lmp1 regulations rendered ts030 hybrid obsolete and it was superseded by ts040 hybrid background prior to development of ts030 hybrid toyota last competed in sports car racing in 1999 that year their cars called gt ones qualified on pole position for 24 hours of le mans all three cars ran quickly for most of race although two of cars retired due to tyre issues while remaining gt one finished in second place behind race winners bmw company chose to withdraw from sports car racing at end of year to concentrate their efforts on establishing their formula one team after hybrid toyota supra hv r won 24 hours outright in 2007 toyota sought a larger and more international audience for acknowledgement of company s work in hybrid racing technology engineers set themselves objective of developing a purpose built car to return to international endurance racing and garner worldwide interest by competing in 24 hours of le mans design and development left thumb engine of 2012 toyota ts030 hybrid on display at 2017 tokyo auto salon work on designing car began in late 2010 when early designs of its chassis were presented to toyota motorsport project was halted briefly after earthquake and tsunami that struck japan in march 2011 although building of car was approved six months later carbon fibre monocoque was constructed at toyota motorsport s headquarters in cologne which built 84 of chassis and performed aerodynamic development of design in its wind tunnel designers were influenced by findings from outdated dome chassis and impressions from current audi and peugeot monocoques suspension setup consisted of an independent double wishbone system with actuated dampers and was designed to accommodate wide tyres its engine a naturally aspirated petrol v8 power unit was mounted at a 90 degree angle and produced toyota engineers elected to base engine on their super gt project instead of constructing a new power unit six speed sequential gearbox unit was transverse mounted to engine and brakes were constructed from carbon materials ts030 hybrid featured a kinetic energy recovery system kers regenerative braking device produced by toyota racing development le mans organisers automobile club de l ouest aco use alternate name ers to charge a super capacitor extra power is directed to rear wheels giving an automatic horsepower increase of its motor generator unit acts as a generator under braking this allows it to harvest direct energy from drive shaft which slows car and converts energy into electricity that is stored in super capacitor which was supplied by and mounted in car s passenger compartment result allows for faster lap times when driver exits track turns and saves fuel by reducing engine usage leaving a corner toyota chose aisin aw to build front electric motor while denso were selected to build rear power unit under 2012 le mans rules they were allowed to use system at any speed unlike audi who had elected to send power to front with a restriction to a minimum speed of michelin was team s tyre supplier livery launch and testing car was liveried in white with blue stripes running down sides of cockpit and on top of each of its sidepods several sponsor stickers were on a number of areas of car vehicle s race number was placed in a red square on middle of top section of its front left fender and far right of both fenders livery incorporated colour scheme of toyota s hybrid production cars and returned to livery used by japanese manufacturer between 1985 and 1993 toyota publicly announced its return to sports car racing in october 2011 three months later first car undertook a three day private test session at circuit paul ricard toyota planned to test their ts030s for during 2012 pre season period company entered into a partnership with french based oreca racing team for provision of operational support on 24 january ts030 was shown to press for first time during its test session at paul ricard after its three day roll out at paul ricard ts030 hybrid covered more than with tyre evaluation testing hybrid system over long distances and aerodynamic and mechanical set up optimising undertaken in their test session team returned to track in mid february and performed a 30 hour endurance stint after evaluating multiple performance developments after a heavy accident at paul ricard during a second endurance test on 4 april that damaged chassis beyond repair toyota cancelled seven days of running at eurospeedway lausitz and ciudad del motor de aragon following car s rebuilding toyota scheduled a functionality test at circuit de nevers magny cours one month later preparation thumb sebastien buemi stephane sarrazin and anthony davidson were chosen to drive no 8 toyota initial schedule for ts030s consisted of participation in may pre qualifying and testing session at le mans in preparation for race in june it was scheduled to make its debut in 6 hours of spa francorchamps but its heavy accident at paul ricard forced team was forced to delay ts030 s debut race appearance until 24 hours of le mans in june because of time needed to produce a new monocoque aco and world motorsport s governing body federation internationale de l automobile fia persuaded toyota to expand their presence in world endurance championship wec by extending deadline for entries following peugeot s withdrawal from sports car racing but toyota elected not to enter 12 hours of sebring because of time constraints in early 2012 toyota named seven drivers to team sebastien buemi then third driver for red bull racing formula one team had no prior experience of endurance motor racing former williams formula one and formula nippon driver kazuki nakajima also came from an open wheel racing background anthony davidson was added to team for his previous experience with sports cars while nicolas lapierre transferred from team oreca s le mans squad alexander wurz also had extensive experience of sports car racing having twice won 24 hours of le mans stephane sarrazin was employed by toyota in may 2012 to replace hiroaki who withdrew following completion of car s first testing session due to back discomfort super gt competitor andrea served as team s junior driver racing history 2012 thumb no 7 toyota led laps at le mans before retiring because of an engine failure left ts030 hybrid made its race debut at 24 hours of le mans with two cars entered it was first petrol hybrid car to compete in wec despite electrical problems in practice and qualifying 8 car qualified third with no 7 entry securing fifth on 82nd lap davidson collided with no 81 af corse ferrari of piergiuseppe perazzini at mulsanne corner into air and crashed heavily into a tyre barrier davidson got out of his car unassisted but was transported to a local hospital complaining of back pain a medical inspection found he had cracked two vertebrae t11 t12 from accident no 7 ts030 hybrid which had briefly led race before accident had previously suffered from car damage that required lengthy repairs to it and retired ten and a half hours into event after an engine failure after le mans toyota fielded one car for remainder of season and installed innovative rear wing extensions to their cars which garnered controversy in series but were declared legal championship resumed two months later at silverstone where no 7 toyota qualified in third position seven tenths of a second behind pole sitting no 1 audi r18 e tron quattro of marcel fassler benoit treluyer and andre lotterer in race car was able to compete with lead audi car with two vehicles trading lead throughout but lost their race long duel and took second place finishing ahead of allan mcnish s and tom kristensen s third placed no 2 audi nakajima missed next two events because of super gt commitments at following round of season 6 hours of sao paulo wurz took ts030 hybrid s first pole position on his first timed lap which he improved on minutes later he was nearly eight tenths of a second faster than audi s no 2 car driven by lucas di grassi wurz and lapierre maintained no 7 s pole position advantage throughout most of race only ceding it to audi during pit stop cycles to secure its first victory in wec lapierre qualified no 7 ts030 in third place for 6 hours of bahrain behind two rival audi cars wurz started car and used slower traffic to move into lead 13 minutes into race wurz and later lapierre cemented their advantage at front of field over next two hours until both illuminated number panels failed forcing an unscheduled seven minute pit stop for replacement car parts lapierre and later wurz recovered to third place before laiperre made contact with jonny kane in no 21 strakka racing arx 03a damaging no 7 ts030 hybrid s suspension this caused him to abandon car at side of track thumb no 7 toyota won its second race of season at 6 hours of fuji for 6 hours of fuji nakajima returned to partner wurz and lapierre he was nominated by toyota to drive no 7 car in qualifying and took pole position with an early effort that removed treluyer in no 1 audi from top of time sheets in race vehicle kept its startline advantage and pulled away from field no 2 audi of lotterer treluyer and fassler traded lead with toyota multiple times before it was penalised for colliding with a slower car hence no 7 toyota maintained lead for rest of race to secure its second victory of season nakajima was unable to attend 6 hours of shanghai because his super gt commitments took priority over wec leaving wurz and laiperre to drive car as a two person entry wurz put no 7 ts030 hybrid on pole position despite losing time on his fastest lap and was one tenth of a second quicker than mcnish s no 2 audi in race car was unhindered throughout as it consistently ran under a second faster than both audi cars and only ceded lead to their rivals in pit stop cycle clinching its third victory of season with a large lead over audi s no 2 car competing with ts030 hybrid toyota team scored 96 points and were second to audi in 2012 world manufacturers championship 2013 toyota opted to develop car to minimise impact of 2013 technical regulations which increased minimum weight of manufacturer le mans prototype 1 lmp1 vehicles by by focusing on fine tuning engine for power improvement efficiency and reliability they also manufactured new chassis tubs consisting of a narrower front nose because there was no longer a need to have an option to operate hybrid system on front wheels company had limited resources so they elected to run one ts030 hybrid for entire wec season with a second vehicle participating in selected rounds including 24 hours of le mans first race of season 6 hours of silverstone saw toyota bring two 2012 specification cars in place of updated 2013 chassis nakajima was absent from silverstone because of a super formula commitment despite a timing system malfunction preventing lap times from being published for more than an hour no 7 and no 8 toyota cars qualified in first and second places separated by nearly two seconds however event was at best uneventful with neither car being able to match either audi s pace finishing third and fourth overall having struggled in first few hours of race with tyre management second round of season 2013 6 hours of spa francorchamps saw toyota debut new 2013 specification car with one older chassis entered after a close qualifying session updated no 7 car ran near front of race for first three hours before retiring due to overheating brakes as a result of a malfunctioning energy recovery system with rear brake assembly designed to be assisted with certain amounts of mechanical retardation provided by hybrid recovery system by design it did not provide deceleration when malfunctioning thus overloading conventional rear brakes no 8 sister car remained in fourth for rest of event closing what was a mixed outcome for team post race technical director pascal vasselon explained that his team s analysis from spa showed that current balance of performance significantly favoured audi s turbo diesel engine over its own normally aspirated petrol engine calling for aco and fia for a more favourable balance of performance to be applied before le mans as agreed at season s start fia and aco reviewed technical regulations at end of may 2013 to adjust performance between petrol and diesel lmp1 cars for rest of 2013 championship from le mans onward petrol engine cars had an additional of fuel capacity left thumb no 8 toyota ts030 hybrid that came second at le mans at le mans no 8 toyota qualified fourth three tenths ahead of sister ts030 hybrid in fifth but off pace of both audi cars race started on a damp and slippery track with two ts030 cars driving faster than they had done in qualifying moving up field and separating first five runners as track dried toyota dropped back from quicker audi cars but had better fuel mileage this recurring pattern continued into night when no 7 and 8 toyota vehicles took over second and third places after two of audi s entrants ran into problems rain fell overnight and toyota s tyre strategy enabled their cars to narrow audi s lead to below two minutes positions remained constant until heavy rain fell on track in final hour and lapierre in no 8 toyota aquaplaned into barriers requiring swift and extensive car repairs and finished fourth overall no 8 toyota of buemi gained on kristensen s no 2 audi in closing stages but was too far behind to effect any positional change and came second starting from 6 hours of sao paulo davidson buemi and sarrazin took part in next two races while wurz and lapierre focused on developing toyota s 2014 car and nakajima concentrated on a joint super formula and super gt programme buemi and davidson were chosen to qualify car and took third with a two lap average lap time that was two tenths slower than pole sitting no 1 audi more than half an hour into race sarrazin drove around outside of slower no 32 lotus t128 of dominik kraihamer to lap him but kraihamer lost control of his car s rear and went into sarrazin s left hand side both drivers made high speed contact with turn three tyre barrier damage to no 8 toyota s steering was great enough to force it to retire at inaugural 6 hours of circuit of americas held three weeks later sarrazin and buemi qualified car in third position 1 3 seconds off lead no 2 audi car s pace and sarrazin could not improve following jan s no 32 lotus t128 hitting his rear end sending ts030 hybrid spinning at first turn in a warm weather affected race buemi moved into second immediately after a fifteen minute safety car period and challenged no 1 audi for lead before pit stop cycle toyota achieved a strong performance through better tyre management enabling no 8 car to finish second going into team s home event 6 hours of fuji toyota announced that two ts030 hybrid cars would take part in race both toyota cars lined up in second and third places on grid with buemi and davidson driving no 8 car while nakajima and lapierre utilised sister no 7 vehicle race was shortened because of heavy rain and poor visibility no 8 toyota secured victory when no 1 audi made unscheduled pit stops for debris removal with other toyota finishing one lap behind in 27th as it had to make a fuel pit stop at race s start but attempted to leave pit lane five seconds later than allowed and fell to back of field following their victory toyota changed a decision to run a sole car at shanghai and included a second reports suggested toyota wished to increase their prospects of winning a race on outright speed it was also confirmed that nakajima would skip round to contest super formula championship lapierre and wurz qualified no 7 car on pole position with no 8 entry of sarrazin and buemi separating two audi cars in third no 7 toyota led race heading into final hour but wurz ceded it when he went off racing line while moving past slower traffic because of worn tyres it was overtaken by no 1 audi and wurz could only manage second place in no 7 car toyota s no 8 car retired from lead in fifth hour because a right front suspension bolt sheared for season closing round in bahrain toyota confirmed to press that two cars would be fielded with provision that neither car finished in shanghai with major problems although no 8 toyota s suspension failure did not affect their decision it was also announced that nakajima would return to drive no 7 car with lapierre and wurz both cars qualified on front row of grid with wurz and nakajima s no 7 vehicle taking pole position by three tenths of a second from no 8 toyota of sarrazin and davidson although it picked up a vibration in race s closing minutes no 8 toyota was unchallenged throughout taking victory with a one minute and ten second advantage over audi s no 1 car it shared lead with sister car no 7 until it was driven to side of track when its engine failed before second hour s end
