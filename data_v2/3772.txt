gol transportes aereos flight 1907 was a boeing 737 8eh on a scheduled domestic passenger flight from manaus brazil to rio de janeiro on afternoon of 29 september 2006 it collided in mid air with an embraer legacy 600 business jet over brazilian state of mato grosso boeing 737 broke up in mid air and crashed into an area of dense jungle killing all 154 passengers and crew on board despite sustaining serious damage to its left wing and tail embraer legacy jet landed safely with its seven occupants uninjured accident was investigated by brazilian aeronautical accidents investigation and prevention center cenipa and u s national transportation safety board ntsb and a final report was issued in 2008 cenipa concluded that accident was caused by air traffic control atc errors combined with mistakes made by american pilots on legacy while ntsb determined that both flight crews acted properly and were placed on a collision course by atc deeming legacy pilots disabling of their tcas

included an interim summary of investigation to date as well as some immediate safety recommendations that ntsb believes should be implemented by u s federal aviation administration faa to enhance flight safety ntsb reported that embraer apparently experienced a traffic collision avoidance system tcas outage unknown to its flight crew prior to collision according to cockpit voice recorder cvr thumb right upright 1 1 diagram of impact 1 impact 2 hydraulic lines 3 control surfaces preliminary findings in ongoing investigation indicate that for reasons yet to be determined collision avoidance system in legacy airplane was not functioning at time of accident thereby disabling system s ability to detect and be detected by conflicting traffic in addition cvr data indicate that flight crew was unaware that collision avoidance system was not functioning until after accident ntsb added that design of embraer s avionics is such that non functioning of tcas that apparently occurred is shown by a small static white text message which may not be noticeable by flight crew ntsb noted using only static text messages to indicate a loss of collision avoidance system functionality is not a reliable means to capture pilots attention because these visual warnings can be easily overlooked if their attention is directed elsewhere in flight environment based on its observations ntsb recommended to faa that design changes be implemented to improve of tcas announcements and that faa advise pilots of all aircraft types to familiarize themselves with details of this accident with ways in which a pilot could inadvertently cause loss of transponder and or tcas function and how to recognize a loss of function final reports cenipa report right thumb relatives of gol 1907 victims react to

findings conclusions and recommendations cenipa report includes a conclusions section that summarizes known facts and lists a variety of contributing factors relating both to air traffic controllers and to legacy jet s flight crew according to cenipa air traffic controllers contributed to accident by originally issuing an improper clearance to embraer and not catching or correcting mistake during subsequent handoff to brasilia center or later on cenipa also found errors in way controllers handled loss of radar and radio contact with embraer cenipa concluded that excelaire pilots also contributed to accident with among other things their failure to recognize that their transponder was inadvertently switched off thereby disabling collision avoidance system on both aircraft as well as their overall insufficient training and preparation ntsb report ntsb issued its own report on accident which was also appended to cenipa report with following probable cause statement evidence collected during this investigation strongly supports conclusion that this accident was caused by n600xl and following atc clearances which directed them to operate in opposite directions on same airway at same altitude resulting in a midair collision loss of effective air traffic control was not result of a single error but of a combination of numerous individual and institutional atc factors which reflected systemic shortcomings in emphasis on positive air traffic control concepts ntsb further added following contributing factors contributing to this accident was undetected loss of functionality of airborne collision avoidance system technology as a result of inadvertent inactivation of transponder on board n600xl further contributing to accident was inadequate communication between atc and n600xl flight crew conflicting cenipa and ntsb conclusions cenipa and ntsb collaborated in accident investigation and while agreeing on most of basic facts and findings two organizations arrived at conflicting interpretations and conclusions cenipa report concluded that accident was caused by mistakes made both by atc and by excelaire pilots whereas ntsb report focused on controllers and atc system concluding that both flight crews acted properly but were placed on a collision course by air traffic controllers according to aviation week u s national transportation safety board ntsb strongly disagreed with brazilian conclusions regarding legacy pilots actions as a causal factor noting crew flew route precisely as cleared and complied with all atc instructions as did gol airlines crew aviation week adds that brazilian military operates that country s air traffic control system conducted investigation and authored report aftermath aviation crisis thumb right passengers at brasilia international airport enquiring about delayed flights crash of flight 1907 precipitated a major crisis in brazil s civil aviation system which included lengthy flight delays and cancellations atc work to rule slowdowns and strikes and public safety concerns about brazil s airport and air traffic infrastructure historically brazil was ruled by its armed forces from 1964 until 1985 since then a civilian government has taken over but country s airways continued to be controlled and operated by brazilian air force fab and run by its generals overseen by a civilian defense minister most of brazil s air traffic controllers are military non commissioned officers and all area control centers are run by fab thumb left upright 0 7 brazilian defense minister waldir pires was accused of mismanaging brazil s air traffic system in october 2006 as details surrounding crash of flight 1907 began to emerge investigation seemed to be at least partly focused on possible atc errors this led to increasing resentment by controllers and exacerbated their already poor labor relations with their military superiors controllers complained about being overworked underpaid overstressed and forced to work with outdated equipment many have poor english skills limiting their ability to communicate with foreign pilots which played a role in crash of flight 1907 in addition military s complete control of country s aviation was criticized for its lack of public accountability amid rising tensions air traffic controllers began staging a series of work actions including slowdowns walkouts and even a hunger strike this led to chaos in brazil s aviation industry major delays and disruptions in domestic and international air service stranded passengers canceled flights and public demonstrations those who blamed various civilian and military officials for growing crisis called for their resignation on 26 july 2007 after an even deadlier crash in brazil tam airlines flight 3054 on 17 july 2007 claimed lives of 199 people president luiz inacio lula da silva fired his defense minister waldir pires who had been in charge of country s aviation infrastructure and safety since march 2006 and was widely criticized for their failures see for example on same day lula appointed former supreme court president nelson jobim to replace pires and vowed to improve brazil s atc system legal action civil litigation on 6 november 2006 families of ten of deceased filed a lawsuit for negligence against excelaire and honeywell alleging that excelaire pilots were flying at an incorrect altitude and that honeywell transponder was not functioning at time of collision other suits were subsequently filed on behalf of other victims with similar allegations against excelaire and honeywell victims families also filed suits against other u s based defendants including two embraer pilots as well as raytheon lockheed martin and amazon tech manufacturers of brazil s atc equipment and manufacturer of embraer s tcas attorney representing embraer crew miami based robert responded to allegation that crew was flying at an incorrect altitude by stating that according to international regulations clearances and directives issued by atc supersede a previously filed flight plan and in this case flight plan cleared by air traffic control at time of departure required embraer to fly all way to manaus at 37 000 feet and absent contrary directives from air traffic control embraer was obligated to follow its cleared flight plan as findings of investigation are made public we are confident that excelaire s pilots will be exonerated a honeywell spokesperson stated that honeywell is not aware of any evidence that indicates that its transponder on embraer legacy was not functioning as designed or that honeywell was responsible for accident on 2 july 2008 u s district court judge brian cogan of eastern district of new york dismissed families suits against all u s based defendants under premise of forum non without ruling on merits of cases and while allowing discovery to continue cogan recommended brazilian court system as a more appropriate jurisdiction for dispute criminal proceedings on 1 june 2007 murilo mendes a brazilian federal judge in small city of sinop mato grosso near crash site of boeing indicted two embraer pilots and four brasilia based air traffic controllers for exposing an aircraft to danger see for example on 8 december 2008 he dismissed charges of negligence against pilots but left in place a charge of imprudence he also dismissed all charges against two of four brasilia based controllers and reduced charges against other two but supported bringing new charges against a fifth controller based in sao jose dos campos embraer s departure point on 12 january 2010 his ruling was overturned by judge candido ribeiro in a federal court in brasilia reinstating negligence charges against pilots on 26 october 2010 a military court convicted air traffic controller sgt fernandes dos santos sentencing him to 14 months in jail for failing to take action when he saw that embraer s anti collision system had been turned off santos will remain free pending outcome of appeal process four other controllers were acquitted for lack of proof on 17 may 2011 judge mendes sentenced air traffic controller tiburcio de alencar to a term of up to three years and four months but ruled he is eligible to do community service in brazil instead and acquitted santos on charges of harming brazil s air transport safety on 16 may 2011 judge mendes sentenced two pilots to four years and four months of prison in a semi open facility for their role in collision but he commuted sentences to community service to be served in united states brazilian authorities accused pilots of turning off legacy s transponder moments before accident and turning it on again only after crash but it was denied by crew in a deposition via videoconference mendes said in his sentence that pilots had failed to verify functioning of equipment for more than an hour a length of time he called an eternity in aviation on 9 october 2012 brazilian federal prosecutors announced that they had successfully appealed sentence of pilots asking to increase their sentences by 17 months a total of 5 years and 9 months new trial was scheduled for 15 october with pilots again facing trial in absentia on that date court upheld prior convictions but modified sentences to 37 months for each requiring that pilots report regularly to authorities and stay home at
