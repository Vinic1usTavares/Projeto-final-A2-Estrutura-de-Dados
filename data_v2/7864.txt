a total lunar eclipse took place on april 15 2014 it was first of two total lunar eclipses in 2014 and first in a tetrad four total lunar eclipses in a series subsequent eclipses in tetrad are those of october 8 2014 april 4 2015 and september 28 2015 moon passed through center of earth s shadow this was last central lunar eclipse of lunar saros 122 eclipse was visible in americas and pacific ocean region including australia and new zealand during 5 hour 44 minute long eclipse moon passed south of center of earth s shadow as a result northern part of moon was noticeably darker than southern part totality lasted for 1 hour 18 minutes eclipse occurred during ascending phase of moon s orbit part of lunar saros 122 mars was near opposition background a lunar eclipse occurs when moon passes within earth s umbra shadow as eclipse begins earth s shadow first darkens moon slightly then shadow begins to cover part of moon turning it a dark red brown color typically color can vary based on atmospheric conditions moon appears to be reddish because of rayleigh scattering same effect that causes sunsets to appear reddish and refraction of that light by earth s atmosphere into its umbra following simulation shows approximate appearance of moon passing through earth s shadow moon s brightness is exaggerated within umbral shadow northern portion of moon was closest to center of shadow making it darkest and most red in appearance thumb none 480px simulation of appearance of moon just before during and just after eclipse description thumb right nasa chart of eclipse thumb planet mars was near opposition as shown in this geo centered motion of mars from 2003 2018 on april 15 2014 moon passed through southern part of earth s umbral shadow it was visible over most of western hemisphere including east australia new zealand pacific ocean and americas in western pacific first half of eclipse occurred before moonrise in europe and africa eclipse began just before moonset mars which had just passed its opposition appeared at magnitude 1 5 about 9 5deg northwest of moon spica was 2deg to west while arcturus was 32deg north saturn was 26deg east and antares 44deg southeast moon entered earth s penumbral shadow at 4 54 utc and umbral shadow at 5 58 totality lasted for 1 hour 18 minutes from 7 07 to 8 25 moment of greatest eclipse occurred at 7 47 at that point moon s zenith was approximately southwest of galapagos islands moon left umbra shadow at 9 33 and penumbra shadow at 10 38 peak umbral magnitude was 1 at which moment northern part of moon was 1 7 arc minutes south of center of earth s shadow while southern part was 40 0 arc minutes from center gamma of eclipse was 0 3017 eclipse was a member of lunar saros 122 it was 56th such eclipse geographic

moon near is descending node viewing events many museums and observatories planned special events for eclipse united states national park service sponsored events at great basin national park and sleeping bear dunes national lakeshore university of hawaii s institute for astronomy held events at two locations on islands griffith observatory in los angeles california streamed eclipse live on internet nasa hosted two live question and answer sessions online first happened roughly 12 hours before eclipse via reddit s ask me anything second was a web chat hosted on nasa s site just before eclipse began nasa also streamed eclipse live on their website nasa tv provided 3 hours of live coverage beginning at 2 a m edt gallery relation to prophecy starting in 2008 christian pastors john hagee and mark biltz began teaching blood moon prophecies biltz said second coming of jesus would occur at end of tetrad that began with april 2014 eclipse while hagee said only that tetrad is a sign of something significant idea gained popular media attention in united states and prompted a response from scientific radio show earth sky according to christian today only a small group of christians saw eclipse as having religious significance despite attention related eclipses eclipses of 2014 a total lunar eclipse on april 15 a non central annular solar eclipse on april 29 a total lunar eclipse on october 8 a partial solar eclipse on october 23 april 15 eclipse was first eclipse in a tetrad that is four consecutive total eclipses with no partial eclipses in between there will be another eclipse every six lunar cycles during tetrad on october 8 2014 april 4 2015 and september 28 2015 lunar year series repeats after 12 cycles or 354 days causing a date shift when compared to solar calendar this shift means earth s shadow will move about 11 degrees west in each subsequent eclipse this tetrad started during ascending node of moon s orbit it is first tetrad since 2003 04 series which started in may next series will be from 2032 to 2033 starting in april half saros cycle a lunar eclipse will be preceded and followed by solar eclipses by 9 years and 5 5 days a half saros
