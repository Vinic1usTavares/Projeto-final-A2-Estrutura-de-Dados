ski flying is a winter sport discipline derived from ski jumping in which much greater distances can be achieved it is a form of competitive nordic skiing where athletes descend individually at very fast speeds along a specially designed takeoff ramp using skis only jump from end of it with as much power as they can generate then glide or fly as far as possible down a steeply sloped hill and ultimately land within a target zone in a stable manner points are awarded for distance and stylistic merit by five judges and events are governed by international ski federation federation internationale de ski fis rules and scoring in ski flying are mostly same as they are in ski jumping and events under discipline are usually contested as part of fis ski jumping world cup season but hills of which there are only five remaining all in europe are constructed to different specifications in order to enable jumps of up to 66 longer in distance there is also a stronger emphasis on aerodynamics and harnessing wind as well as an increased element of danger due to athletes flying much higher and faster than in ski jumping from its beginnings in 1930s ski flying has developed its own distinct history and since given rise to all of sport s world records first hill designed specifically for ski flying was built in yugoslavia in 1934 after which both germany and austria built their own hills in 1950 this was followed by norway in 1966 united states in 1970 and czechoslovakia in 1980 from 1960s to 1980s a friendly rivalry between european venues saw world records being set

stage of their jumps exacerbated by an outdated technique ill suited to new extremes of ski flying as well as prevalence of older hills featuring very steep slopes in late 1980s and early 1990s jan boklov pioneered v style skis were instead spread outwards in an aerodynamic v shape with athlete s body lying much flatter between them this created yet more surface area and lift instantly enabling distances of up to ten per cent further it also had a favourable effect of granting more stability in air although peak speed was some slower than parallel style at first this new technique was looked upon unfavourably by judges who made it an issue to downgrade style points for those who used it nevertheless within a few years with boklov having won 1988 89 ski jumping world cup season and other

goldstrom following joachim hauer s first round jump from eurosport 1 broadcast in vikersund on 13 february 2016 failing to make a telemark landing results in a loss of style points considerably more points are lost if a landing fails before outrun line such as falling over or touching ground with any part of body except feet when hill begins to flatten out it becomes increasingly difficult to make a telemark landing jump distance is measured from edge of table to placement of landing by increments of 0 5 m this is done using electronic and video monitoring systems together with event personnel assigned to observe jumps by side of hill latter are known as distance or backup judges who are present in case monitoring technology fails commentary by david goldstrom before gregor schlierenzauer s first round jump from eurosport 1 broadcast in pyeongchang on 10 february 2018 if enough jumps exceed 95 of hill size zone where slope begins to flatten out an immediate discussion is held between jury and race director which usually results in start gate being lowered so as to reduce inrun speeds and therefore distances for spectators and judges increments of 5 m are clearly indicated by rows of fir across hill a painted red line is used for k point and a dashed red line for hill size both sides of hill are also marked highly visible in red to indicate landing zone while point beyond hill size is marked in green on sides current leading jump distance to beat is laser projected as a bright green line across hill and is visible to everyone including tv viewers scoring and judging distance points ski flying uses same points system as ski jumping but with two differences in ski jumping an athlete who reaches k point receives 60 points as a base mark for distance in ski flying it is 120 points for every metre beyond k point bonus points are awarded in ski jumping a metre has a value of 2 points for normal hills and 1 8 points for large hills in ski flying a metre is worth 1 2 points these bonus points are then added to those received from reaching k point failing to reach k point instead results in a deduction of points from base mark to same aforementioned values examples if an athlete lands a jump of on a ski flying hill with a k point of 185 m they will receive 126 points 120 for reaching k point plus 6 bonus points for beyond that 5 x 1 2 6 if an athlete lands a jump of on a hill with a k point of 200 m they will receive 105 points from 120 which would have been k point their failure to reach it by results in minus 15 distance points 12 5 x 1 2 15 style points another crucial element of scoring are style points awarded by judges five representatives are selected from different countries who are situated in an observation tower by side of hill a new set of judges are selected for every competition they each award points up to 20 in increments of 0 5 based on stylistic merit an athlete s skis should be kept flat steady and symmetrical during flight avoiding excessive paddling or an inward cant good balance an efficient body position and posture should be maintained with minimal arm movement landing should be in a telemark manner if a telemark landing is not made 2 style points are deducted if a landing is made but fails before outrun line a maximum of 5 style points must be deducted notably both highest and lowest judges scores are omitted to cancel out any discrepancy giving a maximum of 60 style points a perfect jump on a k200 hill would therefore garner a minimum of 180 points 120 distance points 60 style points or more depending on bonus points however such a scenario is only an example and not representative of highly variable nature of sport gaining one or more scores of 20 is very rare and five is extremely rare generally a good to excellent jump can be expected to receive judges scores of 18 to 19 5 while a lower score for style puts an athlete at risk of being less competitive this may be mitigated or even nullified if they have attained substantial bonus points for distance wind and gate compensation for 2010 ski flying world cup season beginning in oberstdorf and from thereon used at all ski flying

round after at least one athlete has jumped then all subsequent athletes are individually penalised with a points deduction based on how many positions gate was moved up or awarded additional points for gate being lowered in variable wind conditions requiring either a higher or lower inrun speed than originally anticipated it is not uncommon for many gate changes to be made as a round wears on in era prior to gate compensation athletes who had jumped before a gate adjustment had to quickly make their way back up hill to jump again which was always logistically difficult to arrange due to time constraints collectively system is known as wind gate compensation as points gained or lost due to wind element are set against points gained or lost from gate changes which is then reflected in an athlete s points score after a jump commentary by david goldstrom after maciej kot s first round jump from eurosport 1 broadcast in zakopane on 20 january 2019 a less commonly used feature of gate
