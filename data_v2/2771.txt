campaign in late 1990s following her starring roles in 1996 dramas fear and freeway witherspoon found herself in an unexpected career slump that led her towards a change in direction all my serious dramatic performances suddenly weren t getting me jobs or opportunities that i really wanted she said in a 2005 interview i have stacks and stacks of letters from great directors saying i can t cast you because you don t mean anything to studios that s why i turned boat toward comedy elections director alexander payne was eager to cast witherspoon as tracy based on her performances in freeway and 1991 film man in moon and witherspoon was equally eager to sign on to project but not to play tracy witherspoon was drawn to part of tammy metzler cynical outcast who becomes election s dark horse

speech alone made me want to play tammy so i was terribly conflicted to play tracy witherspoon developed a distinct speech pattern combining strident intonations with a chipper midwestern accent she
