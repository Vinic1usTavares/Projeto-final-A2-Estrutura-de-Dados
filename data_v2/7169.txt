william of tyre 1130 29 september 1186 was a medieval prelate and chronicler as archbishop of tyre he is sometimes known as william ii to distinguish him from his predecessor william i englishman and former prior of church of holy sepulchre who was archbishop of tyre from 1127 to 1135 in his history william of tyre writes in fourth year after tyre had been captured that is in 1127 28 king patriarch and other leading men elected as archbishop of tyre william venerable prior of church of sepulchre of lord adding that this william was an englishman by birth and a man of most exemplary life and character a few chapters later william reports that when patriarch stephen died in 1130 he was succeeded by william prior of church of sepulchre of lord he was flemish by birth a native of mesines two williams were prior of holy sepulchre at an early time then with william of mesines flanders probably directly succeeding william englishman as prior of holy sepulchre this also means that william of mesines could only have been prior from 1127 year of election of william englishman to archbishopric of tyre to 1130 year of his own election as patriarch see william of tyre a history of

william became tutor to king s son future king baldwin iv whom william discovered to be a leper after amalric s death william became chancellor and archbishop of tyre two of highest offices in kingdom and in 1179 william led eastern delegation to third council of lateran as he was involved in dynastic struggle that developed during baldwin iv s reign his importance waned when a rival faction gained control of royal affairs he was passed over for prestigious patriarchate of jerusalem and died in obscurity probably in 1186 william wrote an account of lateran council and a history of islamic states

from classical literature chronicle is sometimes given title historia rerum in partibus transmarinis gestarum history of deeds done beyond sea or historia ierosolimitana history of jerusalem or

egypt had been invaded by king baldwin i fifty years earlier and weak fatimid caliphate was forced to pay yearly tribute to jerusalem amalric turned towards egypt because muslim territory to east of jerusalem had fallen under control of powerful zengid sultan nur ad din nur ad din had taken control of damascus in 1154 six years after disastrous siege of damascus by second crusade in 1148 jerusalem could now expand only to southwest towards egypt and in 1153 ascalon last fatimid outpost in palestine fell to crusaders nur ad din however also wished to acquire egypt and sent his army to hinder amalric s plans this was situation in east when william returned from europe in 1167 amalric married maria comnena grand niece of byzantine emperor manuel i comnenus and in 1168 king sent william to finalize a treaty for a joint byzantine crusader campaign against egypt expedition amalric s fourth was first with support from byzantine navy amalric however did not wait for fleet to

nur ad din also died in 1174 and his general saladin spent rest of decade consolidating his hold on both egypt and nur ad din s possessions in syria which allowed him to completely encircle jerusalem subsequent events have often been interpreted as a struggle between two opposing factions a court party and a noble party court party was led by baldwin s mother amalric s first wife agnes of courtenay and her immediate family as well as recent arrivals from europe who were inexperienced in affairs of kingdom and were in favour of war with saladin noble party was led by raymond iii of tripoli and native nobility of kingdom who favoured peaceful co existence with muslims this is interpretation offered by william himself in historia and it was taken as fact by later historians peter w edbury however has more recently argued that william must be considered extremely partisan as he was naturally allied with raymond who was responsible for his later advancement in political and religious offices accounts of 13th century authors who continued historia in french must also be considered suspect as they were allied to raymond s supporters in ibelin family peter w edbury

did not take up too much of his time scribes and officials in chancery drafted documents and it may not have even been necessary for him to be present to sign them instead he focused on his duties as archbishop in 1177 he performed funeral services for william of montferrat husband of baldwin iv s sister sibylla when patriarch of jerusalem amalric of was too sick to attend edbury and rowe 1988 pp

future successor in tyre bishops of bethlehem tripoli and jabala and abbot of mount sion patriarch amalric and patriarch of antioch aimery of limoges were unable to attend and william and other bishops did not have sufficient weight to persuade pope alexander iii of need for a new crusade hamilton p 144 william was however sent by alexander as an ambassador to emperor manuel and manuel then sent him on a mission to principality of antioch william does not mention exactly what happened during these embassies but he probably discussed byzantine alliance with jerusalem and manuel s protectorate over antioch where due to pressure from rome and jerusalem emperor was forced to give up his attempts to restore a greek patriarch william was absent from jerusalem for two years returning home in 1180 edbury and rowe 1988 pp 54 55 146 47 hamilton pp 147 149 patriarchal election of 1180 during william s absence a crisis had developed in jerusalem king baldwin had reached age of majority in 1176 and raymond iii had been removed from regency but as a leper baldwin could have no children and could not be expected to rule much longer after death of william of montferrat in 1177 king baldwin s widowed sister sibylla required a new husband at easter in 1180 two factions were divided even further when raymond and his cousin bohemond iii of antioch attempted to force sibylla to marry baldwin of ibelin raymond and bohemond were king baldwin s nearest male relatives in paternal line and could have claimed throne if king died without an heir or a suitable replacement before raymond and bohemond arrived however agnes and king baldwin arranged for sibylla to be married to a poitevin newcomer guy of lusignan whose older brother aimery of lusignan was already an established figure at court hamilton pp 150 158 dispute affected william since he had been appointed chancellor by raymond and may have fallen out of favour after raymond was removed from regency when patriarch amalric died on 6 october 1180 two most obvious choices for his successor were william and heraclius of caesarea they were fairly evenly matched in background and education but politically they were allied with opposite parties as heraclius was one of agnes of courtenay s supporters it seems that canons of holy sepulchre were unable to decide and asked king for advice due to agnes influence heraclius was elected there were rumours that agnes and heraclius were lovers but this information comes from partisan 13th century continuations of historia and there is no other evidence to substantiate such a claim william himself says almost nothing about election and heraclius character or his subsequent patriarchate probably reflecting his disappointment at outcome hamilton pp 162

went to rome to appeal to pope where heraclius had him poisoned according to peter edbury and john rowe obscurity of william s life during these years shows that he did not play a large political role

century but otherwise work deals with advent of first crusade and subsequent political history of kingdom of jerusalem it is arranged but was not written chronologically first sections to be written were probably chapters about invasion of egypt in 1167 which are extremely detailed and were likely composed before fatimid dynasty was overthrown in 1171 much of historia was finished before william left to attend lateran council but new additions and corrections were made after his return in 1180 perhaps because he now realized that european readers would also be interested in history of kingdom in 1184 he wrote prologue and beginning of twenty third book edbury and rowe 1988 pp 28 31 august c krey thought william s arabic sources may have come from library of damascene diplomat usama ibn

writing and drew on his own memory edbury and rowe 1988 pp 44 46 william s classical education allowed him to compose latin superior to that of many medieval writers he used numerous ancient roman and early christian authors either for quotations or as inspiration for framework and organization of historia edbury and rowe 1988 pp 32 33 his vocabulary is almost entirely classical with only a few medieval constructions such as someone who makes armour a calque of arabic zarra and to empty one s bowels huygens chronicon introduction pp 41 42 william himself translates arabic zarra william of tyre trans babcock and krey vol 1 book 5 chapter 11 p 241 he was capable of clever word play and advanced rhetorical devices but he was prone to repetition of a number of words and phrases his writing also shows phrasing and spelling which is unusual or unknown in purely classical latin but not uncommon in medieval latin such as confusion between reflexive and possessive pronouns confusion over use of accusative and ablative cases especially after preposition in collapsed diphthongs i e latin diphthongs ae and oe are spelled simply e dative to me is spelled michi a single s is often doubled for example in adjectival place name ending which he often spells this spelling is also used to represent arabic sh a sound which latin lacks for example in name which he spells huygens chronicon

legendary alt a statue of a knight with a long beard he is wearing a crown of thorns and elaborate armour he has a sword in his left hand and a shield rests against his right leg despite his quotations from christian authors and from bible william did not place much emphasis on intervention of god in human affairs resulting in a somewhat secular history edbury and rowe 1988 pp 42 43

1947 p 5 william gave a more nuanced picture of kings of his own day he claimed to have been commissioned to write by king amalric himself but william did not allow himself to praise king excessively for example amalric did not respect rights of church and although he was a good military commander he could not stop increasing threat from neighbouring muslim states on a personal level william admired king s education and his interest in history and law but also noted that amalric had breasts like those of a woman hanging down to his waist william of tyre trans babcock and krey vol 2 book 19 chapter 3 p 300 and was shocked when king questioned resurrection of dead edbury and rowe 1988 pp 75 76 about amalric s son baldwin iv however there was no ambiguity edbury and rowe 1988 p 76 baldwin was nothing but heroic in face of his debilitating leprosy and he led military campaigns against saladin even while still underaged william tends to gloss over campaigns where baldwin was not actually in charge preferring to direct his praise towards afflicted king rather than subordinate commanders edbury and rowe 1988 p 78 william s history can be seen as an apologia a literary defense for kingdom and more specifically for baldwin s rule by 1170s and 1180s western europeans were reluctant to support kingdom partly because it was far away and there were more pressing concerns in europe but also because leprosy was usually considered divine punishment edbury and rowe 1988 p 65 william was famously biased against knights templar whom he believed to be arrogant and disrespectful of both secular and ecclesiastical hierarchies as they were not required to pay tithes and were legally accountable only to pope although he was writing decades later he is earliest author to describe actual foundation of templar order he was generally favourable towards them when discussing their early days but resented power and influence they held in his own time malcolm barber trial of templars cambridge university press 1993 p 11 william accused them of hindering siege of ascalon in 1153 of poorly defending a cave fortress in 1165 for which twelve templars were hanged by king amalric of sabotaging invasion of egypt in 1168 and of murdering assassin ambassadors in 1173 barber p 12 compared to other latin authors of twelfth century william is surprisingly favourable to byzantine empire he had visited byzantine court as an official ambassador and probably knew more about byzantine affairs than any other latin chronicler he shared poor opinion of alexius i comnenus that had developed during first crusade although he was also critical of some of crusaders dealings with alexius edbury and rowe 1988 pp 132 34 he was more impressed by alexius son john ii comnenus he did not approve of john s attempts to bring crusader principality of antioch under byzantine control but john s military expeditions against muslim states common enemy of both greeks and latins were considered admirable edbury and rowe 1988 pp 137 141 emperor manuel whom william met during his visits to constantinople was portrayed more much like king amalric william admired him personally but recognized that empire was powerless to help jerusalem against muslim forces of nur ad din and saladin william was especially disappointed in failure of joint campaign against egypt in 1169 end of historia coincides with massacre of latins in constantinople and chaos that followed coup of andronicus i comnenus and in his description of those events william was certainly not immune to extreme anti greek rhetoric that was often found in western european sources edbury and rowe 1988 pp 141 150 as a medieval christian author william could hardly avoid hostility towards kingdom s muslim neighbours but as an educated man who lived among muslims in east he was rarely polemical or completely dismissive of islam he did not think muslims were pagans but rather that they belonged to a heretical sect of christianity and followed teachings of a false prophet r c schwinges william of tyre muslim enemy and problem of tolerance tolerance and intolerance social conflict in age of crusades ed michael gervers and james m powell syracuse university press 2001 pp 126 27 he often praised muslim leaders of his own day even if he lamented their power over christian kingdom thus muslim rulers such as mu in ad din unur nur ad din shirkuh and even jerusalem s ultimate conqueror saladin are presented as honourable and pious men characteristics that william did not bestow on many of his own christian contemporaries schwinges p 128 circulation of chronicle after william s death historia was copied and circulated in crusader states and was eventually brought to europe in 13th century james of vitry had access to a copy while he was bishop of acre and it was used by guy of bazoches matthew paris and roger of wendover in their own chronicles however there are only ten known manuscripts that contain latin chronicle all of which come from france and england so william s work may not have been very widely read in its original form edbury and rowe 1988 pp 3 4 in england however historia was expanded in

muhammad up to 1184 for which he used eutychius of alexandria as his main source this work seems to have been known in europe in 13th century but it also does not survive edbury and rowe 1988 pp 23 24 modern assessment william s neutrality as an historian was often taken for granted until late twentieth century august c krey for example believed that his impartiality is scarcely less impressive than his critical skill babcock and krey introduction p 32 despite this excellent reputation d w t c vessey has shown that william was certainly not an impartial observer especially when dealing with events of 1170s and 1180s vessey believes that william s claim to have been commissioned by amalric is a typical ancient and medieval topos or literary theme in which a wise ruler a lover of history and literature wishes to preserve for posterity grand deeds of his reign d w t c vessey william of tyre and art of historiography mediaeval studies 35 1973 pp 437 38 william s claims of impartiality are also a typical topos in ancient and medieval historical writing vessey p 446 his depiction of baldwin iv as a hero is an attempt to vindicate politics of his own party and to blacken those of its opponents vessey p 446 as mentioned above william was opposed to baldwin s mother agnes of courtenay patriarch heraclius and their supporters his interpretation of events during baldwin s reign was previously taken as fact almost without question in mid twentieth century marshall w baldwin marshall w baldwin decline and fall of jerusalem 1174 1189 a history of crusades vol 1 p steven runciman steven runciman a history of crusades vol 2 kingdom of jerusalem and frankish east cambridge university press 1952 p 404 and hans eberhard crusades pp 127 128 were influential in perpetuating this point of view although more recent re evaluations of this period by vessey peter edbury and bernard hamilton have undone much of william s influence an often noted flaw in historia is william s poor memory for dates chronology is sometimes confused and dates are given wrongly even for basic information such as regnal dates of kings of jerusalem edbury and rowe 1988 p 26 for example william gives date of amalric s death as 11 july 1173 when it actually occurred in 1174 william of tyre trans babcock and krey vol 2 book 20 ch 31 p 395 despite his biases and errors william has always been considered one of greatest medieval writers depuis toujours guillaume de tyr a ete comme l un des du moyen age huygens chronicon introduction p 39 runciman wrote that he had a broad vision he

historians of middle ages hamilton p 6 as dictionary of middle ages says william s achievements in assembling and evaluating sources and in writing in excellent and original latin a critical and judicious if chronologically faulty narrative make him an outstanding historian superior by medieval and not inferior by modern standards of scholarship babbitt p 643 references sources primary
