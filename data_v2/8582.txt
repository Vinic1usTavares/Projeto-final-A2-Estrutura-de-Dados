elk or wapiti cervus canadensis is one of largest species within deer family cervidae and one of largest terrestrial mammals in north america and northeast asia this animal should not be confused with still larger moose alces alces to which name elk applies in british english and in reference to populations in eurasia elk range in forest and forest edge habitat feeding on grasses plants leaves and bark male elk have large antlers which are shed each year males also engage in ritualized mating behaviors during rut including posturing antler wrestling sparring and bugling a loud series of vocalizations that establishes dominance over other males and attracts females although they are native to north america and eastern asia they have adapted well to countries in which they have been introduced including argentina and new zealand their great adaptability may threaten endemic species and ecosystems into which they have been introduced elk are susceptible to a number of infectious diseases some of which can be transmitted to livestock efforts to eliminate infectious diseases from elk populations largely by vaccination have had mixed success some cultures revere elk as a spiritual force in parts of asia antlers and their velvet are used in traditional medicines elk are hunted as a game species meat is leaner and higher in protein than beef or chicken elk were long believed to belong to a subspecies of european red deer cervus elaphus but evidence from many mitochondrial dna genetic studies beginning in 1998 shows that two are distinct species key morphological differences that distinguish c canadensis from c elaphus are former s wider rump patch and paler hued antlers naming and etymology early european explorers in north america who were familiar with smaller red deer of europe thought that larger north american animal resembled a moose and consequently gave it name elk which is common european name for moose word elk is related to latin alces old norse scandinavian and german elch all of which refer to animal known in north america as moose name wapiti is from shawnee and cree word meaning white rump this name is used in particular for asian subspecies altai wapiti tian shan wapiti manchurian wapiti and alashan wapiti because in eurasia name elk continues to be used for moose wapiti is also preferred name for species in new zealand asian subspecies are sometimes referred to as maral but this name applies primarily to caspian red deer cervus elaphus maral a subspecies of red deer there is a subspecies of elk in mongolia called altai wapiti cervus canadensis sibiricus also known as altai maral taxonomy elk crossing a rock face thumb thumb elk bull in late autumn banff national park canada thumb sparring elks in banff national park canada members of genus cervus and hence early relatives or possible ancestors of elk first appear in fossil record 25 million years ago during oligocene in eurasia but do not appear in north american fossil record until early miocene extinct irish elk was not a member of genus cervus but rather largest member of wider deer family cervidae known from fossil record until recently red deer and elk were considered to be one species cervus elaphus however mitochondrial dna studies conducted on hundreds of samples in 2004 from red deer and elk subspecies as well as other species of cervus deer family strongly indicate that elk or wapiti should be a distinct species namely cervus canadensis previous classification had over a dozen subspecies under c elaphus species designation dna evidence concludes that elk are more closely related to s deer and even sika deer than they are to red deer elk and red deer produce fertile offspring in captivity and two species have freely inter bred in new zealand s fiordland national park where cross bred animals have all but removed pure elk blood from area subspecies there are numerous subspecies of elk described with six from north america and four from asia although some taxonomists consider them different ecotypes or races of same species adapted to local environments through minor changes in appearance and behavior populations vary as to antler shape and size body size coloration and mating behavior dna investigations of eurasian subspecies revealed that phenotypic variation in antlers mane and rump patch development are based on climatic related lifestyle factors of six subspecies of elk known to have inhabited north america in historical times four remain including roosevelt c canadensis roosevelti tule c canadensis nannodes manitoban c canadensis manitobensis and rocky mountain c canadensis nelsoni eastern elk c canadensis canadensis and merriam s elk c canadensis merriami subspecies have been extinct for at least a century four subspecies described in asia include altai wapiti c canadensis sibiricus and tianshan wapiti c canadensis songaricus two distinct subspecies found in china and korea are manchurian wapiti c canadensis xanthopygus and alashan wapitis c canadensis alashanicus manchurian wapiti is darker and more reddish in coloration than other populations alashan wapiti of north central china is smallest of all subspecies has lightest coloration and is least studied biologist valerius geist who has written on world s various deer species holds that there are only three subspecies of elk geist recognizes manchurian and alashan wapiti but places all other elk into c canadensis canadensis claiming that classification of four surviving north american groups as subspecies is driven at least partly for political purposes to secure individualized conservation and protective measures for each of surviving populations recent dna studies suggest that there are no more than three or four subspecies of elk all american forms aside from possibly tule and roosevelt elk seem to belong to one subspecies cervus canadensis canadensis even siberian elk cervus canadensis sibiricus are more or less identical to american forms and therefore may belong to this subspecies too however manchurian wapiti cervus canadensis xanthopygus is clearly distinct from siberian forms but not distinguishable from alashan wapiti chinese forms macneill s deer kansu red deer and tibetan red deer belong also to wapitis and were not distinguishable from each other by mitochondrial dna studies these chinese

grow at a rate of per day while actively growing antlers are covered with and protected by a soft layer of highly vascularised skin known as velvet velvet is shed in summer when antlers have fully developed bull elk may have eight or more tines on each antler however number of tines has little to do with age or maturity of a particular animal siberian and north american elk carry largest antlers while altai wapiti have smallest formation and retention of antlers is testosterone driven after breeding season in late fall level of pheromones released during estrus declines in environment and testosterone levels of males drop as a consequence this drop in testosterone leads to shedding of antlers usually in early winter thumb right rocky mountain elk during fall elk grow a thicker coat of hair which helps to insulate them during winter males females and calves of siberian and north american elk all grow thin neck manes female and young manchurian and alaskan wapitis do not by early summer heavy winter coat has been shed and elk are known to rub against trees and other objects to help remove hair from their bodies all elk have small and clearly defined rump patches with short tails they have different coloration based on seasons and types of habitats with gray or lighter coloration prevalent in winter and a more reddish darker coat in summer subspecies living in arid climates tend to have lighter colored coats than do those living in forests most have lighter yellow brown to orange brown coats in contrast to dark brown hair on head neck and legs during summer forest adapted manchurian and alaskan wapitis have darker reddish brown coats with less contrast between body coat and rest of body during summer months calves are born spotted as is common with many deer species and they lose their spots by end of summer adult manchurian wapiti may retain a few orange spots on back of their summer coats until they are older this characteristic has also been observed in forest adapted european red deer behavior thumb a bison charges an elk near old faithful in yellowstone national park adult elk usually stay in single sex groups for most of year during mating period known as rut mature bulls compete for attention of cow elk and will try to fend off rival bulls from their harem rival bulls challenge opponents by bellowing or bugling and by paralleling each other walking back and forth this allows potential combatants to assess other s antlers body size and fighting prowess if neither bull backs down they engage in antler wrestling and bulls sometimes sustain serious injuries bulls also dig holes in ground called wallows in which they urinate and roll their body bowyer r terry and david w kitchen significance of scent marking by roosevelt elk journal of mammalogy 68 2 1987 418 423 a male elk s urethra points upward so that urine is sprayed almost at a right angle to penis urine soaks into their hair and gives them a distinct smell which attracts cows dominant bulls follow groups of cows during rut from august into early winter a bull will defend his harem of 20 cows or more from competing bulls and predators it is only mature bulls that usually have large harems and breeding success peaks at about eight years of age bulls between two and four years and over 11 years of age rarely have harems and spend most of rut on periphery of larger harems young and old bulls that do acquire a harem usually acquire it later in breeding season than do bulls in their prime a bull with a harem rarely feeds and he may lose up to 20 percent of his body weight during rut bulls that enter rut in poor condition are less likely to keep their harems through to peak conception period or have strength to survive rigors of oncoming winter bulls have a loud vocalization consisting of screams known as bugling which can be heard for miles bugling is often associated with an adaptation to open environments such as parklands meadows and savannas where sound can travel great distances females are attracted to males that bugle more often and have loudest call bugling is most common early and late in day and is one of most distinctive sounds in nature akin to howl of gray wolf reproduction and lifecycle thumb right female nursing young female elk have a short estrus cycle of only a day or two and matings usually involve a dozen or more attempts by autumn of their second year females can produce one and very rarely two offspring although reproduction is most common when cows weigh at least gestation period is 240 to 262 days and offspring weigh between when females are near to giving birth they tend to isolate themselves from main herd and will remain isolated until calf is large enough to escape predators calves are born spotted as is common with many deer species and they lose their spots by end of summer manchurian wapiti may retain a few orange spots on back of their summer coats until they are older after two weeks calves are able to join herd and are fully weaned at two months of age elk calves are as large as an adult white tailed deer by time they are six months old offspring will remain with their mothers for almost a year leaving about time that next season s offspring are produced gestation period is same for all subspecies elk live 20 years or more in captivity but average 10 to 13 years in wild in some subspecies that suffer less predation they may live an average of 15 years in wild predators and defensive tactics thumb right single bull elk are vulnerable to predation by wolves in north america wolf and coyote packs and solitary cougar are most likely predators although brown and black bears also prey on elk coyote packs mostly prey on elk calves though they can sometimes take a winter or disease weakened adult in greater yellowstone ecosystem which includes yellowstone national park bears are most significant predators of calves major predators in asia include wolf dhole brown bear siberian tiger amur leopard and snow leopard eurasian lynx and wild boar sometimes prey on asian elk calves historically tigers in lake baikal region fed on manchurian wapiti and continue to do so in amur region male elk retain their antlers for more than half year and are less likely to group with other males when they have antlers antlers provide a means of defense as does a strong front leg kick which is performed by either sex if provoked once antlers have been shed bulls tend to form bachelor groups which allow them to work cooperatively at fending off predators herds tend to employ one or more scouts while remaining members eat and rest after rut females form large herds of up to 50 individuals newborn calves are kept close by a series of vocalizations larger nurseries have an ongoing and constant chatter during daytime hours when approached by predators largest and most robust females may make a stand using their front legs to kick at their attackers guttural grunts and posturing effectively deter all but most determined predators wapiti in new zealand have no natural predators http www doc govt nz nature pests and threats animal pests deer migration thumb right elk wintering in jackson hole wyoming after migrating there during fall as is true for many species of deer especially those in mountainous regions elk migrate into areas of higher altitude in spring following retreating snows and opposite direction in fall hunting pressure also impacts migration and movements during winter they favor wooded areas and sheltered valleys for protection from wind and availability of tree bark to eat roosevelt elk are generally non migratory due to less seasonal variability of food sources greater yellowstone ecosystem elk herd numbers over 200 000 individuals and during spring and fall they take part in longest elk migration in continental u s elk in southern regions of yellowstone national park and in surrounding national forests migrate south towards town of jackson wyoming where they winter for up to six months on national elk refuge conservationists there ensure herd is well fed during harsh winters many of elk that reside in northern sections of greater yellowstone ecosystem migrate to lower altitudes in montana mainly to north and west diet thumb right elk pellet group elk are ruminants and therefore have four chambered stomachs unlike white tailed deer and moose which are primarily browsers elk are similar to cattle in that they are primarily grazers but like other deer they also browse elk have a tendency to do most of their feeding in mornings and evenings seeking sheltered areas in between feedings to digest their diets vary somewhat depending on season with native grasses being a year round supplement tree bark being consumed in winter and forbs and tree sprouts during summer elk consume an average of of various vegetation daily particularly fond of aspen sprouts which rise in spring elk have had some impact on aspen groves which have been declining in some regions where elk exist range and wildlife managers conduct surveys of elk pellet groups to monitor populations and resource use parasites and disease at least 53 species of protist and animal parasites have been identified in elk most of these parasites seldom lead to significant mortality among wild or captive elk tenuis or meningeal worm is a parasitic nematode known to affect spinal cord and brain tissue of elk and other species leading to death definitive host is white tailed deer in which it normally has no ill effects snails and slugs intermediate hosts can be inadvertently consumed by elk during grazing liver fluke magna and nematode are also commonly found parasites that can be fatal to elk since infection by either of these parasites can be lethal to some commercial livestock species their presence in elk herds is of some concern thumb right a bull elk in spring shedding its winter coat and with its antlers covered in velvet chronic wasting disease transmitted by a misfolded protein known as a prion affects brain tissue in elk and has been detected throughout their range in north america first documented in late 1960s in mule deer disease has affected elk on game farms and in wild in a number of regions elk that have contracted disease begin to show weight loss increased watering needs disorientation and listlessness and at an advanced stage disease leads to death disease is similar to but not same as mad cow disease and no risks to humans have been documented nor has disease been demonstrated to pose a threat to domesticated cattle in 2002 south korea banned importation of elk antler velvet due to concerns about chronic wasting disease gram negative bacterial disease brucellosis occasionally affects elk in greater yellowstone ecosystem only place in u s where disease is still known to exist in domesticated cattle brucellosis causes infertility abortions and reduced milk production it is transmitted to humans as fever producing influenza like symptoms that may last for years though bison are more likely to transmit disease to other animals elk inadvertently transmitted brucellosis to horses in wyoming and cattle in idaho researchers are attempting to eradicate disease through vaccinations and herd management measures which are expected to be successful nevertheless research has been ongoing since 2002 and a successful vaccine has yet to be developed a recent necropsy study of captive elk in pennsylvania attributed cause of death in 33 of 65 cases to either gastrointestinal parasites 21 cases primarily eimeria sp and sp or bacterial infections 12 cases mostly pneumonia elk hoof disease was first noticed in state of washington in late 1990s in cowlitz river basin with sporadic reports of deformed hooves since then disease has spread rapidly with increased sightings throughout southwest washington and into oregon disease is characterised by deformed broken or missing hooves and leads to severe lameness in elk primary cause is not known but it is associated with bacteria which are known to cause digital dermatitis in commercial livestock mode of transmission is also not known but it appears to be highly contagious among elk studies are being undertaken by government departments to determine how to halt or eliminate disease ecology distribution thumb bull elk bugling during rut modern subspecies are descended from elk that once inhabited beringia a steppe region between asia and north america that connected two continents during pleistocene beringia provided a migratory route for numerous mammal species including brown bear camel horse caribou and moose as well as humans as pleistocene came to an end ocean levels began to rise elk migrated southwards into asia and north america in north america they adapted to almost all ecosystems except for tundra true deserts and gulf coast of u s elk of southern siberia and central asia were once more widespread but today are restricted to mountain ranges west of lake baikal including and altai mountains of mongolia and tianshan region that borders kyrgyzstan kazakhstan and china s xinjiang province habitat of siberian elk in asia is similar to that of rocky mountain subspecies in north america throughout their range they live in forest and in forest edge habitat similar to other deer species in mountainous regions they often dwell at higher elevations in summer migrating down slope for winter highly adaptable elk also inhabit semi deserts in north america such as great basin manchurian and alashan wapiti are primarily forest dwellers and their smaller antler size is a likely adaptation to a forest environment thumb left bull elk at big spring creek in great

reintroduction of elk into ontario began in early 20th century and is ongoing with limited success as of 1989 population figures for rocky mountain subspecies were 782 500 and estimated numbers for all north american subspecies exceeded 1 million prior to european colonization of north america there were an estimated 10 million elk on continent outside their native habitat elk and other deer species especially white tails were introduced in areas that previously had few if any large native ungulates brought to these countries for hunting and ranching for meat hides and antler velvet they have proven highly adaptable and have often had an adverse impact on local ecosystems elk and red deer were introduced to argentina in early 20th century there they are now considered an invasive species encroaching on argentinian ecosystems where they compete for food with indigenous chilean huemul and other herbivores this negative impact on native animal species has led iucn to identify elk as one of world s 100 worst invaders introduction of deer to new zealand began in middle of 19th century and current populations are primarily european red deer with only 15 percent being elk there is significant hybridization of elk with more numerous red deer to extent that pure elk may no longer exist in wild in new zealand these deer have had an adverse impact on forest regeneration of some plant species as they consume more palatable species which are replaced with those that are less favored by elk long term impact will be an alteration of types of plants and trees found and in other animal and plant species dependent upon them as in chile and argentina iucn has declared that red deer and elk populations in new zealand are an invasive species cultural references thumb upright a kiowa couple woman on right is wearing an elk tooth dress elk have played an important role in cultural history of a number of peoples pictograms and petroglyphs of elk were carved into cliffs thousands of years ago by anasazi of southwestern u s more recent native american tribes including kootenai cree blackfeet ojibwa and pawnee produced blankets and robes from elk hides elk was of particular importance to lakota and played a spiritual role in their society at birth lakota males were given an elk s tooth to promote a long life since that was seen as last part of dead elk to rot away elk was seen as having strong sexual potency and young lakota males who had dreamed of elk would have an image of mythical representation of elk on their courting coats as a sign of sexual prowess lakota believed that mythical or spiritual elk not physical one was teacher of men and embodiment of strength sexual prowess and courage neolithic petroglyphs from asia depict antler less female elk which have been interpreted as symbolizing rebirth and sustenance by beginning of bronze age elk is depicted less frequently in rock art coinciding with a cultural transformation away from hunting rocky mountain elk is official state animal for utah an image of an elk and a moose appear on state seal and flag of michigan benevolent and protective order of elks b p o e chose elk as its

commercial uses thumb right approximately of ground elk meat formed into patties they have relatively low fat content although breakdown figures for each game species are not available in 2006 national survey from u s fish and wildlife service hunting of wild elk is most likely primary economic impact while elk are not generally harvested for meat production on a large scale some restaurants offer meat as a specialty item and it is also available in some grocery stores meat has a taste somewhere between beef and venison and is higher in protein and lower in fat and cholesterol than beef pork and chicken elk meat is also a good source of iron phosphorus and zinc a male elk can produce of antler velvet annually and on ranches in united states canada and new zealand this velvet is collected and sold to markets in east asia where it is used in medicine velvet is also considered by some cultures to be an aphrodisiac however consuming velvet from elk in north america may be risky since velvet from animals infected with chronic wasting disease may contain prions that could result in a human getting variant creutzfeldt jakob disease antlers are also used in artwork furniture and other novelty items all asian subspecies along with other deer have been raised for their antlers in central and eastern asia by han chinese turkic peoples tungusic peoples mongolians and koreans elk farms are relatively common in north america and new zealand elk hides have been used for thousands of years for tepee covering blankets clothing and footwear modern uses are more decorative but elk skin shoes gloves and belts are not uncommon since 1967 boy scouts of america have assisted employees at national elk refuge in wyoming by collecting antlers which are shed each
