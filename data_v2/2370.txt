hamilton and co and began in 1951 as a series of novels appearing every two weeks by summer it became a monthly magazine with readers letters and an editorial page though fiction content was still restricted to a single novel in 1952 short fiction began to appear alongside novels and within two more years it completed transformation into a science fiction magazine authentic published little in way of important or ground breaking fiction though it did print charles l harness s rose which later became well regarded poor rates of pay ps1 per 1 000 words prevented magazine from attracting best writers during much of its life it competed against three other moderately successful british science fiction magazines as well as american science fiction magazine market hamilton folded magazine in october 1957 because they needed cash to finance an investment in uk rights to an american best selling novel history in 1950 science fiction sf magazines had been published successfully in north america for over twenty years but little progress had been made in establishing british equivalents bulk of british sf was published as paperback books rather than magazines a situation opposite of that in us ashley transformations p 82 quotes figures for 1952 as 95 sf books to 33 issues of sf magazines in uk whereas in us that year there were 16 sf books and 152 sf magazine issues several short lived magazines had come and gone both before and after war john spencer launched four very poor quality juvenile magazines in 1950 which continued into mid 1950s ashley history of sf magazine vol 3 pp 65 66 while one magazine new worlds had survived since 1946 brian stableford peter nicholls new worlds in nicholls clute encyclopedia of science fiction p 867 since 1939 atlas a british publisher had been producing a reprint edition of astounding science fiction one of most well regarded american sf magazines during war contents had often been cut severely and schedule had not been regular but it was reputed to sell 40 000 copies a month this was enough to attract attention of hamilton co a british publisher looking for new markets ashley history of sf magazine vol 3 pp 68 71 in 1949 hamilton hired gordon landsborough as an editor landsborough did his best to improve quality of science fiction he was publishing and was allowed to offer ps1 per 1 000 words for selected material he also was joined at hamilton by h j campbell who was hired as a technical editor campbell was a london science fiction fan he had been brought on by hulton press publisher of very successful comic eagle to create a science fiction magazine but project had been abandoned before seeing print by start of 1951 hamilton s science fiction titles were being published every two weeks on 1 january 1951 hamilton published mushroom men from mars by lee stanton which was a pseudonym for richard conroy a banner was added to base of cover reading authentic science fiction series same banner appeared on 15 january novel reconnoitre ii by jon j deegan also a pseudonym this time for robert g sharp with next book roy sheldon s gold men of aureus landsborough changed banner to read science fiction fortnightly no 3 thinking that caption might help sales ashley transformations pp 82 86 in addition to banner a contents page including a date and issue number a letter column an editorial and an advertisement for subscriptions were inserted according to landsborough banner was only intended to indicate publishing schedule to readers but combined with other changes appearance became much more magazine like these changes established sequence in minds of readers and collectors and retroactively determined that mushroom men from mars had been first in series first two issues had carried no issue number issue 3 was also first issue to carry editors names see individual issues landsborough used pseudonym l g holmes holmes was his middle name for his editing role on magazine caption did apparently help sales landsborough subsequently commented that while hamilton s other titles were selling perhaps 15 000 copies authentic managed to sell 30 000 after banners were in place hamilton proposed launching a monthly sf magazine landsborough was concerned about workload and also felt it would be difficult to find enough good material hamilton refused to increase pay rate which was not high enough to attract best stories a compromise was reached and authentic was born as a monthly magazine in paperback format with a single novel and a short editorial feature in each issue plus an occasional short story eighth issue was last on fortnightly schedule issues 9 12 were titled science fiction monthly in footer of cover in mid 1951 landsborough left hamilton and campbell replaced him as editor of authentic with thirteenth issue which was also first one on which title changed to authentic science fiction under campbell authentic improved somewhat and continued its metamorphosis into a magazine with additional non fiction writing and short fiction in addition to main novel in each issue hamilton also ran a science fiction paperback imprint panther books which would go on to become one of leading british sf houses by 1953 british sf market was going through a metamorphosis similar to one going in us at same time poor quality sf markets were failing and result was a reduced but active market with four magazines authentic new worlds science fantasy and nebula science fiction ashley transformations p 93 at end of 1955 campbell decided to give up editing in favour of his scientific career as a research chemist he was replaced from february 1956 issue by e c tubb who remained editor to end of magazine s life tubb had contributed a great deal of material to magazine under various pseudonyms often amounting to more than half of an issue s fiction and he later recalled that campbell s way of hiring him as editor was to say to him as you re practically writing it you may as well edit it ashley history of sf magazine part 4 pp 40 42 quote is given as you write most of it you might as well edit it in transformations p 99 quality of material submitted to tubb was dreadful in words of sf historian michael ashley ashley history of sf magazine part 4 p 40 and included many stories that had previously been rejected by campbell he was able to recognize these because campbell had kept a log of all submissions one story was rejected that had been plagiarized from one that had appeared twelve years earlier in astounding science fiction tubb s overall acceptance rate was about one in twenty five submissions as a result he found it difficult to keep standards up often finding himself forced to write material under pseudonyms to fill an issue ashley history of sf magazine part 4 pp 40 42 in early 1957 tubb persuaded hamilton to switch magazine from pocket book to digest size format in hope that this would improve magazine s visibility on circulation did indeed rise to about 14 000 copies per month a surprisingly low figure given landsborough s assertion that authentic had been selling 30 000 copies in early days however later that year hamilton made decision to invest a substantial sum in uk paperback rights of an american best seller it is not known for certain which book this was but it is thought to have been evan hunter s blackboard jungle hamilton could no longer afford to have cash tied up in authentic and in summer of 1957 tubb was given two months to close down magazine printing stories that had already been paid for last issue was dated october 1957 contents and reception thumb an advertising insert that ran in issue 27 inset image is cover for issue 28 other side of insert advertised books published by hamilton for first twenty five issues authentic ran a full novel in every issue but no other fiction though there were various non fiction departments such as projectiles readers letters an editorial book reviews fanzine reviews and science related articles quizzes and news columns in issue 26 dated october 1952 first installment of frontier legion a serial by sydney j bounds appeared with issue 29 full length novel immortal s playthings by william f temple was accompanied by a short story ray bradbury s welcome brothers as well as part four of frontier legion serial was stretched out over six issues by printing scarcely more than a dozen pages in each installment it finally completed in issue 31 with issue 36 august 1953 cover text changed from advertising a full length novel to full length story featured story as it was called in contents page was still longest piece of fiction in issue but was no longer necessarily even close to novel length issue 41 for example ran richard demille s phoenix nest as lead story with fewer than forty pages of text finally in issue 60 august 1955 word feature was removed from contents page and with it last vestige of origin of magazine as a series of novels early novels published by hamilton were of generally poor quality michael ashley a historian of sf described first issue lee stanton s mushroom men of mars as of abysmal quality and third roy sheldon s gold men of aureus as atrocious however campbell contributed some better work beginning with phantom moon under house name roy sheldon which appeared in issue 6 dated 15 march 1951 his first novel under his own name was world in a test tube which appeared in issue 8 dated 15 april 1951 he continued to write for magazine after he became editor his work has been described as enjoyable though not especially sophisticated tubb was also a regular contributor often under house names which according to landsborough were used by hamilton to prevent authors gaining name recognition under a pseudonym and then taking that name to another publisher regulars in magazine included sydney j bounds william f temple bryan berry and ken bulmer frank h parnell peter nicholls authentic science fiction in nicholls clute encyclopedia of science fiction p 74 at start of 1953 authentic began to include material that had been previously published in us this practice ceased later that year but began again in 1956 and led to reprinting of material by well known names such as isaac asimov whose 1951 story ideals die hard was reprinted in issue 78 dated march 1957 other well known names that appeared in authentic included brian aldiss and john brunner campbell had encouraged science articles during his tenure but under tubb s editorship these were gradually eliminated perhaps most notable story authentic published was charles l harness s rose which appeared in march 1953 issue mentioned in notable fiction section of tuck encyclopedia of sf p 548 other than this authentic published little of note nicholls clute encyclopedia of sf commented that it seldom published stories of first rank specifically excepting harness s rose david kyle in his pictorial history of science fiction states that campbell improved magazine making it remarkably good kyle pictorial history p 118 and sf expert donald tuck s opinion was that it eventually achieved a good standard donald h tuck encyclopedia of sf p 548 but in michael ashley s opinion magazine sadly lacked originality and ran fiction that was stereotyped and forced frequently because campbell had to rely on same small band of regulars to supply bulk of fiction michael ashley magazines in holdstock encyclopedia of sf p 65 cover artwork was initially poor very first issue has been described as british pulp at its most infantile frank h parnell peter nicholls authentic science fiction in nicholls encyclopedia of science fiction p 53 but covers began to improve from mid 1953 josh kirby now well known for his discworld art contributed seven covers beginning with issue 61 in september 1955 there were also many covers on astronomical themes these were clearly influenced by us artist
