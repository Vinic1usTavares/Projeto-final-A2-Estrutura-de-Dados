is first woman to create a show for cartoon network in 2011 after former cartoon network vice president of comedy animation curtis asked staff for ideas for a new series rebecca sugar an artist working for network s series adventure time described her initial ideas for what would become steven universe and project was chosen for development while developing her show sugar continued working on adventure time series evolved from a short story written by sugar entitled ballad of margo and dread about a sensitive child helping teenagers with problems they cannot verbalize cartoon network executives commissioned show after crew s art presentation and sugar became first woman to create a show independently for network before a production team had been appointed sugar tried to alter elements of show s plot and developed character s identity so her crew would have freedom she did when she worked for adventure time development when sugar s show was commissioned she resigned from her role as a storyboard artist on adventure time to focus on her own series sugar focused pilot short on main characters and their personalities to demonstrate series humor pilot is a slice of life episode that does not involve major events because series world was still in development sugar and her production team focused plot on interaction between crystal gems and steven sugar strove to make her pilot distinctive in terms of its artistic and aesthetic detail but time limit imposed upon her by cartoon network hampered her this unsuccessful experience helped sugar develop show s concept she said to know that there is so much more that you can t see and way that knowledge frustrates and excites and confuses and scares you title character steven is loosely based on steven sugar rebecca s younger brother during steven universe development sugar repeatedly asked her brother whether naming show after him was a good idea she stopped asking when it was commissioned her brother had no problem with it and trusted sugar to use his name wisely in an interview with new york times sugar discussed developing background of show s protagonist saying she wanted to base character s viewpoint on her brother growing up where you re so comfortable in your life because you get all attention but you also want to rise up and not be little brother when original pilot was presented to cartoon network executives they told crew series would air in 2013 cartoon network released original pilot in may 2013 sugar and her team panicked because series was going to be very different from pilot episode pilot was popular when it was released engendering forum discussions in which people expressed their hopes of seeing it on air soon those who knew rebecca sugar from adventure time were also interested positive reaction to show reassured its crew to prepare for show s commissioning by cartoon network sugar began assembling a production crew jackie buscarino was engaged as a producer in september 2012 and was tasked with hiring people and supervising show s crew during this period of development sugar and her team were moved to a building behind main cartoon network studio and based on same floor as crew of powerpuff girls cgi special some artists who had worked on special such as colorist tiffany ford and art directors kevin dart ellie michalka and jasmin lai were later invited to join steven universe team cartoon network also provided sugar with a list of suggested writers when she saw ben levin and matt burnett former writers for level up on list she immediately asked them to join her team because she was familiar with their work freelance artist danny hynes whom former supervising director ian jones quartey knew from his own project lakewood plaza turbo became show s lead character designer steven sugar was assigned as background designer after his work on original pilot and was assisted by dart michalka lai background painter amanda winterston and others during art presentation jones quartey guy hynes and steven sugar created artwork that differed from their previous work jones quartey wanted to work with something new retaining elements of show s previous project he worked with elle michalka who later took over his role as background painter for presentation to create concept art for an action comedy series around this time jones quartey added stars to series logo because he saw them as a versatile symbol he later said he over used them and they were criticized at art presentation art presentation s drawings were by rebecca sugar jones quartey hynes paul a writer and storyboard artist and steven sugar michalka did painting design during development of steven universe pilot sugar focused much attention on design of world adding notes to her drawings inspired by idea of foreign figures gems living human lives she drew many sketches depicting their world and history series design was also inspired by her and her brother s interest in video games comics and animation after series was commissioned sugar decided to redesign everything to make series flexible and simple for future production staff to add ideas of their own during this time art director was kevin dart followed by jasmin lai elle michalka and ricky cometa dart s artistic style has remained a great influence on show long after his departure steven sugar praised dart s work and was inspired by him in college years saying dart had more ideas for art than he did in pilot only two locations appeared temple and big donut temple was designed by ian jones quartey steven sugar ben levin matt burnett and andy ristaino temple s dual faces were based on guy davis ideas steven sugar designed rest of beach city for series he was painstaking in his attention to detail sugar also designed people houses cars buildings and restaurants because of rebecca sugar s redesigned drawings two original locations had to be redrawn to find inspiration for show s backgrounds sugars and jones quartey went to their favorite beaches series setting beach city is loosely based on delaware beaches rehoboth beach bethany beach and dewey beach all of which rebecca sugar visited as a child steven sugar drew beach city with a boardwalk lined with a variety of shops he wanted it to have a specific style so viewers could believe it was based on a real location he drew roads and shops consistently oriented with temple and a water tower concept for primary setting was inspired by akira toriyama s dr slump which features a small environment in which recurring characters live where they work steven sugar made boardwalk focus of steven universes human world characters during early stages of production sugar worked on character appearance and personality development simultaneously during this process of conception she was heavily inspired by fantasy television characters she and her brother used to draw when they were younger lead character designer danny hynes influenced by design of mickey mouse by disney artists wanted characters to be standardized simple and recognizable he proposed 24 human characters to crew rebecca and steven sugar drew 22 designs 13 of which were made official coloring was done by jones quartey rebecca sugar merged several characters during pilot development supporting characters lars and sadie were originally created when she was in college pizza family was based on jones quartey s ghanaian family and ronaldo was created by ben levin and matt burnett guy davis a childhood friend of sugars designed early monsters and gem architecture making a character look alive was always a priority in their design according to jones quartey a character s emotions should be clearly delineated character design team s mission is for characters to resemble a classic cartoon such as 1940s disney cartoons dragon ball z or works of osamu tezuka and harvey kurtzman in drawing characters for each episode crew has two weeks to make modifications character names and some designs were inspired by types of food and some characters were redesigned because pilot revealed discrepancies between appearances and personalities sugar planned for characters designs to receive visual benchmarks so show s artists can draw them consistently sugar aimed to make designs for her characters simple flexible and consistent so production team members would not become bogged down by over complex details this redesigning meant appearances of characters in pilot episode differs substantially from their depiction in television series sugar wanted gems to resemble humans she developed crystal gems to ride a roller coaster of family life with steven whom they would treat like a brother she wanted their gems to reflect their personalities pearl s perfect smoothness amethyst s coarseness and garnet s air of mystery according to sugar gems are some version of me neurotic lazy decisive their facial designs were influenced by wassily kandinsky who taught at bauhaus and encouraged his students to pair three colors red yellow and blue with three basic shapes square triangle and circle because of characters personalities garnet is square amethyst is a sphere and pearl is a cone sugar wanted to give gems a superpower similar to those of classic cartoon characters such as bugs bunny gems ability to shape shift is a reference to older cartoons such as tex avery s work for mgm where characters would change at will although crystal gems are intended to be serious characters writers wanted them to be funny and weird as well production according to sugar production for steven universe began while she was working on adventure time her last episode for which was simon marcy working on both series simultaneously became impossible she also encountered difficulty in production of episode bad little boy cartoon network executives authorized steven universe production crew to begin working after their pre production presentation for which crew were well prepared episodes cheeseburger backpack and together breakfast were developed at this time although sugar works as executive producer on series art animation and sound she considers herself most hands on at storyboarding stage episode outlines are passed to storyboarders who create action for episode and write its dialogue storyboards are animated using paper drawings and production crew s designs by one of two korean studios sunmin and rough draft and production crew s designs storyboard thumb upright 1 2 alt drawing of an anxious looking character portion of storyboard and script from episode island adventure series storyboard artists are also its writers during storyboard meetings artists draw their ideas on post it notes which are then attached to walls table and boxes in corners of their conference room drawings play a major role in forming episode ideas sugar looks at these designs and occasionally makes changes to key poses sugar likes to review and re draw scenes and characters to add extra pathos and emotion to storyboards each episode s storyboards are created by two artists each of whom writes half of dialogue and draws panels similar to comic strips this process can be quite complex storyboard artists must create cinematography and focus on scenic design in a way similar to film production after panels are made thumbnail storyboard artists draw mannerisms and dialogue based on their own experiences sugar draws quintessential scenes from her memories of hanging out with her brother after school storyboard artists then discuss their work with rest of crew and make any necessary changes after team discussion storyboard artists draw a revised board based on thumbnail board on a full size panel with notes storyboards are again discussed corrected and finally approved writing during pilot development sugar wrote and sketched a number of plot ideas that later became episodes series initial premise focused mostly on steven s human side rather than his magic side but premise was later changed sugar developed gems history in conjunction with pilot episode while first season of show introduced human and gem characters and their relationships sugar began to plot and explore second season storylines involving crystal gems eventually sugar created a chart with taped about a 2 000 year gem and earth history with a number of events needing to be fleshed out for production although series overall plot is established writers improvise to arrive at its ending according to matt burnett storylines will be resolved by series end sugar wanted series to focus on comedy and positivity before exploring controversial subjects involving main characters thinking it was more honest to begin show with happiness instead of action or drama writers formerly levin and burnett would write premises and outlines while storyboarders wrote and drew episodes everyone would wait at least a day to get together and discuss writers write potential episode names on paper cards which they pin on conference room wall to review what they have written and plan their meetings they discuss episode pacing and vary each season s texture by balancing lighter and heavier story arcs changes in major character appearances such as yellow diamond in a storyline can be difficult for writers according to ben levin writing a season of steven universe is like a jigsaw puzzle because writing team must assemble a number of plot ideas which are discarded if they do not benefit character growth after further discussion and questions about writing an idea becomes an episode after discussing a season s proposed episodes puzzle is complete and they begin writing a major story arc or a season finale burnett said writing a season is like an algebraic equation where one side is season finale and x s and y s are episodes we need for that solution to make sense he cited ocean gem steven sword fighter monster buddies an indirect kiss and serious steven as examples those episodes led to season one finale as a minor story arc to develop new ideas for episodes writers play writing games in one a scenario with characters is drawn and passed to another writer second writer adds a few sentences before giving it to a third until drawing has a three act story episodes such as island adventure future boy and onion friend were written this way writers also play drawing games which design new gem characters and technological ideas burnett said he and levin use fewer ideas from storyboarders than they previously did storyboarders change fewer things than they did before because episodes have a stronger continuity according to levin he and burnett try to balance focus between main characters with steven in center and theme of episodes in their writing balance indicates steven has same interests on his human side as he does on his gem side levin said gem mythology and drama would have been less interesting if steven was not as well developed in first few episodes grateful to work on a show which is unafraid to be sincere and vulnerable he said if every episode was emotional series would become formulaic happy episodes balance out emotional ones levin said he and burnett have found ways to integrate steven s powers into plot character s powers and home world technology are revealed at a measured very slow pace satisfying viewer and keeping series clear of superhero territory before significant plotlines air writers reveal information relevant to a climactic episode for audience according to storyboard artist hilary florido much of series action and magic are narrative climaxes demonstrating characters discoveries difficulties and views florido said if a character s evolution is not directly related to plot there is no drama crew is discouraged from breaking perspective involving episode development as they want audience to know protagonist s point of view although writers could hint at future events they prefer to focus on plot and develop steven in real time levin said if pilot tried to present gem history in five minutes audience and protagonist would be equally confused backgrounds production of background art begins after approved storyboards are received if characters visit old locations pre existing backgrounds are modified for authenticity it is likely locations would change slightly over time steven sugar likes to hide narrative bits in backgrounds because he believes key to world building is having a cohesive underlying structure to everything former art director elle michalka said backgrounds artistic style was inspired by french post impressionist painter paul cezanne whose apparent lack of focus belied detail and specificity art was also inspired by tao te ching whose work highlights importance of empty spaces like space within a vase as being part of vase that makes it useful during painting phase painters see lines as descriptive bones and color is used loosely meaning color is intentionally slightly off register highlighting distinction between color and line painters used superimposed watercolor texture before switching to photoshop because former made backgrounds very chunky when painting backgrounds they use one primary and several secondary colors amanda winterston and jasmin lai found suitable color combinations after primary backgrounds are painted they are sent to color stylist who chooses colors for a character or prop from model sheets matching and complementing storyboard and background lines of character or prop are rarely colored lines are removed when scenes need light effects coloring in early season one episodes was experimental because stylist would have difficulty if a storyboard s character and background mixed together or a bright character walked unchanged into a shadow mistakes became rare as crew planned and checked storyboards primary backgrounds are made in burbank secondary ones by korean artists animation after crew finishes constructing an episode production team sends it to animators in korea animation is produced by sunmin image pictures and rough draft korea production team and animators communicate by email and sometimes use video chat when animating a major episode before sending episode to one of studios animation director nick demayo and his team create a plan for animators after reviewing animatics they then add character movements on exposure sheets to guide animators mouth assignments for characters describing mouth shapes and timing for lip syncing follow episode is then sent to one of animation studios black and white version is sent first followed about two weeks later by colored version animation is drawn and inked on paper then scanned and colored digitally crew then arranges a work print meeting to discuss episode and review it for errors demayo notes any errors removes them and sends episode back to animation studio or to cartoon network s post production department to fix any remaining issues minor animation mistakes or omissions are fixed by crew voice cast american actor zach callison voices steven role of steven is his first lead role on television for his audition callison spoke ten lines of dialogue from pilot and sang theme song while being recorded garnet crystal gem leader is voiced by estelle a singer songwriter and actor cartoon network asked estelle to take part her first voice acting role steven universe was also first animation voice role for actor michaela dietz who voices amethyst and party singer deedee magno who voices pearl sugar wanted tom scharpling whom she knew from his podcast best show with tom scharpling to voice a character for one of her projects before steven universe was conceived she approached scharpling for part of greg universe who was originally named tom ruby gems are voiced by yi to whom sugar wrote to say she was confident yi would be perfect for role grace rolek who voices steven s friend connie was 16 years old when series began rolek has been a voice actor in animated productions since age of five or six show s four main voice actors callison dietz magno and estelle spend three to four hours recording per session three to four weeks a month for ten months each year cast members record together or separately they are often recording multiple episodes each recording session covers a new episode and includes retakes for that episode or previous ones if needed in group recording sessions a maximum of six actors stand in a semicircle sugar and voice director kent osborne attend sessions advising actors about voicing characters in specific situations if they like a take production assistant marks it and gives it to animation editor for episode s rough cut when a recording session begins sugar explains storyboards and describes sequences character intention and relationship between them osborne does recording before sessions sugar and voice actors discuss new plot elements and shows them advanced storyboards magno said she enjoys group recording sessions because funny faces cast members make while recording lines requiring emotion or movement often cause them to laugh music steven universe features songs and musical numbers produced by sugar and her writers who collaborate on each song s lyrics multiple drafts of theme song s lyrics were written sugar composed extended theme song while waiting in line for a security check at los angeles international airport series relies on leitmotifs for its soundtrack instruments genres and melodies are allotted to specific characters music is influenced by works of michael jackson and estelle and sugar has cited aimee mann as a huge influence sugar writes songs for series during her travels accompanying herself on a ukulele not every episode features a song according to sugar she uses them occasionally to avoid forced creativity most of show s incidental music is composed by chiptune piano duo aivi surasshu with guitars by jeff liu who was familiar with producer aivi s musical score for video game recommended her to sugar as a composer sugar asked aivi to audition and agreed that producer surasshu could join her aivi surasshu scored a clip from gem glow series first episode sugar liked their work and hired them as series composers before composing an episode aivi surasshu video chat with sugar and creative director to discuss episode they have a week to send sugar a preview score after any necessary changes aivi surasshu send score to sabre media studios for final mix with their sound designs each character has a leitmotif expressing their personality which changes slightly depending on situation pearl is often accompanied by a piano garnet by a synth bass amethyst by a drum machine with electric bass and synths and steven with chiptune tones sound palettes were produced for human characters to represent evolution of series its characters and their relationships sound motifs and palettes were also created for locations objects and abstract concepts when sugar or other writers write a song for an episode they record a demo that is sent to composers same musical style for a song and character singing it is used for each song over time songs have become increasingly complex and production has become more difficult because show s original musical style no longer fits perfectly with newer lyrical themes an example is here comes a thought sung by estelle and aj michalka who voices stevonnie two were less inspired by a specific musical style but rather by song s feel which sugar had explained to them broadcast pilot episode of steven universe was released on cartoon network s video platform on may 21 2013 and an edited version was released on july 20

cast s voice acting particularly that of tom scharpling s greg zach callison s exuberant and expressive work as steven and grace rolek singing her heart out as connie all five seasons of steven universe hold a perfect 100 rating on rotten tomatoes website s critical consensus for season five reads having blossomed into a sophisticated mythology with a deeply moving subtext steven universe remains a sparkling entertainment and perfect introduction to lgbtq representation for children style and themes sugar wanted steven universe to be thematically consistent with hers and her brother s shared interests as a coming of age series theme of family is important since sugar based titular character on her brother additionally theme of love was inspired by her relationship with jones quartey series also expresses importance of acceptance and explores relationships lgbt identity body shapes and hues of skin in a colorful sci fi magic display of diversity according to kat morris series central concepts are developed over time in an organic way rather than being overly calculated from start former writer matt burnett said series simple life theme prevented inclusion of cynicism or snarkiness according to burnett writers have no interest in a superhero theme unusually strong female presence in a series about a boy all major characters except steven and greg are female is intentional according to sugar who intended to tear down and play with semiotics of gender in cartoons for children she considered it absurd that shows for boys should be fundamentally different from those for girls series plot is developing towards a distant goal everything in between is kept flexible partly because her intentions have changed since i ve started because i ve grown up a lot while working on show sugar described series as reverse escapism idea that fantasy characters would become interested in real life and would want to participate in it steven personifies love affair between fantasy and reality sugar said steven universe was influenced by anime series future boy conan revolutionary girl utena and simpsons steven universe according to eric thurm is a low key slice of life portrayal of childhood an examination of unconventional family dynamics a homage to anime video games and other pop culture mainstays and a straightforward kids show about superheroes jacob hope chapman of anime news network said anime series revolutionary girl utena and sailor moon are steven universes strongest influences visually and structurally reflected by its predominantly playful tone interrupted by crushing drama at key moments and its glorification of strengths of femininity dilution of gender barriers and emphasis on a wide variety of relationships between women aimed at a family audience steven universe also refers to japanese cultural icons including neon genesis evangelion akira cowboy bebop dragon ball z studio ghibli movies and junji ito s horror manga enigma of fault according to whitbrook series masterful sense of pace allows it to integrate foreshadowing and worldbuilding into scenes which makes an overarching dramatic narrative emerge from what might otherwise be monster of week episodes narration of a complex story from a child s perspective means its exposition remains artfully restrained growing in ambition with series and steven s character steven universes measured pace allows its characters to become more complex and interesting than most of their counterparts on prestige dramas developing as real people and not entities serving narrative functions series explores increasingly challenging facets of relationships such as possibility pearl may partially resent steven because he is reason his mother rose no longer exists and growing self destruction of pearl s all consuming passion for rose its action scenes such as estelle s song presenting climactic fight in jail break as a contest between garnet s loving relationship and jasper s lone wolf attitude are occasionally cast as philosophical arguments characters adams highlighted groundbreaking and inventive portrayal of complicated mentor caregiver older sibling dynamic between steven and crystal gems in a series which at its core is about sibling relationships thurm wrote that a notable emotional difference between steven universe and adventure time and regular show is that latter two series deal with their protagonists transitions to adulthood whereas during its first season steven universe was content to be enamored with simplicity of childhood steven slowly grows from being an obnoxious tag along child to an accepted member of crystal gems in his own right by end of first season a change brought about by increased insight and experience rather than age joe cain noted in mary sue that unlike heroes from antiquity hercules and modern fiction luke skywalker steven is defined by his mother s legacy rather than his father s preponderance of mother figures in series underscores their rarity in other fiction according to kat smalley of popmatters gems alien nature which prevents them from fully understanding world they protect is handled with remarkable depth and intellectual rigor even as they deal with human issues such as depression post traumatic stress and self loathing remaining from long past war for earth smalley characterized steven universe as part of a growing trend of cartoons that appeal to adults and children alike which includes avatar last airbender 2005 its sequel legend of korra 2012 adventure time 2010 and regular show 2010 this is reflected in series outreach to minorities that seldom appear elsewhere in animation and its broader themes instead of delivering genre typical mustache twirling villains steven universe deals with issues of extraordinary violence and horror depicts its characters in shades of grey and subtly plays with matters of philosophy morality and interpersonal conflicts all while refusing to reset any development to a status quo gender and sexuality thumb pearl left and steven s mother rose quartz embrace in a flashback shot edited out of british broadcast their past relationship is gradually seen to affect pearl s relationship with steven and those around him gender is at forefront of conversation surrounding steven universe according to erik adams of

girl protagonist without ridicule or losing his masculine side whitbrook characterized series as being about love all kinds of love including non traditional forms such as motherly and friendly bond between steven and gems and garnet as physical embodiment of a lesbian relationship when placing series on honor list of 2015 tiptree award which recognizes works of science fiction or fantasy that explore and expand gender roles jury wrote in context of children s television this show deals with gender in a much more open and mature way than is typical for genre and has some of best writing of any cartoon in addition to showing men and women who do not necessarily conform to standard american gender ideals show also gives us an agender non binary character and a thoughtful exploration of

characters with whom they identify ideal of fulfilling partnership and true love established as thing to aspire to by generations of disney cartoons extended to all during a 2016 panel discussion

colors represents a polyamorous relationship in july 2018 she told an interviewer that she created series s gems as non binary women in order to express herself as a non binary woman through them series reputation as one of most unabashedly queer shows on tv generated controversy in 2016 when cartoon network uk removed an embrace between rose and pearl but did not remove a kiss between rose
