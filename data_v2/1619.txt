thumb right usaf c 130 taking off from raaf base darwin for a mission to east timor logistical support of multinational international force east timor interfet peacekeeping mission in 1999 and 2000 was a highly complex and ultimately successful endeavour at its peak interfet included 11 693 personnel from 23 countries of these 5 697 were from australia making it largest deployment of australian forces overseas since vietnam war interfet was unusual in that it was led by australia casting country in a wholly unfamiliar role logistics and support areas of australian defence force adf had been subject to deep cuts in 1990s adf had not anticipated commitment to such a large peacekeeping mission and was unprepared to support an australian force projection of this size much less act as lead nation of an international coalition eleven nations contributed transport aircraft to interfet coalition airlift wing icaw which flew 3 400 sorties in support of interfet carried of cargo and transported more than 30 000 passengers but over 90 per cent of cargo and most of passengers travelled by sea transported by a naval task force that included high speed catamaran and landing ship which brought supplies from australia by sea crucial support came from replenishment oiler and tankers and a logistical base was established in darwin with supplies equipment stores and in many cases personnel stockpiled or staged there before being despatched to east timor by sea or air east timor posed significant challenges for logistical support there was only one deepwater port dili and it had a maximum quayside depth of just there were few beaches suitable for logistics over shore lots and just three airfields to give effect to an operational concept that involved flooding east timor with as many combat troops as possible troops were initially landed with a minimum of vehicles and logistical support logistical support units spent next two months catching up and eliminating backlogs effective logistical support enabled interfet to carry out its mission without severe limitations resulting from inadequate logistics although there were shortages of spare parts medical supplies and amenities background thumb right location of east timor portugal established a settlement in east timor in 1633 island was formally divided between netherlands and portugal in 1637 and first portuguese governor of east timor was appointed in 1702 for most of next three centuries eastern half of island was a portuguese colony there were revolts in 17th and 18th centuries and a major rebellion in 1911 during second world war east timor was occupied by australian and dutch forces and then invaded by japanese on 19 february 1942 australian commandos and dutch troops on island waged a guerrilla campaign until they withdrew in january 1943 after war ended australia supported indonesian independence from netherlands and proposed that east timor become a united nations un trusteeship but backed down in face of objections from united kingdom after its april 1974 carnation revolution portugal initiated a gradual decolonisation process and east timor descended into a civil war between supporters of timorese democratic union and fretilin in october 1974 indonesia began military operations to incorporate east timor fretilin unilaterally declared independence on 28 november 1975 in an attempt to forestall this but on 7 december indonesian forces invaded east timor indonesia s annexation of east timor was recognised by australia and united states but not by portugal or un most countries regarded it as un designated non self governing territory under indonesian control following a un brokered agreement between indonesia and portugal on 5 may 1999 a referendum was held on 30 august 1999 that offered a choice between autonomy within indonesia and full independence people voted overwhelmingly for latter a violent scorched earth policy was then carried out by pro indonesia militia supported by elements of indonesian national armed forces tni thumb left map of east timor united states declined to intervene in east timor there were concerns about economic and political consequences of a conflict with indonesia americans felt that in bosnian war united states had carried out most of risky missions and paid bulk of bills and that its allies should do more 1999 helms biden act restricted united states ability to provide military support to un on 15 september united nations security council resolution 1264 established an australian led and indonesian sanctioned peacekeeping force interfet to take all necessary measures to restore order in east timor president of united states bill clinton offered to contribute to force in a limited but essential way including communications and logistical aid intelligence air lifts of personnel and material and coordination of humanitarian response to tragedy this meant united states would play unfamiliar role of a subordinate member of a military coalition while australia played equally unfamiliar one of lead nation neither country s doctrine based on nato publications provided for this contingency thumb right dili area east timor posed significant challenges there was only one deepwater port dili and it had a maximum quayside depth of just greatly limiting its cargo capacity as average draught of a 1 000 container ship is about there were few beaches suitable for logistics over shore lots and just three airfields mountainous interior was characterised by steep narrow and poorly maintained roads susceptible to being cut by flooding during wet season a geographical complication was posed by oecussi enclave which was physically separate from rest of east timor population were poor and much infrastructure had been damaged or destroyed so little host nation support could be provided and interfet had to be entirely self supporting intention was that logistics would remain a national responsibility with each nation being responsible for logistical support of its own element in reality australia in its role of lead nation was called upon to provide all those capabilities not provided by other members of coalition most of these were in combat support and combat service support areas a decade of defence cuts in 1990s had fallen disproportionately on logistics and support areas of australian defence force adf as leadership attempted to preserve combat capability this was compounded by a defence policy of howard government that sought to maximise teeth to tail ratio on 11 march 1999 minister for defence john moore announced that administrative cuts had permitted an increase in readiness so that army s darwin based 1st brigade could be brought to 28 days notice to deploy same as townsville based 3rd brigade this he claimed would allow for a two brigade deployment to a trouble spot in asia pacific region at short notice with east timor specifically mentioned as a possibility but very same cuts in logistic capability rendered this impossible while cuts provided short term financial benefits far from increasing operational capability preferential allocation of resources to combat capabilities and acceptance of risk in logistics functions brought army to precipice of operational failure planning during july and august 1999 head of australian army s strategic command major general michael keating placed elements of adf on reduced notice to move logistical staffs in canberra sydney and brisbane were aware of this but were not authorised to top up units and depots with stocks purchase necessary special equipment or pre position units vehicles equipment or supplies such actions could be easily discovered and that might have strained already tense relations between australia and indonesia brigadier mark evans commander of 3rd brigade held a secret meeting of his subordinate commanders at his headquarters in townsville on 22 august lieutenant colonel mick kehoe commander of 10th force support battalion was not one of evans subordinates his unit was part of brigadier jeff wilkinson s logistic support force which based

planning sessions were attended by wilkinson s senior plans officer major cliff cole and major jim evans who had seen six months active service with british army s logistic headquarters in bosnian war was detached from command of an australian army reserve transport squadron to serve as wilkinson s liaison officer at dfjhq logistic support force was not designed to manage logistic support of forces deployed away from australia its mission was to command army s field force logistic units and it was in midst of a reorganisation in 1999 wilkinson anticipated being designated logistic component commander for operation spitfire responsible coordinating logistics of all three services but this did not occur until 26 august day before first troops began deploying to northern australia for operation to support operation spitfire kehoe detached a small group of specialists under captain phil macmaster to work with lieutenant colonel steve kinloch s 3rd brigade administrative support

operation warden commenced on 8 september organisation wilkinson and cousins agreed that a base at darwin was required to support operation spitfire and subsequent operations limitations of darwin s air and sea ports its facilities for storage and distribution of supplies and its information and communications networks were not overlooked however due to its isolation darwin had better facilities than other cities of similar size and adf s long standing presence in vicinity had engendered close relationships with local government and community on 28 august wilkinson appointed lieutenant

and of cargo adf movements staff not only had to find commercial airlift and sealift for deployment to east timor in a matter of days rather than months that it would usually require it also had to contend with difficulty of moving troops equipment and stores over vast distances of australia moving 10th force support battalion was a particular problem initial concept was that it should move overland from townsville to darwin and embark for east timor from there but staff with appropriate licences were not experienced in long haul operations and there was a high risk of loss of equipment in transit or in darwin while awaiting shipment movements officer in sydney found two vessels whose owners were willing to charter on short notice a grain ship and danish svendborg guardian a container ship neither was particularly suitable and crews spoke little english but with help of a local stevedore company ships were modified by installation of tie down restraints some of vehicles and equipment were moved directly from townsville to dili without loss another of vehicles and equipment had to be moved by road to darwin from whence it was shipped to dili in vessels that included singaporean and danish civilian ship atlantic thumb right during operation stabilise adf chartered seventeen commercial vessels to supplement its strategic lift capability all were foreign as department of defence did not feel that australian vessels offered best value for money operation put port of darwin under great strain and facilities were upgraded lifting wharf capacity to to reduce strain on darwin s facilities casualties were evacuated to other cities and where practical purchasing was conducted in sydney to avoid overburdening local suppliers darwin port authority which managed port with assistance of a lone adf liaison officer were able to increase port s turnover fourfold and no shipping delays occurred operations distribution in order to effect cosgrove s operational concept of flooding east timor with as many combat troops as possible evans deployed his brigade with a minimum of vehicles and logistical support unlike exercises conducted in northern australia in 1980s and 1990s logistical support would follow combat troops and not be pre positioned to receive them since operational situation was uncertain demand for items like ammunition and medical supplies could not be forecast plan therefore was to build up stockpiles in darwin from dnsdc in sydney and then forward them on demand to 10 fsb by air to comoro airport via icaw or by sea to port of dili by hmas jervis bay and tobruk 10 fsb would then distribute them to 3 basb or directly to troops to send supplies directly to dili would have resulted in their arrival without troops to receive them facilities to store them or transport to distribute them as had occurred in vietnam war in 1966 cousins set priorities on advice of colonel ash power cosgrove s operations officer contingency stocks were held offshore on hmas success adf cargo was tracked using three computer systems standard defence supply system sdss lotus notes interim demand system lnids and cargo visibility system cvs these had been employed by adf peace monitoring group in bougainville in 1994 and had been improved as a result of that experience problem of disjointed logistics systems had been recognised for years cvs was not used in operation warden as it could not handle large volumes of urgent requirements sdss was department of defence s preferred system but units in field preferred simpler lnids even for inventory items which it was not intended to handle mcmanus s flsg had responsibility for purchase receipt storage and forwarding of supplies from darwin he did not have sufficient operators trained in use of sdss and to track their movements and order items such as spare parts nor did he have sufficient personnel to prepare pallets or load aircraft and there were only four trained staff who were available to deal with what soon became a flood of mail he established an ad hoc unit called top end distribution squadron teds and leased some former military warehouses in darwin suburb of from their new owners where stocks could be held until called forward a terminal operations unit was created at raaf base darwin to handle air despatch he coordinated air delivery with no 395 expeditionary combat support wing and no 321 expeditionary combat support squadron raaf at raaf base darwin and sea delivery with naval base eventually some 120 personnel were assigned to flsg drawn from 9th and 10th force support battalions and 7th combat service support battalion kinloch was appointed commander land component support group and would be responsible for support of advance elements in dili until 10 fsb arrived sustainment thumb left first priority was water until engineer units with boring equipment arrived there was no potable water in dili each soldier had to carry a day s supply which meant on their backs another day s supply went with troops on their aircraft and ships as packaged water two water tankers each holding arrived on 21 september on landing craft these were used to refill jerry cans sent by sea and air hmas tobruk carried three trucks loaded with bottled water and jerry cans contingency stocks were held offshore on hmas success similarly cousins had each soldier carry a day s combat rations he anticipated that everyone would be eating combat rations for at least two and possibly three weeks additional rations were carried on hmas tobruk and jervis bay but first substantial resupply did not occur until tobruk returned on 26 september a contingency stock of 10 000 combat rations was held on hmas success foreign contingents had been instructed to bring 42 days supplies with them but most arrived requiring assistance with their immediate needs including catering transport and unloading their equipment and supplies first contingent of filipino troops arrived without rations or water fuel presented a problem because adf had no ship to shore refuelling capability naval units were sole source of diesel and aviation fuel for units in east timor for first three months of operation stabilise during which interfet consumed of fuel per day initially packaged fuel was flown from hmas success to heliport by ran westland sea king helicopters in collapsible fuel drums as underslung loads once army tanker trucks arrived in mid october they were driven onto landing craft from hard stand east of wharf taken out to hmas success and then refuelled while alongside this process took about five hours drivers of fuel and water tankers were invited to come aboard hmas success where they could take a shower enjoy a hot meal and have their clothes laundered while they waited for tanker to be refilled hmnzs endeavour ran a shuttle service to east timor from singapore or darwin typically replenishing hms success with of aviation fuel and of diesel fuel on each run endeavour returned home on 20 october followed by success which was relieved by which arrived with a sea king from 443 maritime helicopter squadron thumb right escorted by each soldier carried an initial supply of ammunition additional stocks arrived on hmas tobruk and jervis bay and contingency reserves were held on ships in dili harbour due to its weight ammunition resupply was by sea rather than by air for other items such as spare parts and medical supplies each unit was directed to bring 15 to 30 days supply with limited stocks of ammunition on hand 1 500 soldiers of 3rd brigade confronted some 15 000 tni troops who presumably had plenty of ammunition nor were air and sea bridges secure from interception tni had naval assets in area that included surface combatants and two type 209 submarines and intelligence sources reported that tni aircraft based in west timor included three bae systems hawks north american rockwell ov 10 broncos an aerospatiale sa 330 puma and a casa c 212 aviocar raaf lockheed p 3 orions kept a lookout for submarines and two mcdonnell douglas f a 18 hornets were kept on standby in case air defence or close air support missions were required supply plan was simple but finely tuned with little room for error it fell apart in first 48 hours medical personnel and supplies were unexpectedly delayed this was critical as it was not known whether there would be casualties there were unforeseen requirements like raaf personnel and equipment to run airport and unlike operation spitfire adf was not icaw s only customer there was political pressure to deploy media representatives and unamet personnel with their equipment and stores and remaining elements of 2 rar and 3 basb with their vehicles and stores and bottled water were pushed back in queue members of 3rd brigade who wanted to join their comrades in east timor were frustrated at seeing others boarding flights instead of themselves and subjected movements staff to abuse an abandoned fleet of land rover discovery vehicles was made available to interfet at unamet compound which partially offset 2 rar s vehicle shortage emergency stocks of water on hmas success had to be brought ashore immediately and 2 rar commandeered water that had been flown in as part of 3 basb s stocks when 3 rar arrived on jervis bay with 500 cartons of bottled water they handed over part of this stockpile to 2 rar dili baucau and los palos were secured by 4 october and interfet forces began moving into areas adjoining border with west timor first phase of this was operation lavarack in which 2 rar moved by air and armoured personnel carriers of b squadron 3rd 4th cavalry regiment by sea to occupy balibo which was secured on 5 october in middle of border between east and west timor was next on 10 october operation strand landings at suai on south coast commenced on 6 october then on 22 october operation respite began and secured isolated oecussi enclave finally on 21 november gurkhas landed on atauro island north of dili thumb left in 2014 it was imperative to get 10 fsb to dili before unit level supplies and reserves held by land component support group had been consumed a seven man reconnaissance party led by kehoe flew from townsville to darwin via brisbane on a qantas flight on 26 september and thence to dili on a french c 130 next day kehoe decided to establish 10 fsb at port despite risk involved in storing ammunition there he flew back to darwin to meet advance party who flew direct to darwin from garbutt airport on an air aircraft on 30 september and then travelled to dili overnight on hmas jervis bay main body followed by same route on 8 october colonel grant cavanaugh was appointed commander of logistic support hq he had arrived in dili on 24 september but had no staff and no authority over kinloch who was answerable to evans or mcmanus who was answerable to cosgrove to fill out cavanaugh s hq wilkinson stripped his own he was assisted by students from australian command and staff college who helped draw up a 40 page force level logistic operation order with 54 annexes deployment of 10 fsb was delayed due to a decision to give priority to unloading vehicles and stores of 5th 7th battalion royal australian regiment 5 7 rar and 10 fsb did not become operational until 20 october by 14 october apcs of b squadron 3rd 4th cavalry regiment were barely serviceable vehicles track pads had been worn down through three weeks of high tempo operations and there were no spare parts to conduct necessary maintenance or repairs some vehicles were while restrictions were imposed on use of others until remainder of b squadron arrived a week

works section deployed on 2 and 5 october between 10 and 13 october colonel ahmad mostafa conducted a detailed engineering reconnaissance of east timor and developed an engineering plan he identified three major engineering challenges first was roads 3rd combat engineer regiment devoted much of its time to maintaining roads and bridges but imminent rainy season threatened to make them impassable it also would potentially reduce interfet s vehicle and accommodation areas and airport to quagmires provision of handstands to prevent this was second challenge third was waste disposal human waste was being disposed of with hundreds of that had been brought from australia and were routinely emptied by sewage collection trucks dry waste was disposed of in a rubbish tip that had been established at comoro thumb right devastation in dili in february 2000 at an early stage it was appreciated that what little infrastructure there was in east timor was being destroyed by pro indonesia militia but there was no engineering staff at djfhq adf s engineering capability had been reduced by defence cuts but army still maintained two construction squadrons largely thanks to its involvement in aboriginal and torres strait islander commission s army community assistance program aacap which provided facilities for indigenous communities in remote areas in august 1999 17th construction squadron was in sydney on 180 days notice to move having just completed an aacap tour in queensland while 21st construction squadron was in rockhampton supporting crocodile 99 17th construction squadron was placed on 28 days notice to move on 13 september but was not given additional personnel to bring it up to full strength nor authorisation to requisition or purchase engineering stocks and equipment on 20 september it was given seven days notice to move only then was it topped up with 22 sappers from other units it was hoped that engineering requirements would be met by other nations but this did not occur appeals to contribute engineering units produced a construction troop from kenya which was due to arrive in late december advance party of 17th construction squadron assumed responsibility for main water point in dili from 3rd combat engineer regiment on 14 october and began looking for other water sources main body arrived in east timor with its 160 personnel and 130 vehicles on 26 october abandoned bores were restored and filters and installed giving both interfet personnel and civilian population access to a regular supply of clean drinking water major general des mueller s support command supplemented 17th construction squadron s equipment with a newly purchased rock crusher track mounted concrete batch plant and a cherry picker its task was complicated by unfilled requisitions which overburdened supply system could not meet thumb left dili helipad in february 2000 17th construction squadron s next priority was upgrading dili heliport to facilitate all weather operations heliport was located on low ground that was susceptible to flooding in wet season 198th works section produced a design that called for excavation of construction of hardstands and laying pierced aluminium plank for eleven helipads work was carried out by 17th construction squadron and took four weeks to complete at suai airstrip was upgraded to support all weather c 130 operations runway was extended by and a turning node added hardstands were provided along with accommodation workshops and five helipads mostafa was determined to have 21st construction squadron sent to east timor as well but senior department of defence officials were concerned that interfet was going beyond its mandate and developing east timor s infrastructure reason for not deploying engineer construction assets in first place finally on 8 november 21st construction squadron was ordered to send a plant troop group to east timor to assist in road maintenance with its numbers capped at 80 personnel main body arrived in dili on 3 december but ship carrying its heavy plant and equipment did not reach brisbane until 27 november and broke down several times en route work on roads finally commenced on 17 december 21st construction squadron repaired main route from dili to kenyan troop arrived on 26 december and worked on repairing roads to south after an initial downpour rainy season was not as severe as feared but departure of 3rd combat engineer regiment in mid january left no resources to maintain roads in border areas thumb right us and australian construction personnel at dili airport to resolve waste disposal problem 17th construction squadron erected atco ablution buildings with pump out septic tanks and an independent water supply laundry buildings were assembled with associated plumbing and electrical fittings and separate treatment facilities for black and grey water a solid waste disposal site was developed about from dili a semi permanent camp for up to 500 personnel with atco style accommodation was established at dili airport horizontal works were carried out by 17th construction squadron while no 381 expeditionary combat support squadron erected buildings finally 17th construction squadron built a facility for cleaning stores equipment and vehicles being returned to australia in order to comply with australia s strict quarantine regulations this facility had 20 bays with water tanks and pumps and associated electrical plumbing and water reticulation amenities by late october expectations that units in east timor could live more comfortably began to build in sydney lieutenant colonel dianne negotiated contracts for deliveries of fresh produce to be shipped from darwin and established a flexible resupply system for rations refrigerated containers generators and kitchen trailers were shipped to east timor allowing hot meals to be provided by 22 field kitchens six weeks after first troops arrived in dili yet many soldiers were still sleeping on ground there were still no laundry facilities so soldiers washed their clothes in old ration tins funds were provided to hire east timorese civilians to provide laundry facilities but some units were more successful than others in using them wisely thumb left upright australian troops come alongside at anchor off coast of dili east timor for a day of meetings and rest cousins pressed for tents and camping stores to be sent which support command in melbourne struggled to provide among competing priorities cosgrove assigned top priority to maintaining tempo of operations and second to building up stocks of food fuel water and ammunition in time for rainy season as a veteran of vietnam war where army had lived rough for longer periods he believed that troops could go without amenities for a bit longer land commander australia major general john hartley visited east timor on 4 and 5 november and produced a report that was highly critical of performance of treloar and mueller throughout november logistical personnel in australia and east timor worked to reduce backlogs build up stockpiles for rainy season and improve living conditions of troops in field flsg forwarded an average of of cargo per day and 60 refrigerated containers of fresh produce each week backlog of spare parts was overcome in early november and canteens and showers were available in balibo on 12 november 2 rar finally received a full complement of camp stores including tents chairs tables stretchers and duckboards on 15 december support hq assumed responsibility for support of forces in east timor helicopters unloading was difficult in primitive conditions of damaged ports in east timor especially at suai where there was no equipment to unload containers that canadians and new zealanders had brought their stores in containers had to be unloaded from hmas tobruk with one of its cranes onto a heavy landing craft to be picked up by a side loading truck when it reached shore this was neither quick nor safe a better solution would have been to unload with heavy lift helicopters but ran had none and australian army s ch 47 chinooks were grounded due to problems with transmissions australia theatre hq asked united states pacific command pacom for assistance on 29 september united states secretary of defense william cohen provided four ch 53 sea stallion helicopters from 31st marine expeditionary unit which operated from landing helicopter assault lha ship they were replaced on 5 october by helicopters of 11th marine expeditionary unit which flew from lha provided excellent maintenance support for helicopters and represented united states while not adding to us footprint ashore but deploying thousands of sailors and marines just to support four helicopters was uneconomical thumb one of two mi 8 medium lift helicopters from bulgaria is unloaded from a russian an 124 transport pacom turned to us army s logistics civil augmentation program two mi 8 and two mi 26 helicopters with air and maintenance crews were provided under contract by dyncorp operating helicopters ashore in upcoming monsoon season required construction of concrete helipads at dili airport but east timor lacked facilities to produce concrete all construction equipment required along with trained operators had to be brought in providing food for 100 personnel of air ground and construction crews and fuel for their vehicles and helicopters became an australian responsibility under bilateral acquisition and cross servicing agreement with united states australian theatre also helped with movement of personnel and equipment through pacom staging post in darwin two mi 8s along with their spare parts and a fuel tanker were flown from bulgaria to east timor in russian an 124 transport aircraft two mi 26s flew from russia under their own power a trip that took ten days between december 1999 and february 2000 four helicopters flew 475 hours without mishap carrying 6 400 passengers and 850 tons of cargo medical vaccination regime for japanese encephalitis proved effective and there were no recorded interfet cases main diseases affecting troops were dengue fever and malaria with 306 and 334 cases respectively both were endemic in east timor australian troops recorded 224 cases of dengue fever in east timor there was no vaccine although there was some evidence that japanese encephalitis vaccine was partially effective against dengue nor was there any treatment other than rest until patient recovered preventative measures for mosquito borne diseases like dengue and malaria included use of insect repellents permethrin treated mosquito nets and mosquito control measures such as spraying suspected breeding areas with insecticides a particular concern with dengue was that troops returning from east timor to bases in northern queensland might cause an outbreak in australia as area was receptive to dengue due to presence of its principal vector aedes aegypti mosquito nine confirmed cases were reported among soldiers in townsville who were closely monitored but none among civilian population one malaysian un observer died from malaria a prophylactic regime was instituted whereby personnel were given a daily dose of of doxycycline commencing two days before departure from australia and continuing for two weeks after returning for those who suffered adverse side effects a weekly dose of of mefloquine was substituted a terminal prophylaxis of of primaquine three times a day was administered for three weeks after return from australia in addition a small team from australian army malaria institute headed by major scott j kitchener went to dili as advisors subsequent trials of mefloquine in east timor in 2001 and 2002 found that about 6 5 per cent of soldiers suffered side effects from it mainly of a neuropsychiatric nature there are ongoing concerns about use of drug thumb left contract helicopters are parked at dili airfield note size of mi 26 heavy lift helicopter compared to c 130 hercules transport results showed that memory of previous campaigns had faded since 1975 at every level of command officers failed to supervise regimen and while most soldiers dutifully took their tablets some did not both plasmodium falciparum and plasmodium vivax are endemic in east timor and prevalence of malaria among civilian population was much greater than usual in september 2000 due to many people fleeing from violence into jungle where there was greater exposure to mosquitoes there were 64 cases of malaria among adf personnel in east timor since there was no evidence of resistance against doxycycline cause was either failure to take tablets or their deterioration under tropical conditions about two thirds of cases were falciparum remainder being vivax falciparum cases were treated with a combination of quinine mefloquine and doxycycline while vivax cases were treated with a combination of chloroquine and primaquine another 212 cases were reported from adf personnel after they returned to australia all were falciparum cases except for two who developed vivax within two weeks of return primaquine resistance has been documented in papua new guinea but not in east timor but terminal regimen was not as effective as hoped in any case it was only drug capable of eliminating malaria parasites from liver so cases were administered another course of chloroquine and primaquine it was noted that compliance with treatment was excellent among those who had already suffered an attack of malaria some 44 cases had a relapse eleven had a second relapse and two had a third interfet s medical resources were stretched by east timorese civilian population many of them children who had broken bones or infected wounds from edged weapons some had fractures that had been improperly set available medical supplies were insufficient to cope with demand and soldiers scrounged for medical supplies from abandoned clinics dili general hospital and tni stores in mid october interfet field surgical team opened interfet hospital in museum building with 55 beds and a range of medical and surgical services personnel for unit were drawn from army s 1st field hospital in brisbane and 6th raaf hospital in laverton victoria personnel had experience from operation deployment to papua new guinea to assist victims of 1998 tsunami while 80 per cent of admissions were of interfet personnel hospital also treated east timorese and other civilians interfet hospital maintained only fully equipped intensive care unit in dili less urgent cases were referred to french military hospital and dili general hospital which was run by red cross civil affairs thumb right civil military operations center interfet headquarters in dili in february 2000 over 72 000 civilians had returned to dili by early october mainly from surrounding area but increasingly from further afield dili stadium became focal point for delivery of humanitarian aid techniques honed in operation solace australian intervention in somalia in 1992 1993 were employed to avoid disturbances at food

civil military operations centre in dili on 25 september his ten person team was augmented with australians from interfet hq he coordinated relief efforts with united nations high commissioner for refugees unicef world food program red cross oxfam and other agencies in early november his team were replaced by a detachment from 322nd civil affairs brigade from hawaii when 3rd brigade moved to border areas adjoining west timor agencies struggled to supply aid to people there one relief organisation representative told a meeting that it would take two months for his only truck to move six tonnes of supplies to suai on east timor s south coast assuming that monsoonal rains did not wash roads away two ch 53s moved his supplies in one afternoon postal some members of 10th force support battalion had prior active service in rwanda and bougainville but volume of mail received in east timor came as a surprise delivered to australian field post office 5 in dili by forklift on large metal raaf l pallets volume of mail increased from a day on october to per day in early november as christmas approached families and friends took advantage of free mail delivery and from mid november volume of mail increased to per day jervis bay was employed to fetch incoming mail from darwin three times a week outgoing mail was dispatched to australia seven days a week as a result postal unit found themselves working from 14 to 16 hours a day coalition logistics at its peak interfet had 11 693 personnel from 23 countries of these 5 697 were from australia making it largest deployment of australian forces overseas since vietnam war but as major bronwyn worswick legal officer at flsg noted our logistics system is set up to supply us it s not set up to supply and sell basically to other countries when operations commenced formal arrangements regarding logistical support were in place only with united kingdom and new zealand contingents therefore arrived without a clear idea of what they would be called upon to pay for with potential for fractures in coalition over supplies and their cost recovery while there was a requirement for interfet to account for all stores issued for later cost recovery flsg adopted a policy that rigid accounting was not required from new zealand as they were such close allies two nations shared a similar operational culture in that immediate operational needs were considered paramount and worrying about details could be left for later this culture was not shared by asean nations who wanted their logistical support provided on a commercial basis some contingents attempted to run a cash based economy paying for minor items at point of acquisition south korean force went so far as to seek financial compensation for late delivery of rations australian fuel pumps did not have meters on them so it was difficult to measure how much fuel was provided to contingents nor were there procedures in place for capturing labour and materials required in servicing vehicles these had to be developed in theatre in guidelines for force contributing nations contingents were asked to arrive in australia self sufficient for forty two days this proved to be little more than a vain hope some contingents taking advantage of speed at which australians had assembled coalition arrived with little or no logistical support which they expected australia to provide in its role as lead nation crucial financial assistance came from japan which donated over usd 100 million due to limitations of australian computer systems it was not until september 2000 that adf s costs in supporting interfet could be tallied which hampered australian claims for reimbursement from un interfet trust fund end of mission thumb right cosgrove joins hands with new east timor leadership during a celebration to mark official handover from interfet to untaet indonesia recognised east timor as an independent nation on 19 october and tni forces withdrew on 31 october leaving interfet in charge between 1 and 23 february 2000 it transferred responsibility for administration of east timor to united nations transitional administration in east timor untaet on 20 february 2000 10th force support battalion handed over responsibility for support of forces in east timor along with its few remaining personnel there to 9th force support battalion australian logistical support was still required until untaet could stand on its own feet and logistical handover to untaet was not completed until 1 july 2000 retrospect east timor intervention revealed serious deficiencies in australian logistical capabilities there was no joint logistics doctrine and army ran and raaf had not practiced joint logistical operations in support of joint task forces important equipment such as ship to shore refuelling capability was lacking and there were insufficient and trailers to move shipping containers there were skills shortages in critical areas such as air and water terminal operations petroleum distribution supply clerks medical specialists and cooks notion that adf could shop for supplies like any other consumer was disproved with warehouses unable to cope with sudden demands for personal items stores equipment and spare parts us military aircraft had to fly in helmets and flak jackets from us sources logistical computer systems were designed to track cargo movements from one base to another in australia not to deployed forces personnel systems were not automated and there were four cases of underage personnel being sent to east timor it took 54 days before support command was ready to assume responsibility for east timor wilkinson described support of operations in east timor as a logistics environment that was about as easy as it gets theatre of operations was close to australia area involved and forces deployed were relatively small there was no high level combat and logistical units could perform their duties unhampered by enemy action situation stabilised once interfet boots were on ground and overburdened logistical system was not overwhelmed by urgent requests for high volumes of ammunition and other combat supplies whether by good luck or good management cosgrove had resources he needed to carry out his mission without severe limitations resulting from inadequate logistics while troops had good reason to be critical of a lack of spare parts medical supplies and amenities they still received logistical support on a scale that many other armies could only dream about notes references category military
