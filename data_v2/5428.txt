was a japanese convoy of world war ii convoy left shanghai on 17 april 1944 carrying two infantry divisions to reinforce japan s defensive positions in philippines and western new guinea united states navy usn submarines attacked convoy on 26 april and 6 may sinking four transports and killing more than 4 000 soldiers these losses caused convoy to be diverted to halmahera where surviving soldiers and their equipment were unloaded take ichi convoy s losses had important strategic results failure to bring two divisions to their destination without loss contributed to japanese imperial general headquarters decision to move japan s defensive perimeter back by divisions combat power was also blunted by their losses and while they both saw action against united states army forces they contributed little to japan s attempt to defend its empire background in september 1943 imperial japanese navy ijn and imperial japanese army ija agreed to establish defensive positions along what was termed japan s absolute zone of national defense zone s perimeter reached from marianas islands and caroline islands to western new guinea and banda and flores seas willoughby 1966 p 250 at this time there were few army units in area and it was decided to move combat units from china and manchuria to protect air bases which formed basis of japan s defensive plans movement of these troops was delayed by shipping shortages however willoughby 1966 pp 251 252 efforts to reinforce marianas and caroline islands were assigned highest priority and units selected for western new guinea remained in china until april 1944 when ships became available to transport them willoughby 1966 pp 257 258 and p 272 by early 1944 allied submarines were sinking large numbers of japanese ships their activities were frequently guided by ultra intelligence relating to ship movements which was collected by intercepting and decrypting encoded radio transmissions ijn routinely broadcast location and intended route of convoys under its protection and decrypting these messages allowed allied naval commanders to alert submarines in vicinity of convoys submarine commanders were free to plan their interception and attack where conditions were most favorable parillo 1993 pp 89 90 thumb left upright rear admiral sadamichi kajioka in 1944 ijn s faulty anti submarine doctrine also contributed to japan s shipping losses navy had placed a low priority on protecting merchant shipping from submarine attack before and during early years of war and convoys were not routinely assembled until 1943 parillo 1993 pp 133 134 grand escort headquarters was formed in late 1943 to coordinate convoys and implement a standard doctrine escort of convoy headquarters was also established in april 1944 to provide a pool of senior commanders who were available to command convoys though none had any experience with convoy operations or anti submarine warfare parillo 1993 pp 135 136 attacks on merchant shipping during february 1944 led japanese to change composition of their convoys during this month over ten percent of japanese merchant marine was sunk by submarines and air attack parillo 1993 p 137 these losses included several transport ships carrying reinforcements to marianas and carolines wise et al 2003 p 2001 p 20 in response grand escort fleet headquarters increased average size of japanese convoys from five ships to large convoys of 10 20 vessels this change allowed ijn to allocate more escort ships to each convoy and it was hoped that conducting fewer convoys would also reduce number of targets available to submarines while japanese officers attributed a drop in sinkings during march to changed tactics this was actually due to u s pacific fleet s submarines being diverted to support raids conducted by fast carrier task force that month parillo 1993 pp 137 139 take ichi convoy was assembled at shanghai in april 1944 its task was to carry 32nd division to mindanao and main body of 35th division to western new guinea willoughby 1966 p 272 both divisions had been formed in 1939 and were veterans of fighting in china during second sino japanese war madej 1981 p 60 and pp 62 63 one of 35th division s three infantry regiments was detached from division in early april and sent to palau islands arriving there later that month without loss smith 1953 p 459 two divisions embarked on large transport ships protected by an unusually strong escort force willoughby 1966 pp 272 273 rear admiral sadamichi kajioka who was a veteran of several previous operations including battle of wake island was appointed to command convoy escort force was newly established 6th escort convoy command and included kajioka s flagship coal burning minelayer as well as destroyers and frigate ocean escort ships kaibokan cd 20 and cd 22 minesweeper w 2 subchasers ch 37 and ch 38 and gunboats uji and tama maru no 7 voyage shanghai to manila thumb in december 1943 take ichi convoy sailed from shanghai bound for manila on 17 april parillo 1993 p 139 and initially comprised 15 transports and 6th escort convoy command seven of transports were traveling to manila only and 32nd and 35th divisions were each carried by four vessels allied code breakers decrypted radio signals relating to convoy s departure and subsequent intercepts allowed radio traffic analysts to follow its progress south blair 2001 p 1992 p 129 intelligence from intercepted radio signals was used to guide submarine toward convoy and she made contact with it off northwest coast of luzon on morning of 26 april submarine s captain commander later rear admiral tommy dykers attempted to maneuver into a position to attack convoy but lost contact when he was forced to evade a japanese submarine an aircraft sighted and attacked jack a few minutes later but convoy did not change course dykers regained contact at midday after sighting heavy smoke exhaust and surfaced an hour before sunset to get into an attack position he was forced to submerge however when another aircraft attacked submarine jack surfaced again after dark and successfully attacked after moon set dykers found that japanese escorts were alert and was unable to penetrate convoy as a result he attacked three times by firing a total of 19 torpedoes from long range into mass of ships at center of convoy these attacks sank 5 425 ton freighter ss yoshida maru no 1 which was carrying an entire regiment of 32nd division all 3 000 soldiers onboard drowned when ship sank quickly blair 2001 p 623 remaining japanese ships continued to manila arriving there on 29 april willoughby 1966 p 273 manila to halmahera 32nd division s destination changed during voyage from shanghai to manila imperial general headquarters was concerned that increasing difficulty of shipping units towards front line meant that it would not be possible to complete planned reinforcement of absolute zone of national defense before allied forces reached area as a result it was decided to use division to reinforce second army in western new guinea and eastern netherlands east indies nei which were under direct threat of attack rather than send it to mindanao thumb left upright in march 1944 take ichi convoy resumed its journey to new guinea on 1 may its composition was now eight transports one of manila bound transports having replaced yoshida maru under protection of minesweeper w 22 ch 37 and ch 38 convoy took a special route planned by third southern expeditionary fleet to reduce risk of submarine attack u s signals intelligence operators again detected convoy s departure on 2 may analysts estimated its size as nine transports and seven escorts carrying 12 784 troops of 32nd division and an unknown number of men from 35th division decoded japanese army water transport code messages also provided allies with convoy s route speed daily noon positions and destination this extraordinary intelligence coup was passed to relevant commands on 2 may and usn positioned submarines to ambush japanese ships drea 1992 p 130 take ichi convoy suffered a devastating submarine attack on 6 may on that day intercepted japanese ships in celebes sea near northeastern tip of celebes gurnards captain commander herb andrews submerged his boat and made a cautious approach to avoid detection by aircraft he reached a firing position four hours later and fired six torpedoes at two transports only one of these torpedoes struck its mark and a second salvo missed its intended targets but hit another transport andrews then turned his boat and fired further torpedoes from gurnard s stern torpedo tubes which hit a third transport one of japanese destroyers counterattacked gurnard and forced andrews to break off his attack destroyer was traveling at too great a speed for its detection gear to function however and did not damage submarine despite dropping approximately 100 depth charges parillo 1993 p rose to periscope depth two hours later and found that a major effort to rescue troops and equipment from torpedoed transports was under way that night submarine torpedoed one of crippled transports which was still afloat gurnards attack sank transports aden maru 5 825 tons and maru 6 995 tons as well as cargo ship 6 886 tons while rescue effort was relatively successful 1 290 troops were killed and much of their equipment was lost due to its heavy losses take ichi convoy was ordered to dock at halmahera in eastern nei rather than continue to new guinea surviving ships arrived there on 9 may both divisions and their equipment were unloaded and convoy sailed for manila on 13 may arriving on 20 may without further loss aftermath attacks on take ichi convoy blunted 32nd and 35th divisions fighting power 32nd division s combat elements were reduced from nine to five infantry battalions and from four to one and a half artillery battalions madej 1981 p 60 only four of six 35th division infantry battalions which sailed in convoy reached halmahera and much of division s artillery was lost destruction of take ichi convoy also forced japanese leadership to acknowledge that it was no longer possible to reinforce or defend most of western new guinea while second area army s commander lieutenant general korechika anami requested that surviving ships attempt to carry 35th division to new guinea this was rejected by imperial general headquarters losses inflicted on convoy also contributed to imperial general headquarters decision to move perimeter of absolute zone of national defense back to a line extending from sorong to halmahera willoughby 1966 p 274 this represented a strategic withdrawal from perimeter which had been planned in march smith 1953 p 233 japanese naval staff officers gathered in manila in june to analyze take ichi convoy officers believed that japan s communication codes were secure and discussed alternative explanations for convoy s detection these explanations included increase in radio signals at time convoy sailed being detected by allied radio traffic analysts a japanese officer in manila accidentally divulging information and allied spies working on manila waterfront radioing messages about convoy s composition and departure meeting concluded that allied spies were responsible for convoy s detection and japanese military s codes were not changed drea 1992 pp 130 131 some of surviving elements of 32nd and 35th divisions later saw action against american forces 35th division was moved forward from halmahera to sorong in small ships during may regiment which had been sent to palaus in april was also successfully transferred to new guinea smith 1953 p 460 elements of 35th division subsequently fought in battles of biak and but most of division was stationed on vogelkop peninsula where it was isolated from september 1944 smith 1953 p 263 pp 443 444 and p 449 32nd division was retained at halmahera to garrison island much of division later saw action on neighboring island of morotai where it suffered heavy losses while trying to counterattack an allied force which had established a base there during september and october
