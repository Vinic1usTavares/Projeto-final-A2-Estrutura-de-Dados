british aircraft corporation tsr 2 for tactical strike and reconnaissance 2 was a cancelled cold war strike and reconnaissance aircraft developed by british aircraft corporation bac for royal air force raf in late 1950s and early 1960s tsr 2 was designed to penetrate a well defended forward battle area at low altitudes and very high speeds and then attack high value targets in rear with

design of a replacement for de havilland mosquito at that time among world s leading light bombers mosquito had been designed with express intent of lightening aircraft in order to improve its speed as much as possible a process that led to removal of all defensive armament improving performance to point where it was unnecessary anyway this high speed approach was extremely successful and a jet powered version would be even more difficult to intercept wynn 1997 pp 65 68 this led to air ministry specification e 3 45 winning design canberra also dispensed with defensive armaments producing a design with speed and altitude that allowed it to fly past most defences design s long straight wing gave it lift needed to operate at very high altitudes placing it above range where even jet powered fighters were able to intercept it canberra could simply fly over its enemy with relative impunity a quality that made it naturally suited to aerial reconnaissance missions design was so successful that it was licensed for production in united states one of very few such cases martin rb and f american built reconnaissance subtypes further extended wings up to a 37 5 span compared to much more

technology of day requiring a supersonic all weather aircraft that could deliver nuclear weapons over a long range operate at high level at mach 2 or low level at mach 1 2 with stol or possible vtol performance thornborough 2005 p 6 latter requirement was a side effect of common battle plans from 1950s which suggested that nuclear strikes in opening stages of war would damage most runways and airfields meaning that aircraft would need to take off from rough fields such as disused second world war airfields or even sufficiently flat and open areas of land buttler 1995 p 13 specifically requirement included delivery of tactical nuclear weapons at low level in all weathers by day and night photo reconnaissance at medium level day and low level day and night electronic reconnaissance
