bovidae are biological family of cloven hoofed ruminant mammals that includes bison african buffalo water buffalo antelopes wildebeest impala gazelles sheep goats muskoxen and domestic cattle a member of this family is called a bovid with 143 extant species and 300 known extinct species family bovidae consists of eight major subfamilies apart from disputed peleinae and pantholopinae family evolved 20 million years ago in early miocene bovids show great variation in size and pelage colouration excepting some domesticated forms all male bovids have two or more horns and in many species females possess horns too size and shape of horns vary greatly but basic structure is always one or more pairs of simple bony protrusions without branches often having a spiral twisted or fluted form each covered in a permanent sheath of keratin most bovids bear 30 to 32 teeth most bovids are diurnal social activity and feeding usually peak during dawn and dusk bovids typically rest before dawn during midday and after dark they have various methods of social organisation and social behaviour which are classified into solitary and gregarious behaviour bovids use different forms of vocal olfactory and tangible communication most species alternately feed and ruminate throughout day while small bovids forage in dense and closed habitat larger species feed on high fiber vegetation in open grasslands most bovids are polygynous mature bovids mate at least once a year and smaller species may even mate twice in some species neonate bovids remain hidden for a week to two months regularly nursed by their mothers in other species neonates are followers accompanying their dams rather than tending to remain hidden greatest diversities of bovids occur in africa maximum concentration of species is in savannas of eastern africa other bovid species also occur in europe asia and north america bovidae includes three of five domesticated mammals whose use has spread outside their original ranges namely cattle sheep and goats dairy products such as milk butter and cheese are manufactured largely from domestic cattle bovids also provide leather meat and wool etymology name bovidae was given by british zoologist john edward gray in 1821 word bovidae is combination of prefix originating from latin bos ox through late latin and suffix idae taxonomy family bovidae is placed in order artiodactyla which includes even toed ungulates it includes 143 extant species accounting for nearly 55 of ungulates and 300 known extinct species molecular studies have supported monophyly in family bovidae a group of organisms comprises an ancestral species and all their descendants number of subfamilies in bovidae is disputed with suggestions of as many as ten and as few as two subfamilies however molecular morphological and fossil evidence indicates existence of eight distinct subfamilies aepycerotinae consisting of just impala alcelaphinae bontebok hartebeest wildebeest and relatives antilopinae several antelopes gazelles and relatives bovinae cattle buffaloes bison and other antelopes caprinae goats sheep ibex and relatives cephalophinae duikers hippotraginae addax oryx and relatives and reduncinae reedbuck and kob antelopes in addition three extinct subfamilies are known mid miocene and subfamily which contains mid miocene in 1992 alan w gentry of natural history museum london divided eight major subfamilies of bovidae into two major clades on basis of their evolutionary history boodontia which comprised only bovinae and aegodontia which consisted of rest of subfamilies have somewhat primitive teeth resembling those of oxen whereas have more advanced teeth like those of goats a controversy exists about recognition of peleinae and comprising genera pelea and pantholops respectively as subfamilies in 2000 american biologist george and palaeontologist elisabeth vrba suggested inclusion of pelea in reduncinae though grey sole species of pelea is highly different from kobs and reduncines in morphology pantholops earlier classified in antilopinae was later placed in its own subfamily pantholopinae however molecular and morphological analysis supports inclusion of pantholops in caprinae below is a cladogram based on et al 1997 and gentry et al 1997 evolution early miocene and before thumbnail skull of eotragus a species of ancient bovid genus eotragus in early miocene bovids began diverging from cervids deer and giraffids earliest bovids whose presence in africa and eurasia in latter part of early miocene 20 mya has been ascertained were small animals somewhat similar to modern gazelles and probably lived in woodland environments eotragus earliest known bovid weighed and was nearly same in size as thompson s gazelle early in their evolutionary history bovids split into two main clades boodontia of eurasian origin and aegodontia of african origin this early split between boodontia and aegodontia has been attributed to continental divide between these land masses when these continents were later rejoined this barrier was removed and either group expanded into territory of other tribes bovini and tragelaphini diverged in early miocene bovids are known to have reached americas in pleistocene by crossing bering land bridge present genera of alcelaphinae appeared in pliocene extinct alcelaphine genus that was same in size as hartebeest is believed to have come into being in pliocene but became extinct in middle pleistocene several genera of hippotraginae are known since pliocene and pleistocene this subfamily appears to have diverged from alcelaphinae in latter part of early miocene bovinae are believed to have diverged from rest of bovidae in early miocene boselaphini became extinct in africa in early pliocene their latest fossils were excavated in langebaanweg south africa and lothagam kenya middle miocene middle miocene marked spread of bovids into china and indian subcontinent according to vrba radiation of subfamily alcelaphinae began in latter part of middle miocene caprinae tribes probably diverged in early middle miocene emerged in middle miocene and seem to have been replaced by other bovids and cervids in eurasia earliest fossils of are from middle miocene though studies show existence of subfamily from early miocene speciation occurred in tribe during middle or upper miocene mainly in eurasia tribe neotragini seems to have appeared in africa by end of miocene and had become widespread by pliocene late miocene by late miocene around 10 mya bovids rapidly diversified leading to creation of 70 new genera this late miocene radiation was partly because many bovids became adapted to more open grassland habitats aepycerotinae first appeared in late miocene and no significant difference in sizes of primitive and modern impala has been noted fossils of a tribe of caprinae in africa date back to late miocene earliest fossils date back to late miocene and were excavated from sites such as lothagam and awash valley first african fossils of reduncinae date back to 6 7 mya reduncinae and peleinae probably diverged in mid miocene characteristics thumbnail bovids have unbranched horns all bovids have similar basic form a snout with a blunt end one or more pairs of horns generally present on males immediately after oval or pointed ears a distinct neck and limbs and a tail varying in length and among species most bovids exhibit sexual dimorphism with males usually larger as well as heavier than females sexual dimorphism is more prominent in medium to large sized bovids all bovids have four toes on each foot they walk on central two hooves while outer two dewclaws are much smaller and rarely touch ground bovids show great variation in size gaur can weigh as much as and stands high at shoulder water buffalo can be even heavier and weigh though it is shorter than gaur being at most tall royal antelope in sharp contrast is only tall and weighs at most klipspringer another small antelope stands at shoulder and weighs just differences occur in pelage colouration ranging from a pale white as in arabian oryx to black as in black wildebeest however only intermediate shades such as brown and reddish brown as in reedbuck are commonly observed in several species females and juveniles exhibit a light coloured coat while those of males darken with age as in wildebeest coat may be marked with prominent or faint stripes in some species such as addax coat colour can vary by season scent glands and sebaceous glands are often present thumb left gemsbok has conspicuous markings on its face which conceal eye and on its legs these may have a role in communication some species such as gemsbok sable antelope and grant s gazelle are camouflaged with strongly disruptive facial markings that conceal highly recognisable eye many species such as gazelles may be made to look flat and hence to blend into background by countershading outlines of many bovids are broken up with bold disruptive colouration strongly contrasting patterns helping to delay recognition by predators however all hippotraginae including gemsbok have pale bodies and faces with conspicuous markings zoologist tim caro describes this as difficult to explain but given that species are diurnal he suggests that markings may function in communication strongly contrasting leg colouration is common only in bovidae where for example bos ovis bontebok and gemsbok have white stockings again communication is likely function excepting some domesticated forms all male bovids have horns and in many species females too possess horns size and shape of horns vary greatly but basic structure is a pair of simple bony protrusions without branches often having a spiral twisted or fluted form each covered in a permanent sheath of keratin although horns occur in a single pair on almost all bovid species there are exceptions such as four horned antelope and jacob sheep unique horn structure is only unambiguous morphological feature of bovids that distinguishes them from other a high correlation exists between horn morphology and fighting behaviour of individual for instance long horns are intended for wrestling and fencing whereas curved horns are used in ramming males with horns directed inwards are monogamous and solitary while those with horns directed outwards tend to be polygynous these results were independent of body size male horn development has been linked to sexual selection horns are small spikes in monogamous duikers and other small antelopes whereas in polygynous they are large and elaborately formed for example in a spiral structure as in giant eland thus to some extent horns depict degree of competition among males in a species however presence of horns in females is likely due to natural selection horns of females are usually smaller than those of males and are sometimes of a different shape horns of female bovids are believed to have evolved for defence against predators or to express territoriality as nonterritorial females which are able to use crypsis for predator defence often do not have horns females possess horns only in half of bovid genera and females in these genera are heavier than those in rest females use horns mainly for stabbing thumb american bison skeleton museum of osteology anatomy thumbnail dental pad of a domestic bovid note absence of upper incisors and canines and outward projection of lower teeth in bovids third and fourth are combined into cannon bone ulna and fibula are reduced and fused with radius and tibia respectively long scapulae are present whereas clavicles are absent being ruminants stomach is composed of four chambers rumen 80 omasum reticulum and abomasum ciliates and bacteria of rumen ferment complex cellulose into simpler fatty acids which are then absorbed through rumen wall bovids have a long small intestine length of small intestine in cattle is body temperature fluctuates through day for instance in goats temperature can change slightly from nearly in early morning to in afternoon temperature is regulated through sweating in cattle whereas goats use panting for same right lung consisting of four to five lobes is around 1 5 times larger than left which has three lobes dentition most bovids bear 30 to 32 teeth while upper incisors are absent upper canines are either reduced or absent instead of upper incisors bovids have a thick and tough layer of tissue called dental pad that provides a surface to grip grasses and foliage they are hypsodont and since molars and premolars are low crowned and crescent shaped cusps lower incisors and canines project forward incisors are followed by a long toothless gap known as diastema general dental formula for bovids is most members of family are herbivorous but most duikers are omnivorous like other ruminants bovids have four chambered stomachs which allow them to digest plant material such as grass that cannot be used by many other animals ruminants and some others like kangaroos rabbits and termites are able to use micro organisms living in their guts to break down cellulose by fermentation ecology and behaviour thumb blackbuck antelopes bovids have various methods of social organisation and social behaviour which are classified into solitary and gregarious behaviour further these types may each be divided into territorial and nonterritorial behaviour small bovids such as klipspringer and are generally solitary and territorial they hold small territories into which other members of species are not allowed to enter these antelopes form monogamous pairs many species such as dik dik use pheromone secretions from preorbital glands and sometimes dung as well to mark their territories offspring disperse at time of adolescence and males need must acquire territories prior to mating bushbuck is only bovid that is both solitary and not territorial this antelope hardly displays aggression and tends to isolate itself or form loose herds though in a favourable habitat several bushbuck may be found quite close to one another excluding duikers tragelaphines spiral horned antelopes and most african bovids are gregarious and territorial males are forced to disperse on attaining sexual maturity and must form their own territories while females are not required to do so males that do not hold territories form bachelor herds competition takes place among males to acquire dominance and fights tend to be more rigorous in limited rutting seasons with exception of migratory males males generally hold same territory throughout their lives in waterbuck some male individuals known as satellite males may be allowed into territories of other males and have to wait till owner grows old so they may acquire his territory lek mating where males gather together and competitively display to potential mates is known to exist among kobs and tragelaphines cattle sheep and goats are gregarious and not territorial in these species males must gain absolute dominance over all other males and fights are not confined to territories males therefore spend years in body growth activity thumbnail left blue wildebeest fighting for dominance most bovids are diurnal although a few such as buffalo bushbuck reedbuck and grysbok are exceptions social activity and feeding usually peak during dawn and dusk bovids usually rest before dawn during midday and after dark grooming is usually by licking with tongue rarely do antelopes roll in mud or dust wildebeest and buffalo usually wallow in mud whereas hartebeest and topi rub their heads and horns in mud and then smear it over their bodies bovids use different forms of vocal olfactory and tangible communication these involve varied postures of neck head horns hair legs and ears to convey sexual excitement emotional state or alarm one such expression is flehmen response bovids usually stand motionless with head high and an intent stare when they sense danger some like impala kudu and eland can even leap to heights of a few feet bovids may roar or grunt to caution others and warn off predators bovids such as gazelles stot or in response to predators making high leaps on stiff legs indicating honestly both that predator has been seen and that stotting individual is strong and not worth chasing thumb stotting or by a young springbok signals honestly to predators such as cheetahs that it is a fit and fast individual not worth chasing in mating season rutting males bellow to make their presence known to females muskoxen roar during male male fights and male force air through their noses producing a roar to deter rival males and attract females mothers also use vocal communication to locate their calves if they get separated during fights over dominance males tend to display themselves in an erect posture with a level muzzle fighting techniques differ amongst bovid families and also depend on their build while hartebeest fight on knees others usually fight on all fours gazelles of various sizes use different methods of combat gazelles usually box and in serious fights may clash and fence consisting of hard blows from short range ibex goat and sheep males stand upright and clash into each other downwards wildebeest use powerful head butting in aggressive clashes if horns become entangled opponents move in a circular manner to unlock them muskoxen will ram into each other at high speeds as a rule only two bovids of equal build and level of defence engage in a fight which is intended to determine superior of two individuals that are evidently inferior to others would rather flee than fight for example immature males do not fight with mature bulls generally bovids direct their attacks on opponent s head rather than its body s shaped horns such as those on impala have various sections that help in ramming holding and stabbing serious fights leading to injury are rare diet thumbnail left bovids are herbivores feeding on grass foliage and plant products most bovids alternately feed and ruminate throughout day while those that feed on concentrates feed and digest in short intervals roughage feeders take longer intervals only small species such as duiker browse for a few hours during day or night feeding habits are related to body size while small bovids forage in dense and closed habitat larger species feed upon high fiber vegetation in open grasslands subfamilies exhibit different feeding strategies while bovinae species graze extensively on fresh grass and diffused forage cephalophinae species with exception of primarily consume fruits reduncinae and hippotraginae species depend on unstable food sources but latter are specially adapted to arid areas members of caprinae being flexible feeders forage even in areas with low productivity tribes and have high proportions of monocots in their diets on contrary tragelaphini and neotragini with exception of feed extensively on dicots no conspicuous relationship exists between body size and consumption of monocots sexuality and reproduction thumbnail juvenile sheep lamb near its mother most bovids are polygynous in a few species individuals are monogamous resulting in minimal male male aggression and reduced selection for large body size in males thus sexual dimorphism is almost absent females may be slightly larger than males possibly due to competition among females for acquisition of territories this is case in duikers and other small bovids time taken for attainment of sexual maturity by either sex varies broadly among bovids sexual maturity may even precede or follow mating for instance impala males though sexually mature by a year can mate only after four years of age on contrary barbary sheep females may give birth to offspring even before they have gained sexual maturity delay in male sexual maturation is more visible in sexually dimorphic species particularly reduncines probably due to competition among males for instance blue wildebeest females become capable of reproduction within a year or two of birth while males become mature only when four years old all bovids mate at least once a year and smaller species may even mate twice mating seasons occur typically during rainy months for most bovids as such breeding might peak twice in equatorial regions sheep and goats exhibit remarkable seasonality of reproduction in determination of which annual cycle of daily photoperiod plays a pivotal role other factors that have a significant influence on this cycle include temperature of nutritional status social interactions date of parturition and lactation period a study of this phenomenon concluded that goats and sheep are short day breeders mating in most sheep breeds begins in summer or early autumn mating in sheep is also affected by melatonin that advances onset of breeding season and thyroxine that terminates breeding season estrus lasts for at most a day in bovids with exception of bovines and tragelaphines except hartebeest and topi all bovids can detect estrus in females by testing urine using vomeronasal organ once male is assured that female is in estrus he begins courtship displays these displays vary greatly from elaborate marches among gregarious species to fervent licking of female genitalia among solitary species females initially not receptive ultimately mates with male which has achieved dominance over others receptiveness is expressed by permission for mounting by male and setting aside tail by female copulation generally takes a few seconds gestational period varies among bovids while duiker gestation ranges from 120 to 150 days gestation in african buffalo ranges from 300 to 330 days usually a single offspring is born twins are less frequent and it is able to stand and run by itself within an hour of birth in monogamous species males assist in defending their young but that is not case in polygynous species most newborn calves remain hidden for a week to two months regularly nursed by their mothers in some bovid species neonates start following about their mothers immediately or within a few days as in impala different bovids have different strategies for defence of juveniles for instance while wildebeest mothers solely defend their young buffaloes exhibit collective defence weaning might occur as early as two months as in royal antelope or as late as a year as in muskox lifespan most wild bovids live for 10 to 15 years larger species tend to live longer for instance american bison can live up to 25 years and gaur up to 30 years mean lifespan of domesticated individuals is nearly ten years for example domesticated goats have an average lifespan of 12 years usually males mainly in polygynous species have shorter lifespans than females this can be attributed to several reasons early dispersal of young males aggressive male male fights vulnerability to predation particularly when males are less agile as in kudu and malnutrition being large in size male body has high nutritional requirements which may not be satisfied richard despard estes suggested that females mimic male secondary sexual characteristics like horns to protect their male offspring from dominant males this feature seems to have been strongly selected to prevent male mortality and imbalanced sex ratios due to attacks by aggressive males and forced dispersal of young males during adolescence distribution thumbnail eland occur in grasslands of africa most of diverse bovid species occur in africa maximum concentration is in savannas of eastern africa depending on their feeding habits several species have radiated over large stretches of land and hence several variations in dental and limb morphology are observed duikers inhabit equatorial rainforests sitatunga and lechwe occur near swamps eland inhabit grasslands springbok and oryx occur in deserts bongo and anoa live in dense forests and mountain goats and takin live at high altitudes a few bovid species also occur in europe asia and north america sheep and goats are found primarily in eurasia though barbary sheep and ibex form part of african fauna muskox is confined to arctic tundra several bovid species have been domesticated by human beings domestication of goats and sheep began 10 thousand years ago while cattle were domesticated about 7 5 thousand years ago interaction with humans domesticated animals right thumb 200px zebu oxen in mumbai domestication of bovids has contributed in shifting dependence of human beings from hunting and gathering to agriculture bovidae include three of five large domesticated herbivores whose use has spread outside their original ranges namely cattle sheep and goats all are from eurasia and are now found across world other two species are horse and pig other large bovids that have been domesticated but which remain within ranges of their wild ancestors are water buffalo from indian water buffalo domestic yak from wild yak zebu from indian aurochs from gaur and bali cattle from banteng some antelopes have been domesticated including scimitar oryx addax elands and extinct bubal hartebeest in ancient egypt and bubal are depicted in carved walls earliest evidence of cattle domestication is from 8000 bc suggesting that process began in cyprus and euphrates basin animal products thumb left merino wool is most valued with great fineness and softness dairy products such as milk butter ghee yoghurt buttermilk and cheese are manufactured largely from domestic cattle though milk of sheep goat yak and buffalo is also used in some parts of world and for gourmet products for example buffalo milk is used to make in italy and gulab jamun dessert in india while sheep milk is used to make blue roquefort cheese in france beef is an excellent source of zinc selenium phosphorus iron and b vitamins bison meat is lower in fat and cholesterol than beef but has a higher protein content bovid leather is tough and durable with additional advantage that it can be made into leathers of varying thicknesses from soft clothing leather to hard shoe leather while goat and cattle leather have a wide variety of use sheepskin is suited only for clothing purposes wool from merino is finest and most valuable merino wool is long and very soft coarse wools being durable and resistant to pilling are used for making tough garments and carpets thumb drinking horn made by jonsson of iceland 1598 bone meal is an important fertilizer rich in calcium phosphorus and nitrogen effective in removing soil acidity bovid horns have been used as drinking vessels since antiquity in human culture bovidae have featured in stories since at least time of aesop s fables from ancient greece around 600 bc fables by aesop include crow and sheep frog and ox and wolf and lamb mythological creature chimera depicted as a lion with head of a goat arising from its back and a tail that might end with a snake s head was one of offspring of typhon and echidna and a sibling of such monsters as cerberus and lernaean hydra sheep synonymous with goat in chinese
