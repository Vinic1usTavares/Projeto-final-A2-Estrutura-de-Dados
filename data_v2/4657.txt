eventually decided to write film as a character study developing susie into a feisty wild card looking for something more from her life susie is portrayed by american actress michelle pfeiffer who was first offered role five years before production only to decline it on several occasions despite being one of most sought after film actresses at time due to her recent academy award nominated performance in dangerous liaisons 1988 some studio executives feared that pfeiffer was still too obscure to attract a significant audience on her own having already known her personally pfeiffer was first actor kloves expressed interest in casting in fabulous baker boys he eventually focused on casting real life brothers jeff and beau bridges as eponymous baker boys once establishing contact with pfeiffer proved difficult however kloves script continued to struggle without an actress playing susie during this time actress debra winger and singer madonna were both considered for role latter of whom turned it down because she felt that kloves script was too mushy actresses jodie foster and jennifer jason leigh had also expressed interest in part but kloves was eventually able to contact pfeiffer maintaining that she is only actress that he himself had ever considered for role although actress enjoyed both script and character with whom she identified emotionally she was hesitant to commit to another role so soon after having just having recently completed several film projects in a row initially intending to go on hiatus after filming dangerous liaisons due to exhaustion thus kloves spent one week visiting pfeiffer at her home until she finally relented prior to fabulous baker boys most of pfeiffer s roles had been rather unglamorous pfeiffer claims that she typically avoided playing glamorous characters because she found most of them uninteresting until she discovered susie pfeiffer accepted role because she thought susie was a great woman someone i really wanted to be like film critic mike d angelo writing for dissolve believes that pfeiffer decided to accept role of susie because she was still embarrassed by her performance in unsuccessful musical grease 2 1982 and wanted to prove that she was in fact capable of playing a character who was a combination of both sandy olsson and betty rizzo from grease 1978 at same time pfeiffer provides all of her character s vocals for both film and its soundtrack because she does not consider herself a professional singer pfeiffer s inhibitions about singing on camera initially contributed to her early reservations about accepting role having not done so since her performance in grease 2 fabulous baker boys would mark pfeiffer s first professional singing role in seven years despite kloves insistence that pfeiffer s singing voice not be dubbed composer dave grusin was initially skeptical about pfeiffer s musical abilities until she ultimately convinced him with her rendition of my funny valentine for four months although sources differ citing any period of time between two months to an entire year actress took extensive singing lessons under tutelage of voice coach sally stevens in preparation for role at suggestion of grusin in addition to performing vocal exercises to strengthen her vocal chords pfeiffer would often work 10 hour days in recording studio before finally returning home to listen to and study her own recordings already impressed with pfeiffer s rhythm and phrasing stevens trained actress to avoid pronouncing words in ways that would make film s jazz standards sound too much like rock songs stevens pfeiffer s original pronunciation to musician bob dylan and recording songs for pfieffer to use as reference for enunciation teaching actress about using her teeth and mouth to pronounce words and smiling to lift her pitch admitting that film s songs were much more difficult than ones she had performed in grease 2 pfeiffer worked especially hard on improving her phrasing because material for fabulous baker boys were different than pop music she had grown more accustomed to singing explaining those older songs were written for singers they weren t written for synthesizers and drums it was an entirely new way of listening to songs additionally actress drew inspiration from real life lounge singers performing at hollywood roosevelt hotel in los angeles while listening to jazz singers sarah vaughan dinah washington rickie lee jones billie holiday and helen merrill for inspiration maintaining i didn t copy anybody but i heard a lot for me it helps to act song out pfeiffer incorporated undercurrent of anger in lounge singer s performances drawn from fact that a lot of club singers haven t had recognition they feel they deserve or that they had hoped for into her own interpretation of susie stevens encouraged pfeiffer to envision herself as ingrid bergman s character ilsa lund in film casablanca 1942 while recording more than you know for film s soundtrack which actress identified as one of her favorite songs stevens also suggested that pfeiffer research jazz singer ella fitzgerald because fitzgerald possesses a quality artists of that period had that we felt character susie might have listened to describing end result as an airy alto a nice breathy quality and intelligence in delivery despite her extensive training vocal coach felt it was important that susie s voice sound pleasant but still untrained kloves maintains that he did not hire pfeiffer based on her singing abilities but rather because of way in which she uses her acting abilities to interpret lyrics pfeiffer likened preparing herself for role to a musician preparing to record an album describing process as twice as much work at one point she confessed to kloves that she felt she was performing terribly kloves insisted that pfeiffer is a poignant and insightful perfectionist producer mark rosenberg appreciated pfeiffer for portraying susie as a character who is so colorful and full of life that even jack has to perk up and pay attention pfeiffer decided to play her character in a way that ultimately uncovers scared kid inside despite her profane and world weary introduction although pfeiffer was ultimately pleased with her singing she sometimes doubted her own abilities while filming in fear that she might have outdone herself pfeiffer slightly slurred her speech to portray her character pfeiffer identified susie s first scene in which she walks into her audition demanding attention as her most difficult to film because she initially struggled to channel her character s outgoing personality which is different than her own introverted nature a scene originally intended for film in which pfeiffer s character accidentally allows a bath she has begun pouring herself to overflow because she has become distracted thinking about jack was ultimately edited out of final film pfeiffer initially had reservations about performing atop a grand piano fearing that it would appear silly and cause audience members to laugh however kloves encouraged her to commit to scene pfeiffer s short evening dress worn during musical sequence was designed to be revealing enough without exposing pfeiffer while she moves which was choreographed by dancer peggy holmes pfeiffer touted her character one of most alive characters that i ve played describing her as an emotional creature who is not afraid to take risks doesn t lie to herself if she makes a mistake she doesn t blame anybody else there s a purity in her honesty that i really respect becoming a strong role model for actress herself pfeiffer also credits susie with helping her discover her own sexuality prior to which she had felt uncomfortable exploring according to orlando sentinel s kathy susie has a harder shell a sharper edge and a sexiness than previous characters pfeiffer has played according to film critic david thomson of independent role of susie allowed pfeiffer to add an aspect to her filmography prior to which had been dutiful yet routine characterization and themes according to film critic roger ebert susie adheres to hollywood tradition of being depicted as a hooker with a heart of gold while her tough demeanor is little more than an act matt brunson of creative loafing described susie as a tough talking street smart character who is always ready with a quip or a sharp counter to a quip writing for daily beast elizabeth kaye identified susie as a woman who must battle to keep her emotions from showing film quarterly s steve vineberg wrote that character boasts a cannily concealed underlayer of childlike comparing her appearance and wardrobe to that of singer ricky lee jones wounded by life susie wears an armor that is both impenetrable yet makes others want to experience more of character kaye felt that role was especially poignant for pfeiffer who in real life had still been recovering from an affair with actor john malkovich at same time she was filming fabulous baker boys according to cinapse s frank pfeiffer had never been as open or vulnerable on screen until starring in fabulous baker boys although eponymous baker brothers are default stars of film susie is considered to be film s centerpiece film critic mike d angelo writing for dissolve observed that character s name is susie diamond and she s written like a woman named susie diamond and pfeiffer plays her like a woman named susie diamond as a romantic film fabulous baker boys focuses on unfulfilled longing between bandmates susie and jack susie is only woman capable of changing aloof uncommunicative jack by throwing incendiary tantrums and sounding even tougher than he does slowly inspiring pianist to change person he has allowed himself to become rolling stone s peter travers believes that susie and jack bond because both characters are losers who ve sold themselves on cheap jack is a skilled musician who despises himself for squandering his talent which reminds former escort susie of herself pfeiffer agreed that her character essentially becomes a mirror image for jack although both remain very different individuals while jack is depicted as timid and cautious about his decisions susie rather embraces life instead an adventurous individual susie refuses to do only one thing including perform for her entire life pfeiffer observed that although her character has spent a significant portion of her life as an escort she remains less of a whore than jack because she retains her individuality while jack has ceased to be a vital human being when susie and jack have their final argument profanity jack uses actually helps establish susie as stronger character according to mark r hasan of com susie s nicknames for her bandmates reveal exactly how she feels about both brothers individually while she refers to frank as egghead because of his growing bald spot and tendency to act unintelligent at times she calls jack simply baker because in her opinion there s really only one baker brother and he s it way susie teases frank is reminiscent of how jack used to treat him several years before she joined band when he had energy to do it susie s ballads occupy roughly one third of film performing a combination of both contemporary and classic standards rosenberg compared character to actress marilyn monroe s character sugar kane in film some like it hot 1959 susie s lack of singing experience is balanced by an ineffable vocal quality that causes people to listen because they might be missing something

character has been endowed with a voice and a charm to take breath susie remains a heavily guarded individual until she performs makin whoopee which finally allows her to lower her defenses when susie performs song she is for first time not singing to audience but to her sole accompanist jack instead according to slant film critic chuck bowen when susie sings makin whoopee in a traffic stopping red dress mounting jack s piano as if it s an extension of his very essence all bets of detached business collaborative stability between two are understood to be off bowen also compared character s performance to actress rita hayworth s in film gilda 1946 prior to this moment it almost appears as though a romantic relationship might never actually develop between two characters observing that character s tough attitude matches difficult life she has been through janet maslin of new york times believes that susie must be singing from experience when she performs song ten cents a dance go
