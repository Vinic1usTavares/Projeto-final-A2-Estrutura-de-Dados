rain is a song by english rock band beatles that was first released in may 1966 as b side of their paperback writer single both songs were recorded during sessions for album revolver although neither appears on that album song was written by john lennon and credited to lennon mccartney it is noted for its slowed down rhythm track an example of tape manipulation techniques band embraced at this time and backwards vocals over song s coda single s release marked first time that reversed sounds had appeared in a pop song although beatles used same technique on revolver track tomorrow never knows released in august 1966 three promotional films were made for song rain music and lyrics inspiration for rain is agreed on by neil aspinall beatles roadie and john lennon they both described band s arrival in sydney australia marked by rain and poor weather lennon said i ve never seen rain as hard as that except in tahiti and later explained that rain was about people moaning about weather all time another interpretation is that song s rain and sun are phenomena experienced during a benign lsd trip rain has a simple musical structure set in key of g major final mix pitches it about a quarter of a semitone below this while backing track was taped in g sharp it begins with what alan w pollack calls a ra ta tat half measure s fanfare of solo snare drums followed by a guitar intro of first chord verses are nine measures long and song is in time each verse is based on g c and d chords i iv and v refrain contains only i and iv chords and is twelve measures long repetition of a six measure pattern first two measures are g chord third and fourth measures are c chord third measure has c chord in so called second inversion fifth and sixth measures return to g chord pollack says refrain seems slower than verse though it is at same tempo an illusion achieved by change of beat for first four measures from its erstwhile bounce to something more plodding and regular after four verses and two refrains a short solo for guitar and drums is played with complete silence for one beat following this music returns accompanied by what pollack terms historically significant reverse lyrics musicologist walter everett cites this closing section as an example of how beatles pioneered fade out fade in coda a device used again by them on strawberry fields forever and helter skelter and by led zeppelin on thank you allan kozinn describes mccartney s bass as an ingenious counterpoint that takes him all over fretboard while lennon and mccartney harmonize in fourths on a melody with a slightly middle eastern tinge mccartney first points up song s droning character by hammering on a high g approached with a quick slide from f natural just below it playing it steadily on beat for twenty successive beats recording recording began on 14 april 1966 in same session as paperback writer and concluded on 16 april with a series of overdubs before mixing on same day at that time beatles were enthusiastic about experimenting in studio to achieve new sounds and effects these experiments were showcased in their seventh album revolver geoff emerick who was engineer for both sessions described one technique he used to alter sonic texture of track by recording backing track faster than normal when played back slightly slower than usual speed music had a radically different tonal quality opposite technique was used to alter tone of lennon s lead vocal it was recorded with tape machine slowed down making lennon s voice sound higher when played back last verse of rain includes backwards vocals first use of this technique on a record hit novelty song they re coming to take me away ha haaa where side b is side a played backwards was released later that year of 1966 backwards vocals are lennon singing lyrics of song when sun shines rain and if rain comes they run and hide their heads both lennon and producer george martin claimed credit for idea lennon said after we d done session on that particular song it ended at about four or five in morning i went home with a tape to see what else you could do with it and i was sort of very stoned and tired you know not knowing what i was doing and i just happened to put it on my own tape recorder and it came out backwards and i liked it better so that s how it happened emerick confirmed lennon s creative accident but martin remembered it differently i was always playing around with tapes and i thought it might be fun to do something extra with john s voice so i lifted a bit of his main vocal off four track put it on another spool turned it around and then slid it back and forth until it fitted john was out at time but when he came back he was amazed later in 1980 lennon claimed i got home from studio and i was stoned out of my mind on marijuana and as i usually do i listened to what i d recorded that day somehow i got it on backwards and i sat there transfixed with earphones on with a big hash joint i ran in next day and said i know what to do with it i know listen to this so i made them all play it backwards fade is me actually singing backwards with guitars going backwards singing backwards laughter that one was gift of god of jah actually god of marijuana right so jah gave me that one http www beatlesbible com songs rain regardless of who is credited for technique from that point on emerick wrote almost every overdub we did on revolver had to be tried backwards as well as forwards paperback writer rain single was first release to use a new device invented by maintenance department at abbey road called for automatic transient overload control new device allowed record to be cut at a louder volume louder than any other single up to that time on final mix of single
