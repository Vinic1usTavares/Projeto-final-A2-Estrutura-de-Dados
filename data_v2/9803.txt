running of military forces of each province from traditionally aristocratic strategoi and giving it to civil magistrates praetors emperor constantine belonged to this bureaucratic faction and had been actively reducing size of army during five years since he had come to throne this was a major cause of unrest in thrace and of tornikios own dissatisfaction more importantly this infighting had devastated army s effectiveness nearest useful loyal military force was army of anatolia posted to iberia to guard frontier constantine was therefore forced to rely on saracen mercenaries civilians

panic among capital s defenders who abandoned their posts on walls and their gates tornikios however instead of storming unmanned walls hesitated contemporary historian psellus wrote he was confidently awaiting our invitation to assume throne he assumed that he would be led to palace by flaming torches in a procession worthy of a sovereign modern historian norwich speculates perhaps he wanted to spare a city he believed soon to be his from pillage whatever his reasons he lost his opportunity to take city for that night emperor constantine managed to restore order and re occupy walls to await arrival of anatolian army next morning constantine dressed in full imperial regalia installed himself in a position where all of besieging army could see him giving lie to tornikios claim that he was dead siege lasted from september25 to 28 two assaults by tornikios men were turned back by defenders on walls under personal leadership of emperor constantine who despite suffering from severe gout and arthritis and having no military experience showed courage and energy in defence of city on one occasion an arrow struck and killed a lieutenant standing by his side and his attendants pulled him away following failure of their assaults tornikios men were disillusioned having expected an easy victory constantine sent agents to their camps to bribe them to desert and they met with some success in desperation tornikios approached walls himself to appeal directly to defenders he was met by a hail of missiles thwarted he withdrew his army westwards in early october defeat hoping to retrieve situation he attacked town of but was again repulsed at this point many of his remaining followers deserted army of anatolia arrived at constantinople and set out in pursuit causing his
