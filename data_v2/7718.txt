thumb 250px banksia dentata watercolour by sydney parkinson alt a watercolour predominantly in green or a leaves and fruiting spike of a plant specimen banksia dentata commonly known as tropical banksia is a species of tree in genus banksia it occurs across northern australia southern new guinea and aru islands growing as a gnarled tree to high it has large green leaves up to long with dentate toothed margins cylindrical yellow inflorescences flower spikes up to high appear over cooler months attracting various species of honeyeaters sunbirds sugar glider and a variety of insects flowers fall off ageing spikes which swell and develop follicles containing up to two viable seeds each banksia dentata is one of four banksia species collected by sir joseph banks in 1770 and one of four species published in 1782 as part of carolus linnaeus younger s original description of banksia within genus it is classified in series salicinae a group of species from australia s eastern states genetic studies show it is a basal member early offshoot within group banksia dentata is found in tropical grassland known as savanna associated with pandanus and melaleuca it regenerates from bushfire by regrowing from its woody base known as a lignotuber description tropical banksia is generally a small tree which grows to around or sometimes tall with a rough stocky trunk spreading crown and crooked branches dark grey bark is not flaky but tesselated in texture and appearance initially covered in reddish hair that wears away branchlets become smooth and grey with age large green leaves are scattered along stems and more crowded at tips they are long and wide obovate in shape with mucronate tips dentate toothed margins are lined irregularly with long teeth separated by u shaped sinuses leaves are undulate wavy with white midrib raised underneath and depressed above cylindrical yellow inflorescences flower spikes arise from one to three year old branches appearing between november and may they are high and wide newly opened flower spikes smell like corn all flower parts are pale yellow perianth is long including a long limb after anthesis pistil is long flower parts soon fall off ageing spikes which develop into irregular cylindrical infructescences oval follicles are long high and wide pale green and furry when young they become smooth and pale brown with age follicles open spontaneously with maturity they contain two seeds each between which lies a woody dark brown separator of similar shape to seeds measuring in length seed is obovate and composed of a dark brown wide membranous wing and obovate seed proper which measures long by wide seed surface can be smooth or covered in tiny ridges bright green cotyledons are obovate measuring long by wide at base of each are two pointed auricles around 1 5 mm long cotyledons arise from a 3 4 mm high smooth hypocotyl that is 1 1 5 mm in diameter subsequent seedling leaves are opposite initially arising 3 4 mm above cotyledons each is roughly linear in shape measuring long and wide with two to three serrations teeth on upper quarter to third of leaf margin s length leaf undersurface is covered with white hair successive leaves become more obovate and are long and wide with dentate margins and mucronate tips seedling stems are hairy taxonomy specimens of banksia dentata were collected from vicinity of endeavour river somewhere between 17 june and 3 august 1770 by joseph banks and daniel solander naturalists on endeavour during lieutenant later captain james cook s first voyage to pacific ocean however description of species was not published until april 1782 when carolus linnaeus younger described first four banksia species in his supplementum plantarum linnaeus distinguished them by their leaf shapes and named them accordingly thus this species dentate toothed leaf margins saw it given specific name dentata latin adjective for toothed banksia dentata is monotypic and no subspecies are recognised though not closely studied reports suggest it does not vary significantly over its range robert brown recorded 31 species of banksia in his 1810 work prodromus florae novae hollandiae et insulae van diemen and in his taxonomic arrangement placed taxon in subgenus banksia verae true banksias because inflorescence is a typical banksia flower spike by time carl meissner published his 1856 arrangement of genus there were 58 described banksia species meissner divided brown s banksia verae which had been renamed eubanksia by stephan endlicher in 1847 into four series based on leaf properties he placed b dentata in series quercinae oak like banksias in 1870 george bentham published a thorough revision of banksia in his flora australiensis in bentham s arrangement number of recognised banksia species was reduced from 60 to 46 bentham defined four sections based on leaf style and pollen presenter characters banksia dentata was placed in section eubanksia alongside b marginata and a broadly defined b integrifolia a major disruption to banksia nomenclature occurred in 1891 when otto kuntze challenged banksia l f on grounds that johann reinhold forster and his son georg had already penned name banksia to describe a different genus of plant and hence banksia j r forst g forst took precedence and rendered banksia l f i e as used by linnaeus invalid kuntze transferred all banksia taxa to new name sirmuellera thus b dentata became sirmuellera dentata l f kuntze kuntze s challenge failed as did a similar challenge by james britten in 1905 britten proposed generic name isostylis republishing b dentata as isostylis dentata l f britten in 1940 banksia l f was formally conserved against future challenges commonly known as tropical banksia b dentata is known locally as swamp banksia and by indigenous people in kakadu national park its local name in language of eastern arnhem land is other names from same region include in language of groote eylandt and in language of frederick manson bailey reported in 1913 that indigenous people of cape bedford knew it as kabir placement within banksia current taxonomic arrangement of genus banksia is based on botanist alex george s 1999 monograph for flora of australia book series in this arrangement b dentata is placed in banksia subgenus banksia because its inflorescences take form of banksia s characteristic flower spikes section banksia because of its straight styles and series salicinae because its inflorescences are cylindrical there has been debate on which species it is most closely related to alf salkin had noted that b dentata displays characteristics which are primitive within genus unlike southern banksias it has small juvenile leaves and broad dentate adult leaves salkin 1979 p 161 alex george concluded initially that its affinities lay with banksia integrifolia on account of their similar inflorescences in a morphological cladistic analysis published in 1994 kevin thiele placed it in newly described subseries acclives along with b plagiocarpa b robur and b oblongifolia within series salicinae these four species all have follicles which point slightly upwards towards apex of flower spike it was held to be most closely related to b robur on account of its large undulate leaves salkin had also noted that seedling leaves of b dentata b robur and b oblongifolia were all similar and roughly linear suggesting a close relationship salkin 1979 p 163 however this subgrouping of salicinae was not supported by george he discounted a close relationship with b robur which he felt was too distinctive b dentata s placement within banksia according to flora of australia is as follows genus banksia subgenus isostylis subgenus banksia section oncostylis section coccinea section banksia series grandes series banksia series crocinae series prostratae series cyrtostylis series tetragonae series bauerinae series quercinae series salicinae b dentata b aquilonia b integrifolia b plagiocarpa b oblongifolia b robur b conferta b paludosa b marginata b canei b saxicola since 1998 american botanist austin mast and co authors have been publishing results of ongoing cladistic analyses of dna sequence data for subtribe banksiinae which then comprised genera banksia and dryandra their analyses suggest a phylogeny that differs greatly from george s taxonomic arrangement banksia dentata resolves as an early offshoot within salicinae in 2007 mast and thiele rearranged genus banksia by merging dryandra into it and published b subg spathulatae for taxa having spoon shaped cotyledons thus b subg banksia was redefined as encompassing taxa lacking spoon shaped cotyledons they foreshadowed publishing a full arrangement once dna sampling of dryandra was complete in meantime if mast and thiele s nomenclatural changes are taken as an interim arrangement b dentata is placed in b subg spathulatae distribution and habitat across northern australia banksia dentata has been recorded as far west as king leopold ranges in western kimberley through northern territory and extending south to katherine gorge and into queensland where it is found on cape york peninsula to as far south as cooktown off coast it has been recorded from groote eylandt and wessel islands as well as melville and bathurst islands it also extends onto aru islands where it is found around and new guinea where it ranges in south from merauke east to port moresby and around bulolo and mount mau it is only banksia species not endemic to australia as much of its range is in remote and poorly surveyed country it is possible that it is found more widely than has been recorded pollen samples indicate it has been present on torres strait islands over past 8000 years though it has not been a prominent component of island flora banksia dentata generally grows on sandy soils in savanna woodland or shrubland along freshwater swamps watercourses floodplains or other seasonally wet areas it has also been found on rocky outcrops of quartzite or sandstone to an elevation of around in australia and up to in new guinea in new guinea it is restricted to areas which have a distinct dry season banksia dentata is often found with melaleuca and pandanus species on cape york it is a dominant component in a low scrub known as wet desert due to its resemblance to arid scrub yet occurring in a monsoon climate on phosphorus poor soils banksia dentata is found with melaleuca saligna and on melville island it is a dominant component of banksia low woodland forming part of a high canopy with melaleuca viridiflora understory is composed of sedges such as sorghum intrans grandiflora and as well as suckering shrubs lophostemon lactifluus and syzygium this community grows in wet areas with a grey topsoil with high moisture and gravel content but low sand ecology banksia dentata responds to bushfire by resprouting from its woody lignotuber although unlike other members of salicinae it lacks dormant buds at its base it was described by amateur botanist and banksia enthusiast alf salkin as resembling an upturned parsnip salkin 1979 p 154 plant communities where it is found are subject to periodic bushfires and it can become more dominant if fires occur often salkin had noted that its tropical position might mean that b dentata was a key species in transition from rainforest to open habitat in ancestry of genus one adaptation to a drier sunnier climate was a thick intermediate layer under epidermis in leaf architecture this layer hypodermis contains large vacuoles that are filled with a phenolic compound and seems to serve to reduce intensity of sunlight reaching mesophyll salkin 1979 p 162 numerous nectar feeding insects are attracted to flower spikes which in turn attract honeyeaters silvereyes and sunbirds many of which consume both nectar and insects sugar glider petaurus breviceps forages among flower spikes and is a probable pollinator common blossom bat australis feeds on nectar b dentata has been recorded as a host plant for mistletoe species amyema angustata and d signata cultivation thumb right seedlings provenance north queensland alt two potted seedlings with large trunks tree s gnarled bark large green leaves and yellow flower spikes are attractive horticultural features b dentata is vulnerable to cold winters in cultivation in melbourne and recovers over hotter months of summer salkin 1979 pp 159 60 it has not been able to be grown in colder climates such as those of canberra flowering occurs around 5 to 8 years from seed plants can be pruned hard and do best on a sandy slightly acid soil of ph 5 5 6 5 they can be vulnerable to borers seeds do not require any treatment and take 32 to 40 days to germinate banksia dentata was introduced into united kingdom in 1822 banksia dentata is used as a nectar source in honey bee industry aborigines in northern territory would light old seed cones and use them as firebrands these lasting for up to two hours nectar was consumed by indigenous people a hot smoking flower spike was used to leprosy sores and people suffering from diarrhea would squat over smoking cones in hope this would relieve their symptoms thin woody spikes that did not develop follicles were used as nasal ornaments by aboriginal women and flower spikes were used as combs references cited text external links dentata category eudicots of western australia category flora of new guinea category flora of northern territory category flora of queensland category
