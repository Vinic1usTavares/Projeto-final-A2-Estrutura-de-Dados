effect for duration of course participants were taught that they were responsible for their life outcomes by 1977 over 100 000 people completed est training including public figures and mental health

writes in foreword that rhinehart s book brilliantly communicates clearly to reader both a sense of being in training room and spirit of what takes place there erhard s foreword notes although this book dramatizes highlights of training and attempts to give you vicarious experience of being at a training this is a book and est experience cannot result from reading any book with erhard s endorsement rhinehart attempts to replicate transformation experience from est book imparts message that participant s life doesn t work and that after two weekends individual will come to understand how to win book presents a fictional dramatization of est training punctuation style usage including exclamation points and boldface type bring reader s attention to key items in text rhinehart describes est training as a form of participatory theatre writing seeing trainer as a master actor permits us to evaluate his acts and words more intelligently than if we misinterpret him as being a scholar or scientist giving a lecture in an analysis of how to approach est training rhinehart comments that it might best be described if it can be described at all as theater as living theater participatory theater encounter theater once we begin to see est in these terms much that fails to fit scheme of therapy or religion or science begins to make sense in rhinehart s fictional account of training est course leader begins with instruction let me make one thing clear i don t want any of you to believe a thing i m saying get that don t believe me just listen est trainer explains that course techniques are used because werner has found that they work when one of est participants asks why instructor says certain statements during course instructor responds i m saying them because werner has found that trainer s saying them works concluding portion of book includes a comparison of werner erhard s methodologies to zen teachings of don juan by carlos castaneda and to rhinehart s views from dice man drawing a parallel to controlled folly described in castaneda s a separate reality rhinehart argues that in almost all cases enlightenment is linked to humor one can rarely have an enlightenment experience except under impact of nonsense every time we laugh we are in a way experiencing a mini enlightenment a tiny letting go of some attachment to some bit of belief or sense full enlightenment in these terms is accepting what is which leads to experiencing fully whatever one is experiencing rhinehart comments that those who have taken part in est training feel need for a sense of community most graduates indicate that value of seminar series depends not so much on its ostensible data content or on processes introduced but on sharing on an intimate basis with others he notes that some of graduates of est training treat him erhard with love and awe normally associated with that of disciples for spiritual teachers he likens erhard s relationship to his staff members to way in which a guru interacts with disciples it is essentially eastern phenomenon of a powerful being usually a guru or a spiritual teacher attracting other powerful beings who nevertheless choose to channel their power through their leader rhinehart argues that est may be seen as in many ways culmination to date of of america a process that first became notable in late fifties and early sixties critical reception james charney notes in his review of book for library journal questions of effectiveness or possible harm are hardly considered charney characterizes problem of book and its subject matter as a kind of with it which disallows any intelligent understanding on principle in a review of book for new york times book review zane was critical of work commenting there isn t much to be said for book except that it exudes a kind of repellent fascination a review of book in kirkus reviews was negative review characterizes it as not a book really a verbatim transcription of one of werner erhard s weekend sessions in 250 kirkus reviews criticizes author for not engaging in any judgmental analysis of est training methodology review concludes at least reader finally has an opportunity to see what an seminar is with vomit bags circuitous logic pathetic interplay between overbearing trainer and angst ridden trainee and all in an article about erhard and est for religious journal quarterly review florida international university assistant religious studies professor robert r hann places book among most accessible sources about est hann comments that since book has been reviewed by erhard and carries his statement of support for author it can therefore be presumed to be if not canonical then at least not significantly at odds with perspective of est itself professor walter a effross of american university washington college of law cites book of est along with adelaide bry s est 60 hours that transform your life in an article in buffalo law review analyzing control of new age movements over their intellectual property effross notes that copyright page of book of est gives a notice that material based in part on unpublished lectures created and copyrighted by werner erhard and used by author with his permission no material created and copyrighted by werner erhard may be used or disseminated in any medium or language without his prior written authorization effross comments on potential loss of control over his material that erhard may have invited due to endorsing these books about his methodology because it enabled commentators to make fair use of disclosed information it was not helpful for werner erhard founder of est to endorse a first person account of an est training even one which provided only simulations of est s processes or guided meditations however publicity erhard s organization achieved from such exposure during crucial periods of expansion may have been seen as justifying intellectual property risk see also
