cross road blues also known as crossroads is a blues song written and recorded by american blues artist robert johnson in 1936 johnson performed it as a solo piece with his vocal and acoustic slide guitar in delta blues style song has become part of robert johnson mythology as referring to place where he supposedly sold his soul to devil in exchange for his musical talents although lyrics do not contain any specific references bluesman elmore james revived song with recordings in 1954 and 1960 1961 english guitarist eric clapton with cream popularized song as crossroads in late 1960s their blues rock interpretation inspired many cover versions and rock and roll hall of fame included it as one of 500 songs that shaped rock and roll rolling stone placed it at number three on magazine s list of greatest guitar songs of all time in recognition of clapton s guitar work recording little is known about johnson s life and musical career although his recordings are well documented in october 1936 johnson auditioned for music store owner and sometime talent scout h c speir in jackson mississippi speir passed on johnson s contact information to ernie oertle who was a representative for arc records after a second audition oertle arranged for johnson to travel to san antonio texas for a recording session johnson recorded 22 songs for arc over three days from november 23 to 27 1936 during first session he recorded his most commercially appealing songs they mostly represented his original pieces and reflected current piano influenced musical trends songs include terraplane blues his first single and most popular record along with sweet home chicago and i believe i ll dust my broom which became blues standards after others recorded them a second and third recording date took place in san antonio after a two day break johnson reached back into his long standing repertoire for songs to record material reflects styles of country blues performers charley patton and son house who influenced johnson in his youth songs are among johnson s most heartfelt and forceful and music historian ted gioia sees a shift in lyrical themes cross road blues was recorded during johnson s third session in san antonio on friday november 27 1936 sessions continued at an improvised studio in room 414 at gunter hotel arc producers art satherley and don law supervised recording and used a portable disc cutting machine it is unknown what input if any they had into johnson s selection of material to record or how to present it two similar takes of song were recorded lyrics and interpretation thumb right tourism marker at intersection of historical highways 61 and 49 in clarksdale mississippi one of several purported crossroads sites a crossroads or an intersection of rural roads is one of few landmarks in mississippi delta a flat featureless plain between mississippi and yazoo rivers it is part of local iconography and various businesses use name such as gas stations banks and retail shops a crossroads is also where cars are more likely to slow down or stop thus presenting best opportunity for a in simplest reading johnson describes his grief at being unable to catch a ride at an intersection before sun sets however many see different levels of meaning and some have attached a supernatural significance to song both versions of song open with protagonist kneeling at a crossroads to ask god s mercy while second sections tells of his failed attempts to hitch a ride in third and fourth sections he expresses apprehension at being stranded as darkness approaches and asks that his friend willie brown be advised that i m down first take of song which was used for single includes a fifth verse that is not included in second take in it he laments not having a sweet woman in his distress song has been used to perpetuate myth of johnson selling his soul to devil for his musical ability lyrics do not contain any references to satan or a faustian bargain but they have been interpreted as a description of singer s fear of losing his soul to devil presumably in exchange for his talent music historian elijah wald believes that johnson s verses do not support idea delta bluesman tommy johnson promoted himself as having made a deal with devil and southern folklore identifies a crossroads or graveyard as site of such a pact which wald identifies as likely sources of myth however musicologist robert palmer points out that johnson was fascinated with and probably obsessed by supernatural imagery his song hellhound on my trail tells of trying to stay ahead of demon hound which is pursuing him and in me and devil blues he sings early this mornin when you knocked upon my door and i said hello satan i believe it s time to go these songs contribute to faustian myth how much johnson promoted idea is debated although many agree devil angle made for good marketing blues historian samuel charters sees song as having elements of protest and social commentary second verse includes sun goin down now boy dark gon catch me here a reference to sundown laws or curfew during racial segregation in united states signs in rural south advised nigger don t let sun set on you here johnson may be expressing a real fear of trumped up vagrancy charges or even lynchings that still took place others suggest that song is about a deeper and more personal loneliness writers barry lee pearson and bill mcculloch argue that fifth verse in single version captures essence of song left alone abandoned or mistreated he stands at crossroad looking this way or that for his woman composition cross road blues reflects johnson s delta blues roots and may have been in his repertoire since 1932 it is first recording to show his mastery of his mentor son house s style particularly in his slide guitar work music historian edward komara identifies parts of straight blues by leroy carr and scrapper blackwell 1929 along with roosevelt sykes subsequent adaptation as black river blues 1930 as melodic precedents however johnson infuses their relaxed urban approach with a more forceful rural one komara terms johnson s guitar playing a blues harp style it contrasts with johnson s finger picking piano style which uses a boogie style accompaniment on bass strings while playing melody and harmonies on higher strings harp style playing employs sharp percussive accents on bass strings an imitation of sharp draw used by harmonica players and allows johnson to explore different chordings and fills johnson uses this technique for terraplane blues which shares many common elements with cross road blues song s structure differs from a well defined twelve bar blues verses are not consistent and range from fourteen to fifteen bars in length additionally harmonic progression is often implied rather than stated full iv and v chords are not used johnson uses a spanish or open g tuning with guitar tuned up to key of b this facilitates johnson s use of a slide which features as prominently in song as vocal slide parts function more as a second answer vocal than accompaniment with tension underscoring dark turmoil of lyrics charters characterizes song s rhythm as ambiguous imparting both a 4 4 time and 8 8 feel music writer dave headlam elaborates on johnson s rhythm two takes of song are performed at moderate but somewhat different tempos both begin slower and speed up first is about 106 beats per minute bpm while second is about 96 bpm johnson prepares to go into fifth section for slower second take but engineer apparently cut him off because of time limits of ten inch 78 rpm records in addition to slower tempo johnson sings verses at a lower pitch although both takes are in same key this allows for greater variation and nuance in vocal together with refinements to some guitar parts differences serve to help further distinguish second take from terraplane blues and give it more of its own character releases arc and vocalion records issued first take of cross road blues in may 1937 on then standard 78 rpm record single with its flip side ramblin on my mind sold poorly song remained out of print after its initial release until complete recordings box set in 1990 second take was released in 1961 when producer frank driggs substituted it for original on johnson s first long playing record album compilation king of delta blues singers this take was also included on 1990 complete recordings at 2 29 it is 10 seconds shorter than original 2 39 single version elmore james versions american blues singer and guitarist elmore james who popularized robert johnson s dust my broom recorded two variations on cross road blues both titled standing at crossroads they feature james trademark dust my broom amplified slide guitar figure and a backing ensemble james lyrics focus on lost love aspect of song james first recorded song in august 1954 at modern records new studio in culver city california maxwell davis supervised session and a group of professional studio musicians provided backup song was produced in a newer style that modern used successfully for b b king and james slide guitar was placed further back in mix flair records another of bihari brothers modern labels released single backed with sunny land song became a regional hit but did not reach national charts labels associated with modern included standing at crossroads on several james compilation albums such as blues after hours crown blues in my heart rhythm in my soul custom records and original folk blues kent records in 1959 producer bobby robinson signed james to his fury fire enjoy group of labels in addition to new material robinson had james revisit several of his older songs including standing at crossroads james re recorded it at studios in new york city in late 1960 or early 1961 during one of his last sessions studio musicians again provided backup and horn section included baritone saxophone by paul williams bell records subsidiary labels released song after james death in 1965 flashback records released a single with a reissue of sky is crying and sphere sound records included it on a james compilation album also titled sky is crying both 1954 and 1960 1961 versions appear on numerous later james compilations homesick james who recorded and toured with his cousin elmore also recorded a rendition titled crossroads homesick derived his guitar style from elmore which music critic bill dahl describes as aggressive sometimes chaotic slide work unlike elmore however he uses most of lyrics from johnson s second take which had been first issued in 1961 july 23 1963 recording session produced homesick s only single for chicago based usa records crossroads backed with my baby s sweet eric clapton cream interpretation background in early 1966 while still with john mayall s bluesbreakers eric clapton adapted song for a recording session with an ad hoc studio group dubbed eric clapton and powerhouse elektra records producer joe boyd brought together steve winwood on vocals clapton on guitar jack bruce on bass guitar paul jones on harmonica ben palmer on piano and pete york on drums for project boyd recalled that he and clapton reviewed potential songs clapton wanted to record albert king s crosscut saw but boyd preferred to adapt an older country blues their attention turned to robert johnson songs and boyd proposed crossroads and clapton chose traveling riverside blues for recording clapton developed an arrangement using lyrics from both songs with an adaption of guitar line from latter biographer michael schumacher describes powerhouse s performance as slower and more blues based than cream s winwood sings and jones plays riff on harmonica similar to what clapton later used with cream jones also provides instrumental solo clapton plays rhythm guitar throughout song elektra released 2 32 recording titled crossroads on compilation album what s shakin in june 1966 after powerhouse session clapton continued playing with mayall author marc roberty lists crossroads in a typical set for bluesbreakers in spring of 1966 cream version crossroads became a part of cream s repertoire when clapton began performing with jack bruce and ginger baker in july 1966 their version features a prominent guitar riff with hard driving upbeat instrumental backing and soloing clapton previously recorded ramblin on my mind with mayall and from four until late with cream using arrangements that followed johnson s original songs more closely however he envisioned crossroads as a rock song clapton simplifies johnson s guitar line and sets it to a straight eighth note or rock rhythm he and bruce on bass continuously emphasize riff throughout song to give it a strong and regular metric drive combined with baker s drumming johnson s irregular measures are also standardized to typical twelve bar sections in which i iv v blues progression is clearly stated clapton does not adapt johnson s slide guitar technique or open tuning instead he follows electric guitar soloing approach of b b king and albert king however he employs a johnson guitar innovation duple shuffle pattern or boogie bass line while singing johnson only used it for two bars in cross road blues clapton also simplifies and johnson s vocal lines schumacher calls clapton s vocal on crossroads his best and most assured with cream in addition to johnson s opening and closing lyrics he twice adds same section from traveling riverside blues during instrumental break cream takes an improvisational approach characteristic of their later live performances bruce s bass lines blend rhythm and harmony and baker adds fills and more complex techniques typical of drummers in jazz trios however momentum is never allowed to dissipate and is constantly reinforced recording and releases cream recorded song on november 28 1966 for broadcast on bbc guitar club radio program at less than two minutes in length clapton only sings first and last sections with his guitar solo replacing middle traveling riverside blues verse it appeared on bootleg albums before finally being released in 2003 on bbc sessions on march 10 1968 cream recorded it again during a concert at winterland ballroom in san francisco song became opening number on live half of cream s wheels of fire double album released in august 1968 by polydor records in uk and atco records in us after group s breakup atco issued song as a single in january 1969 which reached number 28 on us billboard hot 100 pop chart and 17 on cashbox both original album and single credit songwriter as robert johnson or r johnson although clapton and cream extensively reworked song cream played crossroads during their final concert at royal albert hall on november 26 1968 expanded version of cream s farewell concert film released in 1977 contains performance during their 2005 reunion cream revisited song at royal albert hall and it is included on royal albert hall london may 2 3 5 6 2005 album and video after cream s breakup in 1968 clapton continued to perform crossroads in a variety of settings live recordings appear on live at fillmore with derek and dominos crossroads 2 live in seventies secret policeman s other ball and other albums clapton has also used name for crossroads centre a drug rehabilitation facility he founded and for crossroads guitar festivals to benefit it views on editing for album version clapton biographer schumacher notes given passion of solo performances on crossroads it seems almost miraculous that cream is able to return to song itself several music writers have explained that cream s recording for wheels of fire was edited from a much longer performance that was typical for trio in notes for clapton s crossroads box set anthony decurtis credits trimming to engineer tom dowd while critic stephen thomas erlewine attributes editing to producer felix pappalardi who cut together best bits of a winding improvisation to a tight four minutes to allow song s drive more continuity in a 1985 interview clapton was asked if song had been edited he replied however barry levenson who produced cream s 1997 box set those were days asserts recognition and influence in 1986 robert johnson s cross road blues was inducted into blues foundation hall of fame writing for foundation jim o neal noted that regardless of mythology and rock n roll renditions johnson s record was indeed a powerful one a song that would stand test of time on its own in 1998 it received a grammy hall of fame award to acknowledge its quality and place in recording history in 1995 rock and roll hall of fame listed cream s crossroads as one of 500 songs that shaped rock and roll rolling stone magazine placed it at number three on its greatest guitar songs of all time allmusic s richard gilliam identifies cream s crossroads as first recording to bring robert johnson to attention of popular music audiences and allow reissues of his original recordings to sell over a million copies by combining elements of hard rock and blues he adds it inspired a
