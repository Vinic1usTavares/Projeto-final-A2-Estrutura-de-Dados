borobudur or is a 9th century mahayana buddhist temple in magelang regency not far from town of in central java indonesia it is world s largest buddhist temple temple consists of nine stacked platforms six square and three circular topped by a central dome it is decorated with 2 672 relief panels and 504 buddha statues central dome is surrounded by 72 buddha statues each seated inside a perforated stupa built in 9th century during reign of sailendra dynasty temple design follows javanese buddhist architecture which blends indonesian indigenous cult of ancestor worship and buddhist concept of attaining nirvana temple demonstrates influences of gupta art that reflects india s influence on region yet there are enough indigenous scenes and elements incorporated to make borobudur uniquely indonesian monument is a shrine to lord buddha and a place for buddhist pilgrimage pilgrim journey begins at base of monument and follows a path around monument ascending to top through three levels symbolic of buddhist cosmology kamadhatu world of desire rupadhatu world of forms and arupadhatu world of formlessness monument guides pilgrims through an extensive system of stairways and corridors with 1 460 narrative relief panels on walls and balustrades borobudur has one of largest and most complete ensembles of buddhist reliefs in world evidence suggests that borobudur was constructed in 9th century and subsequently abandoned following 14th century decline of hindu kingdoms in java and javanese conversion to islam worldwide knowledge of its existence was sparked in 1814 by sir thomas stamford raffles then british ruler of java who was advised of its location by native indonesians borobudur has since been preserved through several restorations largest restoration project was undertaken between 1975 and 1982 by indonesian government and unesco followed by monument s listing as a unesco world heritage site borobudur is largest buddhist temple in world and ranks with bagan in myanmar and angkor wat in cambodia as one of great archeological sites of southeast asia borobudur remains popular for pilgrimage with buddhists in indonesia celebrating vesak day at monument borobudur is indonesia s single most visited tourist attraction etymology thumb 480px left candi borobudur viewed from northwest monument was mentioned in karangtengah and tri tepusan inscriptions in indonesian ancient temples are referred to as candi thus locals refer to borobudur temple as candi borobudur term candi also loosely describes ancient structures for example gates and baths origins of name borobudur however are unclear although original names of most ancient indonesian temples are no longer known name borobudur was first written in raffles s book on javan history raffles wrote about a monument called borobudur but there are no older documents suggesting same name only old javanese manuscript that hints monument called budur as a holy buddhist sanctuary is nagarakretagama written by mpu prapanca a buddhist scholar of majapahit court in 1365 most candi are named after a nearby village if it followed javanese language conventions and was named after nearby village of bore monument should have been named raffles thought that budur might correspond to modern javanese word buda ancient i e ancient boro he also suggested that name might derive from boro meaning great or honourable and budur for buddha however another archaeologist suggests second component of name budur comes from javanese term bhudhara mountain another possible etymology by dutch archaeologist a j bernet suggests that borobudur is a corrupted simplified local javanese pronunciation of biara beduhur written in sanskrit as vihara buddha uhr term buddha uhr could mean city of buddhas while another possible term beduhur is probably an old javanese term still survived today in balinese vocabulary which means a high place constructed from stem word or luhur high this suggests that borobudur means vihara of buddha located on a high place or on a hill construction and inauguration of a sacred buddhist building possibly a reference to borobudur was mentioned in two inscriptions both discovered in kedu temanggung regency karangtengah inscription dated 824 mentioned a sacred building named jinalaya realm of those who have conquered worldly desire and reached enlightenment inaugurated by pramodhawardhani daughter of samaratungga tri tepusan inscription dated 842 is mentioned in sima tax free lands awarded by cri pramodhawardhani to ensure funding and maintenance of a kamulan called kamulan is from word mula which means place of origin a sacred building to honor ancestors probably those of sailendras casparis suggested that bhumi bhudhara which in sanskrit means mountain of combined virtues of ten stages of was original name of borobudur location thumb right borobudur is surrounded by mountains including twin volcanoes mount merbabu and merapi three temples thumb left 380px straight line arrangement of borobudur pawon and mendut approximately northwest of yogyakarta and west of surakarta borobudur is located in an elevated area between two twin volcanoes and merbabu merapi and two rivers and elo according to local myth area known as kedu plain is a javanese sacred place and has been dubbed garden of java due to its high agricultural fertility during restoration in early 20th century it was discovered that three buddhist temples in region borobudur pawon and mendut are positioned along a straight line a ritual relationship between three temples must have existed although exact ritual process is unknown ancient lake hypothesis speculation about a surrounding lake s existence was subject of intense discussion among archaeologists in 20th century in 1931 a dutch artist and scholar of hindu and buddhist architecture w o j developed a hypothesis that kedu plain was once a lake and borobudur initially represented a lotus flower floating on lake it has been claimed that borobudur was built on a bedrock hill above sea level and above floor of a dried out paleolake together with professor thanikaimoni took soil samples in 1974 and again in 1977 from trial trenches that had been dug into hill as well as from plain immediately to south these samples were later analysed by thanikaimoni who examined their pollen and spore content to identify type of vegetation that had grown in area around time of borobudur s construction they were unable to discover any pollen or spore samples that were characteristic of any vegetation known to grow in an aquatic environment such as a lake pond or marsh area surrounding borobudur appears to have been surrounded by agricultural land and palm trees at time of monument s construction as is still case today caesar voute and dr j j in 1985 86 field studies re examined borobudur lake hypothesis and confirmed absence of a lake around borobudur at time of its construction and active use as a sanctuary these findings a new perspective on some old questions pertaining to borobudur were published in 2005 unesco publication titled restoration of borobudur history construction thumb 300px right a painting by g b hooijer c 1916 1919 reconstructing scene of borobudur during its heyday there are no known records of construction or intended purpose of borobudur duration of construction has been estimated by comparison of carved reliefs on temple s hidden foot and inscriptions commonly used in royal charters during 8th and 9th centuries borobudur was likely founded around 800 ad this corresponds to period between 760 and 830 ad peak of sailendra dynasty rule over mataram kingdom in central java when their power encompassed not only srivijayan empire but also southern thailand indianized kingdoms of philippines north malaya kedah also known in indian texts as ancient hindu state of kadaram and khmer in cambodia laguna copperplate george 1968 walter f vella ed indianized states of southeast asia trans susan brown cowing university of hawaii press construction has been estimated to have taken 75 years with completion during reign of samaratungga in 825 there is uncertainty about hindu and buddhist rulers in java around that time sailendras were known as ardent followers of buddhism though stone inscriptions found at also suggest they may have been hindus it was during this time that many hindu and buddhist monuments were built on plains and mountains around kedu plain buddhist monuments including borobudur were erected around same period as hindu shiva prambanan temple compound in 732 ad king sanjaya commissioned a sanctuary to be built on hill only east of borobudur construction of buddhist temples including borobudur at that time was possible because sanjaya s immediate successor rakai panangkaran granted his permission to buddhist followers to build such temples in fact to show his respect panangkaran gave village of kalasan to buddhist community as is written in kalasan charter dated 778 ad this has led some archaeologists to believe that there was never serious conflict concerning religion in java as it was possible for a hindu king to patronize establishment of a buddhist monument or for a buddhist king to act likewise however it is likely that there were two rival royal dynasties in java at time buddhist sailendra and saivite sanjaya in which latter triumphed over their rival in 856 battle on plateau similar confusion also exists regarding lara jonggrang temple at prambanan complex which was believed to have been erected by victor rakai as sanjaya dynasty s reply to borobudur but others suggest that there was a climate of peaceful coexistence where sailendra involvement exists in lara jonggrang abandonment thumb left borobudur stupas overlooking a mountain for centuries it was deserted borobudur lay hidden for centuries under layers of volcanic ash and jungle growth facts behind its abandonment remain a mystery it is not known when active use of monument and buddhist pilgrimage to it ceased sometime between 928 and 1006 king mpu moved capital of kingdom to region of east java after a series of volcanic eruptions it is not certain whether this influenced abandonment but several sources mention this as most likely period of abandonment monument is mentioned vaguely as late as 1365 in mpu prapanca s nagarakretagama written during majapahit era and mentioning vihara in budur soekmono 1976 also mentions popular belief that temples were disbanded when population converted to islam in 15th century monument was not forgotten completely though folk stories gradually shifted from its past glory into more superstitious beliefs associated with bad luck and misery two old javanese chronicles babad from 18th century mention cases of bad luck associated with monument according to babad tanah jawi or history of java monument was a fatal factor for mas dana a rebel who revolted against i king of mataram in 1709 it was mentioned that borobudur hill was besieged and insurgents were defeated and sentenced to death by king in babad mataram or history of mataram kingdom monument was associated with misfortune of prince crown prince of yogyakarta sultanate in 1757 in spite of a taboo against visiting monument he took what is written as knight who was captured in a cage a statue in one of perforated stupas upon returning to his palace he fell ill and died one day later rediscovery upright thumb borobudur s main stupa in mid 19th century a wooden deck had been installed above main stupa following its capture java was under british administration from 1811 to 1816 appointed governor was lieutenant governor general thomas stamford raffles who took great interest in history of java he collected javanese antiques and made notes through contacts with local inhabitants during his tour throughout island on an inspection tour to semarang in 1814 he was informed about a big monument deep in a jungle near village of he was not able to see site himself but sent a dutch engineer who among other antiquity explorations had uncovered sewu complex in 1806 07 to investigate in two months cornelius and his 200 men cut down trees burned down vegetation and dug away earth to reveal monument due to danger of collapse he could not unearth all galleries he reported his findings to raffles including various drawings although raffles mentioned discovery and hard work by cornelius and his men in only a few sentences he has been credited with monument s rediscovery as one who had brought it to world s attention christiaan hartmann resident of kedu region continued cornelius s work and in 1835 whole complex was finally unearthed his interest in borobudur was more personal than official hartmann did not write any reports of his activities in particular alleged story that he discovered large statue of buddha in main stupa in 1842 hartmann investigated main dome although what he discovered is unknown and main stupa remains empty left thumb borobudur in 1872 dutch east indies government then commissioned frans carel wilsen a dutch engineering official who studied monument and drew hundreds of relief sketches jan frederik gerrit brumund was also appointed to make a detailed study of monument which was completed in 1859 government intended to publish an article based on brumund s study supplemented by wilsen s drawings but brumund refused to cooperate government then commissioned another scholar leemans who compiled a monograph based on brumund s and wilsen s sources in 1873 first monograph of detailed study of borobudur was published followed by its french translation a year later first photograph of monument was taken in 1872 by dutch flemish engraver isidore van appreciation of site developed slowly and it served for some time largely as a source of souvenirs and income for souvenir hunters and thieves in 1882 chief inspector of cultural artifacts recommended that borobudur be entirely disassembled with relocation of reliefs into museums due to unstable condition of monument as a result government appointed willem pieter curator of archaeological collection of batavian society of arts and sciences to undertake a thorough investigation of site and to assess actual condition of complex his report found that these fears were unjustified and recommended it be left intact borobudur was considered as source of souvenirs and parts of its sculptures were looted some even with colonial government consent in 1896 king chulalongkorn of siam visited java and requested and was allowed to take home eight cartloads of sculptures taken from borobudur these include thirty pieces taken from a number of relief panels five buddha images two lions one gargoyle several kala motifs from stairs and gateways and a guardian statue dvarapala several of these artifacts most notably lions dvarapala kala makara and giant waterspouts are now on display in java art room in national museum in bangkok restoration thumb right borobudur after van erp s restoration in 1911 note reconstructed chhatra pinnacle on top of main stupa now dismantled thumb unfinished buddha from main stupa of borobudur at karmawibhangga museum to which buddhists give offerings along with main stupa s chhatra on its back borobudur attracted attention in 1885 when dutch engineer chairman of archaeological society in yogyakarta made a discovery about hidden foot photographs that reveal reliefs on hidden foot were made in 1890 1891 discovery led dutch east indies government to take steps to safeguard monument in 1900 government set up a commission consisting of three officials to assess monument jan andries brandes an art historian a dutch army engineer officer and benjamin willem van de kamer a construction engineer from department of public works in 1902 commission submitted a threefold plan of proposal to government first immediate dangers should be avoided by resetting corners removing stones that endangered adjacent parts strengthening first balustrades and restoring several niches archways stupas and main dome second after fencing off courtyards proper maintenance should be provided and drainage should be improved by restoring floors and spouts third all loose stones should be removed monument cleared up to first balustrades disfigured stones removed and main dome restored total cost was estimated at that time around 48 800 dutch guilders restoration then was carried out between 1907 and 1911 using principles of and led by theodor van erp first seven months of restoration were occupied with excavating grounds around monument to find missing buddha heads and panel stones van erp dismantled and rebuilt upper three circular platforms and stupas along way van erp discovered more things he could do to improve monument he submitted another proposal which was approved with additional cost of 34 600 guilders at first glance borobudur had been restored to its old glory van erp went further by carefully reconstructing chattra three tiered parasol pinnacle on top of main stupa however he later dismantled chattra citing that there were not enough original stones used in reconstructing pinnacle which means that original design of borobudur s pinnacle is actually unknown dismantled chattra now is stored in karmawibhangga museum a few hundred meters north from borobudur due to limited budget restoration had been primarily focused on cleaning sculptures and van erp did not solve drainage problem within fifteen years gallery walls were sagging and reliefs showed signs of new cracks and deterioration van erp used concrete from which alkali salts and calcium hydroxide leached and were transported into rest of construction this caused some problems so that a further thorough renovation was urgently needed thumb upright left embedding concrete and pvc pipe to improve borobudur s drainage system during 1973 restoration small restorations had been performed since then but not sufficient for complete protection during world war ii and indonesian national revolution in 1945 to 1949 borobudur restoration efforts were halted monument suffered further from weather and drainage problems which caused earth core inside temple to expand pushing stone structure and tilting walls by 1950s some parts of borobudur were facing imminent danger of collapsing in 1965 indonesia asked unesco for advice on ways to counteract problem of weathering at borobudur and other monuments in 1968 professor soekmono then head of archeological service of indonesia launched his save borobudur campaign in an effort to organize a massive restoration project upright thumb a 1968 indonesian stamp promoting restoration of borobudur in late 1960s indonesian government had requested from international community a major renovation to protect monument in 1973 a master plan to restore borobudur was created through an agreement concerning voluntary contributions to be given for execution of project to preserve borobudur paris 29 january 1973 5 countries agreed to contribute to restoration australia aud 200 000 belgium bef fr 250 000 cyprus cyp ps100 000 france usd 77 500 and germany dem dm 2 000 000 indonesian government and unesco then undertook complete overhaul of monument in a big restoration project between 1975 and 1982 in 1975 actual work began over one million stones were dismantled and removed during restoration and set aside like pieces of a massive jig saw puzzle to be individually identified catalogued cleaned and treated for preservation borobudur became a testing ground for new conservation techniques including new procedures to battle microorganisms attacking stone foundation was stabilized and all 1 460 panels were cleaned restoration involved dismantling of five square platforms and improvement of drainage by embedding water channels into monument both impermeable and filter layers were added this colossal project involved around 600 people to restore monument and cost a total of us 6 901 243 after renovation was finished unesco listed borobudur as a world heritage site in 1991 it is listed under cultural criteria i to represent a masterpiece of human creative genius ii to exhibit an important interchange of human values over a span of time or within a cultural area of world on developments in architecture or technology monumental arts town planning or landscape design and vi to be directly or tangibly associated with events or living traditions with ideas or with beliefs with artistic and literary works of outstanding universal significance in december 2017 idea to reinstall chattra on top of borobudur main stupa s has been revisited however expert said a thorough study is needed on restoring umbrella shaped pinnacle by early 2018 chattra restoration has not yet commenced contemporary events thumb buddhist pilgrims meditate on top platform religious ceremony following major 1973 renovation funded by unesco borobudur is once again used as a place of worship and pilgrimage once a year during full moon in may or june buddhists in indonesia observe vesak day commemorating birth death and time when siddhartha gautama attained highest wisdom to become buddha shakyamuni vesak is an official national holiday in indonesia and ceremony is centered at three buddhist temples by walking from mendut to pawon and ending at borobudur tourism thumb right vesak ceremony at borobudur monument is single most visited tourist attraction in indonesia in 1974 260 000 tourists of whom 36 000 were foreigners visited monument figure climbed to visitors annually 80 were domestic tourists in mid 1990s before country s economic crisis tourism development however has been criticized for not including local community giving rise to occasional conflicts in 2003 residents and small businesses around borobudur organized several meetings and poetry protests objecting to a provincial government plan to build a three storey mall complex dubbed java world international tourism awards were given to borobudur archaeological park such as pata grand pacific award 2004 pata gold award winner 2011 and pata gold award winner 2012 in june 2012 borobudur was recorded in guinness book of world records as world s largest buddhist archaeological site thumb tourists in borobudur conservation unesco identified three specific areas of concern under present state of conservation i vandalism by visitors ii soil erosion in south eastern part of site and iii analysis and restoration of missing elements soft soil numerous earthquakes and heavy rains lead to destabilization of structure earthquakes are by far most important contributing factors since not only do stones fall down and arches crumble but earth itself can move in waves further destroying structure increasing popularity of stupa brings in many visitors most of whom are from indonesia despite warning signs on all levels not to touch anything regular transmission of warnings over loudspeakers and presence of guards vandalism on reliefs and statues is a common occurrence and problem leading to further deterioration as of 2009 there is no system in place to limit number of visitors allowed per day or to introduce mandatory guided tours only in august 2014 conservation authority of borobudur reported some severe abrasion of stone stairs caused by scraping of visitors footwear conservation authority planned to install wooden stairs to cover and protect original stone stairs just like those installed in angkor wat rehabilitation thumb location of borobudur relative to mount merapi and yogyakarta borobudur was heavily affected by eruption of mount merapi in october and november 2010 volcanic ash from merapi fell on temple complex which is approximately west southwest of crater a layer of ash up to thick fell on temple statues during eruption of 3 5 november also killing nearby vegetation with experts fearing that acidic ash might damage historic site temple complex was closed from 5 to 9 november to clean up ashfall unesco donated us 3 million as a part of costs towards rehabilitation of borobudur after mount merapi s 2010 eruption more than 55 000 stone blocks comprising temple s structure were dismantled to restore drainage system which had been clogged by slurry after rain restoration was finished in november in january 2012 two german stone conservation experts spent ten days at site analyzing temples and making recommendations to ensure their long term preservation in june germany agreed to contribute 130 000 to unesco for second phase of rehabilitation in which six experts in stone conservation microbiology structural engineering and chemical engineering would spend a week in borobudur in june then return for another visit in september or october these missions would launch preservation activities recommended in january report and would include capacity building activities to enhance preservation capabilities of governmental staff and young conservation experts on 14 february 2014 major tourist attractions in yogyakarta and central java including borobudur prambanan and ratu boko were closed to visitors after being severely affected by volcanic ash from eruption of kelud volcano in east java located around 200 kilometers east from yogyakarta workers covered iconic stupas and statues of borobudur temple to protect structure from volcanic ash kelud volcano erupted on 13 february 2014 with an explosion heard as far away as yogyakarta security threats on 21 january 1985 nine stupas were badly damaged by nine bombs in 1991 a blind muslim preacher husein ali al was sentenced to life imprisonment for masterminding a series of bombings in mid 1980s including temple attack two other members of islamic extremist group that carried out bombings were each sentenced to 20 years in 1986 and another man received a 13 year prison term on 27 may 2006 an earthquake of 6 2 magnitude struck south coast of central java event caused severe damage around region and casualties to nearby city of yogyakarta but borobudur remained intact in august 2014 indonesian police and security forces tightened security in and around borobudur temple compound as a precaution to a threat posted on social media by a self proclaimed indonesian branch of isis citing that terrorists planned to destroy borobudur and other statues in indonesia security improvements included repair and increased deployment of cctv monitors and implementation of a night patrol in and around temple compound jihadist group follows a strict interpretation of islam that condemns any anthropomorphic representations such as sculptures as idolatry visitor overload problem high volume of visitors ascending borobudur s narrow stairs has caused a severe wear out on stone of stairs eroding stones surface and made them thinner and smoother overall borobudur has 2 033 surfaces of stone stairs spread over four cardinal directions including west side east south and north there are around 1 028 surfaces of them or about 49 15 percent that are severely worn out to avoid further wear of stairs stones since november 2014 two main sections of borobudur stairs eastern ascending route and northern descending route sides are covered with wooden structures similar technique has been applied in angkor wat in cambodia and egyptian pyramids in march 2015 borobudur conservation center proposed further to seal stairs with rubber cover proposals have also been made that visitors be issued special sandals architecture archaeological excavation into borobudur during reconstruction suggests that adherents of hinduism or a pre indic faith had already begun to erect a large structure on borobudur s hill before site was appropriated by buddhists foundations are unlike any hindu or buddhist shrine structures and therefore initial structure is considered more indigenous javanese than hindu or buddhist design thumb left borobudur ground plan taking form of a mandala borobudur is built as a single large stupa and when viewed from above takes form of a giant tantric buddhist mandala simultaneously representing buddhist cosmology and nature of mind original foundation is a square approximately on each side it has nine platforms of which lower six are square and upper three are circular upper platform features seventy two small stupas surrounding one large central stupa each stupa is bell shaped and pierced by numerous decorative openings statues of buddha sit inside pierced enclosures design of borobudur took form of a step pyramid previously prehistoric austronesian megalithic culture in indonesia had constructed several earth mounds and stone step pyramid structures called punden berundak as discovered in site near and in near kuningan construction of stone pyramids is based on native beliefs that mountains and high places are abode of ancestral spirits or punden berundak step pyramid is basic design in borobudur believed to be continuation of older megalithic tradition incorporated with mahayana buddhist ideas and symbolism thumb borobudur architectural model monument s three divisions symbolize three realms of buddhist cosmology namely kamadhatu world of desires rupadhatu world of forms and finally arupadhatu formless world ordinary sentient beings live out their lives on lowest level realm of desire those who have burnt out all desire for continued existence leave world of desire and live in world on level of form alone they see forms but are not drawn to them finally full buddhas go beyond even form and experience reality at its purest most fundamental level formless ocean of nirvana liberation from cycle of samsara where enlightened soul had no longer attached to worldly form corresponds to concept of complete voidness or nonexistence of self kamadhatu is represented by base rupadhatu by five square platforms body and arupadhatu by three circular platforms and large topmost stupa architectural features between three stages have metaphorical differences for instance square and detailed decorations in rupadhatu disappear into plain circular platforms in arupadhatu to represent how world of forms where men are still attached with forms and names changes into world of formless congregational worship in borobudur is performed in a walking pilgrimage pilgrims are guided by system of staircases and corridors ascending to top platform each platform represents one stage of enlightenment path that guides pilgrims was designed to symbolize buddhist cosmology in 1885 a hidden structure under base was accidentally discovered hidden footing contains reliefs 160 of which are narratives describing real kamadhatu remaining reliefs are panels with short inscriptions that apparently provide instructions for sculptors illustrating scenes to be carved real base is hidden by an encasement base purpose of which remains a mystery it was first thought that real base had to be covered to prevent a disastrous subsidence of monument into hill there is another theory that encasement base was added because original hidden footing was incorrectly designed according to vastu shastra indian ancient book about architecture and town planning regardless of why it was commissioned encasement base was built with detailed and meticulous design and with aesthetic and religious consideration building structure thumb left 300px half cross section with 4 6 9 height ratio for foot body and head respectively approximately of andesite stones were taken from neighbouring stone quarries to build monument stone was cut to size transported to site and laid without mortar knobs indentations and were used to form joints between stones roof of stupas niches and arched gateways were constructed in corbelling method reliefs were created in situ after building had been completed monument is equipped with a good drainage system to cater to area s high stormwater run off to prevent flooding 100 spouts are installed at each corner each with a unique carved gargoyle in shape of a giant or makara thumb upright stairs of borobudur through arches of kala thumb upright a narrow corridor with reliefs on wall borobudur differs markedly from general design of other structures built for this purpose instead of being built on a flat surface borobudur is built on a natural hill however construction technique is similar to other temples in java without inner spaces seen in other temples and with a general design similar to shape of pyramid borobudur was first thought more likely to have served as a stupa instead of a temple a stupa is intended as a shrine for buddha sometimes stupas were built only as devotional symbols of buddhism a temple on other hand is used as a house of worship meticulous complexity of monument s design suggests that borobudur is in fact a temple little is known about architect of complex his name is recounted from javanese folk tales rather than from written inscriptions basic unit of measurement used during construction was tala defined as length of a human face from forehead s hairline to tip of chin or distance from tip of thumb to tip of middle finger when both fingers are stretched at their maximum distance unit is thus relative from one individual to next but monument has exact measurements a survey conducted in 1977 revealed frequent findings of a ratio of 4 6 9 around monument architect had used formula to lay out precise dimensions of fractal and self similar geometry in borobudur s design this ratio is also found in designs of pawon and mendut nearby buddhist temples archeologists have conjectured that 4 6 9 ratio and tala have calendrical astronomical and cosmological significance as is case with temple of angkor wat in cambodia main structure can be divided into three components base body and top base is in size with walls body is composed of five square platforms each of diminishing height first terrace is set back from edge of base each subsequent terrace is set back leaving a narrow corridor at each stage top consists of three circular platforms with each stage supporting a row of perforated stupas arranged in concentric circles there is one main dome at center top of which is highest point of monument above ground level stairways at center of each of four sides give access to top with a number of arched gates overlooked by 32 lion statues gates are adorned with kala s head carved on top of each and projecting from each side this kala makara motif is commonly found on gates of javanese temples main entrance is on eastern side location of first narrative reliefs stairways on slopes of hill also link monument to low lying plain reliefs thumb left position of narrative bas reliefs stories on borobudur wall borobudur is constructed in such a way that it reveals various levels of terraces showing intricate architecture that goes from being heavily ornamented with bas reliefs to being plain in arupadhatu circular terraces first four terrace walls are showcases for bas relief sculptures these are exquisite considered to be most elegant and graceful in ancient buddhist world bas reliefs in borobudur depicted many scenes of daily life in 8th century ancient java from courtly palace life hermit in forest to those of commoners in village it also depicted temple marketplace various flora and fauna and also native vernacular architecture people depicted here are images of king queen princes noblemen courtier soldier servant commoners priest and hermit reliefs also depicted mythical spiritual beings in buddhist beliefs such as asuras gods bodhisattvas gandharvas and apsaras images depicted on bas relief often served as reference for historians to research for certain subjects such as study of architecture weaponry economy fashion and also mode of transportation of 8th century maritime southeast asia one of famous renderings of an 8th century southeast asian double outrigger ship is borobudur ship today actual size replica of borobudur ship that had sailed from indonesia to africa in 2004 is displayed in samudra museum located a few hundred meters north of borobudur borobudur reliefs also pay close attention to indian aesthetic discipline such as pose and gesture that contain certain meanings and aesthetic value reliefs of noblemen and noble women kings or divine beings such as apsaras taras and are usually portrayed in tribhanga pose three bend pose on neck hips and knee with one leg resting and one upholding body weight this position is considered as most graceful pose such as figure of holding a lotus during borobudur excavation archeologists discovered colour pigments of blue red green black as well as bits of gold foil and concluded that monument that we see today a dark gray mass of volcanic stone lacking in colour was probably once coated with white plaster and then painted with bright colors serving perhaps as a beacon of buddhist teaching same plaster can also be found in sari kalasan and sewu temples it is likely that bas reliefs of borobudur was originally quite colourful before centuries of
