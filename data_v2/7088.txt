seahorse shown in promotions since series began was in fact a genetically encoded signature created by walter s father dr robert bishop in an interview after episode s broadcast consulting producer akiva goldsman cited bishop revival when discussing use of flashbacks in fringe he stated his disinclination to use too many flashbacks in series explaining i think flashbacks are really useful and there are a couple of places where it will be useful but fundamentally no i don t think we re a show that will be doing a lot of jumping back in time despite single horde of calls for walter s grandfather nazi hunting series i think not but it was fun to do in peter episode guest stars for episode included craig robert young max train sierra pitkin brendon zub barbara john macintyre lauren

adults aged 18 49 with an estimated 9 153 million viewers tuning in fringe was up fifteen percent from previous week with a 3 0 rating tying its highest 18 49 ratings share for season it was second most viewed episode of season after season premiere a new day in old town reviews episode received mixed to positive reviews from television critics jane boursaw of tv squad wasn t sure what to think about bishop revival but loved plotline about walter s dad being a german spy working for us government alternately annalee newitz of io9 called episode surprisingly meh while appreciating all weird family revelations about bishops she believed revelations about walter s father to be too much because we didn t need that extra backstory newitz wished fringe had brought back olivia s childhood subplot and its ties with walter and peter a v club columnist noel murray was also critical of episode explaining plotwise there wasn t much going on in bishop revival fd tracked down a criminal and felled that criminal that s really it murray did however praise killer s methods and aryan aloofness as cool and delightfully old school like newitz tim grierson of magazine new york believed episode contained stupid revelations for instance nazi connection of walter s father just felt like a variation on season one s episodes in which bizarre phenomena could always magically be linked back to walter s work for government obviously this info about peter s grandfather was supposed to be shocking showing how bishop family s scientific work can so easily be perverted for evil but by this point it just seems like a very artificial unnecessary ploy to keep us engaged other than a few minor complaints with episode s logic ign writer ramsey isler thought positively about bishop revival and nazi story element in particular stating there s a definite unique fringe flavor that makes this story work isler disliked unsolved mystery of hoffman however writing story really had feel of one of those intriguing but ultimately disposable stories in fringe library jennifer walker from tv fanatic called episode amazing and a heart stopper while andrew hanson of los angeles times enjoyed father son dynamic ken tucker from entertainment weekly wrote bishop revival was one of series most satisfying stand alone episodes because it featured a good threat and gave more information about bishop family s backstory tucker praised john noble s performance as his portrayal of walter encompasses everything from endearing to ferocious concentration and commitment mtv s josh wigler believed episode was terrific but wished there was more of a balance between show s three leads and that olivia was featured on a regular basis he hanson and other critics agreed that this and previous week s episode gave fringe some strong momentum heading into winter finale though normally skeptical of series many fringe cases popular mechanics called episode fringes most plausible case yet awards and nominations at
