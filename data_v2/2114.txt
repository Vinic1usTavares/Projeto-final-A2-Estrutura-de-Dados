2004 north indian ocean cyclone season was first in which tropical cyclones were officially named in basin cyclone onil which struck pakistan was named in late september final storm cyclone agni was also named and crossed into southern hemisphere shortly before dissipation this storm became notable during its origins and became one of storms closest to equator season was fairly active with ten depressions forming from may to november india meteorological department designated four of these as cyclonic storms which have maximum sustained winds of at least 65 km h 40 mph averaged over three minutes joint typhoon warning center also issued warnings for five of storms on an unofficial basis in early may two tropical storms formed on opposite sides of india first formed on may 5 and meandered while intensifying dropping in aminidivi in lakshadweep group offshore western india which was highest daily rainfall total in basin a week later a cyclone strongest of season struck myanmar killing 236 people and leaving 25 000 people homeless depressions also formed on opposite sides of india in june a depression in september killed 59 people after dropping torrential rainfall over bangladesh and adjacent west bengal in october another depression struck region killing 273 people there was also a short lived cyclonic storm in arabian sea in november toc season summary india meteorological department in new delhi imd was designated a regional specialized meteorological center by world meteorological organization in july 1988 to monitor and warn on tropical cyclones in northern indian ocean basin is defined between 45deg and 100deg e and north of equator agency also used geostationary satellites and a network of buoys to track storms and utilized various tropical cyclone forecast models to predict future tracks american based joint typhoon warning center jtwc also issued warnings for storms in basin on an unofficial basis monsoon became active in may as water temperatures became warm twin depressions formed during june on opposite sides of india which helped intensify monsoon over country a notable feature of season was arabian sea being more active than bay of bengal imd began naming tropical cyclones within basin in 2004 beginning after monsoon season as such only two cyclonic storms in latter half of year were named systems cyclonic storm arb 01 toward end of april an area of convection persisted in southern bay of bengal it developed into a distinct low pressure area on may 1 over body of water but soon moved westward into india without developing on may 4 system emerged from kerala into arabian sea and soon after convection rapidly increased early on may 5 jtwc classified system as tropical cyclone 01a about 370 km 230 mi west southwest of kochi india on same day imd began classifying it as a depression but soon after upgraded it to a deep depression and later cyclonic storm after increased organization storm meandered off southwest india for three days due to weak steering currents during that time convection pulsed around circulation and imd upgraded it to a severe cyclonic storm on may 7 with winds of 100 km h 55 mph by contrast jtwc only estimated peak winds of 85 km h 50 mph increased wind shear cooler waters and dry air rapidly weakened convection exposing center and causing storm to deteriorate quickly into a depression on may 10 system degenerated into a remnant low off gujarat without any discernible low level circulation precursor to storm brought heavy rainfall to southern india reaching in thiruvananthapuram over 48 hours remnants also brought upwards of of rainfall in gujarat while an active tropical cyclone storm dropped torrential rainfall to lakshadweep group offshore western india aminidivi recorded over three days including in just 24 hours this broke record for highest daily rainfall total related to a north indian ocean cyclone high rains cut communications from island group to mainland and damaged 45 houses in conjunction with winds high waves sank 15 boats and one cargo ship while also causing erosion in kerala storm killed nine people and caused rs300 million rupees 6 7 million usd extremely severe cyclonic storm bob 01 second storm of season formed as a depression on may 16 in central bay of bengal with low wind shear and a surge in monsoon trough storm intensified while meandering over open waters storm eventually began a steady northeastward motion due to a ridge to north over india while approaching land an eye developed in center of storm indicative of a strong cyclone on may 19 cyclone made landfall along northwestern myanmar near sittwe with maximum sustained winds estimated at 165 km h 105 mph by imd storm rapidly weakened over land although its remnants spread rainfall into northern thailand and yunnan province in china winds from cyclone reached 157 km h 98 mph in myanmar occurring in conjunction with heavy rainfall and a high storm surge despite storm s ferocity government did not report about cyclone for ten days as they usually under report on landfalling storms cyclone caused heavy damage throughout rakhine state destroying or heavily damaging 4 035 homes and leaving 25 000 people homeless there was widespread crop damage resulting in food shortages and damaged roads disrupted subsequent relief efforts damage in myanmar totaled over million kyat us 99 2 million making it worst storm in country since 1968 and there were 236 deaths although damage was heaviest in myanmar cyclone s effects also spread into neighboring bangladesh where strong winds knocked over trees and capsized two ships deep depression arb 02 on june 8 a low pressure area formed in eastern arabian sea a nearby buoy recorded winds of 45 km h 30 mph which organized into a depression on june 10 while remaining nearly stationary depression quickly intensified into a deep depression system later began a slow westward movement due to a ridge to north on june 11 and again on following day jtwc issued a tropical cyclone formation alert tcfa although system never strengthened beyond its initial stages strong wind shear caused depression to weaken and imd downgraded it to a remnant low on june 13 deep depression bob 02 a surge in monsoon developed an area of convection over andaman sea in early june spawning a low pressure area which later became a depression on june 11 moving to northwest along a ridge it strengthened into a deep depression next day early on june 13 system struck odisha near puri and initially maintained its intensity over land however it eventually weakened degenerating into a remnant low over chhattisgarh on june 14 depression dropped heavy rainfall in eastern india particularly odisha there peak 24 hour precipitation total was in there were no reports of damage land depression bob 03 for about ten days in september a monsoon depression persisted around northern edge of bay of bengal onto adjacent landmasses initially associated with an upper level low on september 10 a low pressure area developed within monsoon trough in extreme northern bay of bengal moving northwestward it organized into a depression after it moved ashore organizing over west bengal near kolkata system attained peak winds of 45 km h 30 mph despite being over land located within a col or weakness between ridges depression meandered over eastern india weakening into a remnant low on september 15 it moved slowly northwestward reaching uttar pradesh by september 22 depression dropped heavy rainfall in eastern india including as a tropical cyclone a precursor and its remnant notable rainfall totals include in on september 9 on september 21 at a station in uttar pradesh and in dhaka in neighboring bangladesh heaviest daily total in 50 years flash flooding in indian state of tripura killed four people and isolated about 55 000 people three people died in west bengal where floodwaters left about 650 000 people homeless in hundreds of villages flash flooding in uttar pradesh killed 33 people overnight on september 21 in nearby bangladesh depression produced additional flooding after a similar disaster occurred in july temporarily isolating about 1 million people and killing 19 severe cyclonic storm onil a depression formed out of an area of convection southwest of india on september 30 next day it intensified into cyclonic storm onil becoming first tropical cyclone on record to be named in northern indian ocean cyclone onil quickly attained its peak intensity on october 2 with winds of 100 km h 65 mph and a barometric pressure of 990 mbar hpa 29 23 inhg however dry air quickly entered system causing it to rapidly weaken to a depression just off coast of gujarat india over following several days system took a slow erratic track towards south southeast after turning northeastward system made landfall near porbandar on october 10 and dissipated shortly thereafter throughout southeastern pakistan and northwestern india thousands of residents were evacuated prior to cyclone s arrival in these areas storm produced moderate to heavy rainfall peaking at in thatta sindh pakistan these rains led to flash flooding in several areas nine people died in several incidents related to storm in karachi drainage system of hyderabad sustained significant damage leading to several protests and demonstrations by city residents offshore 300 fishermen are believed to have gone missing during storm depression bob 04 05 a low pressure area formed in bay of bengal on september 30 and gradually became more organized it moved northwestward and developed into a depression on october 2 without intensifying beyond winds of 45 km h 30 mph depression moved ashore andhra pradesh near kalingapatnam on october 4 it rapidly weakened into a remnant low and turned to northeast on october 7 system re intensified into a depression near despite being over land aided by moisture from bay of bengal after crossing into northern bangladesh system again weakened into a remnant low which gradually elongated and weakened for several days in early october depression dropped rainfall across southeastern india which was heaviest after it re intensified over land in northeastern west bengal recorded in a 24 hour period and reported in two days in northern andhra pradesh flooding from depression affected 40 villages wrecking 50 houses waters also inundated of rice paddies and damaged 200 irrigation water tanks in west bengal floods killed 3 000 migratory birds and damaged rs1 1 billion rupees us 23 9 million worth of crops 51 people also died in state in neighboring odisha four people were killed and floods washed away a bridge and affected several villages third large flood event of year depression caused its most severe impact in northeastern india where 218 people were killed including 112 in city of alone there floods struck in middle of night catching residents off guard and washing away hundreds of houses along two whole blocks flash flooding caused landslides in while regional and national roads were damaged or submerged over 15 000 people were forced to evacuate their homes to emergency shelters across region of crops were damaged and 30 000 homes were damaged or destroyed rainfall spread into nepal where was recorded at airport in kathmandu precipitation led to a snowstorm in tibet reaching in one location this marked highest daily snowfall for station in october and caused a loss of crops and livestock deep depression arb 04 an area of convection formed west of sri lanka on october 31 organizing around a circulation center low wind shear allowed slow development and a low pressure area developed on november 1 in southeastern arabian sea following day a depression formed off southwest coast of india moving northward system s convection continued to organize around center and jtwc classified it as tropical cyclone 04a on november 4 imd upgraded it to a deep depression on next day as storm began moving westward despite good outflow convection failed to intensify further and was limited to eastern portion and jtwc did not estimate 1 minute winds higher than 75 km h 45 mph imd only assessed a peak of 55 km h 35 mph drier air from north caused thunderstorms to weaken and expose circulation imd downgraded system to a remnant low on november 7 and remnants continued to west southwest passing near socotra island on november 9 remnant circulation brushed coast of somalia after redeveloping some convection but there was no redevelopment severe cyclonic storm agni a tropical disturbance was observed on november 19 about 800 km 500 mi southeast of colombo sri lanka in bay of bengal disturbance tracked westward weakening after passing south of sri lanka it entered arabian sea on november 26 and despite being located unusually close to equator system maintained convection about its circulation aided by low wind shear while system was organizing center crossed equator to reach about 0 5deg s thus becoming an anticyclonic circulation in southern hemisphere this was unusual as coriolis effect is nonexistent along equator coriolis effect refers to planetary vorticity which provides spin in a cyclone on november 28 jtwc classified it as tropical cyclone 05a just 78 km 48 mi from equator imd classified it as a depression next day at 1 5deg n noting that cyclogenesis at such low latitudes has not occurred in past it rivaled tropical storm vamei as one of closest storms to equator after developing system moved northwestward due to a ridge over india imd upgraded depression to cyclonic storm agni late on november 29 and further to a severe cyclonic storm next day jtwc also upgraded agni to equivalent of a minimal hurricane estimating 120 km h 75 mph wind shear and dry air caused storm to weaken after agni turned westward imd downgraded it to a depression and later remnant low on december 2 although jtwc tracked it for another day issuing their final advisory while agni was about 450 km 275 mi south southeast of cape guardafui easternmost point of horn of africa remnants moved ashore at eastern somalia before turning to south and dissipating on december 5 see also list of north indian ocean cyclone seasons list of wettest tropical cyclones list of wettest known tropical
