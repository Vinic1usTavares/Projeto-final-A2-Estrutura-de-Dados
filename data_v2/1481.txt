thumb old adobe minaret in village iran thumb earthen hut with thatched roof in near sudan an earth structure is a building or other structure made largely from soil since soil is a widely available material it has been used in construction since prehistoric times it may be combined with other materials compressed and or baked to add strength soil is still an economical material for many applications and may have low environmental impact both during and after construction earth structure materials may be as simple as mud or mud mixed with straw to make cob sturdy dwellings may be also built from sod or turf soil may be stabilized by addition of lime or cement and may be compacted into rammed earth construction is faster with pre formed adobe or mudbricks compressed earth blocks earthbags or fired clay bricks types of earth structure include earth shelters where a dwelling is wholly or partly embedded in ground or encased in soil native american earth lodges are examples wattle and daub houses use a wattle of poles interwoven with sticks to provide stability for mud walls sod houses were built on northwest coast of europe and later by european settlers on north american prairies adobe or mud brick buildings are built around world and include houses apartment buildings mosques and churches fujian are large fortified rammed earth buildings in southeastern china that shelter as many as 80 families other types of earth structure include mounds and pyramids used for religious purposes levees mechanically stabilized earth retaining walls forts trenches and embankment dams soil thumb soil types by clay silt and sand composition as used by usda soil is created from rock that has been chemically or physically weathered transported deposited and precipitated soil particles include sand silt and clay sand particles are largest at in diameter and clay smallest at less than in diameter both sand and silt are mostly inert rock particles including quartz calcite feldspar and mica clays typically are phyllosilicate minerals with a sheet like structure very small clay particles interact with each other physically and chemically even a small proportion of clay affects physical properties of soil much more than might be expected clays such as kaolinite do not expand or contract when wetted or dried and are useful for brick making others such as expand or contract considerably when wet or dry and are not suitable for building loam is a mix of sand silt and clay in which none predominates soils are given different names depending on relative proportions of sand silt and clay such as silt loam clay loam and silty clay loam construction subject of this article referred to as adobe construction when it uses unfired clay bricks is an ancient building technology it was used in early civilizations of mediterranean egypt and mesopotamia in indus ganges and yellow river valleys in central and south america as of 2005 about 1 5 billion people lived in houses built of loam in recent years interest in loam construction has revived in developed world it is seen as a way to minimize use of fossil fuels and pollution particularly carbon dioxide during manufacture and to create a comfortable living environment through high mass and high absorption of material two main technologies are stamped or rammed earth clay or loam called pise de terre in french and adobe typically using sun dried bricks made of a mud and straw mixture materials thumb traditional round mud and thatch houses forming a family compound near ghana thumb mud houses in kandahar afghanistan earth usually requires some sort of processing for use in construction it may be combined with water to make mud straw may be added some form of stabilizing material such as lime or cement may be used to harden earth and earth may be compacted to increase strength mud coursed mud construction is one of oldest approaches to building walls moist mud is formed by hand to make base of a wall and allowed to dry more mud is added and allowed to dry to form successive courses until wall is complete with puddled mud a hand made mud form is filled with wetter mud and allowed to dry in iran puddled mud walls are called chine construction each course is about thick and about high typically technique is used for garden walls but not for house construction presumably because of concern about strength of walls made in this way a drawback to approach is that a lot of time can be spent waiting for each course to dry another technique used in areas where wood is plentiful is to build a wood frame house and to infill it with mud primarily to provide insulation in parts of england a similar technique was used with cob cob thumb cob wall in harwell oxfordshire england hundreds of years old thatched to protect it from water cob sometimes referred to as monolithic adobe is a natural building material made from soil that includes clay sand or small stones and an organic material such as straw cob walls are usually built up in courses have no mortar joints and need 30 or more clay in soil cob can be used as in fill in post and beam buildings but is often used for load bearing walls and can bear up to two stories a cob wall should be at least thick and ratio of width to height should be no more than one to ten it will typically be plastered inside and out with a mix of lime soil and sand cob is fireproof and its thermal mass helps stabilize indoor temperatures tests have shown that cob has some resistance to seismic activity however building codes in developed world may not recognize cob as an approved material sod or turf thumb sod bricks in a house wall cut sod bricks called in spanish can be used to make tough and durable walls sod is cut from soil that has a heavy mat of grass roots which may be found in river bottom lands it is stood on edge to dry before being used in construction european settlers on north american prairies found that sod least likely to deteriorate due to freezing or rain came from dried sloughs turf was once extensively used for walls of houses in ireland scotland and iceland where some turf houses may still be found a turf house may last fifty years or longer if well maintained in a cold climate icelanders find that best quality turf is top of grass turf stabilized earth clay is usually hard and strong when dry but becomes very soft when it absorbs water dry clay helps hold an earth wall together but if wall is directly exposed to rain or to water leaking down from roof it may become saturated and collapse earth may be stabilized to make it more weather resistant practice of stabilizing earth by adding burnt lime is centuries old portland cement or bitumen may also be added to earth intended for construction which adds strength although stabilized earth is not as strong as fired clay or concrete mixtures of cement and lime or pozzolana and lime may also be used for stabilization preferably sand content of soil will be 65 75 soils with low clay content or with no more than 15 non expansive clay are suitable for stabilized earth clay percentage may be reduced by adding sand if available if there is more than 15 clay it may take more than 10 cement to stabilize soil which adds to cost if earth contains little clay and holds 10 or more cement it is in effect concrete cement is not particularly environmentally friendly since manufacturing process generates large amounts of carbon dioxide low density stabilized earth will be porous and weak earth must therefore be compacted either by a machine that makes blocks or within wall using rammed earth technique rammed earth thumb old school built of rammed earth in 1836 37 in hesse germany rammed earth is a technique for building walls using natural raw materials such as earth chalk lime or gravel a rammed earth wall is built by placing damp soil in a temporary form soil is manually or mechanically compacted and then form is removed rammed earth is generally made without much water and so does not need much time to dry as building rises it is susceptible to moisture so must be laid on a course that stops rising dampness must be roofed or covered to keep out water from above and may need protection through some sort of plaster paint or sheathing in china rammed earth walls were built by people in 2600 1900 bc during period when cities first appeared in region thick sloping walls made of rammed earth became a characteristic of traditional buddhist monasteries throughout himalayas and became very common in northern indian areas such as sikkim technique spread to middle east and to north africa and city of carthage was built of rammed earth from there technology was brought to europe by romans rammed earth structures may be long lasting most of great wall of china was made from rammed earth as was alhambra in kingdom of granada in northern europe there are rammed earth buildings up to seven stories high and two hundred years old concrete romans made durable concrete strong enough for load bearing walls roman concrete contains a rubble of broken bricks and rocks set in mortar mortar included lime and pozzolana a volcanic material that contributed significantly to its strength roman concrete structures such as colosseum completed in 80 ad still stand their longevity may be explained by fact that builders used a relatively dry mix of mortar and aggregate and compacted it by pounding it down to eliminate air pockets although derived from earth products concrete structures would not usually be considered earth structures building units mud brick or adobe brick thumb adobe bricks near a construction site in kyrgyzstan thumb left 250px making mudbricks near cooktown australia mudbricks or adobe bricks are preformed modular masonry units of sun dried mud that were invented at different times in different parts of world as civilization developed construction with bricks avoids delays while each course of puddled mud dries wall murals show that adobe production techniques were highly advanced in egypt by 2500 bc adobe construction is common throughout much of africa today adobe bricks are traditionally made from sand and clay mixed with water to a plastic consistency with straw or grass as a binder mud is prepared placed in wooden forms tamped and leveled and then turned out of mold to dry for several days bricks are then stood on end to air cure for a month or more in southwest united states and mexico adobe buildings had massive walls and were rarely more than two stories high adobe mission churches were never more than about since adobe surfaces are fragile coatings are used to protect them these coatings periodically renewed have included mud plaster lime plaster whitewash or stucco adobe walls were historically made by laying bricks with mud mortar which swells and shrinks at same rate as bricks when wetted or dried heated or cooled modern adobe may be stabilized with cement and bonded with cement mortars but cement mortars will cause adobe bricks to deteriorate due to different rates of thermal expansion and contraction compressed earth block thumb compressed earth block housing being built in midland texas in 2006 compressed earth blocks ceb were traditionally made by using a stick to ram soil into a wooden mold today they are usually made from subsoil compressed in a hand operated or powered machine in developing world manual machines can be a cost effective solution for making uniform building blocks while more complex and expensive motorized machines are less likely to be appropriate although labor intensive ceb construction avoids cost of buying and transporting materials block making machines may form blocks that have interlocking shapes to reduce requirement for mortar block may have holes or grooves so rods such as bamboo can be inserted to improve earthquake resistance suitable earth must be used with enough clay to hold block together and resist erosion but not too much expansive clay when block has been made from stabilized earth which contains cement concrete must be given perhaps three weeks to cure during this time blocks should be stacked and kept from drying out by sprinkling water over them this may be a problem in hot dry climates where water is scarce closely stacking blocks and covering them with a polythene sheet may help reduce water loss earthbags earthbag construction is a natural building technique that has evolved from historic military construction techniques for bunkers local subsoil of almost any composition can be used although an adobe mix would be preferable soil is moistened so it will compact into a stable structure when packed into woven polypropylene or burlap sacks or tubes plastic mesh is sometimes used polypropylene pp sacks are most common since they are durable when covered cheap and widely available bags are laid in courses with barbed wire between each course to prevent slipping each course is tamped after it is laid structure in pp bags is similar to adobe but more flexible with mesh tubing structure is like rammed earth earthbags may be used to make dome shaped or vertical wall buildings with soil stabilization they may also be used for retaining walls fired clay brick thumb english bond bricks from 1454 at old college in tattershall lincolnshire england technique of firing clay bricks in a kiln dates to about 3500 bc fired bricks were being used to build durable masonry across europe asia and north africa by 1200 bc and still remain an important building material modern fired clay bricks are formed from clays or shales shaped and then fired in a kiln for 8 12 hours at a temperature of 900 1150 degc result is a ceramic that is mainly composed of silica and alumina with other ingredients such as quartz sand porosity of brick depends on materials and on firing temperature and duration bricks may vary in color depending on amount of iron and calcium carbonate in materials used and amount of oxygen in kiln bricks may decay due to crystallization of salts on brick or in its pores from frost action and from acidic gases bricks are laid in courses bonded with mortar a combination of portland cement lime and sand a wall that is two bricks thick will include stretcher bricks with their long narrow side exposed and header bricks crossing from side to side there are various brickwork bonds or patterns of stretchers and headers including english dutch and flemish bonds examples earth sheltering thumb turf houses in iceland an example of earth sheltering earth sheltering has been used for thousands of years to make energy efficient dwellings there are various configurations at one extreme an earth sheltered dwelling is completely underground with perhaps an open courtyard to provide air and light an earth house may be set into a slope with windows or door openings in one or more of its sides or building may be on ground level but with earth mounded against walls and perhaps with an earth roof pit houses made by hohokam farmers between 100 and 900 ad in what is now southwest of us were structures partially embedded in south facing slopes their successful design was used for hundreds of years at tunisia most of ancient homes were built below ground level and surrounded courtyards about square homes were reached through tunnels other examples of subterranean semi subterranean or cliff based dwellings in both hot and cold climates are found in turkey northern china and himalayas and southwest usa a number of buddhist monasteries built from earth and other materials into cliff sides or caves in himalayan areas such as tibet bhutan nepal and northern india are often perilously placed starting in 1970s interest in technique has revived in developed countries by setting an earth house into ground house will be cooler in warm season and warmer in cool season native american earth lodge an earth lodge is a circular building made by some of native americans of north america they have wood post and beam construction and are dome shaped a typical structure would have four or more central posts planted in ground and connected at top by cross beams smoke hole would be left open in center around central structure there was a larger ring of shorter posts also connected by cross beams rafters radiated from central cross beams to outside cross beams and then split planks or beams formed slanting or vertical side walls structure was covered by sticks and brush or grass covered in turn by a heavy layer of earth or sod some groups plastered whole structure with mud which dried to form a shell thumb school in a maasai village on a109 road kenya wattle and daub wattle and daub is an old building technique in which vines or smaller sticks are interwoven between upright poles and then mud mixed with straw and grass is plastered over wall technique is found around world from nile delta to japan where bamboo was used to make wattle in cahokia now in illinois usa wattle and daub houses were built with floor lowered by below ground a variant of technique is called in colombia in prehistoric britain simple circular wattle and daub shelters were built wherever adequate clay was available wattle and daub is still found as panels in timber framed buildings generally walls are not structural and in interior use technique in developed world was replaced by lath and plaster and then by gypsum prairie sod house thumb omer madison kem later representative to united states congress in front of his sod house in nebraska 1886 european pioneer farmers in prairies of north america where there is no wood for construction often made their first home in a dug out cave in side of a hill or ravine with a covering over entrance when they had time they would build a sod house farmer would use a plow to cut sod into bricks which were then piled up to form walls sod strips were piled grass side down staggered in same way as brickwork in three side by side rows resulting in a wall over thick sod wall was built around door and window frames and corners of wall were secured by rods driven vertically through them roof was made with poles or brush covered with prairie grass and then sealed with a layer of sod sod houses were strong and often lasted many years but they were damp and dirty unless interior walls were plastered roofs tended to leak and sometimes collapsed in a rainstorm mud brick buildings there are innumerable examples of mud brick or adobe building around world walled city of in yemen designated a world heritage site in 1982 is known fr its ten story unreinforced mud brick buildings mosque of mali was first built at start of 14th century ad 8th century ah from round mud bricks and a stone mud and was rebuilt several times afterwards steadily growing in size further south in mali great mosque of a dramatic example of sahel mudbrick architecture was built in 1907 based on design of an earlier great mosque first built on site in 1280 mudbrick requires maintenance and fundamentalist ruler had let previous mosque collapse casa grande ruins now a national monument in arizona protected by a modern roof is a massive four story adobe structure built by hohokam people between 1200 and 1450 ad first european to record great house was a jesuit priest father eusebio kino who visited site in 1694 at that time it had long been abandoned by time a temporary roof was installed in 1903 adobe building had been standing empty and unmaintained for hundreds of years huaca de la luna in what is now northern peru is a large adobe temple built by moche people building went through a series of construction phases growing eventually to a height of about with three main platforms four plazas and many smaller rooms and enclosures walls were covered by striking multi colored murals and friezes those visible today date from about 400 610 ad thumb tulou cluster in fujian province china a fujian tulou is a type of rural dwelling of hakka people in mountainous areas in southeastern fujian china they were mostly built between 13th and 20th centuries a tulou is a large enclosed and fortified earth building rectangular or circular with very thick load bearing rammed earth walls between three and five stories high a might house up to 80 families smaller interior buildings are often enclosed by these huge peripheral walls which can contain halls storehouses wells and living areas structure resembles a small fortified city walls are formed by compacting earth mixed with stone bamboo wood and other readily available materials and are to thick result is a well lit well ventilated and earthquake proof building that is warm in winter and cool in summer mounds and pyramids thumb ziggurat at ali air base in iraq were elevated temples constructed by sumerians between end of 4th millennium bc and 2nd millennium bc rising in a series of terraces to a temple up to above ground level ziggurat of ur contained about three million bricks none more than in length so construction would have been a huge project largest ziggurat was in babylon and is thought by some to be tower of babel mentioned in bible it was destroyed by alexander great and only foundations remain but originally it stood high on a base about square sun dried bricks were used for interior and kiln fired bricks for facing bricks were held together by clay or bitumen many pre columbian native american societies of ancient north america built large pyramidal earth structures known as platform mounds among largest and best known of these structures is monks mound at site of cahokia in what became illinois completed around 1100 ad which has a base larger than that of great pyramid at giza many of mounds underwent multiple episodes of mound construction at periodic intervals some becoming quite large they are believed to have played a central role in mound building peoples religious life and documented uses include semi public chief s house platforms public temple platforms mortuary platforms charnel house platforms earth lodge town house platforms residence platforms square ground and rotunda platforms and dance platforms pyramid of sun in teotihuacan mexico was started in 100 ad stone faced structure contains two million tons of rammed earth earthworks thumb retaining wall near todmorden west yorkshire england earthworks are engineering works created through moving or processing quantities of soil or unformed rock material may be moved to another location and formed into a desired shape for a purpose levees embankments and dams are types of earthwork a levee or is an elongated natural ridge or artificially constructed dirt fill wall that regulates water levels it is usually earthen and often runs parallel to course of a river in its floodplain or along low lying coastlines mechanically stabilized earth mse retaining walls may be used for embankments mse walls combine a concrete leveling pad wall facing panels coping soil reinforcement and select backfill a variety of designs of wall facing panels may be used after leveling pad has been laid and first row of panels has been placed and braced first layer of earth backfill is brought in behind wall and compacted first set of reinforcements is then laid over earth reinforcements which may be tensioned polymer or galvanized metal strips or grids are attached to facing panels this process is repeated with successive layers of panels earth and reinforcements panels are thus tied into earth embankment to make a stable structure with balanced stresses although construction using basic principles of mse has a long history mse was developed in its current form in 1960s reinforcing elements used can vary but include steel and term mse is usually used in us to distinguish it from reinforced earth a trade name of reinforced earth company but elsewhere reinforced soil is generally accepted term mse construction is relatively fast and inexpensive and although labor intensive it does not demand high levels of skill it is therefore suitable for developing as well as developed countries forts and trenches thumb soldiers in a trench on gallipoli during world war i earth has been used to construct fortifications for thousands of years including strongholds and walls often protected by ditches aerial photography in europe has revealed traces of earth fortifications from roman era and later medieval times offa s dyke is a huge earthwork that stretches along disputed border between england and wales little is known about period or builder king offa of mercia who died in 796 ad an early timber and earth fortification might later be succeeded by a brick or stone structure on same site trenches were used by besieging forces to approach a fortification while protected from missiles sappers would build saps or trenches that zig zagged towards fortress being attacked they piled excavated dirt to make a protective wall or gabion combined trench depth and gabion height might be sometimes sap was a tunnel dug several feet below surface sappers were highly skilled and highly paid due to extreme danger of their work in american civil war 1861 1865 trenches were used for defensive positions throughout struggle but played an increasingly important role in campaigns of last two years military earthworks perhaps culminated in vast network of trenches built during world war i 1914 1918 that stretched from switzerland to north sea by end of 1914 two lines of trenches faced each other manned by soldiers living in appalling conditions of cold damp and filth conditions were worst in allied trenches germans were more willing to accept trenches as long term positions and used concrete blocks to build secure shelters deep underground often with electrical lighting and heating embankment dams thumb mica dam in canada an embankment dam is a massive artificial water barrier it is typically created by emplacement and compaction of a complex semi plastic mound of various compositions of soil sand clay and or rock it has a semi permanent natural waterproof covering for its surface and a dense waterproof core this makes such a dam impervious to surface or seepage erosion force of impoundment creates a downward thrust upon mass of dam greatly increasing weight of dam on its foundation this added force effectively seals and makes waterproof underlying foundation of dam at interface between dam and its stream bed such a dam is composed of fragmented independent material particles friction and interaction of particles binds particles together into a stable mass rather than by use of a cementing substance syncrude mildred lake tailings dyke in alberta canada is an embankment dam about long and from high by volume of fill as of 2001 it was believed to be largest earth structure in world structural issues designing for earthquakes regions with low seismic risk are safe for most earth buildings but historic construction techniques often cannot
