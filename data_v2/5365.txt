foreign affairs it was during this period that he developed a cult of personality that has survived into 21st century in international affairs pilsudski pursued two complementary strategies meant to secure poland s independence and to enhance national security prometheism aimed at achieving disintegration of imperial russia and later soviet union into their constituent nations and creation of an intermarium federation of central and eastern european states lying between baltic and black seas to secure its peoples against western and eastern european imperialisms historian piotr characterizes pilsudski as an ardent polish patriot who on occasion would castigate poles for their stupidity cowardice or servility he described himself as a polish lithuanian and was stubborn and reserved loath to show his emotions some aspects of pilsudski s administration such as establishing bereza kartuska prison described by many as a concentration camp remain controversial yet he is highly esteemed in

internationalism he remained a polish nationalist in 1894 as its chief editor he began publishing an underground socialist newspaper robotnik worker he would also be one of its chief writers and initially a typesetter in 1895 he became a pps leader and took position that doctrinal issues were of minor importance and that socialist ideology should be merged with nationalist ideology since that combination offered greatest chance of restoring polish independence on 15 july 1899 while an underground organizer pilsudski married a fellow socialist organizer maria nee according to his chief biographer waclaw jedrzejewicz marriage was less romantic than pragmatic in nature both were very involved in socialist and independence movements printing press of robotnik was in their apartment first in wilno then in lodz having a pretext of regular family life made them less subject to suspicion russian law also protected a wife from prosecution for illegal activities of her husband marriage deteriorated when several years later pilsudski began an affair with a younger socialist aleksandra maria died in 1921 and in october that year pilsudski married aleksandra by then couple had

took a conciliatory position toward russian empire and aimed at negotiating within it a limited autonomy for poland pilsudski s pps was only political force that was prepared to fight empire for polish independence and to resort to violence in order to achieve that goal on outbreak of russo japanese war 1904 1905 in summer of 1904 pilsudski traveled to tokyo japan where he tried unsuccessfully to obtain that country s assistance for an uprising in poland he offered to supply japan with intelligence in support of its war with russia and proposed creation of a polish legion from poles conscripted into russian army who had been captured by japan he also suggested a promethean project directed at breaking up russian empire a goal that he later continued to pursue meeting with yamagata aritomo he suggested that starting a guerrilla war in poland would distract russia and asked for japan to supply him with weapons although japanese diplomat hayashi supported plan japanese government including yamagata was more skeptical pilsudski s arch rival roman dmowski travelled to japan where he argued against pilsudski s plan endeavoring to discourage japanese government from supporting a polish revolution which dmowski felt would then be doomed to failure dmowski himself a polish patriot would remain pilsudski s political archenemy to end of pilsudski s life in end japanese offered pilsudski much less than he had hoped for he received japan s help in purchasing weapons and ammunition for pps and its combat organisation and japanese declined legion proposal in

months until it was broken by russian authorities in june 1905 pilsudski sent paramilitary aid to an uprising in lodz during june days as lodz uprising came to be known armed clashes broke out between pilsudski s paramilitaries and gunmen loyal to dmowski and his national democrats on 22 december 1905 pilsudski called for all polish workers to rise up call went largely unheeded unlike national democrats pilsudski instructed pps to boycott elections to first duma decision and his resolve to try to win polish independence through uprisings caused tensions within pps and in november 1906 party fractured over pilsudski s leadership his faction came to be called old faction or revolutionary faction or frakcja while their opponents were known as young faction moderate faction or left wing frakcja young sympathized with social democrats of kingdom of poland and lithuania and believed that priority should be given to co operation with russian revolutionaries in toppling tsarist regime and creating a socialist utopia that would facilitate negotiations for independence pilsudski and his supporters in revolutionary faction continued to plot a revolution against tsarist russia that would secure polish independence by 1909 his faction would again be majority in pps and pilsudski would remain one of most important pps leaders until outbreak of first world war pilsudski anticipated a coming european war and need to organize nucleus of a future polish army which could help win poland s independence from three empires that had partitioned it out of political existence in late 18th century in 1906 pilsudski with connivance of austrian authorities founded a military school in krakow for training of paramilitary units in 1906 alone 800 strong paramilitaries operating in five man teams in congress poland killed 336 russian officials in subsequent years number of their casualties declined and paramilitaries numbers increased to some 2 000 in 1908 paramilitaries also held up russian currency transports that were leaving polish territories on night of 26 27 september 1908 they robbed a russian mail train that was carrying tax revenues from warsaw to saint petersburg pilsudski who took part in this raid near vilnius used funds thus expropriated to finance his secret military organization take from that single raid 200 812 rubles was a fortune for time and equaled paramilitaries entire takes of two preceding years thumb right jozef pilsudski with supreme command of polish military organisation in 1917 in 1908 pilsudski transformed his paramilitary units into an association for active struggle zwiazek walki or headed by three of his associates wladyslaw sikorski marian kukiel and kazimierz sosnkowski one of main purposes was to train officers and noncommissioned officers for a future polish army in 1910 two legal paramilitary organizations were created in austrian zone of poland one in lwow now lviv ukraine and one in krakow to conduct training in military science with permission of austrian authorities pilsudski founded a series of sporting clubs then riflemen s association which served as cover to train a polish military force in 1912 pilsudski using nom de guerre mieczyslaw became commander in chief of a riflemen s association zwiazek strzelecki that grew by 1914 to 12 000 men in 1914 pilsudski declared only sword now carries any weight in balance for destiny of a nation world war i thumb right pilsudski in uniform at a meeting in paris in 1914 pilsudski presciently declared that in impending war for poland to regain independence russia must be beaten by central powers austro hungarian and german empires and latter powers must in their turn be beaten by france britain and united states by contrast roman dmowski pilsudski s rival believed that best way to achieve a unified and independent poland was to support triple entente against central powers thumb left upright pilsudski in world war i 1914 at outbreak of war on 3 august in krakow pilsudski formed a small cadre military unit first cadre company from members of riflemen s association and polish rifle squads that same day a cavalry unit under wladyslaw was sent to reconnoitre across russian border even before official declaration of war between austria hungary and russia which ensued on 6 august pilsudski s strategy was to send his forces north across border into russian poland into an area that russian army had evacuated in hope of breaking through to warsaw and sparking a national uprising using his limited forces in those early days he backed his orders with sanction of a fictitious national government in warsaw and he bent and stretched austrian orders to utmost taking initiatives moving forward and establishing polish institutions in liberated towns while austrians saw his forces as good only for scouting or for supporting main austrian formations on 12 august 1914 pilsudski s forces took town of kielce of kielce governorate but pilsudski found populace less supportive than he had expected soon afterward he officially established polish legions taking personal command of their first brigade which he would lead successfully into several victorious battles he also secretly informed british government in fall of 1914 that his legions would never fight france or britain only russia thumb left pilsudski and his officers 1915 pilsudski decreed that legions personnel were to be addressed by french revolution inspired citizen and he was referred to as commandant komendant pilsudski enjoyed extreme respect and loyalty from his men which would remain for years to come polish legions fought against russia at side of central powers until 1917 soon after forming legions also in 1914 pilsudski set up another organization polish military organisation polska organizacja wojskowa which served as a precursor polish intelligence agency and was designed to perform espionage and sabotage missions thumb pilsudski painting by jacek malczewski 1916 in mid 1916 after battle of 4 6 july 1916 in which polish legions delayed a russian offensive at a cost of over 2 000 casualties pilsudski demanded for central powers to issue a guarantee of independence for poland he backed that demand with his own proffered resignation and that of many of legions officers on 5 november 1916 central powers proclaimed independence of poland hoping to increase number of polish troops that could be sent to eastern front against russia thereby relieving german forces to bolster western front pilsudski agreed to serve in regency kingdom of poland created by central powers and acted as minister of war in newly formed polish regency government as such he was responsible for polnische wehrmacht after russian revolution in early 1917 and in view of worsening situation of central powers pilsudski took an increasingly uncompromising stance insisting that his men no longer be treated as german colonial troops and but be used to fight only russia anticipating central powers defeat in war he did not wish to be allied with losing side in aftermath of a july 1917 oath crisis when pilsudski forbade polish soldiers to swear a loyalty oath to central powers he was arrested and imprisoned at magdeburg polish units were disbanded and men were incorporated into austro hungarian army while polish military organization began attacking german targets pilsudski s arrest greatly enhanced his reputation among poles many of whom began to see him as most determined polish leader who was willing to take on all partitioning powers on 8 november 1918 three days before armistice pilsudski and his colleague colonel kazimierz sosnkowski were released by germans from magdeburg and soon like vladimir lenin before them placed on a private train bound for their national capital as collapsing germans hoped that pilsudski would create a force that was friendly to them rebuilding poland thumb right ulica 50 warsaw where pilsudski stayed 13 29 november 1918 after his release from magdeburg thumb pilsudski improvised armored car 1919 named after pilsudski on 11 november 1918 in warsaw pilsudski was appointed commander in chief of polish forces by regency council and was entrusted with creating a national government for newly independent country on that very day which would become poland s independence day he proclaimed an independent polish state that week too pilsudski also negotiated evacuation of german garrison from warsaw and of other german troops from ober ost authority over 55 000 germans would peacefully depart poland leaving their weapons to poles in coming months over 400 000 total would depart polish territories on 14 november 1918 pilsudski was asked to supervise provisionally running of country on 22 november he officially received from new government of jedrzej moraczewski title of provisional chief of state naczelnik panstwa of renascent poland various polish military organizations and provisional governments regency council in warsaw ignacy daszynski s government in lublin and polish liquidation committee in krakow bowed to pilsudski who set about forming a new coalition government it was predominantly socialist and introduced many reforms long proclaimed as necessary by polish socialist party such as eight hour day free school education and women s suffrage to avoid major unrest however pilsudski believed that as head of state he must be above partisan politics day after his arrival in warsaw he met with old colleagues from underground days who addressed him socialist style as comrade towarzysz and asked for his support for their revolutionary policies he refused it and answered comrades i took red tram of socialism to stop called independence and that s where i got off you may keep on to final stop if you wish but from now on let s address each other as mister rather than continue using socialist term of address comrade he declined to support any party and did not form any political organization of his own instead he advocated creating a coalition government he also set about organizing a polish army out of polish veterans of german russian and austrian armies in days immediately after war pilsudski attempted to build a government in a shattered country much of former russian poland had been destroyed in war and systematic looting by germans had reduced region s wealth by at least 10 a british diplomat who visited warsaw in january 1919 reported i have nowhere seen anything like evidences of extreme poverty and wretchedness that meet one s eye at almost every turn in addition country had to unify disparate systems of law economics and administration in former german austrian and russian sectors of poland there were nine legal systems five currencies and 66 types of rail systems with 165 models of locomotives which all had to be consolidated on an expedited basis thumb statue of pilsudski before warsaw s belweder palace pilsudski s official residence during his years in power waclaw jedrzejewicz in pilsudski a life for poland described pilsudski as very deliberate in his decision making pilsudski collected all available pertinent information then took his time weighing it before arriving at a final decision he drove himself hard working all day and all night he maintained a simple lifestyle eating plain meals alone at an inexpensive restaurant though he was popular with much of polish public his reputation as a loner result of many years underground work and as a man who distrusted almost everyone led to strained relations with other polish politicians pilsudski and first polish government were distrusted in west because he had co operated with central powers in 1914 to 1917 and because governments of daszynski and jedrzej moraczewski were primarily socialist it was not until january 1919 when world famous pianist and composer ignacy jan paderewski became prime minister of poland and foreign minister of a new government that it was recognized in west that still left two separate governments claiming to be poland s legitimate government pilsudski s in warsaw and dmowski s in paris to ensure that poland had a single government and to avert civil war paderewski met with dmowski and pilsudski and persuaded them to join forces with pilsudski acting as provisional chief of state and commander in chief while dmowski and paderewski represented poland at paris peace conference articles 87 93 of treaty of versailles and little treaty of versailles signed on 28 june 1919 formally established poland as an independent and sovereign state in international arena thumb pilsudski monument designed in 1936 pilsudski often clashed with dmowski for viewing poles as dominant nationality in renascent poland and attempting to send blue army to poland through danzig germany now gdansk poland on 5 january 1919 some of dmowski s supporters marian zegota and eustachy sapieha attempted a coup against pilsudski and prime minister moraczewski but they failed on 20 february 1919 pilsudski declared that he would return his powers to newly elected polish parliament sejm however sejm reinstated his office in little constitution of 1919 word provisional was struck from his title and pilsudski would hold office until 9 december 1922 when gabriel narutowicz was elected as first president of poland pilsudski s major foreign policy initiative was then a proposed federation to be called miedzymorze polish for between seas and also known from latin as intermarium stretching from baltic sea to black sea it was to consist of poland independent baltic states belarus and ukraine somewhat in emulation of pre partition polish lithuanian commonwealth pilsudski s plan met with opposition from most of prospective member states which refused to relinquish any of their hard won independence as well as from allied powers who thought it to be too bold a change to existing balance of power structure according to historian george sanford it was around 1920 that pilsudski came to realize of that version of his intermarium project instead of a central and eastern european alliance there soon appeared a series of border conflicts including polish ukrainian war 1918 19 polish lithuanian war 1920 culminating in zeligowski s mutiny polish czechoslovak border conflicts beginning in 1918 and most notably polish soviet war 1919 21 winston churchill commented war of giants has ended wars of pygmies begun polish soviet war thumb left upright pilsudski around 1919 thumb right pilsudski in poznan in aftermath of world war i there was unrest on all polish borders regarding poland s future frontiers pilsudski said all that we can gain in west depends on entente on extent to which it may wish to squeeze germany in east there are doors that open and close and it depends on who forces them open and how far in 1918 in east polish forces clashed with ukrainian forces in polish ukrainian war and pilsudski s first orders as commander in chief of polish army on 12 november 1918 were to provide support for polish struggle in lviv pilsudski was aware that bolsheviks were no friends of independent poland and that war with them was inevitable he viewed their advance west as a major problem but he also considered bolsheviks less dangerous for poland than their white opponents white russians representatives of old russian empire were willing to accept only limited independence for poland probably within borders similar to those of former congress poland and they clearly objected to polish control of ukraine which was crucial for pilsudski s intermarium project that was in contrast to bolsheviks who proclaimed partitions of poland null and void pilsudski thus speculated that poland would be better off with bolsheviks alienated from western powers than with a restored russian empire by ignoring strong pressures from entente cordiale to join attack on lenin s struggling bolshevik government pilsudski probably saved it in summer and fall of 1919 thumb left upright in march 1920 pilsudski was made first marshal of poland in wake of russian westward offensive of 1918 1919 and of a series of escalating battles that resulted in poles advancing eastward on 21 april 1920 marshal pilsudski as his rank had been since march 1920 signed a military alliance treaty of warsaw with ukrainian leader symon petliura to conduct joint operations against soviet russia goal of polish ukrainian treaty was to establish an independent ukraine and independent poland in alliance resembling that once existing within polish lithuanian commonwealth in return petliura gave up ukrainian claims to western lands of galicia being a historical part of crown of poland for which he was denounced by ukrainian nationalist leaders polish and ukrainian armies under pilsudski s command launched a successful offensive against russian forces in ukraine on 7 may 1920 with remarkably little fighting they captured kiev thumb right pilsudski left and edward rydz smigly right 1920 during polish soviet war bolshevik leadership framed polish actions as an invasion in response thousands of officers and deserters joined red army and thousands of civilians volunteered for war work soviets launched a counter offensive from belarus and counterattacked in ukraine advancing into poland in a drive toward germany to encourage communist party of germany in its struggle to take power soviet confidence soared soviets announced their plans to invade western europe soviet communist theoretician nikolai bukharin writing in pravda hoped for resources to carry campaign beyond warsaw straight to london and paris soviet commander mikhail tukhachevsky s order of day for 2 july 1920 read to west over corpse of white poland lies road to worldwide conflagration march upon vilnius minsk warsaw and onward to berlin over corpse of poland on 1 july 1920 in view of rapidly advancing soviet offensive poland s parliament sejm formed a council for defense of nation chaired by pilsudski to provide expeditious decision making as a temporary supplanting of fractious sejm national democrats however contended that string of bolshevik victories had been pilsudski s fault and demanded that for him to resign some even accused him of treason their 19 july failure to carry a vote of no confidence in council led to dmowski s withdrawal from it on 12 august pilsudski tendered his resignation to prime minister wincenty witos offering to be scapegoat if military solution failed but witos refused to accept his resignation entente pressured poland to surrender and enter into negotiations with bolsheviks pilsudski however was a staunch advocate of continuing fight as norman davies noted at that time especially abroad pilsudski had nothing of his later prestige as a pre war revolutionary he led his party to splits and quarrels as a general in world war i he led his legions to internment and disbanding as a marshal of polish army he led it to kiev and vilnius both now lost to poles he left polish socialist party and his austro german allies refused to ally himself with entente in france and england he was considered a treasonous ally who leads poland into destruction in russia he was seen as a false servant of allies who will lead imperialism to ruin all from lenin to lloyd george from pravda to morning star considered him a military and political failure in august 1920 all were in agreement that his catastrophic career will be crowned with fall of warsaw thumb left pilsudski with his favorite horse chestnut kasztanka however over next few weeks poland s risky unconventional strategy at august 1920 battle of warsaw halted soviet advance polish plan was developed by pilsudski and others including tadeusz rozwadowski later some supporters of pilsudski would seek to portray him as sole author of polish strategy but opponents would seek to minimize his role in west for a long time a myth persisted that it was general maxime weygand of french military mission to poland who had saved poland modern scholars however are in agreement that weygand s role was minimal at best pilsudski s plan called for polish forces to withdraw across vistula river and to defend bridgeheads at warsaw and on wieprz river while some 25 of available divisions concentrated to south for a strategic counteroffensive plan next required two armies under general jozef haller facing soviet frontal attack on warsaw from east to hold their entrenched positions at all costs at same time an army under general wladyslaw sikorski was to strike north from outside warsaw cutting off soviet forces that sought to envelope polish capital from that direction most important role however was assigned to a relatively small approximately 20 000 man newly assembled reserve army also known as strike group grupa comprising most determined battle hardened polish units that were commanded personally by pilsudski their task was to spearhead a lightning northward offensive from vistula wieprz triangle south of warsaw through a weak spot that had been identified by polish intelligence between soviet western and southwestern fronts that offensive would separate soviet western front from its reserves and its movements eventually gap between sikorski s army and strike group would close near east prussian border bringing about destruction of encircled soviet forces at time pilsudski s plan was strongly criticized and only desperate situation of polish forces persuaded other commanders to go along with it though based on reliable intelligence including decrypted soviet radio communications plan was termed amateurish by high ranking army officers and military experts who were quick to point out pilsudski s lack of formal military education when a copy of plan fell into soviet hands western front commander mikhail tukhachevsky thought it to be a ruse and disregarded it days later soviets paid dearly for that when during battle of warsaw overconfident red army suffered one of its greatest defeats ever a national democrat sejm deputy stanislaw stronski coined phrase miracle at vistula cud nad wisla to express his disapproval of pilsudski s ukrainian adventure stronski s phrase was adopted as praise for pilsudski by some patriotically or piously minded poles who were unaware of stronski s ironic intent a junior member of french military mission charles de gaulle would later adopt some lessons from polish soviet war as well as from pilsudski s career in february 1921 pilsudski visited paris where in negotiations with french president alexandre he laid foundations for franco polish military alliance which would be signed later that year treaty of riga which ended polish soviet war in march 1921 partitioned belarus and ukraine between poland and russia pilsudski called treaty an act of cowardice treaty and his secret approval of general lucjan zeligowski s capture of vilnius from lithuanians marked an end to this incarnation of pilsudski s federalist intermarium plan on 25 september 1921 when pilsudski visited lwow now lviv for opening of first eastern trade fair he was target of an unsuccessful assassination attempt by stepan acting on behalf of ukrainian independence

announced his retirement from active politics two days later on 16 december 1922 narutowicz was shot dead by a right wing painter and art critic who had originally wanted to kill pilsudski but had changed his target influenced by national democrat anti narutowicz propaganda for pilsudski that was a major shock which shook his belief that poland could function as a democracy and made him support government by a strong hand he became chief of general staff and together with minister of military affairs wladyslaw sikorski managed to stabilize situation quelling unrest with a brief state of emergency stanislaw wojciechowski of polish people s party piast psl piast another of pilsudski s old colleagues was elected new president and wincenty witos also of psl piast became prime minister however new government pursuant to lanckorona pact an alliance among centrist psl piast and right wing popular national union and christian democrat parties contained right wing enemies of pilsudski people whom he held morally responsible for narutowicz s death and with whom he found it impossible to work on 30 may 1923 pilsudski resigned as chief of general staff thumb right pilsudski in front

fueled public unrest and government was unable to find a quick solution to mounting unemployment and economic crisis pilsudski s allies and supporters repeatedly asked him to return to politics and he began to create a new power base centred on former members of polish legions and polish military organization as well as some left wing and intelligentsia parties in 1925 after several governments had resigned in short order and political scene was becoming increasingly chaotic pilsudski became more and more critical of government and eventually issued statements demanding resignation of witos cabinet when piast coalition which pilsudski had strongly criticized formed a new government on 12 14 may 1926 pilsudski returned to power in a coup d etat may coup supported by polish socialist party liberation peasant party and even polish communist party pilsudski had hoped for a bloodless coup but government had refused to back down 215 soldiers and 164 civilians had been killed and over 900 persons had been wounded in government on 31 may sejm elected pilsudski president of republic pilsudski however aware of presidency s limited powers refused office another of his old friends ignacy moscicki was elected in his stead moscicki then appointed pilsudski as minister of military affairs defence minister a post that he would hold for rest of his life in 11 successive governments two of which he headed himself from 1926 to 1928 and for a brief period in 1930 he also served as general inspector of armed forces and chairman of war council pilsudski had no plans for major reforms he quickly distanced himself from most radical of his left wing supporters and declared that his coup was to be a revolution without revolutionary consequences his goals were to stabilize country reduce influence of political parties which he blamed for corruption and inefficiency and strengthen army his role in polish government over subsequent years has been called a dictatorship or a quasi dictatorship internal politics thumb right belweder palace warsaw pilsudski s official residence during his years in power in internal politics pilsudski s coup entailed sweeping limitations on parliamentary government as his sanation regime 1926 1939 at times employing authoritarian methods sought to restore public life to moral health from 1928 sanation authorities were represented in sphere of practical politics by non partisan bloc for cooperation with government bbwr popular support and an effective propaganda apparatus allowed pilsudski to maintain his authoritarian powers which could not be overruled either by president who was appointed by pilsudski or by sejm powers of sejm were curtailed by constitutional amendments that were introduced soon after coup on 2 august 1926 from 1926 to 1930 pilsudski relied chiefly on propaganda to weaken influence of opposition leaders culmination of his dictatorial and policies came in 1930s with imprisonment and trial of certain political opponents brest trials on eve of 1930 legislative elections and with 1934 establishment of a prison for political prisoners at bereza kartuska today where some prisoners were brutally mistreated after 1930 victory pilsudski left most internal matters in hands of his colonels while he concentrated on military and foreign affairs he came under considerable criticism for his treatment of political opponents and their 1930 arrest and imprisonment was internationally condemned and damaged poland s reputation thumb left marshal and his second wife aleksandra pilsudska in later life pilsudski became increasingly disillusioned with democracy in poland his intemperate public utterances he called sejm a prostitute and his sending of 90 armed officers into sejm building in response to an impending vote of no confidence caused concern in contemporary and modern observers who have seen his actions as setting precedents for authoritarian responses to political challenges one of his main goals was to transform parliamentary system into a presidential system however he opposed introduction of totalitarianism adoption of a new polish constitution in april 1935 that was tailored by pilsudski s supporters to his specifications providing for a strong presidency came too late for pilsudski to seek that office but april constitution would serve poland up to outbreak of world war ii and would carry its government in exile until end of war and beyond nonetheless pilsudski s government depended more on his charismatic authority than on rational legal authority none of his followers could claim to be his legitimate heir and after his death sanation structure would quickly fracture returning poland to pre pilsudski era of parliamentary political contention thumb in 1933 pilsudski paid homage at tomb of john iii sobieski in commemoration of 250th anniversary of battle of vienna pilsudski s regime began a period of national stabilization and of improvement in situation of ethnic minorities which formed about a third of second republic s population pilsudski replaced national democrats ethnic assimilation with a state assimilation policy citizens were judged not by their ethnicity but by their loyalty to state widely recognized for his opposition to national democrats anti semitic policies he extended his policy of state assimilation to polish jews years 1926 to 1935 and pilsudski himself were favorably viewed by many polish jews whose situation improved especially under pilsudski appointed prime minister kazimierz bartel many jews saw pilsudski as their only hope for restraining antisemitic currents in poland and for maintaining public order he was seen as a guarantor of stability and a friend of jewish people who voted for him and actively participated in his political bloc pilsudski s death in 1935 brought a deterioration in quality of life of poland s jews during 1930s a combination of developments from great depression to vicious spiral of oun terrorist attacks and government caused government relations with national minorities to deteriorate unrest among national minorities was also related to foreign policy troubles followed repressions in largely ukrainian eastern galicia where nearly 1 800 persons were arrested tension also arose between government and poland s german minority particularly in upper silesia government did not yield to calls for antisemitic measures but jews 8 6 of poland s population grew discontented for economic reasons that were connected with depression overall by end of pilsudski s life his government s relations with national minorities were increasingly problematic in military sphere pilsudski who had shown himself an accomplished military strategist in engineering miracle at vistula has been criticized by some for subsequently concentrating on personnel management and allegedly neglecting modernization of military strategy and equipment his experiences in polish soviet war 1919 1921 may have led him to overestimate importance of cavalry and to neglect development of armoured and air forces others however contend that particularly from late 1920s he had supported development of these military branches limitations on poland s military modernization in this period may have been less doctrinal than financial foreign policy thumb upright marshal pilsudski painted by wojciech kossak 1928 under pilsudski poland maintained good relations with neighboring romania hungary and latvia relations were strained with czechoslovakia however and even worse with lithuania relations with weimar germany and soviet union varied over time but during pilsudski s tenure could for most part be described as neutral pilsudski s promethean programme to weaken russian empire and its successor state soviet union by supporting nationalist independence movements of major non russian peoples dwelling in russia and soviet union was co ordinated from 1927 to 1939 outbreak of world war ii in europe by military intelligence officer edmund in interbellum but it yielded few tangible results thumb left 270px german ambassador hans adolf von moltke pilsudski joseph goebbels and jozef beck polish foreign minister in warsaw on 15 june 1934 five months after german polish non aggression pact pilsudski sought to maintain his country s independence in international arena assisted by his protege foreign minister jozef beck he sought support for poland in alliances with western powers such as france and united kingdom and with friendly if less powerful neighbours such as romania and hungary a supporter of franco polish military alliance and polish romanian alliance part of little entente pilsudski was disappointed by french and british policy of appeasement evident in their signing of locarno treaties pilsudski therefore aimed also to maintain good relations with soviet union and germany and so poland signed non aggression pacts with both of its powerful neighbours 1932 soviet polish non aggression pact and 1934 german polish non aggression pact both were meant to strengthen poland s position in eyes of its allies and neighbours pilsudski himself was acutely aware of shakiness of pacts and he commented having these pacts we are straddling two stools this cannot last long we have to know from which stool we will tumble first and when that will be critics of two non aggression pacts have accused pilsudski of underestimating hitler s aggressiveness of giving germany time to rearm and of allowing stalin to eliminate opposition primarily in ukraine which had been supported by pilsudski s promethean program after adolf hitler came to power in germany in january 1933 pilsudski is rumored to have proposed to france a preventive war against germany it has been argued that pilsudski may have been sounding out france regarding possible joint military action against germany lack of french interest may have been a reason for poland signing non aggression pact of january 1934 little evidence has however been found in french or polish diplomatic archives that such a proposal for preventive war was ever actually advanced hitler repeatedly suggested a german polish alliance against soviet union but pilsudski declined instead seeking precious time to prepare for potential war with either germany or soviet union just before his death pilsudski told jozef beck that it must be poland s policy to maintain neutral relations with germany keep up polish alliance with france and improve relations with united kingdom religious views pilsudski s religious views are a matter of debate he was baptised on 15 december 1867 in church of then deanery by priest thomas his godparents were joseph and constance adam do biografii z lat 1867 1892 niepodleglosc t

pilsudski notable appreciation for pilsudski was expressed by poland s ethnic and religious minorities eastern orthodox greek orthodox protestant judaic and islamic organizations expressed condolences

poland second man in state after president while many saw rydz smigly as a successor to pilsudski he never became as influential as polish government became increasingly authoritarian and conservative

statuary tributes throughout poland pilsudski had given poland something akin to what henryk sienkiewicz s had mused about a polish oliver cromwell as such marshal had inevitably drawn both intense loyalty and intense vilification in 1935 at pilsudski s funeral president moscicki eulogized marshal he was king of our hearts and sovereign of our will during a half century of his life s travails he

pilsudski s thought influenced policies of polish people s republic a de facto satellite of soviet union in particular poland was in no position to resume pilsudski s effort to build an intermarium federation of poland and some of its neighbors and a promethean endeavor to break up russian state into its main constituents and emancipate countries that have been forcibly incorporated into that empire quoted in for a decade after world war ii pilsudski was either ignored or condemned by poland s communist government along with entire interwar second polish republic this began to change however particularly after de stalinization and polish october 1956 and historiography in poland gradually moved away from a purely negative view of pilsudski toward a more balanced and neutral assessment after fall of communism and 1991 disintegration of soviet union pilsudski once again came to be publicly acknowledged as a polish national hero on sixtieth anniversary of his death on 12 may 1995 poland s sejm adopted a resolution jozef pilsudski will remain in our nation s memory founder of its independence and victorious leader who fended off a foreign assault that threatened whole
