rala experiment or rala was a series of tests during and after manhattan project designed to study behavior of converging shock waves to achieve spherical implosion necessary for compression of plutonium pit of nuclear weapon experiment used significant amounts of a short lived radioisotope lanthanum 140 a potent source of gamma radiation rala is a contraction of radioactive lanthanum method was proposed by robert serber and developed by a team led by italian experimental physicist bruno rossi tests were performed with 1 8 inch 3 2 mm spheres of radioactive lanthanum equal to about and later located in center of a simulated nuclear device explosive lenses were designed primarily using this series of tests some 254 tests were conducted between september 1944 and march 1962 in his history of los alamos project david hawkins wrote rala became most important single experiment affecting final bomb design experimental setup thumb 300px experimental setup for rala shot 78 on may 13 1947 at bayo canyon each rectangular box contains eight cylindrical fast ionization chambers alt a sphere in a in ground above which is wooden scaffolding and two large boxes in background are trees experiment was suggested on 1 november 1943 by robert serber idea was to measure spatial and temporal symmetry of explosive compression of a metal sphere test measured changes of absorption of gamma rays in metal of sphere as it underwent compression gamma ray source was located in center of a metal sphere increase of thickness of hollow shells and density of solid spheres as compression progressed was detected as a decrease of intensity of gamma rays outside of sphere lower density explosives did not absorb gamma radiation enough to interfere with experiment gamma rays had to be intense and of right energy too low energy and they would be fully absorbed in surrounding metal too high energy and difference of attenuation during implosion would be too low to be practical detectors had to provide high speed and large area fast ionization chambers then under development were only devices then available satisfying requirements lanthanum 140 was chosen because it emits gamma rays in desired energy range 1 60 megaelectronvolts mev with fraction of 0 49 mev and has very high specific activity thus providing sufficient radiation intensity to produce usable signals from ionization chambers after a test dispersed la 140 rapidly decays into stable cerium 140 reducing radiation hazard for operators after several half lives it was also potentially available in larger quantities because its parent nuclide barium 140 is an abundant fission product of uranium as a consequence lanthanum 140 samples contained traces of barium 140 caesium 140 and especially strontium 90 which still presents a radioactive contamination problem in area of tests lanthanum 140 has a specific activity of 5 ci g 20 6 g a la 140 source therefore equals about 1 8 mg of lanthanum a radiolanthanum sample precipitated in a tip of a small cone followed by a plug was lowered into center of metal sphere of experimental assembly with a device resembling a fishing rod cone and plug were mated to metal center of assembly together forming a metal sphere a section of explosive lensing was then returned to its place above sphere several typically four ionization chambers were located around experimental setup immediately after detonation they generated signals that were displayed on in a blast proof shelter or a mobile laboratory in a tank away and oscilloscope traces recorded on cameras a calibration measurement was performed before and after each test ionization chambers and their preamplifiers were destroyed during explosion but their simple design allowed their production in sufficient quantities ionization chambers were cylindrical in diameter long with a wire along longitudinal axis they were filled with a mixture of argon and carbon dioxide at eight chambers were arranged in a tray and connected in parallel four trays were located in a tetrahedron around experimental assembly recording gamma radiation around sphere sufficiently close to give a signal and sufficiently far away to not be destroyed by blast before they could record required information initiation of explosives was initially performed by a multipoint primacord system results were erratic as detonations weren t sufficiently synchronized much better results were obtained after february 1945 when exploding bridgewire detonators developed by luis alvarez s g 7 group became available as plutonium was not available it was substituted with material with similar mechanical properties depleted uranium was used but was not optimal because of its opacity for radiation iron copper or cadmium were other choices cadmium was choice for most of tests first shot was performed with an iron mockup of plutonium pit resulting signal was a fast dip corresponding to compression of cadmium sphere followed by slower increase corresponding to decompression and following dispersal of sphere and lanthanum differences between four traces on oscilloscope display each indicating average compression in direction of detector allowed assessment of required synchronization accuracy for detonators rala sources were highly radioactive they had to be lowered to test apparatus by a long rod tests were initially observed from a sealed m4 sherman tank mobile laboratory consisted of two tanks each experiment was expected to contaminate an area of about for about half a year when radiobarium was removed from radiolanthanum short term contamination levels turned out to be insignificant tanks were then replaced with fixed shelters one of tanks was later lead plated sealed equipped with self contained air supply and used for sampling of fission products in post blast debris after trinity test sources posed a considerable radiation exposure risk exposure rate of a source at was 1 130 r h and 11 000 r h at sources with activities up to were used in some tests radiation safety system for remote handling of samples had flaws it took about six months to discover them all chemists who operated on mixtures of fission products with batches reaching up to each were frequently exposed accidentally to undesirably high doses of radiation group handling experiments themselves was less at risk they operated in close coordination with health group who was in charge of ensuring that radiation exposure of people involved was survivable radioactive contamination posed a problem people working in bayo canyon had to change their clothes and take showers after work sometimes they would still trip detectors at security gates thumb 300px left remote handling of a 1 8 mg

small trolley on a wooden platform on top of trolley is a large cylindrical object experiments were performed in bayo canyon in a location designated ta 10 technical area 10 but more commonly referred to as bayo canyon site in los alamos county and close to border with santa fe county northeast from los alamos townsite site had several fixed structures lanthanum 140 was isolated in a radiochemistry building ta 10 1 there were four firing sites instruments for firing explosives and recording data were housed in two detonation control buildings ta 10 13 and ta 10 15 large amounts of radioactive lanthanum were dispersed by outdoor explosions 254 tests were performed between 1944 and 1961 in 1948 two workers received radiation burns there experiments were generally performed when wind blew to north but occasionally wind would change direction in early morning in 1949 and 1950 nuclear fallout from tests was blown over parts of housing area and a road radiation levels on road occasionally reached 5 10 mr h and road had to be closed for a while each test released a plume of dispersed radioactive lanthanum three tests in 1950 are documented where released radioactivity was tracked by a b 17 aircraft in one case radiation was detected over a town downwind these tests were concurrent with rala tests and their aim was development of airborne detectors for tracking air burst nuclear tests size and altitude of radioactive cloud was determined by quantity of explosive used for first 125 tests between 1944 and 1949 meteorology and fallout monitoring were rare but between 1950 1954 closer monitoring was phased in and was comprehensive afterwards one cloud was reportedly tracked as far as downwind over watrous new mexico logistics and schedule to handle logistics of tests luis alvarez was appointed by robert oppenheimer director of los alamos laboratory as head of rala program his group was designated e 7 rala and electric detonators group bruno rossi and swiss physicist hans staub built ionization chambers and electronics by late spring at first work proceeded at a leisurely pace as implosion was only a backup project it was believed that plutonium bomb would be of thin man gun type fission weapon design this turned out not to be case as first tests on reactor produced plutonium in early summer 1944 showed unacceptably high spontaneous fission rates due to presence of plutonium 240 precluding use of gun assembly on 17 july thin man design was abandoned and all effort was focused on implosion to meet challenge los alamos laboratory was reorganized x division explosive division and g division gadget division or weapon physics division were formed rossi s group was assigned to g division as g 6 or rala group alvarez s group was g 7 or electric detonator group on 25 july 1944 first preliminary test was fired in bayo canyon as a rehearsal test of equipment and measurement of collapse times and detonation and shock wave velocities program was delayed by about a month by late radiobarium shipments as test scheduled for 15 august was not conducted until mid september first test with radiobarium was fired on 22 september in late august and at request of rossi s group rala group was reformed under leadership of rossi and alvarez and his group took over exploding bridgewire detonator research at suggestion of robert christy solid spheres instead of originally intended hollow ones were chosen for pit in order to reduce problems with jets and spalling first solid sphere rala shot was performed in early december but results were inconclusive shot from 14 december though showed in words of robert bacher definite evidence of compression first tests using electric detonators and solid pits were performed on 7 and 14 february 1945 until then primacord based initiation was employed electric detonators showed a significant improvement in achieved compression degree and symmetry and were used on all rala tests thereafter based on these results by end of february design of gadget as bomb was euphemistically known was settled other test methods were also necessary as rala experiments provided only indirect indications about formation of problematic jets that plagued early implosion designs but rala was most important radiolanthanum preparation barium lanthanum preparation half life of la 140 is 40 224 hours it undergoes beta decay to stable cerium 140 it was prepared from barium 140 a common fission product isolated from spent fuel from oak ridge national laboratory x 10 graphite reactor and later after 1948 also from hanford site plutonium 239 producing nuclear reactors barium was isolated in a purpose built hot laboratory in oak ridge and shipped in a lead pig to los alamos where it was used to extract lanthanum oak ridge laboratory was first laboratory where remote manipulators were used for work with radioactive materials delivery was performed by a truck with a two person crew driving nonstop at oak ridge uranium slugs were irradiated for 40 days then left to cool down for 1 to 5 days then dissolved barium then was extracted and solution evaporated solid material was then shipped to los alamos as of 1949 full production runs involved up to 1728 slugs 34 5 batches of 50 slugs until 1949 oak ridge production site processed uranium slugs irradiated both on site and at hanford afterward only hanford material was processed at first barium isolation was performed in building 3026 c 706 c where an existing laboratory was converted for this purpose in 5 months first run was finished in september 1944 3026 c was designed for work with sources between but conditions forced it to be adapted to work with sources its capacity was insufficient as demand grew in may 1945 a dedicated building 3026 d 706 d adjacent to 3026 c and designed to process sources up to 1000 ci was completed first run in 3026 d was on 26 may 1945 same day as last run in 3026 c facility by march 1949 31 shipments averaging over 2000 ci each were produced there for los alamos demand continued to grow though by july 1950 production goal per shipment was and by early 1950s requirements went up to by 1954 shipments went up to and that year aec decided to build a new facility in idaho national laboratory for rala production in october 1956 oak ridge completed their 68th and last rala run in total oak ridge processed over 30 000 uranium slugs and shipped over to los alamos during preparation of rala volatile fission products were released when dissolved a batch of 50 slugs produced of xenon 133 of iodine 131 high amounts as fuel had to be processed fresh and a small amount of krypton 85 as few precautions were used for limiting fission product releases rala production was a major contributor to radioactive contamination at oak ridge iodine emissions were an important factor in decision to move facility to idaho later improvements allowed a reduction of iodine emissions to levels about 100 times lower a serious accident with radioactivity release occurred in 3026 d facility at about 5 pm on 29 april 1954 after dissolution of third batch of uranium slugs liquid in tank did not completely cover slugs for about 29 hours which overheated due to decay heat when acid was added for fourth batch violent reaction with hot metal produced gases and forced solution up slug loading chute and pipes building staff donned their gas masks and evacuated building radiation levels on third floor of building reached 100 roentgen per hour r h and were reduced to 100 mr h by 7 am next day highest exposure to a person was 1 25 r of hard radiation and 4 7 roentgen equivalent physical of soft radiation lanthanum preparation after delivery of barium lanthanum material to los alamos it was stored in a dedicated building in bayo canyon site at first mixture was used as is both barium and lanthanum together but this led to unpleasant radioactive contamination that took a long time to disappear as half life of barium 140 is 12 5 days shortly after process was improved barium was removed chemically by double precipitation from a solution as barium sulfate process was improved again to allow repeated separation of lanthanum from barium solution as lanthanum built up initially a phosphate process was used where lanthanum was precipitated as lanthanum phosphate this was later abandoned when an oxalate or hydroxide method was developed lanthanum was precipitated as lanthanum hydroxide and then converted to a filterable precipitate by addition of oxalate with a trace of fluoride oxalate method had to be performed quickly as oxalate ion was susceptible to radiolysis and lanthanum had tendency to go back into solution oxalate process could be performed by remotely operated devices batches contained about of radiolanthanum highest radiation levels people had ever worked with at that time special tools had to be developed for remote handling of hot materials lead bricks were used for shielding sources radiation dose limit for personnel was set to 500 mrem 5 msv per source preparation sometimes this limit was exceeded once received dose was 2 rem 20 msv improved process that separated lanthanum from barium chloride solution had advantage that barium could be milked repeatedly increasing radiolanthanum yield and allowing more experiments problems of radioactive contamination with barium 140 with its half life of 12 5 days were eliminated amount of contaminating strontium 90 was also significantly reduced use of purified lanthanum also allowed usage of a much smaller amount of material in tests themselves semiautomatic equipment for lanthanum milking barium 140 isotope was nicknamed a cow was built in a sufficiently distant area which avoided time consuming construction of a heavily shielded building early on process hit a snag when impurities of iron and other metals probably introduced from an irradiated shipping container were found to impair lanthanum phosphate precipitation by forming phosphate gels that clogged filters this problem was solved with better shipping containers a similar milking process is now used for preparation of technetium 99m used in nuclear medicine from a molybdenum 99 cow in technetium 99m generators separation process was performed in a dedicated facility in bayo canyon in radiochemistry building designated ta 10 1 separated lanthanum was then shipped to test site in a lead cask on back of a truck in 1951 separation work was moved to ta 35 tests were performed in a month long series as barium source decayed and was periodically milked for lanthanum post war progress technology was improved and by 1951 four ionization chambers were replaced by twenty scintillation counters each using five gallons of a liquid scintillator flashes from of burning scintillator were remarkably brilliant in early morning times when tests were usually performed rala tests continued until 1962 after which they were replaced by more advanced methods currently several other methods are used for hydrodynamic testing long term contamination lanthanum 140 has a short half life of some 41 hours and is not a threat after a fairly short time other radioisotopes present as impurities have a long enough half life to present a potential problem even decades after tests in 2002 los alamos national laboratory issued a warning to los alamos county and forest service performing thinning of trees in area to not remove trees cut in various parts of bayo canyon due to possible content of residual radioactive materials worst affected zones are fenced off detectable levels of radioisotopes are present in soil insects and trees in surrounding areas neighboring population was not informed about tests until
