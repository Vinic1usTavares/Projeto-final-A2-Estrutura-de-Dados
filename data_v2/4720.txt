frame right dna damage resulting in multiple broken chromosomes dna repair is a collection of processes by which a cell identifies and corrects damage to dna molecules that encode its genome in human cells both normal metabolic activities and environmental factors such as radiation can cause dna damage resulting in as many as 1 million individual molecular lesions per cell per day many of these lesions cause structural damage to dna molecule and can alter or eliminate cell s ability to transcribe gene that affected dna encodes other lesions induce potentially harmful mutations in cell s genome which affect survival of its daughter cells after it undergoes mitosis as a consequence dna repair process is constantly active as it responds to damage in dna structure when normal repair processes fail and when cellular apoptosis does not occur irreparable dna damage may occur including double strand breaks and dna crosslinks or this can eventually lead to malignant tumors or cancer as per two hit hypothesis rate of dna repair is dependent on many factors including cell type age of cell and extracellular environment a cell that has accumulated a large amount of dna damage or one that no longer effectively repairs damage incurred to its dna can enter one of three possible states an irreversible state of dormancy known as senescence cell suicide also known as apoptosis or programmed cell death unregulated cell division which can lead to formation of a tumor that is cancerous dna repair ability of a cell is vital to integrity of its genome and thus to normal functionality of that organism many genes that were initially shown to influence life span have turned out to be involved in dna damage repair and protection thumbtime 1 thumb paul modrich talks about himself and his work in dna repair 2015 nobel prize in chemistry was awarded to tomas paul modrich and aziz for their work on molecular mechanisms of dna repair processes dna damage dna damage due to environmental factors and normal metabolic processes inside cell occurs at a rate of 10 000 to 1 000 000 molecular lesions per cell per day while this constitutes only 0 of human genome s approximately 6 billion bases 3 billion base pairs unrepaired lesions in critical genes such as tumor suppressor genes can impede a cell s ability to carry out its function and appreciably increase likelihood of tumor formation and contribute to tumour heterogeneity vast majority of dna damage affects primary structure of double helix that is bases themselves are chemically modified these modifications can in turn disrupt molecules regular helical structure by introducing non native chemical bonds or bulky adducts that do not fit in standard double helix unlike proteins and rna dna usually lacks tertiary structure and therefore damage or disturbance does not occur at that level dna is however and wound around packaging proteins called histones in eukaryotes and both superstructures are vulnerable to effects of dna damage sources dna damage can be subdivided into two main types endogenous damage such as attack by reactive oxygen species produced from normal metabolic byproducts spontaneous mutation especially process of oxidative deamination also includes replication errors exogenous damage caused by external agents such as ultraviolet uv 200 400 nm radiation from sun other radiation frequencies including x rays and gamma rays hydrolysis or thermal disruption certain plant toxins human made mutagenic chemicals especially aromatic compounds that act as dna intercalating agents viruses replication of damaged dna before cell division can lead to incorporation of wrong bases opposite damaged ones daughter cells that inherit these wrong bases carry mutations from which original dna sequence is unrecoverable except in rare case of a back mutation for example through gene conversion types there are several types of damage to dna due to endogenous cellular processes oxidation of bases e g 8 oxo 7 8 8 and generation of dna strand interruptions from reactive oxygen species alkylation of bases usually methylation such as formation of 7 1 6 o methylguanine hydrolysis of bases such as deamination depurination and bulky adduct formation e g a diol epoxide dg adduct i da adduct mismatch of bases due to errors in dna replication in which wrong dna base is stitched into place in a newly forming dna strand or a dna base is skipped over or mistakenly inserted damage cause by change in single nitrogenous base of dna damage damage caused by exogenous agents comes in many forms some examples are uv b light causes crosslinking between adjacent cytosine and thymine bases creating pyrimidine dimers this is called direct dna damage uv a light creates mostly free radicals damage caused by free radicals is called indirect dna damage ionizing radiation such as that created by radioactive decay or in cosmic rays causes breaks in dna strands intermediate level ionizing radiation may induce irreparable dna damage leading to and transcriptional errors needed for or may trigger viral interactions leading to pre mature aging and cancer thermal disruption at elevated temperature increases rate of depurination loss of purine bases from dna backbone and single strand breaks for example hydrolytic depurination is seen in thermophilic bacteria which grow in hot springs at 40 80 degc rate of depurination 300 purine residues per genome per generation is too high in these species to be repaired by normal repair machinery hence a possibility of an adaptive response cannot be ruled out industrial chemicals such as vinyl chloride and hydrogen peroxide and environmental chemicals such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons found in smoke soot and tar create a huge diversity of dna adducts oxidized bases alkylated and crosslinking of dna just to name a few uv damage alkylation methylation x ray damage and oxidative damage are examples of induced damage spontaneous damage can include loss of a base deamination sugar ring and shift constitutive spontaneous dna damage caused by endogenous oxidants can be detected as a low level of histone h2ax phosphorylation in untreated cells tanaka t halicka hd huang x traganos f darzynkiewicz z 2006 constitutive histone h2ax phosphorylation and atm activation reporters of dna damage by endogenous oxidants cell cycle 5 1940 5 nuclear versus mitochondrial in human cells and eukaryotic cells in general dna is found in two cellular locations inside nucleus and inside mitochondria nuclear dna ndna exists as chromatin during non replicative stages of cell cycle and is condensed into aggregate structures known as chromosomes during cell division in either state dna is highly compacted and wound up around bead like proteins called histones whenever a cell needs to express genetic information encoded in its ndna required chromosomal region is unravelled genes located therein are expressed and then region is condensed back to its resting conformation mitochondrial dna mtdna is located inside mitochondria organelles exists in multiple copies and is also tightly associated with a number of proteins to form a complex known as inside mitochondria reactive oxygen species ros or free radicals byproducts of constant production of adenosine triphosphate atp via oxidative phosphorylation create a highly oxidative environment that is known to damage mtdna a critical enzyme in counteracting toxicity of these species is superoxide dismutase which is present in both mitochondria and cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells senescence and apoptosis senescence an irreversible process in which cell no longer divides is a protective response to shortening of chromosome ends telomeres are long regions of repetitive dna that cap chromosomes and undergo partial degradation each time a cell undergoes division see limit in contrast quiescence is a reversible state of cellular dormancy that is unrelated to genome damage see cell cycle senescence in cells may serve as a functional alternative to apoptosis in cases where physical presence of a cell for spatial reasons is required by organism which serves as a last resort mechanism to prevent a cell with damaged dna from replicating inappropriately in absence of pro growth cellular signaling unregulated cell division can lead to formation of a tumor see cancer which is potentially lethal to an organism therefore induction of senescence and apoptosis is considered to be part of a strategy of protection against cancer mutation it is important to distinguish between dna damage and mutation two major types of error in dna dna damage and mutation are fundamentally different damage results in physical abnormalities in dna such as single and double strand breaks 8 residues and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon adducts dna damage can be recognized by enzymes and thus can be correctly repaired if redundant information such as undamaged sequence in complementary dna strand or in a homologous chromosome is available for copying if a cell retains dna damage transcription of a gene can be prevented and thus translation into a protein will also be blocked replication may also be blocked or cell may die in contrast to dna damage a mutation is a change in base sequence of dna a mutation cannot be recognized by enzymes once base change is present in both dna strands and thus a mutation cannot be repaired at cellular level mutations can cause alterations in protein function and regulation mutations are replicated when cell replicates in a population of cells mutant cells will increase or decrease in frequency according to effects of mutation on ability of cell to survive and reproduce although distinctly different from each other dna damage and mutation are related because dna damage often causes errors of dna synthesis during replication or repair these errors are a major source of mutation given these properties of dna damage and mutation it can be seen that dna damage is a special problem in non dividing or slowly dividing cells where unrepaired damage will tend to accumulate over time on other hand in rapidly dividing cells unrepaired dna damage that does not kill cell by blocking replication will tend to cause replication errors and thus mutation great majority of mutations that are not neutral in their effect are deleterious to a cell s survival thus in a population of cells composing a tissue with replicating cells mutant cells will tend to be lost however infrequent mutations that provide a survival advantage will tend to clonally expand at expense of neighboring cells in tissue this advantage to cell is disadvantageous to whole organism because such mutant cells can give rise to cancer thus dna damage in frequently dividing cells because it gives rise to mutations is a prominent cause of cancer in contrast dna damage in infrequently dividing cells is likely a prominent cause of aging mechanisms cells cannot function if dna damage corrupts integrity and accessibility of essential information in genome but cells remain superficially functional when non essential genes are missing or damaged depending on type of damage inflicted on dna s double helical structure a variety of repair strategies have evolved to restore lost information if possible cells use unmodified complementary strand of dna or sister chromatid as a template to recover original information without access to a template cells use an error prone recovery mechanism known as translesion synthesis as a last resort damage to dna alters spatial configuration of helix and such alterations can be detected by cell once damage is localized specific dna repair molecules bind at or near site of damage inducing other molecules to bind and form a complex that enables actual repair to take place direct reversal cells are known to eliminate three types of damage to their dna by chemically reversing it these mechanisms do not require a template since types of damage they counteract can occur in only one of four bases such direct reversal mechanisms are specific to type of damage incurred and do not involve breakage of backbone formation of pyrimidine dimers upon irradiation with uv light results in an abnormal covalent bond between adjacent pyrimidine bases process directly reverses this damage by action of enzyme photolyase whose activation is obligately dependent on energy absorbed from blue uv light 300 500 nm wavelength to promote catalysis photolyase an old enzyme present in bacteria fungi and most animals no longer functions in humans who instead use nucleotide excision repair to repair damage from uv irradiation another type of damage methylation of guanine bases is directly reversed by protein methyl guanine methyl transferase mgmt bacterial equivalent of which is called this is an expensive process because each mgmt molecule can be used only once that is reaction is stoichiometric rather than catalytic a generalized response to agents in bacteria is known as adaptive response and confers a level of resistance to alkylating agents upon sustained exposure by of alkylation repair enzymes third type of dna damage reversed by cells is certain methylation of bases cytosine and adenine mismatch repaired by dna polymerase proofreading frequency of base pair substitution mutations in bacterial genes ranges from 10 7 to 10 11 errors generations however dna polymerase inserts incorrect nucleotide at frequency of 10 5 most of difference between two values is accounted for by 3 to 5 exonuclease proofreading activity of dna polymerase in both bacteria and eukaryotes when an incorrect nucleotide is inserted polymerase detects mismatched base pairs and corrects area by back spacing to remove wrong nucleotide and then resuming synthesis in forward directions mutator mutations in e coli illustrate importance of 3 to 5 exonuclease activity of dna polymerase for maintaining low mutation rate mutator mutants have much higher than normal mutation frequency for all genes these mutants have mutations in genes for proteins whose normal functions are required for accurate dna replication for example mut d mutator gene of e coli encodes epsilon sub unit of dna polymerase iii primary replication enzyme of e coli mut d mutants are defective in 3 to 5 proofreading activity so that many incorrectly inserted nucleotide are left unrepaired repair of uv induced pyrimidine dimers through photo reactivation or light repair uv light induced thymine other pyrimidines dimmers are reverted directly to original form by exposure to near uv light in wavelength range from 320 to 370 nm photo reactivation occurs when an enzyme called photolyase is activated by a photon of light and splits dimmers apart strains with mutations in gene are defective in light repair photolyase has been found in bacteria and in simple eukaryotes but not in humans repair of alkylation damage alkylating agents transfer alkyl groups usually methyl or ethyl groups onto bases mutagen mms methylates oxygen of carbon 6 in guanine in e coli this alkylation damage is repaired by an enzyme called o6 methylguanine methyltransferase this enzyme remove methyl group from guanine thereby changing base back ti its original form similar specific system exist to repair alkylated thymine mutations of genes encoding this repair enzymes results in a much higher rate of spontaneous mutation methyl directed mismatch repair of dna polymerase a number of mismatched base pair remain uncorrected after replication has been completed in next round of replication this errors will become fixed as mutations if they are not repaired this system recognizes mismatched base pairs excises incorrect bases and then carry out repair synthesis single strand damage thumb 250px structure of base excision repair enzyme uracil dna excising a produced uracil residue from dna uracil residue is shown in yellow when only one of two strands of a double helix has a defect other strand can be used as a template to guide correction of damaged strand in order to repair damage to one of two paired molecules of dna there exist a number of excision repair mechanisms that remove damaged nucleotide and replace it with an undamaged nucleotide complementary to that found in undamaged dna strand base excision repair ber damaged single bases or nucleotide are most commonly repaired by removing base or nucleotide involved and then inserting correct base or nucleotide in base excision repair repair enzyme removes damaged base from dna by cleaving bond between base and deoxyribose sugars these enzymes remove a single nitrogenous base to create an or site ap site enzymes called ap endonucleases nick damaged dna backbone at ap site dna polymerase then removes damaged region using its 5 to 3 exonuclease activity and correctly synthesizes new strand using complementary strand as a template gap is then sealed by enzyme dna ligase nucleotide excision repair ner repairs damaged dna which commonly consists of bulky helix distorting damage such as pyrimidine dimerization caused by uv light damaged regions are removed in 12 24 nucleotide long strands in a three step process which consists of recognition of damage excision of damaged dna both upstream and downstream of damage by endonucleases and resynthesis of removed dna region ner is a highly evolutionarily conserved repair mechanism and is used in nearly all eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells in prokaryotes ner is mediated by proteins in eukaryotes many more proteins are involved although general strategy is same mismatch repair systems are present in essentially all cells to correct errors that are not corrected by proofreading these systems consist of at least two proteins one detects mismatch and other recruits an endonuclease that cleaves newly synthesized dna strand close to region of damage in e coli proteins involved are mut class proteins this is followed by removal of damaged region by an exonuclease resynthesis by dna polymerase and nick sealing by dna ligase double strand breaks double strand breaks in which both strands in double helix are severed are particularly hazardous to cell because they can lead to genome rearrangements it was noted in some studies that double strand breaks and a cross linkage joining both strands at same point is irreparable because neither strand can then serve as a template for repair cell will die in next mitosis or in some rare instances mutate three mechanisms exist to repair double strand breaks dsbs non homologous end joining nhej microhomology mediated end joining mmej and homologous recombination hr in an in vitro system mmej occurred in mammalian cells at levels of 10 20 of hr when both hr and nhej mechanisms were also available thumb 230px dna ligase shown above repairing chromosomal damage is an enzyme that joins broken nucleotides together by catalyzing formation of an ester bond between phosphate backbone and deoxyribose nucleotides in nhej dna ligase iv a specialized dna ligase that forms a complex with cofactor directly joins two ends to guide accurate repair nhej relies on short homologous sequences called present on single stranded tails of dna ends to be joined if these overhangs are compatible repair is usually accurate nhej can also introduce mutations during repair loss of damaged nucleotides at break site can lead to deletions and joining of termini forms insertions or translocations nhej is especially important before cell has replicated its dna since there is no template available for repair by homologous recombination there are backup nhej pathways in higher eukaryotes besides its role as a genome caretaker nhej is required for joining hairpin capped double strand breaks induced during v d j recombination process that generates diversity in b cell and t cell receptors in vertebrate immune system homologous recombination requires presence of an identical or nearly identical sequence to be used as a template for repair of break enzymatic machinery responsible for this repair process is nearly identical to machinery responsible for chromosomal crossover during meiosis this pathway allows a damaged chromosome to be repaired using a sister chromatid available in g2 after dna replication or a homologous chromosome as a template dsbs caused by replication machinery attempting to synthesize across a single strand break or unrepaired lesion cause collapse of replication fork and are typically repaired by recombination mmej starts with short range end resection by mre11 nuclease on either side of a double strand break to reveal microhomology regions in further steps poly adp ribose polymerase 1 parp1 is required and may be an early step in mmej there is pairing of microhomology regions followed by recruitment of flap structure specific endonuclease 1 fen1 to remove overhanging flaps this is followed by recruitment of xrcc1 to site for ligating dna ends leading to an intact dna mmej is always accompanied by a deletion so that mmej is a mutagenic pathway for dna repair extremophile deinococcus radiodurans has a remarkable ability to survive dna damage from ionizing radiation and other sources at least two copies of genome with random dna breaks can form dna fragments through annealing partially overlapping fragments are then used for synthesis of homologous regions through a moving d loop that can continue extension until they find complementary partner strands in final step there is crossover by means of reca dependent homologous recombination topoisomerases introduce both single and double strand breaks in course of changing dna s state of supercoiling which is especially common in regions near an open replication fork such breaks are not considered dna damage because they are a natural intermediate in topoisomerase biochemical mechanism and are immediately repaired by enzymes that created them translesion synthesis translesion synthesis tls is a dna damage tolerance process that allows dna replication machinery to replicate past dna lesions such as thymine dimers or ap sites it involves switching out regular dna polymerases for specialized translesion polymerases i e dna polymerase iv or v from y polymerase family often with larger active sites that can facilitate insertion of bases opposite damaged nucleotides polymerase switching is thought to be mediated by among other factors post translational modification of replication factor pcna translesion synthesis polymerases often have low fidelity high propensity to insert wrong bases on undamaged templates relative to regular polymerases however many are extremely efficient at inserting correct bases opposite specific types of damage for example pol e mediates error free bypass of lesions induced by uv irradiation whereas pol i introduces mutations at these sites pol e is known to add first adenine across t t using watson crick base pairing and second adenine will be added in its syn conformation using base pairing from a cellular perspective risking introduction of point mutations during translesion synthesis may be preferable to resorting to more drastic mechanisms of dna repair which may cause gross chromosomal aberrations or cell death in short process involves specialized polymerases either bypassing or repairing lesions at locations of stalled dna replication for example human dna polymerase eta can bypass complex dna lesions like guanine thymine intra strand crosslink g 8 5 me t although it can cause targeted and semi targeted mutations and basu studied toxicity and mutagenesis of same lesion in escherichia coli by replicating a g 8 5 me t modified plasmid in e coli with specific dna polymerase knockouts viability was very low in a strain lacking pol ii pol iv and pol v three sos inducible dna polymerases indicating that translesion synthesis is conducted primarily by these specialized dna polymerases a bypass platform is provided to these polymerases by proliferating cell nuclear antigen pcna under normal circumstances pcna bound to polymerases replicates dna at a site of lesion pcna is ubiquitinated or modified by proteins to provide a platform for specialized polymerases to bypass lesion and resume dna replication after translesion synthesis extension is required this extension can be carried out by a replicative polymerase if tls is error free as in case of pol e yet if tls results in a mismatch a specialized polymerase is needed to extend it pol z pol z is unique in that it can extend terminal mismatches whereas more processive polymerases cannot so when a lesion is encountered replication fork will stall pcna will switch from a processive polymerase to a tls polymerase such as pol i to fix lesion then pcna may switch to pol z to extend mismatch and last pcna will switch to processive polymerase to continue replication global response to dna damage cells exposed to ionizing radiation ultraviolet light or chemicals are prone to acquire multiple sites of bulky dna lesions and double strand breaks moreover dna damaging agents can damage other biomolecules such as proteins carbohydrates lipids and rna accumulation of damage to be specific double strand breaks or adducts stalling replication forks are among known stimulation signals for a global response to dna damage friedberg ec walker gc siede w wood rd schultz ra ellenberger t 2006 dna repair and mutagenesis part 3 asm press 2nd ed global response to damage is an act directed toward cells own preservation and triggers multiple pathways of macromolecular repair lesion bypass tolerance or apoptosis common features of global response are induction of multiple genes cell cycle arrest and inhibition of cell division initial steps packaging of eukaryotic dna into chromatin presents a barrier to all dna based processes that require recruitment of enzymes to their sites of action to allow dna repair chromatin must be remodeled in eukaryotes atp dependent chromatin remodeling complexes and histone modifying enzymes are two predominant factors employed to accomplish this remodeling process chromatin relaxation occurs rapidly at site of a dna damage halicka hd zhao h m traganos f darzynkiewicz z 2009 detection of chromatin relaxation an early reporter of dna damage response cell cycle 8 2233 2237 in one of earliest steps stress activated protein kinase c jun n terminal kinase jnk sirt6 on serine 10 in response to double strand breaks or other dna damage this post translational modification facilitates mobilization of sirt6 to dna damage sites and is required for efficient recruitment of poly adp ribose polymerase 1 parp1 to dna break sites and for efficient repair of dsbs parp1 protein starts to appear at dna damage sites in less than a second with half maximum accumulation within 1 6 seconds after damage occurs parp1 synthesizes polymeric adenosine diphosphate ribose poly adp ribose or par chains on itself next chromatin alc1 quickly attaches to product of parp1 action a poly adp ribose chain and alc1 completes arrival at dna damage within 10 seconds of occurrence of damage about half of maximum chromatin relaxation presumably due to action of alc1 occurs by 10 seconds this then allows recruitment of dna repair enzyme mre11 to initiate dna repair within 13 seconds gh2ax phosphorylated form of h2ax is also involved in early steps leading to chromatin decondensation after dna double strand breaks histone variant h2ax constitutes about 10 of histones in human chromatin gh2ax h2ax phosphorylated on serine 139 can be detected as soon as 20 seconds after irradiation of cells with dna double strand break formation and half maximum accumulation of gh2ax occurs in one minute extent of chromatin with phosphorylated gh2ax is about two million base pairs at site of a dna double strand break gh2ax does not itself cause chromatin decondensation but within 30 seconds of irradiation rnf8 protein can be detected in association with gh2ax rnf8 mediates extensive chromatin decondensation through its subsequent interaction with a component of nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase complex ddb2 occurs in a complex with ddb1 this complex further complexes with ubiquitin ligase protein and with parp1 this larger complex rapidly associates with uv induced damage within chromatin with half maximum association completed in 40 seconds parp1 protein attached to both ddb1 and ddb2 then creates a poly adp ribose chain on ddb2 that attracts dna remodeling protein alc1 action of alc1 relaxes chromatin at site of uv damage to dna this relaxation allows other proteins in nucleotide excision repair pathway to enter chromatin and repair uv induced pyrimidine dimer damages after rapid chromatin remodeling cell cycle checkpoints are activated to allow dna repair to occur before cell cycle progresses first two kinases atm and atr are activated within 5 or 6 minutes after dna is damaged this is followed by phosphorylation of cell cycle checkpoint protein initiating its function about 10 minutes after dna is damaged dna damage checkpoints after dna damage cell cycle checkpoints are activated checkpoint activation pauses cell cycle and gives cell time to repair damage before continuing to divide dna damage checkpoints occur at g1 s and g2 m boundaries an intra s checkpoint also exists checkpoint activation is controlled by two master kinases atm and atr atm responds to dna double strand breaks and disruptions in chromatin structure whereas atr primarily responds to stalled replication forks these kinases phosphorylate downstream targets in a signal transduction cascade eventually leading to cell cycle arrest a class of checkpoint mediator proteins including brca1 and has also been identified these proteins seem to be required for transmitting checkpoint activation signal to downstream proteins dna damage checkpoint is a signal transduction pathway that blocks cell cycle progression in g1 g2 and metaphase and slows down rate of s phase progression when dna is damaged it leads to a pause in cell cycle allowing cell time to repair damage before continuing to divide checkpoint proteins can be separated into four groups 3 kinase pi3k like protein kinase proliferating cell nuclear antigen pcna like group two serine threonine s t kinases and their adaptors central to all dna damage induced checkpoints responses is a pair of large protein kinases belonging to first group of pi3k like protein kinases atm ataxia telangiectasia mutated and atr ataxia and rad related kinases whose sequence and functions have been well conserved in evolution all dna damage response requires either atm or atr because they have ability to bind to chromosomes at site of dna damage together with accessory proteins that are platforms on which dna damage response components and dna repair complexes can be assembled an important downstream target of atm and atr is p53 as it is required for inducing apoptosis following dna damage cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor p21 is induced by both p53 dependent and p53 independent mechanisms and can arrest cell cycle at g1 s and g2 m checkpoints by deactivating cyclin cyclin dependent kinase complexes prokaryotic sos response sos response is changes in gene expression in escherichia coli and other bacteria in response to extensive dna damage prokaryotic sos system is regulated by two key proteins lexa and reca lexa homodimer is a transcriptional repressor that binds to operator sequences commonly referred to as sos boxes in escherichia coli it is known that lexa regulates transcription of approximately 48 genes including lexa and reca genes sos response is known to be widespread in bacteria domain but it is mostly absent in some bacterial phyla like most common cellular signals activating sos response are regions of single stranded dna ssdna arising from stalled replication forks or double strand breaks which are processed by dna helicase to separate two dna strands in initiation step reca protein binds to ssdna in an atp hydrolysis driven reaction creating reca ssdna filaments reca ssdna filaments activate lexa activity which ultimately leads to cleavage of lexa dimer and subsequent lexa degradation loss of lexa repressor induces transcription of sos genes and allows for further signal induction inhibition of cell division and an increase in levels of proteins responsible for damage processing in escherichia coli sos boxes are 20 nucleotide long sequences near promoters with palindromic structure and a high degree of sequence conservation in other classes and phyla sequence of sos boxes varies considerably with different length and composition but it is always highly conserved and one of strongest short signals in genome high information content of sos boxes permits differential binding of lexa to different promoters and allows for timing of sos response lesion repair genes are induced at beginning of sos response error prone translesion polymerases for example 2 also called dna polymerase v are induced later on as a last resort once dna damage is repaired or bypassed using polymerases or through recombination amount of single stranded dna in cells is decreased lowering amounts of reca filaments decreases cleavage activity of lexa homodimer which then binds to sos boxes near promoters and restores normal gene expression eukaryotic transcriptional responses to dna damage eukaryotic cells exposed to dna damaging agents also activate important defensive pathways by inducing multiple proteins involved in dna repair cell cycle checkpoint control protein trafficking and degradation such genome wide transcriptional response is very complex and tightly regulated thus allowing coordinated global response to damage exposure of yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae to dna damaging agents results in overlapping but distinct transcriptional profiles similarities to environmental shock response indicates that a general global stress response pathway exist at level of transcriptional activation in contrast different human cell types respond to damage differently indicating an absence of a common global response probable explanation for this difference between yeast and human cells may be in heterogeneity of mammalian cells in an animal different types of cells are distributed among different organs that have evolved different sensitivities to dna damage in general global response to dna damage involves expression of multiple genes responsible for repair homologous recombination nucleotide excision repair dna damage checkpoint global transcriptional activation genes controlling mrna decay and many others a large amount of damage to a cell leaves it with an important decision undergo apoptosis and die or survive at cost of living with a modified genome an increase in tolerance to damage can lead to an increased rate of survival that will allow a greater accumulation of mutations yeast rev1 and human polymerase e are members of y family translesion dna polymerases present during global response to dna damage and are responsible for enhanced mutagenesis during a global response to dna damage in eukaryotes aging pathological effects of poor dna repair frame dna repair rate is an important determinant of cell pathology experimental animals with genetic deficiencies in dna repair often show decreased life span and increased cancer incidence for example mice deficient in dominant nhej pathway and in telomere maintenance mechanisms get lymphoma and infections more often and as a consequence have shorter lifespans than wild type mice in similar manner mice deficient in a key repair and transcription protein that dna helices have premature onset of aging related diseases and consequent shortening of lifespan however not every dna repair deficiency creates exactly predicted effects mice deficient in ner pathway exhibited shortened life span without correspondingly higher rates of mutation if rate of dna damage exceeds capacity of cell to repair it accumulation of errors can overwhelm cell and result in early senescence apoptosis or cancer inherited diseases associated with faulty dna repair functioning result in premature aging increased sensitivity to carcinogens and correspondingly increased cancer risk see below on other hand organisms with enhanced dna repair systems such as deinococcus radiodurans most radiation resistant known organism exhibit remarkable resistance to double strand break inducing effects of radioactivity likely due to enhanced efficiency of dna repair and especially nhej longevity and caloric restriction frame right most life span influencing genes affect rate of dna damage a number of individual genes have been identified as influencing variations in life span within a population of organisms effects of these genes is strongly dependent on environment in particular on organism s diet caloric restriction results in extended lifespan in a variety of organisms likely via nutrient sensing pathways and decreased metabolic rate molecular mechanisms by which such restriction results in lengthened lifespan are as yet unclear see for some discussion however behavior of many genes known to be involved in dna repair is altered under conditions of caloric restriction several agents reported to have anti aging properties have been shown to attenuate constitutive level of mtor signaling an evidence of reduction of metabolic activity and concurrently to reduce constitutive level of dna damage induced by generated reactive oxygen species for example increasing gene dosage of gene sir 2 which regulates dna packaging in nematode worm caenorhabditis elegans can significantly extend lifespan mammalian homolog of sir 2 is known to induce downstream dna repair factors involved in nhej an activity that is especially promoted under conditions of caloric restriction caloric restriction has been closely linked to rate of base excision repair in nuclear dna of rodents although similar effects have not been observed in mitochondrial dna c elegans gene age 1 an upstream effector of dna repair pathways confers dramatically extended life span under free feeding conditions but leads to a decrease in reproductive fitness under conditions of caloric restriction this observation supports pleiotropy theory of biological origins of aging which suggests that genes conferring a large survival advantage early in life will be selected for even if they carry a corresponding disadvantage late in life medicine and dna repair modulation hereditary dna repair disorders defects in ner mechanism are responsible for several genetic disorders including hypersensitivity to sunlight uv resulting in increased skin cancer incidence and premature aging cockayne syndrome hypersensitivity to uv and chemical agents sensitive skin brittle hair and nails mental retardation often accompanies latter two disorders suggesting increased vulnerability of developmental neurons other dna repair disorders include werner s syndrome premature aging and retarded growth bloom s syndrome sunlight hypersensitivity high incidence of malignancies especially leukemias ataxia telangiectasia sensitivity to ionizing radiation and some chemical agents all of above diseases are often called segmental accelerated aging diseases because their victims appear elderly and suffer from aging related diseases at an abnormally young age while not manifesting all symptoms of old age other diseases associated with reduced dna repair function include fanconi anemia hereditary breast cancer and hereditary colon cancer cancer because of inherent limitations in dna repair mechanisms if humans lived long enough they would all eventually develop cancer there are at least 34 inherited human dna repair gene mutations that increase cancer risk many of these mutations cause dna repair to be less effective than normal in particular hereditary colorectal cancer is strongly associated with specific mutations in dna mismatch repair pathway brca1 and brca2 two important genes whose mutations confer a hugely increased risk of breast cancer on carriers are both associated with a large number of dna repair pathways especially nhej and homologous recombination cancer therapy procedures such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy work by overwhelming capacity of cell to repair dna damage resulting in cell death cells that are most rapidly dividing most typically cancer cells are preferentially affected side effect is that other non cancerous but rapidly dividing cells such as progenitor cells in gut skin and hematopoietic system are also affected modern cancer treatments attempt to localize dna damage to cells and tissues only associated with cancer either by physical means concentrating therapeutic agent in region of tumor or by biochemical means exploiting a feature unique to cancer cells in body in context of therapies targeting dna damage response genes latter approach has been termed synthetic lethality perhaps most well known of these synthetic lethality drugs is poly adp ribose polymerase 1 parp1 inhibitor olaparib which was approved by food and drug administration in 2015 for treatment in women of brca defective ovarian cancer tumor cells with partial loss of dna damage response specifically homologous recombination repair are dependent on another mechanism single strand break repair which is a mechanism consisting in part of parp1 gene product olaparib is combined with to inhibit single strand break repair induced by dna damage caused by co administered chemotherapy tumor cells relying on this residual dna repair mechanism are unable to repair damage and hence are not able to survive and proliferate whereas normal cells can repair damage with functioning homologous recombination mechanism many other drugs for use against other residual dna repair mechanisms commonly found in cancer are currently under investigation however synthetic lethality therapeutic approaches have been questioned due to emerging evidence of acquired resistance achieved through rewiring of dna damage response pathways and reversion of previously inhibited defects dna repair defects in cancer it has become apparent over past several years that dna damage response acts as a barrier to malignant transformation of preneoplastic cells previous studies have shown an elevated dna damage response in cell culture models with activation and preneoplastic colon adenomas dna damage response mechanisms trigger cell cycle arrest and attempt to repair dna lesions or promote cell death senescence if repair is not possible replication stress is observed in preneoplastic cells due to increased proliferation signals from oncogenic mutations replication stress is characterized by increased replication initiation origin firing increased transcription and collisions of transcription replication complexes nucleotide deficiency increase in reactive oxygen species ros replication stress along with selection for inactivating mutations in dna damage response genes in evolution of tumor leads to downregulation and or loss of some dna damage response mechanisms and hence loss of dna repair and or senescence programmed cell death in experimental mouse models loss of dna damage response mediated cell senescence was observed after using a short hairpin rna to inhibit double strand break response kinase ataxia telangiectasia atm leading to increased tumor size and invasiveness humans born with inherited defects in dna repair mechanisms for example li syndrome have a higher cancer risk prevalence of dna damage response

excision repair mmr mismatch repair epigenetic dna repair defects in cancer classically cancer has been viewed as a set of diseases that are driven by progressive genetic abnormalities that include mutations in tumour suppressor genes and oncogenes and chromosomal aberrations however it has become apparent that cancer is also driven by epigenetic alterations epigenetic alterations refer to functionally relevant modifications to genome that do not involve a change in nucleotide sequence examples of such modifications are changes in dna methylation and hypomethylation and histone modification changes in chromosomal architecture caused by inappropriate expression of proteins such as or and changes caused by each of these epigenetic alterations serves to regulate gene expression without altering underlying dna sequence these changes usually remain through cell divisions last for multiple cell generations and can be considered to be epimutations equivalent to mutations while large numbers of epigenetic alterations are found in cancers epigenetic alterations in dna repair genes causing reduced expression of dna repair proteins appear to be particularly important such alterations are thought to occur early in progression to cancer and to be a likely cause of genetic instability characteristic of cancers http oxfordjournals org content 3 1 51 c prasad ar v bernstein h 2013 chapter 16 dna damage dna repair and cancer new research directions in dna repair clark chen ed intech reduced expression of dna repair genes causes deficient dna repair when dna repair is deficient dna damages remain in cells at a higher than usual level and these excess damages cause increased frequencies of mutation or epimutation mutation rates increase substantially in cells defective in dna mismatch repair or in homologous recombinational repair hrr chromosomal rearrangements and also increase in hrr defective cells higher levels of dna damage not only cause increased mutation but also cause increased epimutation during repair of dna double strand breaks or repair of other dna damages incompletely cleared sites of repair can cause epigenetic gene silencing deficient expression of dna repair proteins due to an inherited mutation can cause increased risk of cancer individuals with an inherited impairment in any of 34 dna repair genes see article dna repair deficiency disorder have an increased risk of cancer with some defects causing up to a 100 lifetime chance of cancer e g p53 mutations however such germline mutations which cause highly cancer syndromes are cause of only about 1 percent of cancers frequencies of epimutations in dna repair genes thumb 400px a chart of common dna damaging agents examples of lesions they cause in dna and pathways used to repair these lesions also shown are many of genes in these pathways an indication of which genes are epigenetically regulated to have reduced or increased expression in various cancers it also shows genes in error prone microhomology mediated end joining pathway with increased expression in various cancers deficiencies in dna repair enzymes are occasionally caused by a newly arising somatic mutation in a dna repair gene but are much more frequently caused by epigenetic alterations that reduce or silence expression of dna repair genes for example when 113 colorectal cancers were examined in sequence only four had a missense mutation in dna repair gene mgmt while majority had reduced mgmt expression due to methylation of mgmt promoter region an epigenetic alteration five different studies found that between 40 and 90 of colorectal cancers have reduced mgmt expression due to methylation of mgmt promoter region similarly out of 119 cases of mismatch repair deficient colorectal cancers that lacked dna repair gene pms2 expression pms2 was deficient in 6 due to mutations in pms2 gene while in 103 cases pms2 expression was deficient because its pairing partner mlh1 was repressed due to promoter methylation pms2 protein is unstable in absence of mlh1 in other 10 cases loss of pms2 expression was likely due to epigenetic overexpression of microrna mir 155 which down regulates mlh1 in further examples tabulated in table 4 of this bernstein and harris bernstein 2015 epigenetic reduction of dna repair in progression to cancer advances in dna repair prof clark chen ed intech epigenetic defects were found at frequencies of between 13 100 for dna repair genes brca1 wrn mgmt mlh1 ercc1 xpf and atm these epigenetic defects occurred in various cancers e g breast ovarian colorectal and head and neck two or three deficiencies in expression of ercc1 xpf or pms2 occur simultaneously in majority of 49 colon cancers evaluated by et al chart in this section shows some frequent dna damaging agents examples of dna lesions they cause and pathways that deal with these dna damages at least 169 enzymes are either directly employed in dna repair or influence dna repair processes human dna repair genes 15 april 2014 md anderson cancer center university of texas of these 83 are directly employed in repairing 5 types of dna damages illustrated in chart some of more well studied genes central to these repair processes are shown in chart gene designations shown in red gray or cyan indicate genes frequently epigenetically altered in various types of cancers wikipedia articles on each of genes highlighted by red gray or cyan describe epigenetic alteration s and cancer s in which these epimutations are found four review articles chen and tao chen 2011 chapter 18 roles of microrna in dna damage and repair dna repair inna ed intech and two broad experimental survey articles also document most of these epigenetic dna repair deficiencies in cancers red highlighted genes are frequently reduced or silenced by epigenetic mechanisms in various cancers when these genes have low or absent expression dna damages can accumulate replication errors past these damages see translesion synthesis can lead to increased mutations and ultimately cancer epigenetic repression of dna repair genes in accurate dna repair pathways appear to be central to carcinogenesis two gray highlighted genes rad51 and brca2 are required for homologous recombinational repair they are sometimes epigenetically over expressed and sometimes under expressed in certain cancers as indicated in wikipedia articles on rad51 and brca2 such cancers ordinarily have epigenetic deficiencies in other dna repair genes these repair deficiencies would likely cause increased unrepaired dna damages over expression of rad51 and brca2 seen in these cancers may reflect selective pressures for compensatory rad51 or brca2 over expression and increased homologous recombinational repair to at least partially deal with such excess dna damages in those cases where rad51 or brca2 are under expressed this would itself lead to increased unrepaired dna damages replication errors past these damages see translesion synthesis could cause increased mutations and cancer so that under expression of rad51 or brca2 would be carcinogenic in itself cyan highlighted genes are in microhomology mediated end joining mmej pathway and are up regulated in cancer mmej is an additional error prone inaccurate repair pathway for double strand breaks in mmej repair of a double strand break an homology of 5 25 complementary base pairs between both paired strands is sufficient to align strands but mismatched ends flaps are usually present mmej removes extra nucleotides flaps where strands are joined and then strands to create an intact dna double helix mmej almost always involves at least a small deletion so that it is a mutagenic pathway fen1 flap endonuclease in mmej is epigenetically increased by promoter hypomethylation and is over expressed in majority of cancers of breast prostate stomach pancreas and lung parp1 is also over expressed when its promoter region ets site is epigenetically and this contributes to progression to endometrial cancer brca mutated ovarian cancer and brca mutated ovarian cancer other genes in mmej pathway are also over expressed in a number of cancers see mmej for summary and are also shown in cyan genome wide distribution of dna repair in human somatic cells differential activity of dna repair pathways across various regions of human genome causes mutations to be very unevenly distributed within tumor genomes in particular gene rich early replicating regions of human genome exhibit lower mutation frequencies than gene poor late replicating heterochromatin one mechanism underlying this involves histone modification h3k36me3 which can recruit mismatch repair proteins thereby lowering mutation rates in h3k36me3 marked regions another important mechanism concerns nucleotide excision repair which can be recruited by transcription machinery lowering somatic mutation rates in active genes and other open chromatin regions evolution basic processes of dna repair are highly conserved among both prokaryotes and eukaryotes and even among bacteriophages viruses which infect bacteria however more complex organisms with more complex genomes have correspondingly more complex repair mechanisms ability of a large number of protein structural motifs to catalyze relevant chemical reactions has played a significant role in elaboration of repair mechanisms during evolution for an extremely detailed review of hypotheses relating to evolution of dna repair see fossil record indicates that single cell life began to proliferate on planet at some point during precambrian period although exactly when recognizably modern life first emerged is unclear nucleic acids became sole and universal means of encoding genetic information requiring dna repair mechanisms that in their basic form have been inherited by all extant life forms from their common ancestor emergence of earth s oxygen rich atmosphere known as oxygen catastrophe due to photosynthetic organisms as well as presence of potentially damaging free radicals in cell due to oxidative phosphorylation necessitated evolution of dna repair mechanisms that act specifically to counter types of damage induced by oxidative stress rate of evolutionary change on some occasions dna damage is not repaired or is repaired by an error prone mechanism that results in a change from original sequence when this occurs mutations may propagate into genomes of cell s progeny should such an event occur in a germ line cell that will eventually produce a mutation has potential to be passed on to organism s offspring rate of evolution in a particular species or in a particular gene is a function of rate of mutation as a consequence rate and accuracy of dna repair mechanisms have an influence over process of evolutionary change dna damage protection and repair does not influence rate of adaptation by gene regulation and by recombination and selection of alleles on other hand dna damage repair and protection does influence rate of accumulation of irreparable advantageous code expanding inheritable mutations and slows down evolutionary mechanism for expansion of genome of organisms with new functionalities tension between and mutation repair and protection needs further investigation technology a technology named clustered regularly
