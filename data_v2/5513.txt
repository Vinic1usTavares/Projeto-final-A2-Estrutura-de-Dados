and tennant reviewing script before filming in at queen s gate tunnel on 28 january 2009 russell t davies co wrote episode with gareth roberts first credited writing partnership for show since its 2005 revival planet of dead was a departure from roberts usual stories roberts had previously only written pseudo historical stories and instead consisted of wild science fiction elements from his literary career and teenage imagination episode had no clear concept such as shakespeare and witches in shakespeare code or agatha christie and a murder mystery in unicorn and wasp and instead was a deliberate clash of concepts with many disparate elements roberts explained he was cautious to ensure that each element had to feel precise and defined like we meant that citing serial arc of infinity as an example where such control was not enforced episode includes a common feature of davies writing in that there is no clear antagonist tritovore are eventually sympathetic to protagonists and stingrays are only following their biological imperative unlike christmas specials theme of easter was not emphasised in story episode only contained a fleeting mention of holiday instead of robot bunnies carrying baskets full of deadly egg bombs episode s tone word joyous was influenced by davies realisation that every story since fires of pompeii had a bittersweet quality and his subsequent desire to avoid recurring theme starting point for story was roberts first novel highest science davies liked image of a train on a desert planet and rewrote train as a bus davies nevertheless emphasised it was not an adaptation as such because tangential elements were constantly being conceived and added thumb 200px michelle ryan who played lady christina de souza michelle ryan s casting as lady christina de souza was confirmed by bbc on 23 january 2009 and attracted media attention owing to ryan s recent relatively high profile roles in eastenders jekyll bionic woman and merlin ryan stated that she is a huge fan of doctor who and was very excited to be joining david tennant and doctor who team davies commented that michelle is one of most sought after young actors in country and that they were delighted to announce that she would be joining team ryan described her casting as a real honour noting that she love s character ryan was rumoured to be in line for a role as full time companion to incoming eleventh doctor matt smith and her casting in planet of dead combined with her previous working history with incoming executive producer steven moffat two working together on jekyll fuelled speculation that she might return to doctor who accompanying eleventh doctor in series 5 ryan herself has said that she is open for a return to character however stating that she is a commitment at moment and with regards to her character she views her as someone who is around for this one time adventure it had been reported that ryan auditioned to replace billie piper in companion role when her character rose tyler left in 2006 but was unsuccessful ryan subsequently stated that this was false ryan was interviewed by bbc news about her role as lady christina ryan praised her colleagues and family atmosphere on set and described doctor who as really something special to do on 9 april 2009 ryan guested on steve wright in afternoon on bbc radio 2 and on justin lee collins show on itv2 to promote planet of dead after a showing of a trailer for episode on justin lee collins show ryan described fantastic time she had filming in cardiff and in dubai ryan s character lady christina de souza is an adrenaline junkie and thief christina is a typical doctor who companion davies electing to draw parallels from time lady romana rather than new series companion rose tyler roberts described her as an adventuress who is upper class and glam suited and booted and extremely intelligent which doctor could relate to because they both rejected their heritages episode s director james strong described character as reverting to a traditional romantic based companionship rather than platonic companionship of donna noble catherine tate in fourth series while still being a unique companion comedian lee evans plays professor malcolm taylor a unit scientist devoted to his predecessor doctor davies created evans character to serve as a foil for noma dumezweni s pragmatic character captain erisa magambo who previously appeared in episode turn left roberts noted after writing episode that evans character had unintentionally become a loving caricature of doctor who fandom episode was influenced by several works davies described planet of dead as a great big adventure a little bit indiana jones a little bit flight of phoenix a little bit pitch black relationship between doctor and christina was influenced by 1960s films such as charade and topkapi which included cary grant and audrey hepburn being witty and sophisticated together and then running for their lives and tritovore were influenced by 1950s and 1970s science fiction b movies such as fly and davies habit of including aliens that were recognisable to audience as animals from earth such as judoon carmen s warning evoked memories of ood s warning to doctor and donna in fourth series episode planet of ood tennant explained prophecy meant that doctor s card had become marked and three specials would thus be darker characterising planet of dead as last time doctor gets to have any fun and that subject of prophecy was not obvious answer filming pre production on four specials started on 20 november 2008 four days before scheduled because episode s overseas filming in dubai required extra planning time two weeks later production team was on a recce for special and final draft of script was completed production team examined overseas locations to film episode because they wanted scenery to feel real and thought that they would be unable to film on a welsh beach in winter after examining countries such as morocco and tunisia production team decided to film in dubai because area was more amicable to filming industry and viable filming locations were nearer to urban areas than other locations production began on 19 january in wales special was first doctor who episode to be filmed in high definition television resolution move to hd had previously been resisted for two major reasons when show was revived in 2005 high definition television had not been adopted by an adequate portion of audience to be financially viable and special effects were considerably more expensive to create in high definition than in standard definition planet of dead was used as a switch to hd because of show s reduced schedule in 2009 and because filming crew had become experienced with equipment while they were filming torchwood filming began at national museum cardiff national museum cardiff international gallery which doubled for history museum depicted in episode s first scene to portray tunnel bus travelled into queen s gate tunnel of road in s gate tunnel tunnel was closed for four nights to accommodate filming last major piece of filming in wales took place in closed mir formerly steelworks in newport mir steelworks tritovore spaceship which doubled almost unaltered for tritovore spaceship scenes set in london s oxford street were filmed at st mary street cardiff filming took place at peak of february 2009 great britain snowfall where sub zero temperatures slowed filming and had a visible effect on cast to accommodate for adverse conditions davies included a line in script that specified that tritovore spaceship cooled as external temperatures increase thumb left 200 bus so named after episode s landmark in dock at dubai city port after a container was accidentally dropped on it filming in desert planet of dead took place in mid february 2009 two weeks previously one of two 1980 bristol vr double decker buses bought for filming had been substantially damaged when a crane accidentally dropped a container in dubai city port after an emergency discussion by production team they agreed that damage was unintentionally artistic and decided to include damaged bus in episode instead of shipping spare bus from cardiff which would have delayed already hurried filming schedule production team decided to partially reconstruct bus in dubai damage spare bus in cardiff to match bus in dubai and rewrite part of script to accommodate and mention damage to bus james strong recalled reaction of production team to damage to bus in an issue of doctor who magazine thumb a notable use of lens flares being used in episode for artistic effect strong sought to maximise rather than minimise effects such as these because it disguised fact it was filmed in a studio and allowed viewer to suspend their disbelief more easily this specific shot was highlighted by strong and tennant as an example of how it was correctly utilised damaged bus was not only problem to filming in dubai first of three days was afflicted by a sandstorm which left most of footage shot unusable production team then struggled to complete three days of filming in two days last day was compared to filming lawrence of arabia to complete episode s filming interior scenes in bus were filmed in a studio in wales to disguise fact they were using a a 360 degree background image strong utilised often avoided techniques such as muddied windows and lens flares latter also served to create a warmer environment for viewer after filming ended editing and post processing took place until two days before transmission leaving bbc to resort to using an unfinished copy to market episode 200th story planet of dead was advertised as doctor whos 200th story writer russell t davies admitted that designation was arbitrary and debatable based upon how fans counted unfinished serial shada season long fourteen part serial trial of a time lord and third series finale consisting of utopia sound of drums and last of time lords davies personally disagreed about counting trial of a time lord as one serial arguing that it felt like four stories to him and grouping utopia with its following episodes but agreed that it was only an opinion which did not override any others gareth roberts inserted a reference to landmark specifically bus number is 200 and davies emailed show s publicity team to advertise special as such doctor who magazines editor tom spilsbury acknowledged controversy in magazine s 407th issue which ran a reader survey of all 200 stories

making it fifth most watched programme of week and most watched programme aired on bbc hd at that time including repeats in following week and viewings on bbc iplayer 13 89 million viewers watched episode in total episode received average critical reviews simon brew of science fiction blog den of geek said episode was by turns ambitious and predictable but still quite entertaining first part of review mentioned an objection from his wife that bus trapped in sand looked really fake despite episode being actually filmed in dubai and then mentioned brew s appreciation of concept of people stranded in desert and concluded that made a fair fist of it brew positively reviewed michelle ryan s performance comparing her performance to be on par to her role in bionic woman rather than her role as zoe slater in eastenders and lee evans performance as malcolm taylor calling him highlight of episode because of his dialogue he closed his review by saying that planet of dead was passable enough he thought it never really gelled for him but he thought it was overall entertaining and was excited for remaining three specials as a result of carmen s prophecy charlie jane anders of io9 mostly loved planet of dead commenting that it was a standard russell t davies script she compared it to two previous episodes impossible planet and midnight both of which she enjoyed she criticised three aspects of episode lady christina who was first russell t davies heroine who actually filled her with revulsion leaving her hoping that character would be killed off screen malcolm s reluctance to close wormhole and implausibility of only three stingrays travelling through it she thought that episode was a pretty solid adventure with a cool set of monsters ben rawson jones of entertainment website digital spy gave episode two stars out of five he characterised episode as being as hollow as a big chocolate easter egg because it was lacking in enthralling drama and compelling characterisation that has been lynchpin of russell t davies era his main criticism was towards ryan s character describing romantic tension between christina and doctor as feeling forced and arguing that ryan was utterly unconvincing as christina conversely he was appreciative of strong s direction and unit subplot specifically he approved of evans performance noting that fact that malcolm names a unit of measurement after himself is both inspired and hilarious his review ended by describing episode as lifeless for much of hour and expressing his hope that ambiguous entity from carmen s premonition would hurry up orlando parfitt of ign gave episode a 7 1 good rating out of ten parfitt called it a straightforward story that did not elevate to level of excitement typically seen in doctor who until episode s climax instead describing majority of story as being taken up with tennant and ryan standing in desert swapping flirtatious banter in between proclaiming how dire their situation is and criticised writing of part of episode where bus was on san helios claiming that plot devices such as tritovore or taylor being held at gunpoint and ordered to close wormhole as feel ing forced and unnaturally shoe horned into script his praise of episode went to ryan and evans although he thought of christina as a shameless lara croft ripoff he said that character still proves a sexy and wise cracking counterpart to doctor and evans acting alongside dumezweni highlighted his undeniably great comic acting as opposed to his love it or hate it stand up comedy last paragraph of his review focused on climax which he thought was a cracker that just about makes up for previously plodding plot and described entire episode as having enough enjoyable moments to entertain fans
