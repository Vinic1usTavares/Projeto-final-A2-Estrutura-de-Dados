ny 590 is known as sea breeze expressway a name derived from small community of sea breeze located near highway s former northern terminus at culver road near southern shore of lake ontario portion of ny 590 between can of worms and ny 104 is part of northeastern quadrant of rochester outer loop a series of expressways that form a beltway around city of rochester at ny 104 outer loop turns west to follow ny 104 through irondequoit sea breeze expressway was built in stages from 1950s to 1960s and carried various designations until 1970 when entirety of rochester sea breeze highway was designated as part of ny 47 it was redesignated as ny 590 in 1980 in late 2000s section of ny 590 north of titus avenue was reconfigured into a two lane road named sea breeze drive and ny 590 was truncated to end at titus avenue route description thumb left just north of ny 286 on ny 590 northbound in rochester four lane i 590 becomes ny 590 upon passing under i 490 at can of worms on eastern edge of rochester it heads northeast into brighton and through remainder of interchange passing under ramp connecting i 490 west to i 590 south csx transportation owned rochester subdivision and ramps from ny 590 south to i 490 in succession before widening to six lanes and turning northward ahead of a diamond interchange with blossom road once designated as ny 286a between blossom road and ny 286 browncroft boulevard ny 590 slowly turns to northwest passing through densely populated neighborhoods located adjacent to rochester brighton boundary it reaches city line and reenters rochester upon meeting ny 286 lone portion of ny 590 within city of rochester runs due north south acting as a divider between residential neighborhoods to west and irondequoit creek valley much of which is part of ellison park to east little more than a half mile after entering city ny 590 exits city and enters neighboring town of irondequoit here freeway turns to northwest to avoid area surrounding intersection of north winton road and ny 404 empire boulevard after passing under north winton road ny 590 resumes its northward trek and connects to ny 404 by way of a modified cloverleaf interchange expressway continues onward separating a large residential area from irondequoit bay park west as it progresses toward a northbound only exit with norton street one half mile to north of norton ny 590 meets ny 104 via a large interchange thumb current northern terminus of ny 590 at titus avenue due to terrain surrounding interchange and location of irondequoit bay bridge ny 104 is forced to run parallel to ny 590 for a short distance between keeler street expressway and ny 590 s next exit a diamond interchange connecting to east ridge road through this stretch ny 590 now just four lanes wide runs in between ny 104 westbound and ny 104 eastbound at east ridge road ny 104 turns to northeast to cross irondequoit bay while ny 590 continues north through residential areas toward sea breeze road has an at grade intersection with sunrise crescent a private residential street before meeting titus avenue at a roundabout that serves as ny 590 s northern terminus past this point right of way of ny 590 continues north to culver road at lake ontario shoreline as a divided two lane street named sea breeze drive traveling southbound on ny 590 two significant movements are restricted due to composition of expressway one is at blossom road in brighton where traffic entering ny 590 southbound cannot access i 490 due to location of exit 5 left exit flyover which begins north of blossom road onramp this movement was possible prior to reconstruction of can of worms as original connection point between sea breeze expressway and i 490 was south of blossom road interchange in irondequoit there are no southbound exits between east ridge road and ny 404 thus there is no access to either ny 104 or norton street an access road between ny 590 at titus avenue and irondequoit bay bridge was planned to provide access from ny 590 southbound to ny 104 eastbound and from ny 104 westbound to ny 590 northbound but it was never completed history construction and designation origins of ny 590 date back to start of 1950s when work first began on sea breeze expressway a part divided highway part limited access highway that extended from rochester north to lake ontario shoreline at sea breeze highway was built in stages from north to south with first section a divided highway connecting culver road to east ridge road in irondequoit opening to traffic in early 1950s as a realignment of ny 18 northern end of roadway was situated just west of irondequoit bay outlet where irondequoit bay meets lake ontario construction on next segment a limited access extension south to empire boulevard u s route 104 or us 104 began in mid 1950s new roadway was completed in late 1950s at which time it became part of a rerouted us 104 thumb left march 2008 photo of original northern terminus of ny 590 at culver road by 1960 construction was underway on final piece a second extension south to eastern expressway i 490 in eastern rochester under construction highway generally paralleled winton road then designated as part of ny 47 new extension was completed but went unnumbered until when ny 47 was realigned north of blossom road to follow expressway north to empire boulevard interchange where it ended at us 104 remainder of sea breeze expressway from i 490 to blossom road became part of ny 47 following completion of what is now i 590 from can of worms to elmwood avenue from 1970 to 1980 sea breeze expressway underwent a series of designation changes on january 1 1970 ny 47 was extended northward to encompass entirety of sea breeze expressway change resulted in overlaps with us 104 from empire boulevard to new keeler street expressway which was built south of ridge road in late 1960s as a realignment of us 104 and ny 18 from east ridge road to culver road from where ny 18 continued east along lake road to webster both overlaps proved to be temporary us 104 was realigned to cross irondequoit bay on irondequoit bay bridge while ny 18 was truncated to end in rochester s kodak park in late 1970s state of new york submitted a proposal to american association of state highway and transportation officials that would substantially alter how outer loop was numbered as part of plan ny 47 designation would be eliminated while most of northeastern section of outer loop from i 490 in rochester to ny 104 former us 104 to irondequoit would become northernmost part of i 590 a replacement designation for ny 47 north of ny 104 was not named at time most of proposed changes took effect on march 18 1980 when ny 47 was eliminated however i 590 was modified to end at its junction with i 490 in its place rochester irondequoit leg of outer loop was assigned ny 590 which continued north to sea breeze over former ny 47 sea breeze drive project origins in 1995 irondequoit town supervisor david schantz proposed idea of converting portion of ny 590 north of titus avenue into a parkway that would serve as a gateway into irondequoit he presented idea to jim walsh united states representative representing irondequoit who later secured 8 million from federal government for project another 4 5 million of funding was also devoted to project from state of new york planning for project began in mid 2004 in late 2006 town board chose a configuration calling for number of lanes on ny 590 to be reduced to two and for four intersections to be replaced with roundabouts as its preferred alternative final project design was presented on february 6 2008 in last of five public meetings on project under plan section of ny 590 north of titus avenue would be reduced to a two lane parkway and named sea breeze drive its signalized intersections with titus avenue durand boulevard and seneca and point pleasant roads would be converted into roundabouts as part of reconstruction also portion of ny 590 north of durand boulevard would be realigned to meet culver road at a new intersection farther west along lakeshore realignment would open up of waterfront land along shore of irondequoit bay that had previously been occupied by expressway town of irondequoit would then acquire former right of way of ny 590 from state of new york for future recreational uses in a transaction that would officially cost town 1 public opinion on proposed project was split many residents supported project stating it would improve safety of highway however others believed that reduction in lanes would result in increased traffic on culver road which runs parallel to ny 590 through irondequoit and that roundabouts would make navigating highway difficult construction on july 15 2008 town of irondequoit let a 12 8 million contract for sea breeze drive project a mark that was within 14 million accumulated in funding by this time ground was officially broken on project on july 28 as part of a ceremony attended by several rochester area dignitaries among those present were jim walsh and david schantz both of whom played large roles in making project a reality corridor was subsequently reduced to two lanes as southbound lanes of ny 590 were reconfigured to handle both directions of traffic while work ensued on permanently narrowing northbound lanes to a single lane northbound traffic on ny 590 was realigned to use new northbound lane on august 17 2009 first two of roundabouts to reach operational status were those at point pleasant road and durand boulevard point pleasant road roundabout opened to traffic on september 8 2009 by which time durand boulevard roundabout was also ready for use titus avenue roundabout was completed in late 2009 while work on seneca road junction was delayed until october 2009 due to proximity of intersection to side of hill overlooking irondequoit bay although original plans for project had already accounted for issue plans had to be revised to comply with new federal standards regarding use of steel pilings for supporting hillside work on roundabout finally began on october 12 seneca road roundabout and new alignment of sea breeze drive north of durand boulevard were completed in first half of 2010 thumb sea breeze drive at durand boulevard completion date for project dubbed largest public works project ever done in town of irondequoit by then town supervisor mary ellen heyman was pushed back several times it was originally set for may 2010 but was subsequently pushed back to late august or early september it was finally completed in october 2010 with installation of a decorative ship mast structure at durand boulevard roundabout following project s completion ny 590 was truncated to titus avenue and ownership and maintenance of sea breeze drive was transferred to town of irondequoit according to new york state department of transportation nysdot official rick papaj state turned sea breeze drive over to town because portion of ny 590 north of titus avenue had low traffic volumes and was situated in a residential area papaj added portion of ny 590 north of titus avenue didn t make sense to us anymore 590 effectively ends at route 104 exit list see also interstate 590 for exits 1 4 references external links 590 category transportation in rochester new york category limited
