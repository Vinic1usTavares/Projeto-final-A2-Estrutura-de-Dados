aliso creek is a long mostly urban stream in south orange county california originating in cleveland national forest in santa ana mountains it flows generally southwest and empties into pacific ocean at laguna beach creek s watershed drains and it is joined by seven main tributaries as of 2018 watershed had a population of 144 000 divided among seven incorporated cities aliso creek flows over highly erosive marine sedimentary rock of late eocene to pliocene age what would become aliso creek watershed originally lay at bottom of pacific ocean before being uplifted as recently as 10 million years ago about 1 2 million years ago san joaquin hills began to uplift in path of aliso creek occasionally swollen by wetter climates during glacial periods creek carved deep water gap known today as aliso canyon main feature of aliso and wood canyons wilderness park historically aliso creek served as boundary between juaneno and tongva native americans spanish explorers and missionaries reached area in 1700s and established mission san juan capistrano whose lands included part of aliso creek watershed in 1840s watershed was divided between several mexican land grants after california became part of united states ranchos were gradually partitioned and sold off to farmers and settlers starting in 1950s real estate companies acquired most of land for development by 21st century more than 70 percent of aliso creek watershed was urbanized most of creek s course has been channelized or otherwise impacted by development pollution and erosion from urban runoff have become chronic issues however parts of creek remain free flowing and provide important regional wildlife habitat especially in aliso canyon section creek has recently been focus of projects to restore stream channel and improve water quality etymology first recorded use of name aliso was for rancho canada de los alisos mexican land grant in 1841 rancho area was renamed el toro sometime before 1900 but name aliso creek persisted gudde and bright p 8 word aliso means alder in spanish and refers to riparian forests that historically occurred along creek california sycamore platanus racemosa is also known as aliso in spanish and is common in area around creek according to u s geological survey s geographic names information system creek has also been historically called los alisos creek and alisos creek

lower aliso canyon significant flow only occurred in rainy months of november through march as recently as 1982 creek was observed to be dry in summer as of 2012 urban runoff contributed a dry season flow of 5 million gallons 20 000 m3 per day or approximately at creek s mouth urban runoff accounts for at least 80 percent of creek s dry season flow united states geological survey operated a stream gage on creek at el toro road bridge in mission viejo from 1930 to 1980 this gage measured runoff from or 26 percent of watershed area there was also a gauge in laguna beach which measured runoff from entire watershed but it operated only from 1982 to 1987 average annual flow at el toro was ranging from in february to in july highest peak flow was on february 24 1969 at laguna beach gage average annual flow was with a high of in march and a low of in june largest flow recorded at laguna beach gauge was during el nino event on march 1 1983 urbanization is main cause of increased winter

million years ago san joaquin hills along orange county coast began their uplift along san joaquin hills blind thrust fault which extends south from los angeles basin hills rose directly in path of aliso creek which cut a water gap through range forming aliso canyon uplift also diverted sulphur creek which originally flowed south into salt creek to turn north and join aliso creek during last glacial period 110 000 to 10 000 years ago especially in wisconsinian glaciation 31 000 to 10 000 years ago climate of southern california became periodically much wetter with a climate similar to present day pacific northwest at these times aliso creek was a river carrying much more water than it does today during glacial periods sea level was as much as lower increasing stream gradient and thus its erosive force these factors led to aliso creek carving out a much larger series of valleys than would appear possible with its present day volume as sea levels rose after wisconsinian glaciation aliso canyon became a long narrow bay over thousands of years aliso creek filled in bay with sediment creating flat alluvial valley floor seen today while creek itself remains as an stream ecology plants before urbanization of watershed aliso creek and some of its tributaries supported a significant riparian zone dominated by native hardwoods such as coast live oak sycamore alder cottonwood and arroyo willow many of trees in aliso creek s riparian zone especially near mouth of creek were cut down in spanish mission period to construct colonial settlements during early 20th century groundwater withdrawal for agriculture killed off many of remaining trees along creek most significant remaining riparian habitat today occurs in aliso and wood canyons and along uppermost headwaters of aliso creek increased erosion and pollution caused by urban runoff have had adverse impacts on riparian zone invasive plants including tobacco tree castor bean pampas grass periwinkle and artichoke thistle but most notably giant reed have in many places replaced native trees giant reed was originally planted in 1970s to control erosion these invasive species are most prevalent along upper sulphur creek lower half of aliso creek and wood canyon creek hilly terrain of watershed supports mostly grassland and coastal scrub vegetation native shrub species present in watershed include california california buckwheat california sagebrush california coyote brush and mule fat like riparian zones native grassland and shrublands have been heavily impacted by invasive species a 2009 survey conducted in aliso creek watershed found non native grass coverage of between 66 and 100 percent and non native shrub coverage of between 0 and 50 percent across fourteen sample sites animals mountain lions bobcats mule deer gray fox and other large mammals once ranged throughout aliso creek watershed today they are mostly confined to wilderness reserves in santa ana mountains cleveland national forest and san joaquin hills aliso wood canyons laguna coast wilderness most large mammal populations in aliso wood canyons area are considered at risk of extirpation by 2040s in absence of extensive habitat restoration mountain lions have already disappeared from aliso wood canyons although most of creek channel is tightly bound by urban development it is considered a potential wildlife corridor between these two areas u s army corps of engineers describes corridor as meager at best with several places where aliso creek is very narrow concrete or incorporates golf courses parks and school grounds watershed supports multiple native bird species including california least tern least bell s vireo southwestern willow flycatcher california and western snowy plover loss of riparian zones has reduced bird habitat in watershed these species are mostly found in undeveloped areas of aliso and wood canyons upper reaches of aliso creek and some parts of english canyon creek aliso canyon is one of most diverse bird habitats in orange county with some 122 nesting and migratory species found there canyon also has raptors including northern harrier cooper s hawk golden eagle and peregrine falcon creek has several species of amphibians and reptiles species of concern listed by state of california include coastal range newt orange throated whiptail coastal western whiptail coast horned lizard california legless lizard and two striped garter snake native frogs and arroyo toad once inhabited creek but they were extirpated by damage to channel following floods in 1983 non native bullfrogs have been introduced to parts of creek threatened southwestern pond turtle only indigenous turtle species to orange county is also found in creek fish and amphibians thumb left alt a long silver and gray fish steelhead trout existed in aliso creek and likely inhabited creek within recorded history as recently as 1972 although many fish species were once found in aliso creek only remaining one is introduced common carp which can tolerate low oxygen levels and high temperatures typical of creek water aside from carp several other native and introduced fish species were found in creek until 1980s including mosquito fish bluegill bass and channel catfish after flooding exacerbated by urban runoff destroyed much of remaining riparian habitat these species were reported to have disappeared from area historical presence of endangered steelhead trout oncorhynchus mykiss in aliso creek has been debated until 2006 national marine fisheries service nmfs stated that there was no evidence of historical or extant of o mykiss in anadromous waters in aliso creek however a 1998 study co authored by u s army corps of engineers and us fish wildlife service declared that steelhead had inhabited creek until 1970s when increased urbanization resulted in poor water quality conditions pollution and low oxygen levels that drove fish out in 2009 after years of petitioning from local residents and environmental groups including friends of aliso creek steelhead and clean water now nmfs recognized lower of aliso creek as former steelhead habitat and creek was added to distinct population segment list under jurisdictional domain of noaa national marine fisheries service technical memorandum 394 steelhead of south central southern california coast population characterization for recovery planning 2006 it is now considered a candidate for re colonization evidence cited included native american acjachemen accounts of takings as well as anglers who reported taking steelhead trout in 1960s and 1970s from aliso creek s estuary and aliso canyon before suburban development began last reported observation of steelhead in aliso creek was in 1972 in 1970s a large population of threatened tidewater goby 10 000 15 000 was documented in aliso creek estuary species has declined significantly since then due to pollution and reduction of its habitat in 2011 u

large valley between arid chaparral covered hills opening towards ocean aliso canyon once formed part of boundary between acjachemen and tongva lands aliso creek historically served as a boundary between tongva native americans in north and acjachemen sometimes grouped with larger in south tongva s territory extended north past santa ana river and san gabriel river into present day los angeles county while acjachemen s smaller territory extended from aliso creek south past san juan creek and to vicinity of san mateo creek in present day san diego county availability of perennial water in some parts of creek made it an attractive location for native americans to camp hunt gather and fish numerous oak groves along creek provided an abundant supply of acorns a staple of their diet about 70 archaeological sites have been discovered along creek with 33 on northwest side and 47 on southeast side an acjachemen village situated near confluence of aliso creek and sulphur creek was named possibly meaning a large spring in luiseno language placement of tribal boundary at aliso creek has been disputed as usual practice among indigenous peoples of this region was to claim watershed divides rather than stream channels as boundaries constance cameron challenged this view in paper aliso creek great divide 1974 presented to southern california academy of sciences arguing that boundary lay north of aliso creek and that entire stream lay within acjachemen land d earle 1992 further stated that there is some evidence that gabrielino tongva territory may have extended only as far south as tustin plain a location about north of aliso creek this contradicts generally accepted theory originated by alfred l kroeber 1925 who stated that juaneno acjachemen place names do not extend north of aliso creek master key 1956 by bernice eastman johnson and first 1996 by w mccawley also place boundary at aliso creek spanish exploration and colonization on july 24 1769 spanish portola expedition led by gaspar de portola traveling north from san diego reached a stream which fray joan crespi described as alisos creek which was actually arroyo trabuco they camped there for two days before continuing on and crossing what is now known as aliso creek where they found wild grapes and roses in abundance on july 26 crespi wrote in his diary so we went on over very open country with hills and broad mesas ascending and descending through three or four little valleys of good soil well grown with alders he also wrote of local acjachemen people they came without arms and with a friendliness unequaled they made us presents of their poor seeds and we made return with ribbons and these first explorers were soon followed by franciscan missionaries who established mission san juan capistrano in 1776 near main population center of acjachemen people on san juan creek about east of mouth of aliso creek spanish referred to acjachemen as juaneno and to tongva as gabrielino after further away mission san gabriel arcangel aliso creek watershed was part of vast land holdings of mission san juan capistrano el camino real king s highway connecting coastal missions in california crossed aliso creek in vicinity of el toro today s lake forest spanish established rancheria niguel in what is now city of aliso viejo and grazed their cattle there most of native americans were relocated to mission where they were forced into agricultural labor and converted to spanish catholicism in order to provide timber for spanish settlements most of riparian forests around aliso creek were heavily logged it was said that trees near mouth of aliso canyon were especially tall and there were accounts of spanish ships mooring in large bay at outlet of aliso canyon and men going ashore to chop down and take away these trees for constructing mission buildings ships and other structures mexican land grants thumb right jose serrano adobe in lake forest is one of several

province and secularized missions in 1830s former mission lands were divided into private land grants in 1842 don juan avila received rancho niguel grant name of rancho was derived from original rancheria niguel which in turn received its name from acjachemen village that once stood nearby rancho niguel included portion of aliso creek watershed stretching from what is now i 5 nearly to pacific as well as significant areas of land on either side don juan became known as el rico for his wealth and hospitality he made a fortune driving beef cattle up to northern california after gold rush started in 1848 hospitality of avila s were legendary in 1846 and 1847 generals fremont and kearny as well as commodore stockton were said to have been entertained general andreas pico and last two mexican governors pio pico and jose maria flores were also welcome visitors there was always music and plenty of food whenever provisions ran low locals knew that they could always count of generosity of don juan rancho canada de los alisos translated as valley of alders or valley of sycamores encompassing northern half of aliso creek watershed including what would become el toro was granted to don jose antonio fernando serrano don juan s brother in law in 1842 1846 armor p 509 nearly rancho would come to feature large tracts of grazing land as well as vineyards orchards and

thurston and their eight children who converted land surrounding creek into orchards and vegetable gardens and later helped establish a public campground at aliso beach in 1914 most of thurston family left for santa ana though their son joe stayed until selling land in 1921 it served as a girl scout camp for several years before laguna beach country club precursor of present day hotel and golf course was built in 1950 after severe drought of 1863 64 in which thousands of cattle died don jose serrano was forced to sell rancho canada de los alisos to j s slauson a los angeles banker ranch passed through several owners before being acquired by dwight whiting in 1884 whiting heavily promoted settlement of area calling it aliso city name el toro of unclear origin though it had been in use since 1838 was used after u s postal service declined name aliso for a post office citing that it was too similar to alviso gudde and bright p 397 he granted a right of way to california southern railroad company and even traveled to england to encourage gentleman farmers to come to el toro to raise oranges and walnuts surf line was extended through area in 1888 connecting los angeles to san diego via orange county by 1932 citrus and other fruit trees were main crops in el toro irrigated by wells sunk into shallow groundwater basins along aliso creek for similar reasons don juan avila sold rancho niguel in 1865 to john forster and property was eventually purchased by lewis moulton and jean pierre daguerre in 1895 daguerre was one of many basque immigrants who arrived in this part of orange county starting in 1870s introducing sheep ranching and crops of bean and barley to area moulton and daguerre purchased parts of adjoining ranches bringing total size of property to ranch remained under their ownership for approximately thirty eight years and moulton family continued to own it until 1960s cattle and sheep ranching and dryland farming continued on rancho niguel until mid 20th century urbanization and development in 1927 laguna beach became first city to be incorporated in aliso creek watershed and second in orange county wells were drilled into stream bed near its mouth and water was piped to homes in laguna beach however in 1928 aliso creek supply was discontinued due to undesirable quality of water caused by high chloride levels idea of using uncontaminated surface water from aliso creek was also considered but this would require construction of a large storage reservoir in 1934 an a j stead proposed to build a dam just above mouth of creek to store and provide a firm annual yield of of water lewis moulton filed a lawsuit as reservoir would flood part of rancho niguel but dam project was upheld in a hearing in 1936 however this dam was never built with exception of farming community of el toro rest of watershed remained largely unpopulated into 1950s in 1950s rancho niguel was sold off to real estate developers to build planned cities of laguna niguel aliso viejo and laguna hills with an undeveloped portion to south that would later become aliso and wood canyons wilderness park up until 1960s and 1970s barely 15 percent of watershed was urbanized but by 1990 after doubling rate of development in past two decades watershed was roughly 60 percent urbanized cities of mission viejo and laguna niguel were incorporated in 1988 and 1989 respectively in 1991 el toro incorporated as city of lake forest laguna hills also incorporated in 1991 and laguna woods in 1999 by early 21st century more than 70 percent of watershed was urbanized newest city in watershed aliso viejo was incorporated in 2001 flood control in early 1900s several significant floods wreaked havoc in southern california orange county flood control district was created by orange county flood control act of 1927 in response to some of these flooding events over following decades most streams in orange county were channelized with aliso creek being channelized to facilitate urban development starting in 1960s although some parts of aliso creek were completely lined with concrete it retains an earthen riverbed in most parts despite being confined to a narrow channel a major weakness in flood control system is at south end of aliso canyon where creek is confined by steep cliffs and aliso creek golf course this area has suffered severe flood damage several times in 20th century 1998 flood was largest on record it inundated aliso creek inn and golf course destroyed six footbridges across aliso creek and caused severe bank erosion in many places along creek thumb left alt a muddy flow of water drops over an artificial concrete waterfall from a tree lined riverbed to a riprap lined channel many drop structures exist in aliso creek riverbed to prevent erosion like most other coastal orange county streams watershed of aliso creek is now heavily urbanized with 70 percent of original land surface now underneath impermeable surfaces such as pavement and buildings far more runoff now enters creek during storm events greatly increasing risk of flooding several tributaries of aliso creek dairy fork aliso hills channel munger creek and other smaller ones have been replaced by storm drains parts of sulphur creek and english canyon creek have been channelized as well only tributary that closely resembles its natural condition is wood canyon creek although it is still affected considerably by urban runoff there are several facilities capable of storing floodwaters largest of which is laguna niguel lake formed by sulphur creek dam on sulphur creek sulphur creek dam completed in 1966 was built as an irrigation reservoir but was acquired by orange county flood control district in 1970 in addition there are two detention basins on main stem of aliso creek first is el toro detention basin an off stream basin in a portion of heroes park in lake forest and second is on stream pacific park detention basin in aliso viejo there are also detention basins constructed on upper wood canyon creek dairy fork and english canyon creek nineteen drop structures have been constructed on aliso creek to mitigate damaging erosion caused by increased flooding many of these structures were constructed in response to a 1969 flood that caused 1 million of damage along aliso creek while others were necessary to mitigate erosion caused by artificial straightening of stream channel in one of largest such projects at aliso creek road creek was realigned in an excavated channel through a ridge in order to accommodate construction of chet federal building and alicia parkway because this shortened stream channel by about and increased its gradient two drop structures were constructed to prevent creek from eroding upstream environmental

frequently exceeds bacterial limits set by california law at aliso beach creek water is considered unsafe for swimming 99 percent of time contact with seawater at beach is discouraged for 72 hours 3 days after a major storm event creek contains elevated levels of e coli phosphorus nitrogen and selenium which comes mainly from heavy application of fertilizer and manure and other organic pollutants in urban runoff high water temperatures sometimes exceeding in summer promote growth of bacteria as well as algae blooms leading to eutrophication runoff of chlorine oils and heavy metals mainly caused by irrigation and car washing have killed off most fish and shrimp species in creek with exception of carp los angeles times reported in 1997 that county health officials acknowledge that bacterial count at mouth of creek which curls into a warm water stagnant pond that flushes out onto beach is at times alarmingly high often surpassing legal limit for california as a result area where creek meets sea and creek itself are considered permanently off limits to swimmers and bear prominent signs that warn of dangers of trespassing into such toxic waters nevertheless people do almost daily officials from orange county environmental health department say that skin rashes infections pink eye and other assorted ailments are not uncommon to those who use aliso beach and unwittingly come in contact with creek and its invisible bacteria urbanization has also changed sediment transport in creek obstruction of natural sediment sources and increased water flow due to urban runoff has caused significant downcutting in river bed creek has eroded to depths exceeding below its original bed in some areas disconnecting creek from its natural floodplain and riparian zones in 2017 u s army corps of engineers reported that 5 million of damage had been caused by erosion along lower aliso creek this includes physical damage to creek banks bridges roads and water pipelines landslides have occurred along creek and its tributaries including at english canyon in 1990s creek is estimated to deliver 20 000 60 000 tons of sediment to sea in an average year and as much as 200 000 tons in wet years south orange county wastewater authority socwa coastal treatment plant is located next to aliso creek in laguna beach and treats about 2 9 million gallons 11 million litres of sewage each day treated wastewater is discharged into pacific ocean about offshore from aliso beach via aliso creek ocean outfall a pipeline carrying raw sewage downstream to treatment plant and two pipelines carrying treated sludge back upstream to socwa s regional treatment plant in laguna niguel for recycling are buried roughly parallel to creek within aliso canyon and have been frequently threatened by flooding and erosion sewage spills have occasionally entered creek forcing closure of aliso beach in 2016 california coastal commission approved a project to replace two treated sludge lines which had deteriorated extensively over last 30 years restoration projects there have been several attempts to clean up creek stabilize its banks and restore native habitat one of earlier projects was aliso creek wildlife habitat enhancement project acwhep conceived and jointly funded by county of orange and mission viejo company mitigation banking theory and practice p 251 and intended to rehabilitate of former riparian areas that were dried up due to downcutting of stream channel a high concrete dam was built about downstream of aliso creek road inside aliso canyon to increase water level so that riparian area could be restored due to poor design as well as storm damage from 1998 flooding dam ended up causing further erosion of creek downstream due to rapid flow of water cascading over structure and project was abandoned dam is now considered a failure risk and must be periodically grouted to maintain its stability thumb right map of aliso creek mainstem ecosystem restoration project in 2006 u s army corps of engineers began studies for aliso creek mainstem ecosystem restoration project which aims to control erosion and restore riparian habitat along lower of creek downstream of pacific park drive as well as short stretches of lower wood canyon and sulphur creeks project would remove existing drop structures and barriers along this section of creek and construct 47 low rock riffles to maintain a constant gradient parts of creek prone to erosion would be realigned to slow down water velocity and creek banks in several places would be stabilized with buried concrete walls a total of of riparian areas would be reconnected to creek s floodplain all non native plant species would be removed as of 2017 this project had an estimated cost of 91 to 99 million usace project has been criticized for its potential large impacts on aliso and wood canyons wilderness park as it would require extensive re grading of stream channel and banks with of excavations and more than of fill in addition many of proposed structures are intended to protect sewer lines along aliso creek in aliso canyon rather than for environmental restoration sierra club has advocated for closure of coastal treatment plant in aliso canyon and for wastewater to be recycled or treated at nearby j b latham plant instead which would significantly reduce cost of aliso creek restoration
