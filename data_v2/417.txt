epsom began early on 26 june with units of 15th scottish infantry division advancing behind a rolling artillery barrage air cover was sporadic for much of operation because poor weather in england forced last minute cancellation of bomber support accompanied by 31st tank brigade 15th scottish division made steady progress and by end of first day had overrun much of german outpost line although some difficulties remained in securing flanks in mutually costly fighting over following two days a foothold was secured across river odon and efforts were made to expand this by capturing tactically valuable points around salient and moving up 43rd wessex infantry division by 30 june after german counter attacks some of british forces across river were withdrawn and captured ground consolidated

were stopped by secondary positions in front of rauray and on high ground to south east although some troops penetrated as far as haut du bosq further german attacks throughout day were met with intense artillery fire and made no progress in early evening a british counter attack with sherman and flame throwing churchill crocodile tanks restored original front line attacks were costly for both sides thirty german tanks were claimed destroyed mostly by 49th west riding infantry division troops of 12th ss panzer division had been repulsed during morning and artillery fire halted attacks from other formations aftermath analysis having had to commit his last strategic reserves to contain british offensive on 29 june rommel requested permission from hitler to allow 7th army to begin a fighting withdrawal towards river seine a move which would be mirrored by german forces in southern france to form a new front line along seine towards swiss border this was partially endorsed by hausser who on 30 june proposed a retirement from caen encouraged by fighting in valley of odon hitler stated that we must not allow mobile warfare to develop committing his troops in normandy to a policy of aggressive and unyielding defence wilmot pp 346 347 on 2 july british patrols produced first evidence of this reporting that south of odon germans were digging in aerial photographs taken two days later showed large numbers of newly dug weapon positions and by 8 july german forces facing viii corps had entrenched themselves jackson p 59 some local adjustments occurred as both sides sought to improve their tactical position and 12th ss panzer division captured fontaine etoupefour on 2 july clark pp 101 102 thumb viii corps in battle for first time had broken through elaborate german defensive positions and advanced nearly by throwing in their last reserves germans had been able to achieve a defensive success at operational level by containing british offensive hart p 108 more than 4 000 casualties were inflicted upon british but effort cost germans more than 3 000 men jackson pp 37 40 44 53 55 pp 107 109 german commanders had been forced to commit their armoured reserves piecemeal to meet threats as they developed counter attacking at a disadvantage williams p 123 over tanks were destroyed organisation of remaining forces was disrupted and their offensive power much reduced with few infantry divisions to relieve them panzer divisions were forced to remain in front line rather than pulling back into reserve to recover williams p 124 operation epsom has been analysed by many military historians and commentators s a hart wrote in 2007 that post war publication of memoirs by allied generals led to disputes along national lines during 1950s and 1960s with american historians generally critical of montgomery and actions of anglo canadian forces while pro montgomery historians set out to refute these criticisms also published during this period were national official campaign histories which were thoroughly researched but avoided detailed critical analysis of controversies during 1980s revisionist writers concentrated on perceived deficiencies of allies and since late 1990s two schools of thought have been revising revisionists some expanding on revisionist work by providing a more detailed campaign analysis and those who have tried to show that techniques employed by anglo canadian forces were appropriate to conditions in normandy hart pp 16 17 in 1983 carlo d este wrote that most logical place for a british attack would have been out of orne bridgehead on extreme eastern flank of allied lodgement d este 1983 p 233 an attack there had been rejected by montgomery dempsey and o connor as unrealistic some writers described intent of epsom as an attack to gain ground while others have suggested that operation had other objectives in 2004 williams wrote that due to ultra intercepts montgomery was aware of rommel s plan to attack towards bayeux and that epsom was intended to forestall it wilmot in 1952 wrote that operation was intended to draw i ss panzer corps and newly arrived ii ss panzer corps into battle around caen hart wrote that montgomery wanted to keep initiative and prevent german armoured forces from moving from to west against us first army or being relieved and forming a reserve wilmot p 342 arrival of ii ss panzer corps was a catalyst for operation epsom which retaining initiative by forcing german command to use ii ss panzer corps against viii corps hastings wrote in 1985 that no sane commander would mount an attack as big as epsom without every hope of breaking through german defences or at least of causing enemy to make substantial withdrawals hastings p 171 d este wrote that no amount of pretence can conceal that real object had been a short pincer movement to outflank caen d este p 245 lloyd clark wrote on battlefield epsom ended rather ignominiously in a sort of draw and that judging effects of operation epsom is hampered by disagreement about montgomery s intent in written orders montgomery required an advance across orne river and capture of high ground south of caen which was not achieved clark wrote that there were implicit objectives with strategic implications more important than capture of ground clark pp 100 104 in 1971 ambrose wrote of epsom veering off course from plan and d este wrote that epsom was an operation of immense intentions which were not attained calling it a dismal failure ambrose p 428 in 2004 trew and badsey wrote of british failure that it took most of six panzer divisions to stop epsom short of its final objectives and reynolds in 2002 wrote that without commitment of these six divisions it was highly likely that british offensive would have achieved its goals trew p p 31 daglish in 2007 wrote that while original concept of epsom had failed offensive was a strategic success daglish pp 218 219 by withdrawing 11th armoured division across odon and then into reserve 21st army group had re created threat of an offensive near caen by end of june all german armoured forces in normandy were concentrated on second army front wilmot p p p 53 shulman had written in 1947 that with defeat of its second armoured counter attack in june german command had thrown away its most effective troops and reynolds wrote that while operation was costly for british it caused grievous losses to germans shulman pp 132 p 33 in viii corps history published in 1945 jackson wrote that epsom failed in its overt goal but that when seen as part of montgomery s series of rapid and consecutive blows against german army in normandy importance of epsom becomes more apparent and there is little doubt that it did play a significant part in allies eventual success in region jackson p 114 d este wrote that losses inflicted on german army were purely in terms of men and material copp in 2003 wrote that too much emphasis had been given to a win lose criterion whereas a cost benefit approach provided more insight buckley editor p 18 copp describing standard german practice of counter attacking when driven from a position copp wrote that germans courted losses that could not be readily replaced one such counter attack on 22 july resulted in regaining control of bon evrecy road a clear victory in a win lose narrative but a typical german defeat in any cost benefit analysis in 2013 buckley wrote that by 1 july there was a stalemate in which british were established south of odon but had retired from hill 112 in what may have been a premature decision germans had maintained a continuous front but only by using reserves which made it impossible to begin counter offensive planned by which made offensive a considerable allied success as part of a strategy of attrition based on organised fire power looked on as an attempt to break through and force germans out of caen operation failed but in terms of montgomery s strategy it was a costly victory german defence of normandy never recovered from damage inflicted during epsom initiative was lost and german counter attack tactics failed in face of allied fire power with even greater cost than that inflicted on british german command structure and assumptions on which defence was based were undermined buckley 2013 pp 86 87 casualties clark wrote that casualties in 15th scottish infantry division were and from buckley gave casualties for division as killed casualties incurred from 1945 and that other units in operation had buckley p 87 losses among 11th armoured division and 43rd wessex infantry division were killed in 11th armoured division no figures are provided for 49th west riding infantry division 51st highland infantry division or 8th armoured

static defence led to disputes in german high command on evening of 1 july in a conversation with wilhelm keitel rundstedt said make peace you fools shortly afterwards gunther von kluge replaced him as commander in chief west due to his disagreements with hitler over how campaign should be conducted schweppenburg was replaced by heinrich eberbach as commander of panzer group west during lull both sides made changes to their dispositions 53rd welsh infantry division relieved 15th scottish infantry division in west of british salient while 43rd wessex infantry division relieved infantry of 11th armoured division who were still holding odon bridgehead clark p p 60 germans moved up 277th infantry division which began to relieve 9th ss panzer division and battle group of 2nd ss panzer division
