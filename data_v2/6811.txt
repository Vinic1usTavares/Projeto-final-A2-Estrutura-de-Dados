thumb 300px telephone cable containing multiple twisted pair lines primary line constants are parameters that describe characteristics of conductive transmission lines such as pairs of copper wires in terms of physical electrical properties of line primary line constants are only relevant to transmission lines and are to be contrasted with secondary line constants which can be derived from them and are more generally applicable secondary line constants can be used for instance to compare characteristics of a waveguide to a copper line whereas primary constants have no meaning for a waveguide constants are conductor resistance and inductance and insulator capacitance and conductance which are by convention given symbols r l c and g respectively constants are enumerated in terms of per unit length circuit representation of these elements requires a distributed element model and consequently calculus must be used to analyse circuit analysis yields a system of two first order simultaneous linear partial differential equations which may be combined to derive secondary constants of characteristic impedance and propagation constant a number of special cases have particularly simple solutions and important practical applications low loss cable requires only l and c to be included in analysis useful for short lengths of cable low frequency applications such as twisted pair telephone lines are dominated by r and c only high frequency applications such as rf co axial cable are dominated by l and c lines loaded to prevent distortion need all four elements in analysis but have a simple elegant solution constants there are four primary line constants but in some circumstances some of them are small enough to be ignored and analysis can be simplified these four and their symbols and units are as follows per per minsulator per minsulator per metres m r and l are elements in series with line because they are properties of conductor and c and g are elements shunting line because they are properties of dielectric material between conductors g represents leakage current through dielectric and in most cables is very small word loop is used to emphasise that resistance and inductance of both conductors must be taken into account for instance if a line consists of two identical wires that have a resistance of 25 mo m each loop resistance is double that 50 mo m because values of constants are quite small it is common for manufacturers to quote them per kilometre rather than per metre in english speaking world per mile can also be used connor p 8 bird pp 604 605 word constant can be misleading it means that they are material constants but they may vary with frequency in particular r is heavily influenced by skin effect furthermore while g has virtually no effect at audio frequency it can cause noticeable losses at high frequency with many of dielectric materials used in cables due to a high loss tangent avoiding losses caused by g is reason many cables designed for use at uhf are air insulated or foam insulated which makes them virtually air insulated porges pp 223 224 actual meaning of constant in this context is that parameter is constant with distance that is line is assumed to be homogenous lengthwise this condition is true for vast majority of transmission lines in use today bird pp 502 503 519 typical values for some common cables o km

omit a value for inductance in their data sheets some of these values are estimated from figures for capacitance and characteristic impedance by circuit representation thumb 400px fig 1 equivalent circuit representation of a transmission line using distributed elements and are to be read as and respectively line constants cannot be simply represented as lumped elements in a circuit they must be described as distributed elements for instance pieces of capacitance are in between pieces of resistance however many pieces r and c are broken into it can always be argued they should be broken apart further to properly represent circuit and after each division number of meshes in circuit is increased this is shown in figure 1 to give a true representation of circuit elements must be made infinitesimally small so that each element is distributed along line infinitesimal elements in an infinitesimal distance are given by connor pp 8 10 thumb 300px fig 2 representation of a transmission line using generalised distributed impedance and admittance elements it is convenient for purposes of analysis to roll up these elements into general series impedance z and shunt admittance y elements such that and analysis of this network figure 2 will yield secondary line constants propagation constant whose real and imaginary parts are attenuation constant and phase change constant respectively and characteristic impedance which also in general will have real and imaginary parts making a total of four secondary constants to be derived from four primary constants term constant is even more misleading for secondary constants as they usually vary quite strongly with frequency even in an ideal situation where primary constants do not this is because in circuit and introduce a dependence on it is possible to choose specific values of primary constants that result in and being independent of heaviside condition but even in this case there is still which is directly proportional to as with primary constants meaning of constant is that secondary constants do not vary with distance along line not that they are independent of frequency hickman p 113 porges p 217 characteristic impedance thumb 250px fig 3 equivalent circuit of a transmission line for calculation of z0 from primary line constants characteristic impedance of a transmission line is defined as impedance looking into an infinitely long line such a line will never return a reflection since incident wave will never reach end to be reflected when considering a finite length of line remainder of line can be replaced by as its equivalent circuit this is so because remainder of line is still infinitely long and therefore equivalent to original line if finite segment is very short then in equivalent circuit it will be modelled by an l network consisting of one element of and one of remainder is given by this results in network shown in figure 3 which can be analysed for using usual network analysis theorems porges pp 216 217 connor pp 10 11 which re arranges to taking limits of both sides and since line was assumed to be homogenous lengthwise propagation constant thumb 400px fig 4 each infinitesimal section of transmission line causes an infinitesimal drop in line voltage as it is propagated along line integrating these drops enables propagation constant to be found ratio of line input voltage to voltage a distance further down line that is after one section of equivalent circuit is given by a standard voltage divider calculation remainder of line to right as in characteristic impedance calculation is replaced with connor pp 9 10 bird pp 609 611 each infinitesimal section will multiply voltage drop by same factor after sections voltage ratio will be at a distance along line number of sections is so that in limit as second order term will disappear in limit so we can write without loss of accuracy and comparing with mathematical identity yields from definition of propagation constant hence special cases ideal transmission line an ideal transmission line will have no loss which implies that resistive elements are zero it also results in a purely real resistive characteristic impedance ideal line cannot be realised in practice but it is a useful approximation in many circumstances this is especially true for instance when short pieces of line are being used as circuit components such as stubs a short line has very little loss and this can then be ignored and treated as an ideal line secondary constants in these circumstances are connor p 17 twisted pair typically twisted pair cable used for audio frequencies or low data rates has line constants dominated by r and c dielectric loss is usually negligible at these frequencies and g is close to zero it is also case that at a low enough frequency which means that l can also be ignored in those circumstances secondary constants become connor pp 18 19 attenuation of this cable type increases with frequency causing distortion of waveforms not so obviously variation of with frequency also causes a distortion of a type called dispersion to avoid dispersion requirement is that is directly proportional to however it is actually proportional to and dispersion results also varies with frequency and is also partly reactive both these features will be cause of reflections from a resistive line termination this is another undesirable effect nominal impedance quoted for this type of cable is in this case very nominal being valid at only one spot frequency usually quoted at 800 hz or 1 khz bird pp 612 613 porges p 219 co axial cable cable operated at a high enough frequency vhf radio frequency or high data rates will meet conditions and this must eventually be case as frequency is increased for any cable under those conditions r and g can both be ignored except for purpose of calculating cable loss and secondary constants become connor p 19 loaded line loaded lines are lines designed with deliberately increased inductance this is done by adding iron or some other magnetic metal to cable or adding coils purpose is to ensure that line meets heaviside condition which eliminates distortion caused by frequency dependent attenuation and dispersion and ensures that is constant and resistive secondary constants are here related to primary constants by connor pp 19 21 velocity velocity of propagation is given by since and then in cases where can be taken as velocity of propagation is given by lower capacitance higher velocity with an air dielectric cable which is approximated to with low loss
