extremely severe cyclonic storm nilofar was at time third strongest cyclone in arabian sea in late october 2014 it reached peak maximum sustained winds estimated between 205 km h 125 mph and 215 km h 130 mph india meteorological department imd named it nilofar name refers to water lily and was suggested by pakistan western fringes of storm caused flash flooding in northeastern oman killing four people nilofar originated from a low pressure area between india and arabian peninsula it developed into a depression on october 25 and moved generally northward through an area of favorable conditions system intensified into a cyclonic storm on october 26 quickly organizing due to conditions nilofar developed a well defined eye and structure attaining its peak intensity on october 28 at time nilofar was expected to make landfall in western india prompting evacuations and preparations however high wind shear caused storm to rapidly weaken and nilofar degraded into a remnant low pressure area on october 31 off indian state of gujarat meteorological history toward middle of october 2014 monsoon trough was active over arabian sea off west coast of india a circulation formed on october 19 near lakshadweep archipelago remaining nearly stationary for several days it developed a distinct low pressure area on october 21 and produced an intense area of convection by next day despite moderate wind shear conditions favored further development including warm water temperatures and good outflow amplified by an anticyclone to its east northeast structure became more organized by october 24 when broken rainbands were rotating around a poorly defined circulation that day american based joint typhoon warning center jtwc classified it as a tropical depression although agency did not issue warnings at time at 00 00 utc on october 25 india meteorological department imd classified system as a depression about 1270 km 790 mi southeast of muscat oman when system first formed it benefited from warm water temperatures of and a favorable phase of madden julian oscillation moderate wind shear and continued interaction with monsoon dislocated bulk of deepest convection to western periphery by 12 00 utc on october 25 system organized enough for jtwc to classify it as tropical cyclone 04a and there were hints of an eye feature within thunderstorms by time of classification storm was moving to northeast steered by subtropical ridge to south although motion slowed on october 26 due to competing influence of another subtropical ridge to northwest that day system strengthened quickly imd upgraded depression to a deep depression at 03 00 utc to cyclonic storm nilofar at 06 00 utc and further to a severe cyclonic storm at 21 00 utc at 00 00 utc on october 27 jtwc upgraded nilofar to equivalent of a minimal hurricane based on development of a 54 km 33 mi eye throughout that day cyclone turned more to northwest as a ridge built to east while inner core of convection became more symmetrical and compact also by that time tropical cyclone forecast models anticipated that nilofar would eventually recurve to northeast and make landfall in western india at 06 00 utc on october 27 imd upgraded nilofar to a very severe cyclonic storm storm was rapidly intensifying at time after wind shear had decreased and eye contracted to a diameter of 19 km 12 mi at 09 00 utc on october 28 imd upgraded nilofar further to an extremely severe cyclonic storm six hours later jtwc estimated peak 1 minute winds of 215 km h 130 mph at time agency anticipated further strengthening due to favorable conditions and good organization at 18 00 utc on october 28 imd estimated peak 3 minute winds of 205 km h 125 mph at time it was third strongest storm on record in arabian sea on october 29 nilofar started weakening due to increased wind shear and convection diminished in intensity at same time storm turned northeastward while rounding ridge to east increasingly cooler and drier air as well as cooler waters caused storm to degrade rapidly eye previously small and well defined dissipated by 06 00 utc on october 29 later that day center began decoupling from convection a sign of rapid weakening and by 21 00 utc imd downgraded it to a severe cyclonic storm early on october 30 jtwc downgraded nilofar to a tropical storm and subsequently circulation became exposed from convection at 18 00 utc that day jtwc posted their final advisory nilofar weakened further into a depression on october 31 and soon after degenerated into a remnant low off coast of indian state of gujarat preparations and impact thumb cyclone nilofar succumbing to strong wind shear on october 30 note part of low level circulation exposed on west side of central dense overcast offshore buoys recorded 3 2 m 10 5 ft waves and winds of 41 km h 25 mph outskirts of storm caused flash flooding in al rustaq in northeastern oman killing four people after a vehicle was swept away in a flooded wadi five people were rescued when another car was stranded amid floods west of al rustaq in storm s developmental stages outskirts of nilofar dropped of rainfall in margao goa helping state record its wettest october in four years other nearby areas along india s west coast received heavy rainfall threat of storm prompted officials to evacuate nearly 30 000 people in western india utilizing 200 storm shelters most of displaced people were living in thatched huts and weak structures in coastal areas schools were canceled for two days most of evacuees quickly returned home after storm weakened to minimize damage trees were trimmed down to eliminate damage due to falling debris and a total suspension of fishing activities was ordered with about 5 000 boats advised to return to port officials in gujarat sent a warning of storm to all operators of ham radios a distant warning signal 2 was hoisted in ports of kandla and national disaster response force deployed rescue and rehabilitation teams at dwarka porbandar veraval and bhuj while standby teams were stationed at ahmedabad and after facing problems during deadly floods in september and cyclone hudhud in october mobile companies enacted greater preparations during nilofar to guarantee operations during storm including an emergency hotline setting up internet in shelters and mobile cell towers despite threat from storm nilofar only produced light rainfall and gusty winds along gujarat coast unseasonable rainfall damaged mangoes in maharashtra causing prices to rise shifting air patterns brought cooler temperatures to western india signaling end of monsoon season while also bringing haze and smog over delhi from polluting areas to south in pakistan fishermen were also warned to avoid sea and people in coastal areas were evacuated country s navy coast guard maritime security agency and fishermen organizations helped rescue fishermen stationed offshore along coast of sindh province bathing and swimming were banned for several days there were minor power outages in karachi due to heavy rainfall from nilofar see also cyclone gonu strongest tropical cyclone on record in arabian sea cyclone
