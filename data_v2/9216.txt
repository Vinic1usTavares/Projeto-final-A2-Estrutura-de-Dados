historicity of to kill a mockingbird southern literary journal 32 2 p 1 style strongest element of style noted by critics and reviewers is lee s talent for narration which in an early review in time was called tactile brilliance writing a decade later another scholar noted harper lee has a remarkable gift of story telling her art is visual and with cinematographic fluidity and subtlety we see a scene melting into another scene without jolts of transition lee combines narrator s voice of a child observing her surroundings with a grown woman s reflecting on her childhood using ambiguity of this voice combined with narrative technique of flashback to play intricately with perspectives graeme dunphy meena s mockingbird from harper lee to meera syal 88 2004 637 660 pdf online this narrative method allows lee to tell a delightfully deceptive story that mixes simplicity of childhood observation with adult situations complicated by hidden motivations and unquestioned tradition ward l to kill a mockingbird book review commonwealth december 9 1960 however at times blending causes reviewers to question scout s preternatural vocabulary and depth of understanding both harding

story scholar jacqueline tavernier courbin states laughter exposes gangrene under beautiful surface but also by demeaning it one can hardly be controlled by what one is able to laugh at tavernier courbin jacqueline humor and humanity in to kill a mockingbird in on harper lee essays and reflections alice petry ed university of tennessee press 2007 scout s precocious observations about her neighbors and behavior inspired national endowment of arts director david kipen to call her hysterically funny murphy p 105 to address complex issues however tavernier courbin notes that lee uses parody satire and irony effectively by using a child s perspective after dill promises to marry her then spends too much time with jem scout reasons best way to get him to pay attention to her is to beat him up which she does several times lee p 46 scout s first day in school is a satirical treatment of education her teacher says she must undo damage atticus has wrought in teaching her to read and write and forbids atticus from teaching her further lee p 19 lee treats most unfunny situations with irony however as jem and scout try to understand how maycomb embraces racism and still tries sincerely to remain a decent society satire and irony are used to such an extent that tavernier courbin suggests one interpretation for book s title lee is doing mocking of education justice system and her own society by using them as subjects of her humorous disapproval critics also note entertaining methods used to drive plot cornell william five humors english journal 1999 88 4 p 66 when

laugh uproariously she is so distracted and embarrassed that she prefers to go home in her ham costume which saves her life lee p 297 genres scholars have characterized to kill a mockingbird as both a southern gothic and a bildungsroman grotesque and near supernatural qualities of boo radley and his house and element of racial injustice involving tom robinson contribute to aura of gothic in novel johnson boundaries pp 40 41 lee used term gothic to describe architecture of maycomb s courthouse and in regard to dill s exaggeratedly morbid performances as boo radley johnson boundaries pp 39 45 outsiders are also an important element of southern gothic texts and scout and jem s questions about hierarchy in town cause scholars to compare novel to catcher in rye and adventures of huckleberry finn murphy pp x 96 149 despite challenging town s systems scout reveres atticus as an authority above all others because he believes that following one s conscience is highest priority even when result is social ostracism fine laura structuring narrator s rebellion in to kill a mockingbird in on harper lee essays and reflections alice petry ed university of tennessee press 2007 however scholars debate about southern gothic classification noting that boo radley is in fact human protective and benevolent furthermore in addressing themes such as alcoholism incest rape and racial violence lee wrote about her small town realistically rather than melodramatically she portrays problems of individual characters as universal underlying issues in every society as children coming of age scout and jem face hard realities and learn from them lee seems to examine jem s sense of loss about how his neighbors have disappointed him more than scout s jem says to their neighbor miss maudie day after trial it s like bein a caterpillar wrapped in a cocoon i always thought maycomb folks were best folks in world least that s what they seemed like lee p 246 this leads him to struggle with understanding separations of race and class just as novel is an illustration of changes jem faces it is also an exploration of realities scout must face as an atypical girl on verge of womanhood as one scholar writes to kill a mockingbird can be read as a feminist bildungsroman for scout emerges from her childhood experiences with a clear sense of her place in her community and an awareness of her potential power as woman she will one day be themes despite novel s immense popularity upon publication it has not received close critical attention paid to other modern american classics don noble editor of a book of essays about novel estimates that ratio of sales to analytical essays may be a million to one christopher metress writes that book is an icon whose emotive sway remains strangely powerful because it also remains unexamined noble suggests it does not receive academic attention because of its consistent status as a best seller if that many people like it it can t be any good and that general readers seem to feel they do not require analytical interpretation noble pp vii viii harper lee had remained famously detached from interpreting novel since mid 1960s however she gave some insight into her themes when in a rare letter to editor she wrote in response to passionate reaction her book caused surely it is plain to simplest intelligence that to kill a mockingbird spells out in words of seldom more than two syllables a code of honor and conduct christian in its ethic that is heritage of all southerners harper lee twits school board in virginia for ban on her novel new york times january 6 1966 p 82 southern life and racial injustice when book was released reviewers noted that it was divided into two parts and opinion was mixed about lee s ability to connect them johnson boundaries pp 20 24 first part of novel concerns children s fascination with boo radley and their feelings of safety and comfort in neighborhood reviewers were generally charmed by scout and jem s observations of their quirky neighbors one writer was so impressed by lee s detailed explanations of people of maycomb that he categorized book as southern romantic regionalism erisman fred april 1973 romantic regionalism of harper lee alabama review 27 2 this sentimentalism can be seen in lee s representation of southern caste system to explain almost

december 1964 keen scalpel on racial ills english journal 51 9 pp 658 661 and narrator sets action and characters amid a finely detailed background of finch family history and history of maycomb this regionalist theme is further reflected in mayella ewell s apparent powerlessness to admit her advances toward tom robinson and scout s definition of fine folks being people with good sense who do best they can with what they have south itself with its traditions and taboos seems to drive plot more than characters second part of novel deals with what book reviewer harding lemay termed spirit

that denies humanity of tom robinson when atticus makes his summation to jury he literally bares himself to jury s and town s anger class in a 1964 interview lee remarked that her aspiration was to be

and you see it through no matter what lee p 128 charles j shields who wrote first book length biography of harper lee offers reason for novel s enduring popularity and impact is that its lessons of human dignity and respect for others remain fundamental and universal shields p 1 atticus lesson to scout that you never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view until you climb around in his skin and walk around in it exemplifies his compassion lee p 33 she ponders comment when listening to mayella ewell s testimony when mayella reacts with confusion to

be cherished metress christopher lee harper contemporary southern writers st james press 1999 last pages of book illustrate this as scout relates moral of a story atticus has been reading to her and

character deals with his or her own personal defeat lee builds a framework to judge whether characters are heroes or fools she guides reader in such judgments alternating between unabashed adoration and biting irony scout s experience with missionary society is an ironic juxtaposition of women who mock her gossip and reflect a smug colonialist attitude toward other races while giving appearance of gentility piety and morality conversely when atticus loses tom s case he is last to leave courtroom except for his children and black spectators in colored balcony who rise silently as he walks underneath them to honor his efforts lee p 241 reception despite her editors warnings that book might not sell well it quickly became a sensation bringing acclaim to lee in literary circles in her
