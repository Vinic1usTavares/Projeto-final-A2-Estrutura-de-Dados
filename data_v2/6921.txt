eventually re wrote jasmine into a stronger and more prominent heroine following elimination of aladdin s mother from script while borrowing story elements from romantic comedy roman holiday 1953 several months after securing role larkin was nearly fired from project because disney executive jeffrey katzenberg felt that her voice was not suitable for a princess but clements and musker managed to convince him otherwise discovered by casting director albert tavares lea salonga was cast as jasmine s singing voice based on her performance in musical miss saigon this unprecedented casting decision made jasmine first disney princess to have her speaking and singing voices provided by two different actresses animated by mark henn jasmine s design is an eclectic combination of unique sources including an anonymous theme park guest henn s own sister and actress jennifer connelly unlike most of disney s princesses jasmine is a supporting character in her own film taking secondary role of love interest character has garnered mixed to positive reviews with much of her character arc compared unfavorably to her predecessors ariel and belle from little mermaid 1989 and beauty and beast 1991 but has been praised for her personality and her chemistry with aladdin as sixth disney princess and franchise s first non european member character is credited with introducing racial diversity to disney s princess genre jasmine has made subsequent appearances in aladdin s sequels return of jafar 1994 and aladdin and king of thieves 1996 as well as its television series and a broadway musical adaption of film both larkin and salonga have been awarded disney legends for their contributions to role naomi scott played a live action version of character in 2019 live action adaptation of original 1992 film development conception and writing jasmine is based on princess who appears in middle eastern folk tale collection one thousand and one nights specifically story aladdin and magical lamp lyricist howard ashman and composer alan menken had first begun to develop aladdin while they were still writing songs for little mermaid 1989 but further development was abandoned in favor of working on beauty and beast 1991 instead however aladdin was finally resurrected as beauty and beast neared completion while princess in original tale is named badroulbadour studio decided to rename character more familiar jasmine after actress jasmine guy additionally name was also among decade s most popular at time in ashman s original treatment of film aladdin had two potential love interests both jasmine and a judy garland y tomboy whose romantic feelings for aladdin were not reciprocated by hero screenwriter linda woolverton eventually drafted a screenplay based on film thief of baghdad 1940 a revision that included a handmaiden for jasmine who was ultimately replaced by a pet tiger thumb upright 0 7 actress audrey hepburn s role as princess ann a bored princess in film roman holiday 1953 provided inspiration for jasmine s storyline alt a snapshot of actress audrey hepburn in her role as princess ann in film roman holiday directors and writers ron clements and john musker eventually disregarded woolverton s script in favor of developing something more similar to ashman s version albeit making several changes to his treatment among them approaching character of jasmine a little differently while maintaining woolverton s vision of a princess that aladdin could woo following elimination of aladdin s mother from script jasmine and aladdin s relationship was expanded upon to point of which it became a focal point of film ultimately allowing more screen time for princess thus jasmine was developed into a more prominent character unlike disney s previous adaptations of fairy tales princess is not film s main character and therefore story does not revolve around her despite presence of a prominent princess character directors decided to treat aladdin more so like an arabian adventure as opposed to a traditional disney fairy tale or princess film in vein of snow white and seven dwarfs 1937 or beauty and beast decision to make aladdin a high comedy ultimately eliminated need to explore some of jasmine s deeper story lines although several details of original folk tale were altered for film adaptation jasmine s main story line being pressured into marriage remained mostly untouched however while badroulbadour initially resents aladdin jasmine on other hand is almost immediately charmed by him screenwriters ted elliott and terry rossio re wrote jasmine into a stronger character who actively longs for freedom from her regal confinement according to dave smith of disney archives liberated jasmine primarily seeks to escape her present lifestyle idea of a disguised jasmine stowing away from her palace in middle of night was inspired by romantic comedy film roman holiday 1953 in which princess ann portrayed by actress audrey hepburn similarly escapes royal embassy in disguise in order to spend one day exploring rome on her own voice casting of american actor and comedian robin williams as genie inspired studio to recruit similarly talented voice actors capable of matching his pace filmmakers had originally envisioned jasmine s voice as similar to that of actress lauren bacall jasmine s speaking voice is provided by american actress linda larkin role was only one of several auditions larkin had scheduled during same week in which she auditioned for aladdin and she originally underestimated scope of project joking i thought it was going to be something like duck tales sic initially presented with only a few pages of screenplay larkin found that she was particularly drawn to jasmine s spirit of activism in addition to ways in which character was both similar to and different from previous disney heroines princesses snow white cinderella and aurora had been childhood favorites of actress larkin s first audition was held in a burbank california recording studio in which she performed solely for film s casting director side used for larkin s first audition was scene in which jasmine meets aladdin in marketplace their first encounter jasmine s line it s all so magical helped convince larkin that she was meant to voice character although larkin s voice was significantly different from what filmmakers had originally envisioned for character her interpretation gradually changed their minds thumb left upright 0 8 actress linda larkin provides jasmine s speaking voice six months after being cast disney executive jeffrey katzenberg insisted that she was required to re audition for role alt image of actress linda larkin speaking voice of princess jasmine addressing an unseen audience at a convention in form of an extensive series of callbacks larkin returned to studio on several different occasions over next few months while audience of studio executives and filmmakers continued to increase amount of actresses competing for role gradually decreased accordingly as audition process neared completion larkin s final audition lasted a total of four hours during which she read through entire script for first time animators were also provided with an opportunity to animate to larkin s voice for first time actress was finally cast several months later by which time she had nearly forgotten she had ever auditioned six months into recording however larkin was forced to re audition for role by disney executive jeffrey katzenberg who felt that actress voice lacked authority required to voice a princess however clements and musker disagreed with him and managed to trick katzenberg into not firing larkin by staging a fake recording session during which they had actress speak lower and slower in katzenberg s presence only to have her return to her natural voice thereafter larkin recorded only one scene alongside her co stars williams and scott weinger voice of aladdin apart from some rough unfinished storyboards and drawings larkin did not see much of her character until film was finally screened at museum of modern art before discovering larkin disney had been insisting on auditioning exclusively performers who were capable of singing as well as they could act however after williams recruitment studio relented in favor of casting strong actors instead when larkin first auditioned for role a whole new world jasmine s only surviving song had not yet been written she admitted there s no way i would have even auditioned if there had been a song from beginning after writing jasmine s first song filmmakers asked larkin if she would be interested in recording it and providing character s singing voice larkin immediately declined joking i do sing but not like a princess thus disney decided to recruit a singer who could mimic larkin s speaking voice instead despite actress fear that studio would completely replace her with a professional singer altogether jasmine s singing voice is provided by filipina singer and actress lea salonga salonga s tony award winning performance in musical miss saigon helped her garner interest of casting director albert tavares who proceeded to leave a note for singer on stage door before leaving a show he had attended salonga s agent then scheduled her audition at which she performed part of your world from little mermaid salonga finally began recording a demo of a whole new world a few days later with casting of salonga larkin became one of disney s first voice actors to not provide singing voice of character she voices and thus jasmine marked first time disney decided to separate a princess s speaking and singing voices describing salonga as an incredible singer larkin herself was pleasantly surprised by how much salonga s voice resembled her own when she first heard a whole new world joking filmmakers almost had me convinced that i sang it personality and design character s blurb on official disney website reads jasmine is an independent fiery beauty capable of taking care of herself who longs to experience life outside palace writers had originally conceived jasmine as a spoiled and materialistic princess whose interests were limited to clothing and jewelry but eventually developed her into a stronger more mature character larkin described jasmine as a very strong well defined character from very beginning mark henn served as jasmine s supervising animator having originally been hired to animate aladdin s mother removal of character from film ultimately provided henn with opportunity to animate jasmine instead throughout disney s previous animated film beauty and beast design of heroine belle whom henn had also helped animate suffered from various inconsistencies due to character having been animated at two completely separate studio locations to avoid experiencing a similar dilemma with jasmine filmmakers ultimately decided to have princess animated entirely at one studio because jasmine is film s love interest as opposed to its main character princess was animated at company s secondary studio in florida while aladdin was animated in california however more intimate love scenes between two leads proved particularly difficult to animate as a result of 2000 mile distance between two studios and animators out of his desire to indian architecture into film art director bill perkins based jasmine s design on famous mausoleum taj mahal which itself incorporates and expands on indian design particularly curves demonstrated in character s hair clothes and jewelry left thumb upright 0 6 actress jennifer connelly inspired jasmine s appearance alt close up of actress jennifer connelly s face her own facial features provided inspiration for those of jasmine having just recently animated two previous disney heroines ariel from little mermaid and belle from beauty and beast respectively henn initially suffered from a severe case of artist s block while attempting to design his third heroine jasmine while working on character at disney mgm studios in florida henn noticed a young female amusement park guest with long black hair and ultimately decided to use her as his initial inspiration for jasmine guest s identity remains anonymous to date earliest sketches of jasmine were based on various exotic looking supermodels in addition to her namesake jasmine guy but actress facial features were ultimately considered to be too severe for an animated character in search of something fresh to help with physical look of her henn was eventually inspired by a high school graduation photograph of his younger sister beth allen who wore her hair in a style similar to what would ultimately become jasmine s henn credits his sister with helping him overcome his artist s block and directors ultimately approved of henn s concept design character s facial features were further inspired by actress jennifer connelly specifically her eyebrows additionally some of larkin s own mannerisms and physical traits were incorporated into character henn credits one particular dinner conversation he had shared with larkin with proving very inspirational in terms of helping him discover jasmine s emotional side final appearance of jasmine consequently inspired studio to redesign aladdin accordingly because katzenberg felt that main character who was originally depicted as a younger scrawny underdog did not resemble a suitable leading man for jasmine which they feared would result in unconvincing chemistry between couple thus they ultimately decided to base aladdin on actor tom cruise instead henn s favorite sequence to animate was scene in which jasmine discovers aladdin s true identity and gives him a look filmmakers decided to dress jasmine in blue to symbolically represent water which is most precious substance one can find in a desert animators sat character next to a fountain when she is first introduced in film to further emphasize this motif and comparison with her appearance finalized jasmine became disney s first non white princess as opposed to being of european heritage themes characteristics and beliefs as a character jasmine is both similar to and different from disney heroines who preceded her she possesses many qualities associated with traditional disney princesses grace and beauty among them however marketed by disney as a heroine of 1990s jasmine is born before her time and thus her intelligence and ambitions tend to more so resemble contemporary incarnations namely belle brian lowry of variety likened jasmine s strong willed personality to that of belle describing her as an anachronistically liberated heroine meanwhile hollywood news rob burch observed that princess is very similar to ariel being independent beautiful and desperate for chance to live her own life while at same time concealing kindness beneath a shield of anger belonging to a series of spunky heroines inspired by both contemporary feminism and girl power movement jasmine was recognized by hearing a film seeing a sermon preaching and popular movies author timothy b as a member of disney s continued efforts to reshape their heroines for a more feminist age in addition to providing young girls with strong female role models with whom they can identify at only 15 years of age jasmine is already more resourceful than her two immediate predecessors while sharing their same preference for assertiveness and empowerment over passiveness traits echoed by several other disney princesses introduced throughout decade at same time jasmine is depicted as being feistier than belle and less naive than ariel distinctively jasmine is not aladdin s protagonist a role held instead by title character aladdin while jasmine herself occupies a secondary role as film s love interest consequently lacking significant character development however sometimes both characters are collectively referred to as protagonists while jasmine is sometimes identified as film s female protagonist first novels club observed that jasmine essentially ends up same person as when she started little is known about jasmine s interests hobbies and goals art of princess and frog author jeff wrote that although jasmine is less prominent as a heroine she made decisions and was a little more strong willed samantha rullo of bustle agreed that despite her secondary role jasmine remains determined to live her life way she wants to rather than letting others make her decisions for her and thus ranks among disney s most rebellious princesses jasmine s personality continues to rank among disney s strongest heroines because she is not concerned about wealth or social class despite her opulent upbringing similarly jasmine is not interested in marrying someone who is capable of only offering her everything she already owns opting for excitement and companionship instead alongside aladdin s other main characters jasmine embodies film s central theme of longing for freedom from some form of confinement or oppression both film and its characters are influenced by jasmine s power of choice character s desire for both freedom and a sense of agency is constantly threatened by other characters and situations sole decision jasmine maintains complete agency over during entire film is who she falls in love with aided by genie s refusal to use his magical powers to force characters to fall in love although not who she marries although jasmine yearns to explore her kingdom beyond confines of her palace she only gets as far as marketplace before returning home jasmine explores idea that enclosing yourself behind walls can make you more vulnerable not less as evidenced by fact that character is unprepared and knows little about money when she ventures into marketplace for first time in film jasmine releases a flock of birds from their cage which serves as a metaphor for her own situation being caged from a world she has never seen and yearns to be released jasmine s bedroom is also shaped like a bird cage to represent her own confinement jasmine s story also explores themes such as civil rights racial tolerance social hierarchy and life liberty and pursuit of happiness feminism marriage laws and gender jasmine demonstrates several traits beliefs and ideologies associated with feminism exercising much feminist potential although notably less explicit than belle s nonetheless character still adheres to traditional romance oriented aspirations commonly associated with disney s princess characters despite her modern feminist attitude although her yearning for romance is much more subdued in comparison steve daly of entertainment weekly identified jasmine as a sexually aware proto feminist princess new exoticisms changing patterns in construction of otherness author isabel santaolalla wrote that jasmine appears to have inherited legacy bequeathed by 1960s women s movement having stepped out of 1990s according to washington post s desson howe jasmine is appropriately opposed to glass ceiling defying marriage laws and arranged marriages are also among jasmine s central themes larkin believes that her character is responsible for inspiring a change in her kingdom s marriage laws explaining jasmine didn t just believe in something she fought against something that she saw was an injustice she actively sought change and made it happen musker agreed that princess rebel s against social structure in choosing to marry someone of her own free will according to singer brad kane who provides aladdin s singing voice aladdin is a stealth feminist movie because jasmine is willing to give up being a princess to not get stuck marrying someone jasmine s defiance eventually successfully convinces her father to change constitution only named speaking female character in male dominated film jasmine lacks both female companions and a motherly figure male characters account for 90 of film s dialogue character has come to resent patriarchal society in which she lives movies and mind theories of great psychoanalysts applied to film author william observed that jasmine represents rejection of father king s domination and control over his daughter s life resembling a strong and assertive heroine who rebels against her father s tyranny rather than passively accepting his will jasmine s life is almost entirely determined by men by whom she refuses to be ordered constantly voicing her disapproval by rejecting arrogant suitors and yelling at men who attempt to make decisions on her behalf while challenging traditional gender roles and male authority figures jasmine s father sultan responds to his daughter s constant rejection of potential suitors with i don t know where she gets it from her mother wasn t nearly so picky indicating that jasmine s mother belonged to a generation of docile pre feminist women at times jasmine can seem judgmental she originally has a thoroughly negative opinion of all princes until she meets a disguised aladdin in ulrich marzolph s book arabian nights reader author described character as mouthpiece of opposition to a vaguely defined middle eastern backwardness and authoritarianism appearances films and television series jasmine debuted in aladdin 1992 as princess of agrabah daughter of sultan frustrated with constantly having decisions made for her and being pressured into marrying a prince by law jasmine disguises herself as a peasant and escapes palace in nearby marketplace jasmine befriends street thief aladdin after he rescues her from an angry vendor who very nearly chops her hand off escaping to aladdin s hideout pair bonds over realization that they both feel trapped in their own environments and long for better lives when aladdin is soon arrested by palace guards jasmine demands his immediate release only to find her orders overruled by jafar sultan s scheming grand vizier when princess confronts jafar he lies and tells her that aladdin has already been executed leaving jasmine distraught and blaming herself for his death in reality jafar is using aladdin to retrieve a magical lamp containing a genie when genie who saves and befriends aladdin grants his wish to be transformed into a prince to better his chances of wooing jasmine aladdin introduces himself to her as prince ali although initially unimpressed jasmine is charmed after joining him on a magic carpet ride at end of which she discovers that prince is in fact same peasant she met in marketplace however aladdin convinces jasmine that he truly is a prince who much like her only occasionally disguises himself as a commoner when jafar learns truth about aladdin he steals lamp and becomes genie s master banishing aladdin and forcing genie to make him sultan while enslaving both jasmine and her father after refusing to marry him jasmine kisses jafar to distract him while aladdin returns in time to trick jafar into wishing himself into a genie and thus trapping himself within lamp jasmine and sultan

absence when aladdin finally returns to agrabah with cassim and introduces him jasmine and sultan take an immediate liking to him however cassim is soon imprisoned by sultan after he attempts to steal oracle again aladdin frees cassim and accepts punishment for his actions until jasmine convinces her father that he was only helping is father out of love iago returns to inform them that cassim has been captured by sa luk and remaining thieves jasmine goes with aladdin to rescue his father and afterward they return for their wedding which cassim attends from shadows they go for a ride on carpet

palace walls which composer alan menken wrote specifically for reed described by reed as a really beautiful song that sets up her character these palace walls narrates jasmine s desire to explore world beyond confines of palace despite being grateful for everything her father has already provided her with reed originally found performing a whole new world particularly daunting because as film

less carefully worked out than aladdin but equally likable as a personality type contactmusic com agreed that character exhibits cynical streaks despite being an essentially bland character jasmine s strong willed personality has frequently been both positively and negatively compared those of her predecessors ariel and belle gary thompson of philadelphia daily news wrote princess jasmine is also more barbed yet without obvious feminist makeover given to belle similarly james berardinelli of reelviews commended jasmine for show ing same streak of stubborn independence exhibited by ariel and belle but ultimately criticized fact that she doesn t fill a more pressing role than that of aladdin s love interest agreeing that jasmine appears bland in comparison to aladdin s supporting characters mari ness of tor com wrote jasmine follows in footsteps of ariel and belle as someone unhappy with restrictions of her world and her lack of choices like both of them she takes active steps to change this and it s not entirely her fault that she s a secondary character in a film not all that interested in her she s perceptive and fast thinking but this isn t her movie and in end although she does get to choose her own husband she doesn t really get a chance like ariel and belle to move out of her world she can be shown world but she stays in her palace other critics have been much less forgiving common critiques have derided princess as a spoiled shallow bland and overly sexualized character common sense media criticized jasmine for lacking an original predicament and premise

supposed center time out called character disappointing and tv guide described her as bland film critic roger ebert cited jasmine among film s weaknesses dismissing relationship between her and aladdin as pale and routine in comparison to belle and beast s additionally ebert wrote that characters look unformed as if even filmmakers didn t see them as real individuals ed gonzalez of slant

received by critics tom jorgensen of ign found her portrayal of jasmine a clear improvement over 1992 version and added that character feels more three dimensional pun not intended nor apologized for and she is given far more interesting ambitions this time around scott gives character a dignity and drive that makes it easier to root for her than poor old al johnny of new york post found scott s version of jasmine lovely and also had more agency and less passiveness than in original version san francisco chronicles critic mick lasalle found scott to be real star of film and she thrives and gives everything to her new power anthem that was written for film washington posts michael o sullivan praised scott s portrayal as someone who doesn t just dream of escaping from under her father s

sparkles in new song speechless for her performance scott won teen choice award for choice movie actress sci fi fantasy and also received a nomination for saturn award for best supporting actress feminist analysis reverse cover of aladdin s original home video release proudly touted jasmine as a heroine of 1990s however it s not media truth about pop culture s influence on children author karen strongly disagreed with this sentiment writing that despite being strong willed and almost given feminist qualities jasmine nonetheless resembles heroines of old waiting for her prince to come and rescue her and using traditional feminine wiles to get her out of trouble character continues to be heavily discussed among feminist critics bustle included jasmine s first encounter with aladdin on website s ranking of most feminist disney princess moments with author samantha rullo crediting scene with demonstrating how strong willed and independent she truly is in a similar feminist ranking of all disney princesses bustle s chelsea maze appreciated jasmine for refusing to let men in her life boss her around ultimately placing character at number eight because she possesses agency to choose her own mate and follow her heart all while financially supporting guy she loves mize concluded that jasmine is a pretty strong woman with a solid feminist streak both feminist and muslim critics have accused jasmine of being an offensive role model unworthy of showcasing to impressionable young girls according to meghan o keefe of overthinking it jasmine possesses tremendous yet ineffectual potential to be a feminist heroine due to her lack of interest in books music social interaction and thirst for learning that ariel and belle share o keefe concluded jasmine s complaints to aladdin about palace life sound less like a budding feminist finding her voice and more like spoiled muse of pulp s common people charles i schuster author of speculations readings in culture identity and values agreed that character offers very little feminism apart from her defiance of an arbitrary law bust s began by praising jasmine s progressiveness she challenges her ascribed life as a princess is skeptical of marriage and by falling in love with poor aladdin upsets class system however in end author criticized character for being very sexualized explaining while female sexuality is something to be proud and in control of it maybe isn t best message for young girls opening that jasmine s role lacks significance feminist fiction deemed her an example of how disney treats its female characters when they re not protagonist of story elaborating it looks like disney put a lot of effort into giving jasmine girl power and independence at least in her dialogue and attitude but didn t follow through and give her strength in plot itself website also observed that character s feminism does not appear to extend beyond lip service ultimately criticizing jasmine of using her sexuality instead of her intelligence to save day before finally reverting to role of a damsel in distress awaiting rescue routledge companion to media gender author cynthia carter believes that jasmine becomes possession of her husband by end of film within realm of internet scene during which jasmine kisses jafar in order to distract him from aladdin is oftentimes viewed as a point of contention among feminist writers and bloggers meredith ancret of snark who hunts back argued that both sultan and genie are similarly enslaved by jafar ancret continued to defend jasmine for being of her own mind bravely defying jafar on numerous occasions and praised her distraction of villain for being instrumental to aladdin s success also defending jasmine s decision to kiss jafar feminist
