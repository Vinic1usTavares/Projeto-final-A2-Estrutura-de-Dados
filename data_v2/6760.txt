plectania nannfeldtii commonly known as nannfeldt s plectania black felt cup or black snowbank cup fungus is a species of fungus in family fruit bodies of this species resemble small black goblet shaped shallow cups up to wide with stems up to long attached to black mycelia fruit bodies which may appear alone or in groups on ground in conifer duff are usually attached to buried woody debris and are commonly associated with melting snow plectania nannfeldtii is found in western north america and in asia often at higher elevations similar black cup fungi with which p nannfeldtii may be confused include pseudoplectania vogesiaca p nigrella and helvella corium taxonomy species was first described by british mycologist fred jay seaver in 1928 who called it paxina nigrella in his monograph of cup fungi of north america type specimens were found in 1914 in tolland colorado by mycologist lee oras overholts further collections were reported from colorado and california in 1930 species has also been referred to as nigrella helvella nigrella and macroscyphus in 1957 richard korf transferred species to its current name changing specific epithet in process as plectania nigrella was already in use it is a synonym of pseudoplectania nigrella name chosen by korf honors swedish mycologist john axel nannfeldt responsible for some early advances in understanding of this fungus and other cup fungi p nannfeldtii is classified in korf s section plectania of genus plectania because of its ellipsoid ascospores vernacular names for species include black felt cup nannfeldt s plectania or black snowbank cup fungus description thumb left 150px fruit bodies grow on rotting wood fruit body of plectania nannfeldtii is shallowly cup or goblet shaped and may be up to in diameter edges of cup are somewhat wavy and remain curled inward until they flare out when they are very old external surface is covered with delicate blackish brown hairs while color of surface underneath is also brownish black surface wrinkles when fruit body is dry internal convex surface of cup contains spore producing tissue layer known as hymenium it is black stem is thin and may be up to long with a diameter of 2 3 mm tapering towards base like fruit body it is covered in delicate brownish black hairs and it is similar in color to outer surface of cup dense coarse mycelium at base of stem is black flesh is thin and blackish gray edibility has not been determined for this species microscopic features in mass spores are white spores are hyaline translucent ellipsoid with dimensions of 30 35 by 15 um opinions are divided about distribution of oil droplets in spores miller says that spores typically have two oil droplets at either end trudell and ammirati in their field guide to mushrooms of pacific northwest says that spores lack large oil drops while evenson claims that there are numerous tiny oil drops walls of spores have thin horizontal ridges that are cyanophilic that is they are visible with light microscopy when stained with methyl blue spore bearing cells asci are about 500 um long and 20 um wide asci are operculate that is with a flap at one end that opens to discharge spores interspersed between asci are numerous sterile filamentous dark brown cells called paraphyses that are slightly enlarged on one end and 380 420 um long by 4 5 um wide similar species based on external appearance plectania nannfeldtii is similar to pseudoplectania vogesiaca although this latter species may be difficult to distinguish by its less hairy external fruit body surface its microscopic characters identify it more definitively p vogesiaca has spores that are much smaller typically with widths of 12 14 um helvella corium is another black cup fungus that appears in spring it has smaller spores whitish margins on cup edges and shorter stems than p nannfeldtii pseudoplectania nigrella is smaller with a hairier outer surface a darker inner cup surface and a rudimentary stem habitat and distribution plectania nannfeldtii is typically found at higher elevations in coniferous forests growing on wet twigs or other rotting woody debris often in or near snow it often begins its development underneath snow reaching maturity as snowbank recedes to expose it one source suggests that its metabolic heat may help it melt a path through snow as it grows it may grow singly scattered or in clusters and has been noted to have a preference for wood of picea engelmannii and abies as well as other conifers in north america it is found in western united states and canada where it fruits from late may to early august it is common in sierra nevada and in higher elevations of pacific coast ranges its distribution also includes china and japan see also snowbank fungus references external links category pezizales category fungi described in 1928 category fungi of north america category fungi of asia category snowbank fungi
