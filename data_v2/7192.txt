impressionist painters including paul cezanne implementation of wii motionplus proved problematic for developers to point where it was nearly discarded it was first zelda game to use a live orchestra for majority of its tracks with music composed by a team led by hajime wakai and supervised by koji kondo first revealed in 2009 it was initially planned for release in 2010 before being delayed to 2011 to further refine and expand it game was a critical and commercial success receiving perfect scores from multiple journalistic sites winning and receiving nominations for numerous industry and journalist awards and selling over three million copies worldwide despite accolades it received points of widespread criticism directed toward certain aspects of game s design proved to be a key influence in development of next entry for home consoles breath of wild gameplay thumb left 250px link flies on his loftwing bird through sky game s visuals were inspired by impressionist artists such as paul cezanne while its controls were tailored exclusively for wii motionplus legend of zelda skyward sword is an action adventure game in which players take on role of series protagonist link through a series of monster populated overworlds and navigating dungeons featuring puzzles and bosses link is controlled using wii remote and nunchuk and wii motionplus peripheral is required to play greater majority of gameplay mechanics revolve around use of motion controls these include camera control with nunchuk and general hotkey actions and movement linked to wii remote jumping across gaps and scaling ledges happen automatically within context nunchuk is also used to make link perform a forward roll link can sprint for short distances but sprinting and other actions such as climbing and carrying heavy objects is limited by a stamina meter which recharges after a few seconds when not performing actions that drain it when depleted entirely link s movement speed is reduced and he is left vulnerable until meter refills standard navigation takes place from a third person perspective while dowsing search function switches to a first person view dowsing scans an area for a selected object with new dowsing objectives appearing depending on game context fighting enemies which appear in both overworld and dungeons relies on link s use of his sword and shield link s sword movements are mapped to direction wii remote is flicked by player and other moves include a forward thrust and a stab enemy movements are designed to anticipate and block link s combat movements by raising wii remote sword gathers energy which can be unleashed in a skyward strike skyward strikes are also used to trigger environmental elements such as magical switches shield is controlled with nunchuck when shield is raised it can be used to reflect attacks spin attacks and finishing blows are activated by swinging both wii remote and nunchuck link s health is represented with hearts with link taking damage whenever he is hit if he loses all hearts game ends game takes place on floating island of skyloft and surrounding airborne islands three surface overworlds where majority of main adventure takes place side quests for town s citizens are unlocked as game progresses different areas of surface are accessed through portals in clouds side quests for characters of surface are also available and are sometimes mandatory for completing main quest skyloft is navigated with a bird called a loftwing while surface is navigated on foot beacons can be set on map for link to follow and save points in form of statues preserve link s progress up to that point during his quest link is aided by sword spirit fi who is able to give hints to player for both environmental elements and enemies for example when an enemy is targeted and fi is summoned she will give enemy s characteristics and weaknesses traditional series items such as bombs and bow and arrow appear along with new additions such as a mechanical beetle that flies to areas beyond link s reach and a whip for grabbing otherwise unreachable objects and activating levers link s shield takes damage when blocking attacks fail and may eventually break items and equipment can be upgraded making them stronger and more durable in addition to consuming resources link must also pay for upgrade with rupees game s currency which is scattered throughout world plot skyward sword takes place at beginning of zelda continuity according to legend three ancient goddesses bestowed a great wish granting power triforce demon king demise sought triforce and laid waste to much of land in his quest for it goddess hylia gathered survivors and sent them into sky allowing her to launch a full scale offensive against demise she was victorious but land was severely damaged uncounted years later outcrop is known as skyloft and its people believe surface below clouds is a myth fi this is a tale you humans have passed down through uncounted generations it tells of a war of unmatched scale and ferocity likes of which would never be seen again one dark fateful day earth cracked wide and malevolent forces rushed forth from fissure they mounted a brutal assault upon surface people driving land into deep despair they burnt forest to ash choked land s sweet springs and murdered without hesitation they did all this in their lust to take ultimate power protected by her grace goddess power she guarded was without equal handed down by gods of old this power gave its holder means to make any desire a reality such was might of ultimate power that old ones placed it in care of goddess to prevent this great power from falling into hands of evil swarming lands goddess gathered surviving humans on an outcropping of earth she sent it skyward beyond reach of demonic hordes beyond even clouds with humans safe goddess joined forces with land dwellers and fought evil forces sealing them away at last peace was restored to surface this is a tale that you humans have told for many ages generation to generation but there are other legends long hidden away from memory that are intertwined with this tale now a new legend bound to this great story stands ready to be revealed a legend that will be forged by your own hand in present knight in training link passes his final exam despite attempted interference of his class rival groose who considers himself a romantic rival for link s childhood friend zelda after passing exam and on a celebratory flight together zelda is whisked away below clouds by a dark tornado after recovering back on skyloft link is led to island s statue of hylia by fi spirit of goddess sword residing within statue link draws sword showing himself to be prophesied hero who will finally destroy demise opening a way to surface link is guided by fi to sealed temple where he meets an old woman who tells him to track zelda this leads link across regions of faron woods eldin volcano and lanayru desert while he catches up with zelda he is prevented from returning her to skyloft by impa a young woman guarding and guiding zelda link is also confronted by ghirahim a self proclaimed demon lord working towards freeing demise at temple of time in lanayru desert link defends zelda and impa from ghirahim giving two time to depart through a time gate into past which impa destroys as they pass through returning to temple of hylia link is followed by groose and two end up on surface together link then has to defeat imprisoned a monstrous form of demise attempting to reach sealed temple after old woman shows him a second dormant time gate with imprisoned defeated link sets out to strengthen goddess sword by passing trials set by ancient goddesses and using their gifts to find sacred flames to purify and strengthen blade so time gate can be awakened returning to find imprisoned attempting to break free link it with help from groose activating time gate and traveling to past he finds zelda and learns that she is mortal reincarnation of hylia hylia could not kill demise and was too weakened from their battle to fend him off again so she created goddess sword and reincarnated as a mortal to find someone who would fulfill her duty by using triforce to wish demise s destruction as only mortals can use artifact zelda then seals herself inside a crystal to strengthen demise s seal granting her power to goddess sword and upgrading it into master sword zelda old gods created a supreme power that gave anyone who possessed it ability to shape reality and fulfill any desire they called it triforce in his thirst to make world his own demise readied a massive army of monsters for war he sought to take triforce for himself by force after a long and fierce battle goddess hylia succeeded in sealing away demise however soon after demon king was imprisoned it became clear that seal would not hold long against his fearsome power hylia had suffered grave injuries in her battle with demon king she knew that if he broke free again there would be no stopping him and if demon king were to free himself it would mean end of world for all beings of this land in order to put an end to demon king hylia devised two separate plans and set them both into motion first she created fi she made spirit that resides in your sword to serve a single purpose to assist her chosen hero on his mission her second plan was to abandon her divine form and transfer her soul to body of a mortal she made this sacrifice as you have guessed so that supreme power created by old gods could one day be used for while supreme power of triforce was created by gods all of its power can never be wielded by one knowing this power was her last and only hope goddess gave up her divine powers and her immortal form you ve probably figured it out by now haven t you link you are chosen hero and i zelda i am goddess reborn as a mortal we must stop demise from freeing himself from seal that imprisons him at any cost that is why i intend to remain here in this time and place to sustain seal as best as i can as long as i continue this vigil we may be able to prevent demon king from fully reviving himself in our own time link locates triforce on skyloft and uses it to destroy demise with demise dead zelda is freed but ghirahim arrives and kidnaps zelda though demise is dead in present ghirahim intends to use zelda as a sacrifice to resurrect him in past ghirahim my master may have perished in this age but in past he lives yet i m taking girl back through that gate to help me revive demon king link pursues ghirahim into past and fights through his army he then defeats ghirahim who turns out to be spirit of demise s sword but is unable to prevent zelda from being used to reincarnate demise s humanoid form groose guards zelda s body while link challenges demise link triumphs and absorbs demise s essence into sword but demise curses link and zelda s descendants to be haunted by his reincarnated rage demise extraordinary you stand as a paragon of your kind human you fight like no man or demon i have ever known though this is not end my hate never perishes it is born anew in a cycle with no end i will rise again those like you those who share blood of goddess and spirit of hero they are eternally bound to this curse an incarnation of my hatred shall ever follow your kind dooming them to wander a blood soaked sea of darkness for all time to complete sword s seal link drives it into a pedestal in sealed temple with fi accepting eternal slumber as a result groose link and zelda return to their time while impa remains behind and destroys time gate as she is a person of that time period and must watch over master sword impa zelda your grace you possess memories of goddess you must understand why that is not possible i am a being of this age my place is here zelda i i know that but impa you must return to your own time i will take care of gate once you have passed through zelda i can t do that you and i have been through so much together i don t want to leave you alone please impa come back with us impa zelda at command of goddess i passed through gate of time i did so to protect you and aid fight to prevent world s destruction last remnants of demise are decaying slowly within sword someone must stay behind to watch over this blade his spirit must not he must never be allowed to threaten world again in present old woman greets them one last time before she dies and vanishes revealing that she was impa game ends with groose returning to skyloft while zelda deciding to remain on surface to watch over triforce she and link together establish kingdom of hyrule zelda look around us as a child i always dreamed of a world below i wanted to see surface with my own eyes and feel land s warm breeze on my skin i i think i want to live here i always want to feel solid ground beneath my feet see clouds above my head and watch over triforce what about you link what will you do now development thumb skyward sword producer eiji aonuma at 2007 game developers conference skyward swords development began in 2006 after release of legend of zelda twilight princess for gamecube and wii it was developed by nintendo entertainment analysis development a development division of series publisher nintendo they were assisted in development by kyoto branch of monolith soft its producer was eiji aonuma a major contributor to legend of zelda series his main preoccupation during these early stages was whether developers could continue creating legend of zelda games using same development mindset that had been used up to twilight princess game s director was hidemaro fujibayashi previously working as assistant director on legend of zelda phantom hourglass for nintendo ds skyward sword was his first project for home consoles he began work on skyward sword after finishing phantom hourglass and continued working on game alongside his work on legend of zelda spirit tracks when spirit tracks was finished fujibayashi and game s development team transferred back to working on skyward sword according to aonuma team s starting point for development was wii version of twilight princess feeling they had not fully realized their goal of creating a vast and realistic world with twilight princess they used their previous work as a foundation for next game they also sought to create a memorable experience equivalent to legend of zelda ocarina of time by that time considered series most memorable game development lasted around five years and according to series producer shigeru miyamoto game s budget was considered quite high for a nintendo project development time was initially estimated at three years but difficulties and changes in game s development extended development time by a further two years despite this miyamoto felt that this was not wasted development time as first two years went into experimentation by june 2011 game was complete aside from fine tuning and balancing its mechanics a new zelda game was first hinted at in april 2008 when miyamoto stated that zelda development team were reforming to create new games miyamoto later confirmed at 2008 electronic entertainment expo e3 that a new zelda was in development for wii game was unveiled at e3 2009 although its title remained unknown due to its in development state miyamoto could not show off gameplay as he had wished instead he showed promotional art featuring link and fi he also announced game s use of wii motionplus along with its planned 2010 release window in a later interview aonuma s comments on game s playability brought this release window into doubt he also noted that his wish to focus on new game meant that release date of spirit tracks was shifted to end of 2009 rather than its initial projected release in early 2010 game s title was announced at event along with its revised release period in 2011 and a playable demonstration according to miyamoto game was delayed from its planned 2010 release window as staff felt that they would be releasing an unfinished product if they put convenience of company ahead of creating a quality experience they used extra year to both finish core elements and polish up game as a whole multiple promotional elements were created a five part online comic was written and illustrated by jerry holkins and mike krahulik under their penny arcade presents series and television commercials featuring actor and comedian robin williams and his daughter zelda were made playing on actor s stated love for series skyward sword released in all regions in november 2011 it released in europe on november 18 north america on november 20 japan on november 23 and australia on november 24 game was released as both a standard edition and a limited deluxe edition that included a gold wii remote plus an anniversary cd was included with both editions containing orchestrated versions of various iconic musical pieces from series following its release a glitch was discovered that corrupted save files if three late game events were taken in a certain order once revealed nintendo issued instructions on avoiding it and set up a special channel on their wii site in japan to gain feedback along with offering to manually repair corrupted save files scenario script for cinematic scenes was written by naoki mori who joined project for one and a quarter years in his role cinematic director was shigeki yoshida who was brought on at same time as and worked on storyboards with mori initial script was proposed by fujibayashi based on his perception of game s structure as game s theme was use of sword and sword most associated with series was master sword team decided to make it an origin story for weapon an early element was whether to incorporate creation of hyrule while also needing to explain creation of skyloft this initial stage of story development ended up being difficult as their initial story plans were full of contradictions to established series lore due to them wanting to create an origin story for entire series these issues were further complicated by third year of development with necessity of finalizing gameplay and environments feigning illness fujibayashi shut himself away in a hotel room and wrote synopsis in a single day mori wrote dialogue based on fujibayashi s synopsis who needed to work out fine details with fujibayashi a scene fujibayashi was intent on including was where zelda jumped from edge of skyloft and link caught her this was fitted in for two characters after end of link s exam early part of story was quite different from earlier zelda games playing out in a similar way to a school drama once script was finished it was handed to yoshida so his team could create cinematics total number of cinematics was estimated as 79 coming to over 120 minutes relationship between link and zelda was quite different from earlier incarnations in particular fact that zelda was not royalty according to aonuma a recurring difficulty was how contrived necessity for link to rescue zelda became with each passing installment as their contact may only have been fleeting beforehand in response to this team considered how to make player care about zelda and want to rescue her having two characters as childhood friends served this purpose and cut down on extraneous plot elements they continued to encourage player by having link only just miss her on her early travels across surface mischievous elements were also added to zelda s personality by her pushing link over an ledge initially intended as a rule of three style gag it was cut down to two during development figure of hylia was a new addition to world s lore although her existence was linked to zelda with two being essentially same character known under different names in subsequent ages groose who acted as link s rival was introduced to make story more interesting within school setting groose s maturation during course of story was intended to help convey link s parallel growth as a character as he was otherwise mute and static fi was created before implantation of wii motionplus when she was going to be part of some different undefined gameplay concepts unrelated to motion control her design was based on design of master sword referencing her origins as sword s spirit she also served as an alternate explanatory voice as link was a silent protagonist according to staff fi s technical dialogue for each area of game was written by different people verbal inconsistencies arose that needed addressing so fujibayashi adjusted them all so she sounded consistent nearly all of fi s dialogue was ultimately written by fujibayashi ghirahim was designed to be similar to dark link character from ocarina of time he could read link s movements requiring players to think strategically to defeat him rather than simply swinging link s sword around randomly character designs were far more detailed than in previous zelda games clothing was frequently designed to complement backgrounds such as zelda s pink and red dress in opening game s use of warm colors and brushstroke like aesthetics was inspired by impressionist artwork pioneered in 19th century by painters such as claude monet a particular element cited by miyamoto was sky which he called a tribute to paul cezanne s work basic starting point for art style was that it was a fantasy world final version was referred to as a balance between cartoon styling of legend of zelda wind waker and twilight princess where cartoon shading was transferred onto an older version of link team settled this artstyle as it would properly portray more exaggerated actions of some characters and general swordplay while preserving link s mature appearance design during development team faced a lot of problems when designing game so it would be both familiar for series fans and fresh to old and new players pieces of gameplay experimentation meant that development was a more fundamental ground up process than earlier games such as wind waker their earlier games had involved lifting elements from earlier games and pasting them into a new entry but for skyward sword developers wanted to add a new play structure to avoid fans seeing it as more of same original concept for gameplay using wii motionplus was proposed by fujibayashi at a point when team were already developing gameplay around console s standard wii remote and nunchuk control scheme when first proposed aonuma was highly enthusiastic and his wish to change to wii motionplus meant that work on game needed to begin all over again use of wii motionplus proved challenging for developers to implement to point where at one point aonuma seriously considered dropping it from game entirely after release of wii sports resort team saw how motion controls could be used for swordplay after talking with development team they were able to borrow technology and used it to create motion driven swordplay implementation of wii motionplus meant that enemy artificial intelligence needed to be able to counter it adjusting their stances depending on position of link s sword when creating link s sword movements team initially wanted them to be as realistic as possible but because it was detrimental to character s portrayal they had to include unrealistic movements to preserve atmosphere skyward strike was initially born from aonuma thinking up a possible mechanic of holding sword above link these also gave rise to game s title having sword fighting relying on wii motionplus freed up other buttons on controller allowing addition of dash sprinting option so as not to interrupt flow of gameplay they incorporated other elements into dash function such as scaling walls rather than just slamming into them dowsing mechanic was created early on based on gameplay themes of discovery and exploration due to introduction of dowsing team did not have to create environmental landmarks for places and objects of importance as they had done in previous games so players would not get lost in terrain they also introduced marker beacons items were designed so they could be visible in any area such as bright blue bombs they were also designed based on their original location those from skyloft used a bird motif while those from other surface regions used more intricate designs beetle acted as a replacement for as team wanted an item that players could control beetle and other pseudo technical items gave rise to ancient mechanical theme that appeared in lanayru desert region at miyamoto s insistence more desirable items that were normally placed towards end of a campaign were made available to players from an early stage when designing items developers were faced with usual problems of interdependence of items and dungeons creating a chicken and egg scenario for developers menu for item access was also redesigned around use of wii motionplus in past zelda games team had made numerous new fields for player exploration but this time they limited number of overworlds to three and expanded their content so players would be able to full appreciate them through repeated visits team also created world based on their experiences with twilight princess feeling that overworld and dungeons were too large with puzzles too thinly dispersed team both sought to compact areas and have environmental puzzles in overworld biggest difficulty was ensuring that players could reach areas quickly while still discovering new features and puzzles creation of skyloft overworld was due to difficulties connecting three surface based overworlds with each other due to drastically contrasting environments sky was initially going to be presented similar to course selection screen from super mario series but this was changed to an overworld with its own quests and population so link had a place where he could prepare for his adventures an initial idea when jumping down from sky seemed unlikely to be approved was to have a huge tower acting as a central hub with height at which link jumped lengthening duration of his free fall once concept of traveling from sky had been chosen instead loftwing mounts were created so it looked and felt more rational to players these overlapping gameplay mechanics triggered creation of skyloft along with elements of early game such as knight academy continual movements and routines of skyloft s people were modeled after similar time driven mechanics from legend of zelda majora s mask with similar links between character specific side quests and main narrative despite aerial element mechanics necessary for free navigation meant a loftwing racing minigame could not be implemented each surface overworld had a specific theme forest overworld revolved around landforms altering gameplay volcano overworld focused around changing rules of gameplay while desert overworld was themed around duality between past and present first areas sealed grounds and faron woods were created so players could be eased into game s mechanics and navigation while forest areas were made to be mostly flat eldin volcano overworld was made with height differences in mind to provide a greater challenge elements in volcano terrain included areas of lava and slopes where link s sprinting ability would become necessary for reaching new areas for lanayru desert team created three different overworld zones due to its unique time shifting mechanics triggered with time shift stones this shifting between different zones was inspired by similar systems in ocarina of time and twilight princess portable time shift stones were one of many ideas included in desert overworld as they did not fit with forest or volcano environments a difficult feature to include naturally was remnants of lanayru s ancient civilization which used electricity to power both its technology and citizens enemy types that recurred in all surface based overworld areas were given slightly altered designs so they would be unique to each overworld silent realms were created as a new mechanic filled with enemies that could not be defeated and relying on link s sprinting ability rather than his weapons or items while they had experimented with indestructible enemies in phantom hourglass and spirit tracks but this time it was changed by restricting link s options and actions they also created a time limit for added strategy as knowledge of areas where spirit realms were located was key to completing them this was also why they were set up in areas players would already be familiar with they were originally in form of special dungeons but this was discarded in favor of familiar areas audio game s sound team consisted of ten people five handling general sound design and five handling music composition hajime wakai acted as game s sound director and lead composer with other composers being shiho fujii mahito yokota and takeshi hama longtime series composer koji kondo had a supervisory role only composing a single piece by himself music accompanying prologue video describing mythical origins of demise and hylia he also helped in arranging other composer s pieces using an electric piano and a mac computer fujii was responsible for music focused on environments dungeons boss battles among her work was music for skyloft she used art and environmental assets so that her compositions would fit in with their environments a first for zelda series music was performed using a live orchestra rather than synthesized instruments it was first time nintendo ead had used a live orchestra any previous orchestral elements in twilight princess which amounted only to one track were handled by their tokyo division due to his experience department s musical lead yokota was brought on to help orchestrate score aonuma initially did not think of using an orchestra and was still sure score would remain synthesized even after wakai asked him about it an orchestra was finally chosen after miyamoto insisted upon it a decision which surprised entire team using orchestra enabled a greater expression of emotion which meant that they used it when creating scores for environments cinematic scenes and emotional moments within story conversely team were given less freedom to adjust tracks as they had been able to with synthesized tracks something new they did for skyward sword was producing unique themes for specific characters such as link and zelda they also added people singing songs another element new to series one notable element was game s main theme ballad of goddess which was actually a reversed version of recurring tune zelda s lullaby due to use of an orchestra and sheer amount of extra work going into sound design music team doubled in size from standard five person group and became largest sound team at time to have worked on a nintendo game positive reception of orchestral score within company led to creation of legend of zelda 25th anniversary symphony concert a celebratory concert featuring orchestrated versions of classic zelda themes music was also woven into story and gameplay through use of harp link receives using a recurring theme within series of music being a central part of experience in contrast to previous games instrument could be played at any time rather than at specific times and places reception skyward sword received acclaim from multiple journalistic magazines and websites upon release it received a score of 93 100 on aggregate site metacritic based on 81 reviews it was site s 10th highest scoring game of 2011 and also ranked as 6th best reviewed wii game of all time it received perfect scores from multiple publications these included famitsu ign eurogamer game informer edge magazine and videogamer com in case of famitsu skyward sword was third zelda game and sixteenth video game in magazine s history to be given a perfect score at that time famitsu was highly positive praising overworld and gameplay one reviewer felt that it would form new standard for both zelda series and video games as a whole edge was highly positive about all aspects of game aside from player driven upgrade system and even then it was not enough to spoil experience for reviewer nintendo power gave it similar praise saying that it s truly worthy of being called epic ray carsillo of electronic gaming monthly appreciated game s nostalgic value but found motion control difficult to handle and kept game from being truly great jose otero writing for 1up com praised developers for putting effort into moving away from zelda tradition and called it one of better games in series but said that those detrimental elements that remained such as side quests and some item usage made skyward sword a weird middle ground filled with genuine surprises inessential carry overs and copy paste quest structures gamespot s tom mcshea was notably less positive than other critics praising storyline dungeons enemies and visuals while faulting controls for being unreliable and feeling that most of experience felt both unnecessary and overly familiar destructoid s jonathan holmes called skyward sword his new favorite 3d game from series but noted that its exclusive use of motion controls would put off potential players oli welsh of eurogamer was highly positive praising controls gameplay experience and additional elements such as upgrades he gave particular praise to game s visuals which were impressive despite hardware limitations game informers phil kollar echoed both general praise of gameplay and presentation and minor issues experienced with motion controls he concluded by saying that nintendo had fulfilled its initial promises for wii with skyward sword gamesradar s carolyn gudmundson called it perfectly balanced mix of innovation and classic zelda gameplay despite minor control issues gametrailers noted that despite its many strengths such as a believable relationship between link and zelda skyward sword represented series first gray hairs due to some of its mechanics feeling dated in modern gaming landscape ign s richard george felt that game returned legend of zelda to being a revolutionary series in gaming industry praising almost every aspect of game with exception of soundtrack which he felt did not live up to series standards despite its quality joystiq writer griffin mcelroy noted that a lot of game s content seemed unnecessary and extravagant but said that beneath this surface lay best zelda game of all time steve of official nintendo magazine shared many points of praise with other positive journalist reviews calling it greatest game in series to date videogamer com chris schilling called it one of best zelda games praising its motion controls narrative and treatment of series
