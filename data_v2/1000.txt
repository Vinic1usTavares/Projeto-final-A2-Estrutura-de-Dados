kamble vivek gomber as vinay vora geetanjali kulkarni as public prosecutor nutan pradeep joshi as judge usha bane as sharmila pawar shirish pawar as subodh production development director chaitanya tamhane made a short film called six strands at age of twenty three which was well received at several international film festivals project left him broke and jobless and under pressure to earn money but he did not want to assist another director tamhane was watching a typical conventional courtroom drama on doordarshan one day when he thought of making a real courtroom drama and started developing idea for court tamhane wanted to explore judicial nightmare in an indian setting after coming across case of jiten marandi a cultural activist from jharkhand marandi was arrested as a suspect in massacre which occurred on 26 october 2007 where nineteen people were killed by at a public function marandi became a suspect because his name was similar to actual suspect whom police could not find he was arrested and tried but was released in 2016 after proven not guilty action against activist singers of cultural organisation kabir kala on allegations of links with left wing also inspired film s narrative tamhane was curious by idea of a realistic court trial unfolding in a lower court of mumbai after attending some of them recalling tamhane found incidents that occur in a lower court to be bizarre and saw potential for drama and humour another incident which prompted tamhane to make film was when a friend had gone to a police station for document submission and had to wait two hours for a printout because constable did not know how to connect cable of printer in 2011 tamhane met with his friend vivek gomber who he had directed in a theatrical play called grey elephants in denmark in 2009 tamhane told gomber that he wanted to write a courtroom drama but did not have money to finance his project gomber then expressed his interest in producing film and offered to pay him a month to write script tamhane wrote script in a year after interviewing several lawyers academics and activists reading books and newspaper clippings and discovering world of protest music and legal world gomber found script very funny he also mentioned that visiting courts for film was quite sad and disheartening while tamhane was writing script character of public prosecutor was male for a long time and he felt film was too male with all main characters being men later he changed that character to a woman tamhane saw anand s documentary jai comrade 2011 when he was about to finish writing script and cited it as an invaluable resource for reference of film tamhane had written all scenes outside courtroom but lacked main case until he read about condition of manhole workers in a book which he incorporated into script he also read books of sam nariman v r krishna iyer and watched krzysztof s 1966 short film office for reference tamhane wrote scenes about domestic lives of lawyers in film as he was interested in depicting kind of life they lived outside courtroom while also juxtaposing their professional lives with their personal one in 2012 tamhane submitted script of court to national film development corporation of india for financing but it was rejected he applied for hubert fund in 2012 given by international film festival rotterdam where his short film six strands was screened in 2011 he received a sum of for script and project development gomber invested his own money for remainder of budget casting court took three years to complete film s planning and pre production was done in a year crew had to build court sets as shooting inside a real court is not allowed tamhane and casting director puranik would sneak into bombay high court and stay there for almost three hours a day they researched and observed real protest singers and activists and made notes for references on surroundings and costumes tamhane did not want to make film in a conventional manner and hence opted to have newcomers for cast and crew it was first film for much of its crew including production designers editor and casing director film s cinematographer mrinal desai had a documentary background tamhane had previously worked with film s production designers pooja and somnath pal on his play grey elephants in denmark tamhane chose to work with mostly newcomers as he did not wish to have anybody from a bollywood background we wanted people with hunger and passion who would go out of their way to get things done film also features first time actors like pradeep joshi usha bane and shirish pawar vira sathidar editor of marathi magazine was cast in role of narayan kamble just three weeks before shoot gomber played role of a defence lawyer and was selected after auditioning for part rest of cast were also selected after auditions including geetanjali kulkarni who is an alumnus of national school of drama auditions were conducted over course of nine months with nearly 1 800 people auditioning for several roles tamhane borrowed idea of using non professional actors from iranian filmmaker abbas kiarostami according to him 80 percent of cast were non professional actors who had not been filmed before tamhane and his crew members went to banks railway offices schools tea sellers snack vendors auto and taxi drivers and asked people if they would like to act in film filming court was shot in 45 days and recorded in sync sound entire film was shot without camera movements and background score for a realistic feel tamhane and desai chose real locations in mumbai for shooting film based on their look and feel and decided not to tamper with them he decided to shoot long takes with no cuts and scripted lines in a controlled manner scenes involving non professional actors were shot in 30 35 takes on an average and some scenes even took 60 takes to shoot because of actors inexperience only one scene per day was shot due to long takes that were done without any cuts or improvisations kulkarni followed a real prosecutor s body language mannerism and manner of speaking a scene in film showed a public prosecutor cross examining accused which is not allowed in real trials tamhane said that this was a deliberate decision as he had taken creative liberty to avoid hampering narrative of film he also expressed his interest towards essence of a scene instead of its technical detail during production members of anti terrorism squad came on sets claiming that there was a naxalite from nagpur in a film and searched for him sathidar was from nagpur and like his character was a human rights activist thereby making him according to tamhane politically involved crew hid him as he had not finished shooting film s main sequences and they were worried that his arrest would prevent film s completion ats had mistaken sathidar for a naxalite themes when asked about whether court is an actual depiction of indian judiciary or an exaggerated one tamhane said film actually talks about people who comprise system people who run system and structural and human failings in not just indian judiciary but any institution or any kind of a place with power dynamics according to him film also highlights aspect of immigrants snatching jobs of locals in mumbai court also has elements of black comedy like a scene where one of vora s speeches is interrupted by a man putting a pedestal fan a critic from new republic called film a welcome addition to critiques of judiciary and favorably compared it to novels bleak house 1853 and trial 1925 he elaborated that absurdity of case is similar to trial baradwaj rangan stated in his review that film is about teeming metropolis he also noted contrasting lives of vora and nutan where one lives alone speaks fluent english and drives a car other has a family does not speak fluent english and uses public transport through this analysis rangan says that film shows how people despite being from different genders classes and ethnicities converge in court film is multilingual with four languages spoken in it english hindi gujarati and marathi most of dialogues are in marathi as it is set in maharashtra and laws are read out in english defence lawyer is a gujarati and speaks gujarati language marathi lawyers for prosecution speak in marathi and english since gujarati lawyer does not understand marathi they speak with him in hindi tamhane said court is set in mumbai where people speak all four languages so it was natural to keep that in film

carried by suparna sharma of deccan chronicle wrote court doesn t caricature our reality nor does it harangue us with prescriptive chalk talk it simply trains its lens on real life parody as it plays out and shows us our world as is without exaggeration or artifice anuj kumar of hindu found film to be an accomplished piece of work surabhi redkar of koimoi called it best representation of a court room drama so far in india contrary to positive responses some critics were concerned with non professional actors and western treatment of film raja sen felt that film was better in parts than as a whole he also pointed out problem with non professional extras a constant problem with court however lies in just how ghastly film s extras are with almost every person in a non speaking role doing a jarringly bad job baradwaj rangan felt that western eye was evident in filmmaking with its wide shots in absence of camera movement we rely on other things to enliven frames people crossing roads and
