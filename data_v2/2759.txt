avatars as kurt cobain avatar in guitar hero 5 gameplay main version game is functionally similar to features of guitar hero 5 including bands composed of any combination of four instruments drop in drop out play in song menus to change difficulty and instrument and additional multiplayer modes compared to guitar hero 5 s rockfest band hero also retains band moment and band revival feature from guitar hero 5 taylor swift adam levine of maroon 5 and band no doubt have been confirmed to be playable avatars in game artists performed motion capture for their in game avatars band hero also introduced an updated revision of drum kit that shipped with guitar hero world tour many changes were made to address weight and size concerns that made assembly difficult and stand s crossbar was moved to bottom to improve leg room and allow bass pedal to be supported by it cymbals were changed to a circular shape from previous triangular design and sensitivity of drums themselves were adjusted an in game sensitivity adjustment feature is also supported in united states new controller was for a limited time exclusive to game and instrument bundles of band hero on wii xbox 360 and

tip side round pads that sit over units controls screens show a virtual drum kit on bottom and a note highway on top screen band hero for nintendo ds features ability to play same instruments as console based versions though game is compatible with ds ds lite and dsi only players on ds lite will receive full band experience due to nature of hardware extensions for unit guitar and bass parts are played with same guitar grip previously created for guitar hero on tour series though this unit will not work on nintendo dsi and nintendo 3ds due to lack of a gba slot gameplay for guitar and bass is considered to be fourth iteration of guitar hero on tour design by developers vicarious visions and have further improvements to meet with different strumming styles a new drum skin that fits over bottom half of ds unit provides four pads for drumming that map to unit s directional pad and face buttons this design was selected over use of touch screen due to inability of touch screen to recognize near simultaneous taps a factor that would have interfered with drumming experience drum skin is limited to nintendo ds lite due to skin s form factor decision to design towards ds lite rather than newer dsi was due to much larger volume of ds lite units that have been sold relative to dsi ds microphone is used for vocal parts ds has 30 of songs from console versions game also

brett ratner in same manner as previous ads for other recent guitar hero games initially paying tribute to scene in risky business with tom cruise dancing in his underwear to song old time rock and roll though it appears as if all four performed together wentz stated that swift performed her parts separately using a green screen to impose her into footage of other musicians a three song demo was made available on xbox live on october 15 2009 and included paralyzer by finger eleven picture to burn by taylor swift and walking on sunshine by katrina and waves demo was solely party mode with three songs playable in random order soundtrack console hero for consoles features 65 songs from mainstream acts game also allows guitar hero world tour s downloadable content to be used within band

compatible with world tour nor any other guitar hero game transfer process requires player to enter a unique code from world tour or smash hits manual to be able to available songs in a pack on xbox 360 or playstation 3 or individual songs on wii that have been updated to include new features players on xbox 360 can delete individual songs after downloading pack some songs are not transferable because of licensing issues not technical issues according to bright tim riley head of music licensing at activision stated that company will continue to seek licenses for more songs from previous games and downloadable content to be exported into band hero but cannot guarantee that these songs will be licensed for future guitar hero games downloadable content while band hero does not have its own separate library of downloadable content it supports downloadable content from guitar hero 5 dlc library in addition 152 of 158 available downloadable songs for guitar hero world tour are forward compatible with guitar hero 5 and band hero existing content is automatically upgraded to include all features new to these games and was immediately available to players upon release of band hero downloaded songs can be used in all game modes provided all participating players have song including in game s career mode when players are given option to select any song to play entire band hero dlc library is also available in guitar hero 5 and vice versa so both games embrace same dlc library some dlc songs have specific focus on band hero like celebrity new years track pack which includes taylor swift maroon 5 and no doubt songs and band hero track pack with miley cyrus demi lovato and selena gomez scene songs hero has received mixed to positive reviews from gaming critics most recognized game as having same feature sets as guitar hero 5 including any benefits or flaws that may come from that reviewers praised reuse of guitar hero 5 features such as party play mode that allows for players to jump in and out improved career mode and improved ghtunes some identified that target market of game appears to be towards teenage girls such as featuring of taylor swift color schemes used in game and other parts of song selection reviewers noted that setlist would be strongest measure of whether players should purchase game reviewers also commented on smaller setlist which contains only 65 songs compared to guitar hero 5 s 85 review did note that top 40 songs do not always make for challenging songs as many featured simple chord repetition throughout song or simply following pre programmed electronic keyboard or drum beats however most songs were found to feature at least one difficult instrument portion that would be fun to play reviews also noted that censoring of songs in order to affirm a family friendly rating is awkward such as censoring word whiskey from don mclean s american pie 8 times and can ruin enjoyment of some songs greg miller of ign further noted that these censoring are at odds with straight up inclusion of other songs such as gasoline by airborne toxic event which miller claims is about sex some reviews saw band hero as a good addition to guitar hero franchise and pointed out strength of game is improved in part due to ability to import and export songs between band hero guitar hero 5 and content justin haywald of 1up com in consideration of equivalent nature of featured considered that players now had a choice of top 40 band hero or hard rock guitar hero 5 skins to select for playing music on and positive direction for series however others saw simple rebranding of game and that some may see product as little more than a full price track pack game has sold 596 000 units in north america through january 2010 according to data from npd group prior to end of 2009 activision had expressed plans to publish a sequel to band hero in 2010 however as a result of overall decline in music game sales in part due to large number of skus released by activision during 2009 such plans have been shelved and activision only released sequels to guitar hero and dj hero in 2010 lawsuit by no doubt a day following band heros release band no doubt filed a lawsuit against activision in a similar manner as guitar hero 5 where avatar of kurt cobain could be used to play any of songs in game and leading to questionable virtual performances same was found to be true for no doubt avatars in band hero no doubt s lawsuit claimed their contract limited their performance to three songs within game and that they were never told their avatars would be used in that manner activision argued that it believes that manner of use of band s avatars in game is within bounds of contract activision subsequently filed a counter suit against band alleging contract breaches activision claimed that it was publicly known that in game characters in guitar hero series once unlocked could be used for all game modes and that no doubt s request came well after game s code was finalized courtney love who has expressed an intention to file legal action for cobain s appearance in guitar hero 5 said to nme that she will join no doubt in their lawsuit against activision in april 2010 los angeles county superior court denied activision s motion to dismiss no doubt s rights of publicity claims under california s anti law in february 2011 2nd district court of appeal upheld superior court s ruling allowing no doubt s case to proceed against activision in may 2012 superior court denied activision s motion for summary judgment though it also denied a preliminary injunction sought by band in october 2012 on eve of trial case was settled for undisclosed terms notes references external links official site activision
