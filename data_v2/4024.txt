jagiellon was elected king of poland he claimed to be king of sweden by paternal inheritance but was never able to gain possession of throne his titles were longest of any polish king ever life wladyslaw iv s father sigismund iii vasa grandson of sweden s king gustav i had succeeded his father to swedish throne in 1592 only to be deposed in 1599 by his uncle subsequently king charles ix this resulted in a long standing feud with polish kings of house of vasa claiming swedish throne this led to polish swedish war of 1600 29 and later to deluge of 1655 childhood thumb left 150px prince wladyslaw aged about 10 ca 1605 alt prince wladyslaw aged about 10 ca 1605 marriage of anne of austria to sigismund iii was a traditional politically motivated marriage intended to tie young house of vasa to prestigious habsburgs wladyslaw was born 9 june 1595 at king s summer residence in near krakow a few months after main wawel castle had been consumed by fire wladyslaw s mother died on 10 february 1598 less than three years after giving birth to him he was raised by one of her former ladies of court urszula who eventually became a powerful player at royal court with much influence wladyslaw s hofmeister was michal konarski a polish prussian noble around early 17th century urszula lost much of her influence as wladyslaw gained new teachers and mentors such as priests gabriel andrzej and marek and in military matters zygmunt kazanowski much of his curriculum was likely designed by priest piotr skarga much respected by iii wladyslaw studied for several years in krakow academy and for two years in rome at age of 10 wladyslaw received his own prince court wladyslaw formed a friendship with adam kazanowski and his brother stanislaw it is reported that young wladyslaw was interested in arts later this led to him becoming an important patron of arts he spoke and wrote in german italian and latin wladyslaw was liked by szlachta polish nobility but his father s plans to secure him throne of poland vivente rege were unpopular and eventually crushed in zebrzydowski rebellion rokosz tsar thumb young wladyslaw alt young wladyslaw with intensification of polish intervention in muscovy in 1609 royal family moved to their residence in vilnius capital of grand duchy of lithuania there he witnessed fire of vilnius which required royal family to evacuate their residence in vilnius castle shortly afterwards that year wladyslaw aged 15 was elected tsar by muscovy s aristocracy council of seven boyars who overthrew tsar vasily shuysky during polish muscovite war and muscovy s time of troubles his election was ruined by his father sigismund who aimed to convert muscovy s population from orthodox religion to catholicism sigismund refused to agree to boyar s request to send prince wladyslaw to moscow and his conversion to orthodoxy instead sigismund proposed that he should reign as a regent in muscovy instead this unrealistic proposal led to a resumption of hostilities briefly beginning in 1610 wladyslaw struck muscovite silver and gold coins in russian mints in moscow and novgorod with his titulary tsar and grand prince vladislav of all russia wladyslaw tried to regain tsar s throne himself organizing a campaign in 1616 despite some military victories he was unable to capture moscow commonwealth gained some disputed territories in truce of deulino but wladyslaw was never able to reign in russia throne during this time was instead held by tsar michael romanov he held on to title without any real power until 1634 likely failure of this campaign showed wladyslaw limits of royal power in poland as major factors for failure included significant autonomy of military commanders which did not see wladyslaw as their superior and lack of funds for army as polish parliament sejm refused to subsidize war prince thumb left 200px wladyslaw iv in an 18th century portrait by marcello bacciarelli before he was elected king of commonwealth wladyslaw fought in many campaigns seeking personal glory after his final campaign against russians in 1617 1618 end of dymitriads in 1619 he went to silesia looking for an opportunity to aid habsburgs in their struggle against czech in thirty years war that opportunity never came but from that point onward wladyslaw had a good relationship with george william elector of brandenburg following year wladyslaw took part in second phase of polish ottoman war a consequence of long series of struggles between poland and ottomans over moldavia in 1621 wladyslaw was one of polish commanders at battle of chocim reportedly he was struck ill but despite that he proved a voice of reason convincing other polish commanders there to stay and fight his advice was correct and battle eventually ended with a peace treaty that returned status quo from before ottoman invasion this peace treaty also gave wladyslaw an international reputation as a defender of christian faith and increased his popularity in commonwealth itself thumb 250px art collection of prince wladyslaw vasa royal castle in warsaw according to artist s signature painted in warsaw in 1626 depicts treasures purchased by prince during his journey across europe in 1623 while near gdansk danzig he witnessed arrogant attitude of gustavus adolphus whose navy took opportunity of its sea superiority to demand concessions from gdansk commonwealth had no navy in 1624 king sigismund decided that time had come for wladyslaw to travel like many of his peers to western europe for security reasons wladyslaw traveled under a fake name from polish meaning sheaf as seen in vasa s coat of arms in his voyage 1624 1625 he was accompanied by stanislaw radziwill and other less notable courtiers first he travelled to wroclaw breslau then munich where he met maximilian i elector of bavaria in brussels he met infanta isabella clara eugenia of spain in antwerp rubens near breda he met ambrosio spinola it was during his stay with spinola that he was impressed by western military techniques this was later reflected when he became king as military matters were always important to him while not a military genius and surpassed by his contemporary commonwealth hetman stanislaw koniecpolski wladyslaw was known as a fairly skillful commander on his own in rome he was welcomed by pope urban viii who congratulated him on his fighting against ottomans during his stay in florence he was impressed by opera and decided to bring this form of art to commonwealth where it was previously unknown in genoa and venice he was impressed by local shipyards and in pisa he witnessed a specially organized mock naval battle experiences that resulted in his later attempt to create polish lithuanian commonwealth navy after returning to poland he fought in 1626 against swedes in last phase of polish swedish war where he took part in battle of gniew his involvement in this conflict which lasted till truce of altmark in 1629 was rather limited and he spent much time in other parts of country during that period and afterward he lobbied for support of his candidature for polish throne as his father sigismund was getting more advanced in his age and succession to polish throne did not occur through inheritance but rather through process of royal elections while wladyslaw and his father sigismund tried to ensure wladyslaw s election during sigismund s life this was not a popular option for nobility and it repeatedly failed up to and including at sejm of 1631 sigismund suffered a sudden heart attack on 23 april 1632 and died in morning hours of 30 april forcing issue to be taken up again king thumb 200px wladyslaw iv by pieter ca 1634 election sejm of 1632 eventually chose wladyslaw there were no other serious contenders decision reached on 8 november but as pacta conventa were not yet ready official announcement was delayed until 13 november in pacta conventa wladyslaw pledged himself to fund a military school and equipment to find a way to fund a navy to maintain current alliances not to raise armies give offices or military ranks to foreigners negotiate peace treaties or declare war without sejm s approval not to take a wife without senate s approval to convince his brothers to take an oath to commonwealth and to transfer profits from royal mint to royal treasury rather than to a private treasury when election result was announced by crown grand marshal lukasz szlachta nobility who had taken part in election began festivities in honor of new king which lasted three hours wladyslaw was crowned in wawel cathedral in krakow on 6 february in following year military campaigns in an attempt to take advantage of confusion expected after death of polish king tsar michael i of russia invaded commonwealth a muscovite army crossed commonwealth eastern frontier in october 1632 and laid siege to smolensk which was ceded to poland by russia in 1618 at end of wars in war against russia in 1632 1634 smolensk war wladyslaw broke siege in september 1633 and then in turn surrounded russian army under mikhail shein which was then forced to surrender on 1 march 1634 thumb left polish lithuanian commonwealth during reign of wladyslaw iv ca 1635 during that campaign wladyslaw started modernisation program of commonwealth army emphasising usage of modern infantry and artillery wladyslaw proved to be a good tactician and his innovations in use of artillery and fortifications based on western ideas greatly contributed to eventual polish lithuanian success king wladyslaw wanted to continue war or because polish swedish treaty of altmark would soon be expiring ally with russians to strike against sweden however sejm wanted no more conflict as stanislaw lubienski bishop of plock wrote two weeks after shein s surrender our happiness is in remaining within our borders guaranteeing health and well being resulting peace of treaty of polanow favourable to poland confirmed pre war territorial status quo muscovy also agreed to pay 20 000 rubles in exchange for wladyslaw s renunciation of all claims to tsardom and return of royal insignia which were in commonwealth possession since dymitriads following smolensk campaign commonwealth was threatened by another attack by ottoman empire during wars against ottomans in 1633 1634 wladyslaw moved commonwealth army south of muscovy border where under command of hetman stanislaw koniecpolski it forced turks to renew a peace treaty in resulting treaty both countries agreed again to curb border raids by cossacks and tatars and ottomans confirmed that commonwealth to be an independent power and had not to pay tribute to empire after southern campaign commonwealth had to deal with a threat from north as armistice ending polish swedish war 1600 1629 was expiring majority of polish nobles preferred to solve problem through negotiations unwilling to pay taxes for a new war provided that sweden was open to negotiations and concessions in particular to retreat from occupied polish coastal territories wladyslaw himself was hoping for a war which could yield some more significant territorial gains and even managed to gather a sizeable army with navy elements near disputed territories sweden weakened by involvement in thirty years war was however open to a peaceful solution wladyslaw could not go against decision of sejm and senate and agreed to support treaty thus both sides agreed to sign armistice of stuhmsdorf on 12 september 1635 favourable to commonwealth which regained prussian territories and called for a reduction of swedish tolls on maritime trade politics in three months between his election and coronation wladyslaw sounded waters regarding possibility of a peaceful succession to swedish throne following recent death of gustavus adolphus but this as well as his proposal to mediate between sweden and its enemies was rejected primarily by swedish chancellor and head of regency council axel oxenstierna wladyslaw iv owed nominal allegiance to imperial habsburgs as a member of order of golden fleece his relationship with habsburgs was relatively strong although he was not above carrying some negotiations with their enemies like france he refused cardinal richelieu s 1635 proposal of an alliance and a full out war against them despite potential lure of territorial gains in silesia he realized that such a move would cause much unrest in a heavily catholic commonwealth that he likely lacked authority and power to push such a change of policy through sejm and that resulting conflict would be very difficult from 1636 onward for next few years wladyslaw strengthened his ties with habsburgs in meantime wladyslaw still tried to take a leading role in european politics and negotiate a peaceful settlement to thirty years war a settlement which he hoped would ease his way into regaining swedish crown following armistice of stuhmsdorf wladyslaw came to increasingly realize that his prospects for regaining swedish throne were dim in years 1636 1638 he proposed several reforms to strengthen his and his dynasty s power in commonwealth his first plan was an attempt to secure a hereditary province within country which would not be threatened by possible power shift following a future royal election this however did not gain sufficient support in sejm next wladyslaw attempted to create an order of chivalry similar to order of golden fleece but this plan was scuttled down as well with szlachta and magnates seeing this as an attempt to create a royal loyalist elite and traditionally opposing anything that could lead to reduction of their extensive power popular vote and opposition also resulted in failure of plan to raise taxes from trade tariffs here it was not only nobility but even merchants and burghers from towns like gdansk danzig who were able to muster enough support including from foreign powers to stop king s reforms in fact defeat of his plans was so total that he was forced to make certain conciliatory gestures to nobility as sejm passed several laws constraining his authority such as to hire foreign troops further indicating limits of royal power in commonwealth marriages early in his reign there were plans regarding a marriage of wladyslaw and princess elisabeth of bohemia princess palatine daughter of frederick v elector palatine this was however unpopular both with catholic nobles and catholic church and when it became clear to wladyslaw that this would not convince swedes to elect him to their throne this plan with quiet support from wladyslaw himself was dropped left thumb upright wladyslaw iv in later life ferdinand ii holy roman emperor s proposal of marriage between wladyslaw and archduchess cecilia renata of austria sister of future ferdinand iii holy roman emperor arrived in warsaw somewhere during spring 1636 in june that year wladyslaw sent jerzy ossolinski to imperial court to work on improving imperial commonwealth relations king s trusted confessor father walerian magni of franciscan religious order and voivode kasper arrived in regensburg on 26 october 1636 with consent and performed negotiations archduchess dowry was agreed for 100 000 zloty s emperor also promised to pay dowries of both of siegmund iii s wives anna and additionally son of wladyslaw and cecilia renata was to obtain duchy of opole and raciborz in silesia duchy of opole and raciborz however before everything was confirmed and signed ferdinand ii died and ferdinand iii backed from giving silesian duchy to son of wladyslaw instead a dowry was awarded to be secured by bohemian estates of trebon trebon on 16 march 1637 a family alliance was signed between habsburgs and polish branch of house of vasa wladyslaw promised not to sign any pacts against habsburgs and to transfer his rights to swedish throne in case of his line s extinction in return habsburg promised to support his efforts to regain swedish crown and to transfer to him some territory in case of gains in a war against ottomans marriage took place in 1637 on 12 september thumb upright portrait of wladyslaw iv by frans ca 1640 next few years were similarly unsuccessful with regards to his plans eventually he tried to bypass opposition in sejm with secret alliances dealings and intrigues but did not prove successful those plans included schemes such as supporting holy roman emperor s raid on inflanty in 1639 which he hoped would lead to a war an attempted alliance with spain against france in 1640 1641 and in 1641 1643 with denmark against sweden on international scene he attempted to mediate between various religious factions of christianity using tolerant image of commonwealth to portray himself as neutral mediator he organized a conference in torun thorn that begun on 28 january 1645 but it failed to reach any meaningful conclusions alt ceremony of contract of marriage thumb ceremony of

karol i gonzaga prince de nevers in 1646 wladyslaw s last plan was to orchestrate a major war between european powers and ottoman empire border with empire was in a near constant state of low level warfare some historians estimate that in first half of 17th century ottoman raids and wars resulted in loss death or enslavement of about 300 000 commonwealth citizens in borderlands war wladyslaw hoped would also solve problem of unrest among cossacks a militant group living in ukraine near ottoman border who could find worth in such a campaign and turn their attention to fighting for commonwealth instead of against it as usual he failed to inspire nobility rarely willing to consider sponsoring another war to agree to this plan he received more support from foreign powers from rome venice and muscovy with promise of funds for war wladyslaw started recruiting troops among cossacks in 1646 opposition of sejm demanding that he dismiss troops coupled with wladyslaw s worsening health crippled that plan as well wladyslaw still did not give up and attempted to resurrect plan in 1647 and with support of magnate jeremi wisniowiecki who organized military exercises near ottoman border attempted unsuccessfully to provoke ottomans to attack on 9 august 1647 his young son sigismund casimir then seven years old suddenly fell ill and died death of his only legitimate heir to

people s person able to charm many of those who interacted with him on other hand he had a short temper and when angered could act without considering all consequences wladyslaw was criticized for being a spendthrift he lived lavishly spending more than his royal court treasury could afford he also dispensed much wealth among his courtiers who were seen by people farther from court as taking advantage of king he has also been known to maintain several mistresses throughout his life including during his married period patronage thumb left 150px loving cup of king wladyslaw iv held at kunsthistorisches museum in vienna one of king s most substantial achievements was in cultural sphere he became a notable patron of arts wladyslaw was a connoisseur of arts in particular theater and music he spoke several languages enjoyed reading historical literature and poetry he collected paintings and created a notable gallery of paintings in warsaw castle wladyslaw assembled an important collection of italian and flemish baroque paintings much of which were lost in wars after his death he sponsored many musicians and in 1637 created first amphitheater in palace first theater in poland where during his reign dozens of operas and ballets were performed he is credited with bringing very genre of opera to poland wladyslaw s attention to theater contributed to spread of this art form in poland he was also interested in poetry as well as in cartography and historical and scientific works he corresponded with galileo notable painters and engravers wladyslaw supported and who attended

various reasons most of them ended in failure during his 16 year reign though his grand international political plans failed he did improve commonwealth foreign policy supporting establishment of a network of permanent diplomatic agents in important european countries throughout his life wladyslaw successfully defended poland against foreign invasions he was recognized as a good tactician and strategist who did much to modernize polish army wladyslaw ensured that officer corps was significantly large so that army could be expanded introduced foreign western infantry to polish army with its pikes and early firearms and supported expansion of artillery his attempt to create a polish lithuanian commonwealth navy resulted in creation of a new port village despite promising beginnings

6 protestant members at time of his death it had 11 despite his support for religious tolerance he did fail however to resolve conflict stemming from union of brest split despite his support for protestants he did not stop growing tide of intolerance either in poland or abroad as shown by fate of racovian academy or an international disagreement between faiths neither did he get involved with disagreement about orthodox cossacks a group that he respected and counted on in his plans in internal politics he attempted to strengthen power of monarchy but this was mostly thwarted by szlachta who valued their independence and democratic powers wladyslaw suffered continuing difficulties caused by efforts of polish sejm parliament to check king s power and limit his dynastic ambitions wladyslaw was fed up with weak position of king in commonwealth his politics included attempting to secure a small preferably hereditary territory like a duchy where his position would be much stronger wladyslaw used title of king of sweden although he had no control over sweden whatsoever and never set foot in that country however he continued his attempts to regain swedish throne with similar lack of results as his father he might have been willing to trade his claim away but offer was never put down in negotiations some historians see wladyslaw as a dreamer who could not stick to one policy and upon running into first difficulties ditched it and looked for another opportunity perhaps it was due to this that wladyslaw was never able to inspire those he ruled to support at least in any significant manner any of his plans wladyslaw czaplinski in his biography of king is more understanding noting short period of his reign 16 years and weakness of royal position he was forced to deal with several years after his death a diplomatic mission from muscovy demanded that publications about wladyslaw s victories in smolensk war of 1633 1634 be collected and burned eventually to much controversy their demand was met polish historian maciej noted under reign of wladyslaw iv such a shameful event would have never been allowed ancestry see also history of poland 1569 1795 golden
