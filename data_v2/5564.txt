typhoon nora known in philippines as typhoon luming was fourth most intense tropical cyclone on record originating from an area of low pressure over western pacific nora was first identified as a tropical depression on october 2 1973 tracking generally westward system gradually intensified attaining typhoon status following evening after turning northwestward typhoon underwent a period of rapid intensification during which its central pressure decreased by 77 mb hpa 2 27 inhg in 24 hours at end of this phase nora peaked with winds of 295 km h 185 mph and a pressure of 877 mb hpa 25 91 inhg making it most intense tropical cyclone on record alongside typhoon ida in 1958 at time however this pressure has since been surpassed by three other typhoons and one hurricane typhoon subsequently weakened and turned northwestward as it approached philippines after brushing luzon on october 7 system passed south of taiwan and ultimately made landfall in china on october 10 once onshore nora quickly weakened and dissipated following day philippines and taiwan sustained most extensive losses from typhoon nora with 36 people losing their lives collectively in former more than 1 million residents were left homeless as high winds and flooding wrecked homes damage in country reached 2 million 1973 usd in taiwan more than 1 000 homes were destroyed and 8 000 people were left homeless typhoon was also responsible for several maritime incidents that killed at least four people meteorological history on september 30 a weak surface low developed within monsoon trough about 195 km 120 mi south of yap drifting northwestward system gradually organized into a tropical depression by october 2 later that day aircraft reconnaissance revealed system to have intensified into a tropical storm at which time it was assigned name nora system s movement soon became slow and erratic with nora executing a counter clockwise loop on october 3 after completing loop it attained typhoon status and acquired a temporary northward trajectory due to cyclone s proximity to philippines philippine atmospheric geophysical and astronomical services administration also monitored storm and assigned it with local name luming late on october 4 nora began to undergo a period of rapid intensification several aircraft reconnaissance missions were flown by u s air force 54th weather reconnaissance squadron into storm between october 5 and 6 documenting typhoon s dramatic strengthening by evening of october 5 nora had attained winds in excess of 260 km h 160 mph ranking it as a category 5 equivalent super typhoon on saffir simpson hurricane scale a recon mission into storm at this time revealed concentric eyewalls measured at and initially aircraft was unable to penetrate into core of eye due to severe turbulence however they were successful after a second attempt once inside eye they discovered an almost cloud free center with an amphitheater or bowl like appearance stratocumulus clouds were suppressed to an unusually low altitude of core of nora was exceptionally warm with temperatures reaching a near record at 700 mb level at 0020 utc on october 6 a dropsonde released by reconnaissance team recorded a surface pressure of 877 mb hpa 25 91 inhg just inside eyewall of typhoon at this time maximum winds were estimated to have peaked at 295 km h 185 mph this intensity ranked nora as most intense tropical cyclone on record in world alongside typhoon ida in 1958 however in post storm analysis it was noted that since dropsonde did not record a pressure at storm s center nora was likely slightly stronger than indicated since then nora s intensity has been surpassed by three other storms typhoon june in 1975 typhoon tip in 1979 and hurricane patricia in 2015 despite storm s extreme intensity it quickly began to weaken as it approached philippines on october 6 within ten hours pressure rose to 894 mb hpa 26 40 inhg and later dropped below category 5 status that morning nora turned more northwesterly in response to a weakening in a subtropical ridge and an approaching shortwave trough over china steady weakening continued over following days with storm brushing northeastern tip of luzon philippines with winds of 175 185 km h 110 115 mph on october 7 nora s intensity leveled out around 130 km h 80 mph on october 8 as it tracked between philippines and taiwan after passing within 95 km 60 mi of taiwan nora turned more northerly before making landfall near xiamen fujian as a minimal typhoon early on october 10 once onshore storm rapidly degenerated into an area of low pressure before dissipating following day preparations and impact prior to typhoon s arrival in philippines all domestic flights in and out of manila were cancelled however international travel was unaffected united states air force also moved its planes from clark air base to other bases in asia additionally all schools in manila were closed brushing coast of luzon in philippines as a category 3 equivalent typhoon nora caused considerable damage in region gale force winds were measured across much of western luzon with a peak reading of at manila port these winds caused scattered power and communication losses throughout peninsula city of baguio population 100 000 lost power for approximately six hours crop losses were extensive with storm striking close to harvest time heavy rains from storm peaking at in baguio triggered significant flooding and caused a breach in dike in apalit pampanga eight towns along a 45 km 30 mi stretch downstream were flooded however roads remained passable flooding in manila also prompted evacuation of 400 residents in caloocan a child died after being electrocuted by downed wires across philippines 24 people were killed and over 1 million were left homeless damage to crops and property reached 2 million 1973 usd nora was first of three typhoons to impact philippines in span of a week with patsy and ruth striking country on october 12 and 15 respectively while passing south of taiwan rough seas spawned by typhoon were responsible for several maritime incidents over taiwan strait and south china sea philippine freighter asian mariner though all 38 crewmen were rescued greek freighter baltic capsized about 150 km 90 mi southwest of penghu islands with three crewmen confirmed dead and several others missing and presumed dead additionally taiwanese fishing vessel jai tai became stranded amid seas with its bow split open one of crew perished however frigate uss worden was able to rescue seven fishermen despite dangerous seas as storm neared landfall in china two ships became stranded over south china sea and sent out distress signals passing within 95 km 60 mi of taiwan storm brought gale force winds and torrential rain to island a peak gust of was measured in penghu islands most significant impacts came from rains which amounted to in over a 20 hour span widespread flooding and many landslides destroyed at least 1 000 homes and washed out bridges roads and railroads twelve people lost their lives and twenty eight others were reported missing additionally 8 000 people were left homeless in hong kong typhoon produced gusty winds peaking at 95 km h 60 mph though no rainfall was recorded although nora struck china as a typhoon there were no
