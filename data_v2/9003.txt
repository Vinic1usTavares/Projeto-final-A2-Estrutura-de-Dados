years and crown prince of prussia for twenty seven years frederick was suffering from cancer of larynx when he died aged fifty six following unsuccessful medical treatments for his condition frederick married victoria princess royal eldest daughter of queen victoria of united kingdom couple were well matched their shared liberal ideology led them to seek greater representation for commoners in government frederick in spite of his conservative militaristic family background had developed liberal tendencies as a result of his ties with britain and his studies at university of bonn as crown prince he often opposed conservative chancellor otto von bismarck particularly in speaking out against bismarck s policy of uniting germany through force and in urging that power of chancellorship be curbed liberals in both germany and britain hoped that as emperor frederick iii would move to liberalize german empire frederick and victoria were great admirers of prince albert queen victoria s husband they planned to rule as consorts like albert and queen victoria and to reform what they saw as flaws in executive branch that bismarck had created for himself office of chancellor responsible to emperor would be replaced with a british style cabinet with ministers responsible to reichstag government policy would be based on consensus of cabinet frederick described imperial constitution as ingeniously contrived chaos balfour p 69 according to michael balfour however frederick s illness prevented him from effectively establishing policies and measures to achieve this and such moves as he was able to make were later abandoned by his son and successor wilhelm ii timing of frederick s death and length of his reign are important topics among historians his premature demise is considered a

oster pp 60 65 thumb right crown prince frederick william of prussia 1867 by oskar frederick grew up during a tumultuous political period as concept of liberalism in germany which evolved during 1840s was gaining widespread and enthusiastic support p 43 liberals sought a unified germany and were constitutional monarchists who desired a constitution to ensure equal protection under law protection of property and safeguarding of basic civil rights sperber p 64 overall liberals desired a government ruled by popular representation when frederick was 17 these emergent nationalistic and liberal sentiments sparked a series of political uprisings across german states and elsewhere in europe in germany their goal was to protect freedoms such as freedom of assembly and freedom of press and to create a german parliament and constitution sperber pp 128 129 although uprisings ultimately brought about no lasting changes liberal sentiments remained an influential force in german politics throughout frederick s life rohl 1998 p 554 despite value placed by hohenzollern family on a traditional military education augusta insisted that her son also receive a classical education accordingly frederick was thoroughly tutored in both military traditions and liberal arts his private tutor was ernst curtius a famous archaeologist frederick was a talented student particularly good at foreign

into first infantry regiment of guards as he grew older he was expected to maintain an active involvement in military affairs mueller bohn p 14 however at age of 18 he broke with family tradition and entered university of bonn where he studied history law and governance and public policy during his time at bonn 1850 1852 his teachers included ernst moritz arndt and friedrich christoph dahlmann his time spent at university coupled with influence of less conservative family members were instrumental in his embrace of liberal beliefs nichols p 7 in 1853 frederick was initiated into freemasonry by

long treasured baron stockmar s idea of a marriage alliance between britain and prussia van der kiste p 16 frederick s father prince william had no interest in arrangement hoping instead for a russian grand duchess as his daughter in law however princess augusta was greatly in favour of a match for her son that would bring closer connections with britain in 1851 his mother sent frederick to england ostensibly to visit great exhibition but in truth she hoped that cradle of liberalism and home of industrial revolution would have a positive influence on her son prince albert took frederick under his wing during his stay but it was albert s daughter only eleven at time who guided german prince around exhibition frederick only knew a few words of english while victoria could converse fluently in german he was impressed by her mix of innocence intellectual curiosity and simplicity and their meeting proved to be a success a regular exchange of letters between victoria and frederick followed

of sixty four van der kiste p 61 he regularly clashed with diet over policies in september 1862 one such disagreement almost led to frederick being crowned and replacing his father as king william threatened to abdicate when diet refused to fund his plans for army s reorganization frederick was appalled by this action and said that an abdication would constitute a threat to dynasty country and crown pakula p 168 william reconsidered and instead on advice of minister of war albrecht von roon appointed otto von bismarck who had offered to push through military reform even against majority of diet as minister president appointment of bismarck an authoritarian who would often ignore or overrule diet set frederick on a collision course with his father and led to his exclusion from affairs of state for rest of william s reign frederick insisted on bloodless moral conquests unifying germany by liberal and peaceful means but it was bismarck s policy of blood and iron that prevailed his protests against william s rule peaked at danzig on 4 june 1863 where at an official reception in city he loudly denounced bismarck s restrictions on freedom of press dorpalen p 11 kollander pp 38 pp

afterward frederick gave a speech denouncing anti semitic movement in germany as a shameful blot on our time adding that we are ashamed of persecution of jews which has broken all bounds of decency in berlin but which seems to flourish under protection of court clerics in 1881 frederick and victoria again attended a synagogue service this time in wiesbaden to demonstrate as clearly as we can what our convictions are frederick followed this up by giving a speech in which he spoke out for poor ill treated jews of europe frederick s mother in law queen victoria wrote to thank him for his speech

caused by a chronic laryngeal catarrh on 7 february frederick consulted a doctor karl gerhardt who scraped a wire across membrane for 10 days in an attempt to remove thickened tissue after procedure proved unsuccessful gerhardt left vocal cord with an electric wire on 15 march in an attempt to remove what was then thought to be a vocal fold nodule due to frederick s highly inflamed throat gerhardt was unable to remove entire growth after several cauterisations and with no signs of improvement frederick and his wife went to spa of bad ems where he drank mineral waters and underwent a regimen of and inhaling fresh air with no effect on 17 may gerhardt and other doctors including ernst von bergmann diagnosed growth as laryngeal cancer bergmann recommended consulting a leading british cancer specialist morell mackenzie he also recommended a to gain better access to inside of larynx followed by complete removal of larynx a total laryngectomy if situation proved serious while victoria was informed of need for an immediate operation frederick was not told despite tentative diagnosis of cancer doctors hoped growth would prove to be a benign a room on top floor of crown prince s palace was then equipped as an operating theatre but bergmann elected to put operation on hold until mackenzie could provide his assessment rohl 1998 pp 647 648 mackenzie arrived in berlin on 20 may but after examining frederick recommended a biopsy of growth to determine whether or not it was malignant he conducted biopsy following morning after which he sent tissue samples to distinguished pathologist rudolf virchow for microscopic examination when virchow was unable to detect any cancerous cells despite several separate analyses mackenzie declared his opposition to a laryngectomy being performed as he felt it would be invariably fatal and said he would assume charge of case he gave his assurance that frederick would fully recover in a few months rohl 1998 pp 649 650 while gerhardt and physician general august wegner concurred with mackenzie bergmann and his colleague adalbert held to their original diagnosis of cancer in addition to mackenzie s opinion bismarck strongly opposed any major operation on frederick s throat and pressed kaiser to veto it on 9 june mackenzie again biopsied growth and sent samples to virchow who reported following day that he was again unable to detect any signs of cancer on 13 june crown prince left potsdam for london to attend his mother in law s golden jubilee and to consult mackenzie he never saw his father alive

nearly entire growth rohl 1998 p 654 frederick spent july with his family at norris castle on isle of wight however when frederick visited mackenzie s office on 2 august for a follow up examination growth had reappeared necessitating its same day and again on 8 august an ominous indication that it was indeed malignant felix semon a distinguished german throat specialist with a practice in england and who had been closely following frederick s case submitted a report to german foreign secretary in which he strongly criticised mackenzie s cauterisations and gave his opinion that growth if not malignant was suspect and should continue to be biopsied and examined rohl 1998 pp 656 657 on 9 august frederick travelled to braemar in scottish highlands with dr mark hovell a senior surgeon at throat hospital in london although a further examination by mackenzie on 20 august revealed no sign of a recurrent growth frederick said he had constant feeling of something not right inside nonetheless he requested queen victoria to knight mackenzie who duly received a knighthood in september rohl 1998 pp 658 659 despite operations on his throat and having taken sea air at cowes frederick remained hoarse and was advised by mackenzie to spend coming winter on italian riviera in august following reports that his father was gravely ill he considered returning to germany but was

frederick s lack of visible improvement after a brief meeting with frederick in munich philipp prince of eulenburg consulted distinguished laryngologist max joseph oertel who urged a drastic and thorough operation on frederick s throat and said he suspected a benign tumour which could soon become malignant rohl 1998 pp 662 663 by this time mackenzie s treatment of frederick was generating strong criticism after a fortnight in toblach mackenzie arrived to reexamine frederick who had continued to suffer from colds and hoarseness in public however doctor remained largely unconcerned and attributed hoarseness to a momentary chill however he recommended that frederick should leave toblach for venice to be followed by victoria weather soon turned cold and frederick s throat caused him pain for which he received cocaine injections rohl 1998 pp 664 666 thumb right professor ernst von bergmann who attended to frederick throughout his illness upon arriving in venice frederick again caught cold privately mackenzie was growing seriously concerned having observed a continued tendency for frederick s throat and larynx to swell he forbade frederick from speaking at any length noting that if crown prince insisted on speaking and contracted further colds he could give him no more than three months to live at beginning of october victoria noted that fritz s throat is giving no cause for fresh anxiety he really does take a little more care and speaks a little less rohl 1998 pp 671 673 on 6 october frederick his family and mackenzie left for a villa at baveno on shore of lake maggiore with mackenzie leaving baveno on 8 october after predicting frederick s recovery in 3 or 4 months wrote victoria their elder son wilhelm joined them at baveno on 17 october for frederick s 56th birthday following day at end of october frederick s condition abruptly worsened with victoria writing to her mother on 2 november that frederick s throat was again inflamed but not due to any cold and that he was very hoarse again and easily became depressed about his health general alfred von waldersee observed that frederick s health had grave implications as if william died soon and his son succeeded a new kaiser who is not allowed to speak is a virtual impossibility quite apart from fact that we desperately need a highly energetic one his son wilhelm reported to king albert of saxony that his father was frequently short tempered and melancholic though his voice appeared to have slightly improved and that frederick s throat was being treated by blowing in a powder twice a day to soothe larynx on 3 november frederick and his entourage departed for san remo at san remo two days later on 5 november frederick entirely lost his voice and experienced severe pain throughout his throat rohl 1998 pp 690 691 upon examination dr hovell discovered a new growth under left vocal cord when news reached william and german government it caused great consternation following day mackenzie issued a bulletin stating that while there was no immediate danger to crown prince his illness had unfortunately taken an unfavourable turn and that he had requested advice from other specialists including austrian professor of laryngology leopold schrotter and dr hermann krause of berlin on 9 november schrotter and krause diagnosed new growth as malignant and said it was unlikely frederick could live another year all doctors in attendance including mackenzie now concluded that frederick s disease was indeed laryngeal cancer as new lesions had appeared on right side of larynx and that an immediate and total laryngectomy was required to save his life moritz schmidt one of doctors subsequently said that earlier growths found in may had also been cancerous rohl 1998 pp 694 697 frederick was devastated by news bursting into tears upon being informed by mackenzie and crying to think i should have such a horrid disgusting illness i had so hoped to have been of use to my country why is heaven so cruel to me what have i done to be thus stricken and condemned pakula p 448 even at this stage however frederick in a private discussion with his wife decided against laryngectomy as it was itself highly risky he sent his doctors a written statement that he would remain in italy and would only submit to a tracheotomy if he was at risk of suffocating due to his condition news was greeted with shock in berlin and generated further hatred against victoria now seen as a domineering foreigner who was manipulating her husband some politicians suggested that frederick be made to relinquish his position in line of succession in favour of his son wilhelm but bismarck firmly stated that frederick would succeed his ailing father whether he is ill or not and whether k is then unable permanently to perform his duties would then be determined per relevant provisions of prussian constitution rohl 1998 pp 702 705 despite renewed diagnosis of cancer frederick s condition appeared to improve after 5 november and he became more optimistic through january 1888 there remained some hope that diagnosis was incorrect both frederick and victoria retained their faith in mackenzie who reexamined frederick s throat several times in december and gave a good prognosis again doubting whether growths had been cancerous rohl 1998 pp 699 701 on 26 december 1887 frederick wrote that his chronic catarrh appeared to be taking a turn for better and that a further bond has been forged between our people and myself may god preserve it by giving me when i resume my duties capacity to prove myself worthy of great trust that has been shown me a week later however on 5 january 1888 his hoarseness and swelling under his left vocal cord returned with previously unaffected right side of his throat becoming inflamed rohl 1998 pp 773 777 he ran high fevers and began coughing violently with his breathing becoming more laboured doctors diagnosed an infection of throat membrane frederick again became unable to speak and suffered violent headaches and insomnia on 29 january mackenzie returned to san remo from a trip to spain and after examining his patient recommended an immediate tracheotomy rohl 1998 pp 778 782 operation was conducted at 4 p m on 8 february by which time frederick was continually suffering from insomnia and embarrassing bouts of suffocation a cannula was fitted to allow frederick to breathe sinclair p 204 for remainder of his life he was unable to speak and often communicated through writing dorpalen p 27 during operation dr bergmann almost killed him by missing incision in trachea and forcing cannula into wrong place mackenzie pp 200 201 frederick started to cough and bleed and bergmann placed his forefinger into wound to enlarge it bleeding subsided after two hours but bergmann s actions resulted in an abscess in frederick s neck producing pus which would give frederick discomfort for remaining months of his life later frederick would ask why did bergmann put his finger in my throat and complain that bergmann ill treated me even after tracheotomy frederick continued to run high fevers and suffered from headaches and insomnia his violent coughing continued bringing up bloody sputum apart from mackenzie other doctors led by bergmann now held firm opinion that crown prince s disease was cancer and that it had possibly spread to his lungs diagnosis of laryngeal cancer was conclusively confirmed on 6 march when anatomist professor wilhelm waldeyer who had come to san remo examined frederick s sputum under a microscope and confirmed presence of so called bodies from a cancerous new growth that was in larynx he further said that there were no signs of any growths in lungs though it finally settled question waldeyer s diagnosis threw all of mackenzie s treatment of frederick into doubt diagnosis and treatment of frederick s fatal illness caused some medical controversy well into next century

liberal monarch frederick iii other historians including wilhelm mommsen and arthur rosenberg oppose idea that frederick could have or would have liberalized germany they believe that he would not have dared to oppose both his father and bismarck to change germany s course a natural soldier he was steeped in his family s strong military tradition and had happily reported to his father since he joined army at age of ten andreas dorpalen notes that frederick had complied with most of william s and bismarck s policies early in his life and would have been unlikely to change his behaviour dorpalen p 18 according to arthur rosenberg despite his liberal tendencies frederick still firmly believed in bismarck and his system rosenberg p 34 with dorpalen adding that in any case frederick had too weak and ineffectual a character to have brought about real change regardless of how long he reigned dorpalen p 4 james j sheehan states that political climate and party system of germany during that period were too steeped in old ways for frederick to overcome with liberalization sheehan p 216 dorpalen also observes that frederick s liberal persona may have been exaggerated after his death to keep liberal movement strong in germany dorpalen p 30 and he points out that many mistakes made by wilhelm ii helped to paint his father in a more favorable light dorpalen p 31 frederick s children wilhelm in particular held various political positions and greatly influenced europe unlike his father wilhelm had not personally experienced horrors of war and he enthusiastically embraced his family s military heritage coming under bismarck s tutelage chancellor who disapproved of frederick s and victoria s liberal ways felt bound to increase tensions between wilhelm and his parents feuchtwanger p 243 wilhelm grew up full of disdain for their opinions on government shortly after his father s death he proclaimed that he would follow path of his grandfather william i and made no reference to frederick iii kollander p 178 wilhelm ii abandoned all of his father s policies and ideas and eventually led germany into world war i bismarck s plan of undermining frederick and victoria and of using wilhelm ii as a tool for retaining his own power led to his own downfall as it turned out wilhelm did share his father s conviction that position of chancellor was too strong and should be modified in favour of a more powerful emperor when bismarck realized that wilhelm ii was about to dismiss him all bismarck s resources were deployed he even asked empress victoria to use her influence with her son on his behalf but wizard had lost his magic his spells were powerless because they were exerted on people who did not respect them and he who had so disregarded kant s command to use people as ends in themselves had too small a stock of loyalty to draw on as lord salisbury told queen victoria very qualities which bismarck fostered in emperor in order to strengthen himself when emperor frederick should come to throne have been qualities by which he has been overthrown empress with what must have been a mixture of pity and triumph told him that her influence with her son could not save him for he himself had destroyed it balfour p 132 churches honouring frederick include kaiser friedrich in berlin and former church in konigsberg mount frederick william in jervis inlet area of
