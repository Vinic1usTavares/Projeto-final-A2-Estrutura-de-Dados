as innocent universal and inviting as anything else in janet s past and called songs rock with u and 2nite irresistible grade a dance floor tracks sal cinquemani of slant magazine described it as jackson s most cohesive album in a while giving three out of five stars dan gennoe of yahoo music uk gave it seven out of ten stars saying still if not perfect there s plenty to like on discipline and while none of it is exactly vintage janet there s enough here to keep jackson name on pop s a list for a little while longer carol cooper of village voice called discipline most cohesive deep groove album from la jackson since control now magazine reviewer bryan called it her most modern and club friendly album and commented saying jackson wouldn t want us to call it a comeback but it sure sounds

truly tender smut boston globe music critic joan anderman criticized album saying jackson s decision to recycle nympho routine one more time is just boring a quarter century into her career it was jackson s moment to take a breath dig a little deeper and make a bold or at least a different statement instead she has trussed herself up in vinyl to coo another batch of digitized porn on a better note she called tracks rollercoaster and luv engaging tracks describing them as a sassy sweet side and a plump crackling confection respectively new york times music critic kelefa sanneh commented saying if anything discipline may be too subtle a pretty smartly produced collection that sometimes sounds like background music michael arceneaux of popmatters called album same old from her adding these days her look and sound seem nothing more than a continuation of 2001 s all for you entertainment weeklys margeaux watson wrote that jackson s lyrics sound like cheesy text messages of a lovesick adolescent and gave a c rating nick levine of digital spy wrote that jackson s attempts to play uber nympho are beginning to sound very very desperate with embarrassingly lewd lyrics and gave
