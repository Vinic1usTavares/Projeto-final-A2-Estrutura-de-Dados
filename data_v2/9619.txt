severe tropical cyclone gillian was second most powerful of 2013 14 australian region cyclone season and strongest in basin in four years it developed on 8 march 2014 in gulf of carpentaria offshore northern australia it drifted southeastward moving over northwestern queensland on 10 march as a weak tropical cyclone and subsequently turned to southwest and later to west unfavourable wind shear land interaction and dry air prevented much restrengthening and for several days gillian was a weak tropical low storm moved northward and curved westward around top end of northwestern australia and subsequently moved across several islands in indonesia first timor on 18 march on 21 march gillian again became a tropical cyclone as it moved away from indonesia on next day it passed just southeast of christmas island as an intensifying storm and subsequently gillian underwent rapid deepening on 23 march bureau of meteorology bom estimated peak 10 minute sustained winds of 220 km h 140 mph on same day joint typhoon warning center jtwc estimated peak 1 minute sustained winds of 260 km h 160 mph making it a category 5 on saffir simpson hurricane wind scale increased wind shear caused cyclone to rapidly weaken and both bom and jtwc discontinued advisories on gillian on 26 march cyclone affected northern australia with gusty winds and some rainfall while on indonesian island of java it produced strong waves while moving near christmas island gillian downed thousands of trees and damaged roof of one of oldest buildings on island winds gusted to making it first cyclone to affect christmas island in six years storm also affected search for missing malaysia airlines flight 370 meteorological history origins of gillian were from a weak tropical low that persisted in eastern arafura sea on 6 march next day system moved into gulf of carpentaria where it developed convection or thunderstorms which organised into curved rainbands thunderstorms were located west of a circulation was exposed due to moderate wind shear at 06 00 utc on 8 march bureau of meteorology bom office in darwin began issuing warnings on developing tropical low around that time united states joint typhoon warning center jtwc indicated high potential for tropical cyclogenesis due to increasingly organised circulation and convection at 09 00 utc on 8 march bom upgraded low to tropical cyclone gillian and six hours later jtwc initiated advisories on storm as tropical cyclone 17p after its formation gillian moved slowly southward toward queensland within an area of weak steering currents despite ongoing wind shear forecasters anticipated strengthening due to warm water temperatures and favourable outflow storm turned more toward southeast due to influence of a ridge to northeast early on 10 march gillian made landfall along western cape york peninsula of queensland after weakening below tropical cyclone status thumb cyclone gillian approaching cape york peninsula on 8 march a strengthening ridge to south turned storm to southwest bringing gillian back over water however circulation became poorly defined and convection decreased due to land interaction early on 11 march jtwc discontinued advisories when gillian was downgraded to a tropical low proximity to land and continued wind shear prevented initial redevelopment system tracked westward through gulf of carpentaria due to ridge to south passing just north of mornington island on 12 march next day convection reorganised as circulation became better defined on 14 march jtwc again assessed a high potential for gillian redeveloping into a tropical cyclone noting appearance of a central dense overcast at 06 00 utc on same day bom again upgraded gillian to tropical cyclone status in central gulf of carpentaria due to a weak trough in region storm turned to northeast increasing wind shear again caused storm to lose organisation early on 15 march prompting bom to downgrade gillian to a tropical low dry air prevented convection from initially reorganising after gillian was downgraded with a ridge to south low turned westward around top end of northwestern australia on 17 march system moved north of 10deg s into area of warning responsibility of indonesian agency for meteorology climatology and geophysics by that time low level circulation was disconnected from its mid level circulation and land interaction with indonesia was expected to prevent redevelopment late on 18 march storm moved over island of timor and over subsequent two days passed over several other indonesian islands on 21 march convection reorganised due to a drop in wind shear and at 12 00 utc that day bom again upgraded gillian to tropical cyclone status while storm was about 380 km 235 mi south southeast of jakarta on same day jtwc also re initiated advisories on storm noting that circulation had improved as it moved away from indonesia with low wind shear and favourable outflow gillian gradually intensified while moving southwestward around ridge on 22 march storm passed just north of christmas island while gillian was developing an eye by that time 10 minute sustained winds had increased to 95 km h 60 mph within an environment favourable for continued strengthening at 12 00 utc on 22 march bom upgraded storm to a category 3 on australian tropical cyclone intensity scale with 10 minute winds of 120 km h 75 mph equivalent of a minimal hurricane a few hours later jtwc followed suit cyclone continued to rapidly intensify with a well defined anticyclone providing good outflow and very low wind shear at 12 00 utc on 23 march bom estimated gillian attained peak 10 minute winds of 205 km h 125 mph making it a category 5 on australian scale while located about 1000 km 620 mi south southwest of jakarta agency also estimated peak gusts of 285 km h 180 mph at 18 00 utc on 23 march jtwc estimated peak 1 minute winds of 260 km h 160 mph by that time eye had contracted to a diameter of 22 km 14 mi but was beginning to undergo an eyewall replacement cycle in addition gillian was experiencing increased wind shear due to an approaching trough indicative of weakening it continued around ridge and turned more to south over open waters well to west of western australia eye became less distinct and early on 25 march gillian weakened below category 3 intensity on australian scale on same day jtwc also downgraded cyclone to tropical storm strength noting storm s rapid weakening corresponded to a decline in dvorak numbers a system to estimate intensity via satellites circulation became exposed from convection and bom downgraded gillian to a tropical low on 26 march same day that jtwc discontinued advisories after circulation began dissipating preparations and impact thumb left cyclone gillian near christmas island on 22 march much of far north queensland was affected by rain for over a week as gillian slowly moved through gulf of carpentaria heaviest rains averaging fell along a corridor along southern part of cape york peninsula from mitchell alice rivers national park to cooktown of rain from 9 15 march with gusts up to in kowanyama queensland on 17 march gillian brushed top end region bringing only minor rainfall to coastal areas winds reached 45 km h 30 mph in wessel islands across java indonesia storm produced moderate to heavy rains after re intensifying into a tropical cyclone swells of from storm affected southern shores of island though well to north of cyclone gillian system s circulation drew moisture away from riau western indonesia leaving behind fire prone conditions due in part to illegal logging and slash and burn land clearing several new forest fires began by 23 march on 20 march bom issued a cyclone watch for christmas island and next day upgraded it to a cyclone warning first cyclone to affect christmas island since cyclone rosie in 2008 gillian approached island as a category 2 system causing light to moderate damage only one structure on island immigration detention centre is constructed to cyclone standards on island island administrator jon stanhope stated that 1 700 asylum seekers were likely safer than residents in permanent homes gale force winds peaking at battered island for 15 hours several homes lost their roof and one family had to be evacuated however most structures were left unscathed roof of rumah tinggi bar and restaurant one of oldest buildings on island was torn off thousands of trees were reportedly downed across island with jungles sustaining significant losses and there were power outages due to significant damage to islands powerlines gillian also dropped of rainfall over a 24 hour period on island on 23 march several aircraft at subang airport in malaysia taking part in 26 nation search for malaysia airlines flight 370 were grounded due to inclement weather it was noted that gillian could hamper rescue efforts in southern corridor search for aircraft following discovery of possible debris from aircraft about west southwest of australia fears arose that large swells from storm could sink possible wreckage and make investigation almost impossible see also
