holden commodore ve is an executive car that was produced by australian manufacturer holden from 2006 to 2013 it was first iteration of fourth generation of this australian made model its range included luxury variants holden berlina ve and holden calais ve utility models were included as holden ute ve as opposed to vz and all models previous which used opel sourced platforms adapted both mechanically and in size for local market whole new ve programme is first commodore to be developed exclusively by holden in australia despite its status as an all new model engines comprising 3 6 litre v6 and more powerful 6 0 litre v8 have been largely carried over from vz series innovative features to help minimise export redevelopment costs such as a symmetrical centre console housing a flush fitting hand brake lever facilitate conversion to left hand drive internationally ve was badge engineered as chevrolet lumina chevrolet omega and pontiac g8 holden implemented a staged roll out of ve variants releasing sedan first in july 2006 prior to this holden stated they would manufacture two parallel generations of commodores until new station wagon and utility body styles were launched variants by holden s performance vehicle partner holden special vehicles hsv were released soon after sedan s debut alongside long wheelbase wm statesman caprice models ve ute did not enter production until 2007 when it was accompanied by previewing of a sportwagon concept sportwagon itself was subsequently introduced in july 2008 with standard commodore wheelbase instead of extended wheelbase of previous commodore wagons updates to ve have come in form of model year my changes from early 2007 onwards typically subtle in nature these recurring changes have involved alterations to colours and trim increased standard equipment and a reduction in fuel consumption more noteworthy adjustments have come in form of a smaller 3 0 litre v6 engine for entry level versions and series ii

holden announced that ve station wagon and utility variants would be postponed and vz equivalents would remain in production sales of ve ute commenced on 22 august 2007 this was shortly followed by unveiling of a sportwagon concept production version of which was released in july 2008 sedan holden s designers and engineers began laying down basics of a clean sheet commodore sedan in 1999 in seven years of development car came to be holden s largest and most expensive project representing an expenditure exceeding a 1 billion and 3 4 million kilometres 2 1 million miles of testing in 1999 peter hughes holden s manager of exterior design produced a two dimensional image of a sketch drawn earlier by michael simcoe holden s design director at time known in house as bill of design sketch formed design basis for production ready car various elements of sketch were changed including rear tail lamps low profile side window cluster and drawn out wheelbase but aggressive stance remained mccarthy mckay newton robinson p 34 41 thumb left early 1999 design sketch by peter hughes formed basis for ve commodore sedan profile in 2004 just two years before release of ve commodore holden unveiled torana tt36 concept car at australian international motor show in sydney tt36 served as a preview of ve and allowed holden to gauge public reaction to its styling much of torana s styling drew on essence of ve s design some production ready components even carried over from tt36 including steering wheel window and rear view mirror switch cluster and handbrake lever mccarthy mckay newton robinson p 44 46 shortly after stylists penned first design sketches holden engineers began work on developing chassis opel which had provided basis for all previous commodore generations ceased production of their rear wheel drive omega in 2003 robinson 2006 p 34 35 this meant that holden had two options to use another gm platform or to develop an all new vehicle gm s new premium rear wheel drive sigma platform was to see production in 2002 cadillac cts holden s engineers were offered this platform but decided it was not appropriate robinson 2006 p 53 sigma platform s double a arm front suspension and extensive use of aluminium were too costly for ve s market segment luggage compartment was deemed too small and sigma interior package could not be stretched sufficiently to become a family sized car in particular rear seat shoulder width was too tight mccarthy mckay newton robinson p 31 these major drawbacks made holden decide to develop an all new platform known as gm zeta platform on which a number of forthcoming gm vehicles will also be based robinson 2006 p 55 56 zeta suspension system comprises new double pivot macpherson strut for front and a four link independent rear setup these replace previous simple macpherson strut design front and much criticised semi trailing arm rear suspension for improved ride and handling butler dowling hagon newton p 30 denny mooney was appointed chairman of holden on 1 january 2004 by which time development of ve commodore was well underway key design and engineering work was being finalised and investment was already being made in making tooling with which to manufacture car one of mooney s priorities was to improve perceived quality issues that surrounded previous generations of commodores interior quality benefited dramatically from this additional emphasis mooney pushed for panel gaps to be reduced by a further over previous targets smaller panel gaps are just one of ways that holden have developed ve to pitch it against european competitors through use of advanced steels and intensive design body structure is 50 percent stiffer than outgoing model benefiting from noise and vibration reductions handling and crash safety however new body has resulted in substantially increased weight over outgoing model butler dowling hagon newton p 28 development of new car led holden to redesign elizabeth plant in south australia so that entire sections of car can be assembled off foremost production line this new production method allows for complete sub sections like engine and transmissions to be constructed seamlessly together on rigs that simplify production this process is applied to front end module of ve commodore consisting of headlights bumpers airbag sensors and other accessory components it can be easily removed as one piece leading to lower repair costs and easier access to engine bay this design represents first time such a method has been used within gm and garnered sae australasia s 2006 automotive engineering excellence award a modular design structure known within holden as flex vision has been applied to interior where fundamentally different components such as audio units and instrument clusters can be swapped out for different commodore variants creating radically varied interior look and feel without much higher costs butler dowling hagon newton p 20 upshot of this is much greater differentiation between variants than outgoing model creating three distinct interior looks dubbed functional performance and luxury closely related long wheelbase wm statesman caprice derivatives feature a fourth interior type referred to as prestige robinson 2006 p 81 82 additional detail touches were added to ve such as a new four strut hinge system for boot to replace space intrusive much maligned gooseneck hinges as used on previous commodores robinson 2006 p 52 53 high specification variants see expandable door pockets and a saab like blackout feature which illuminates only speedometer at night to enhance driver focus on road butler dowling hagon newton p 21 23 an innovative flush fitting handbrake set into a symmetrical centre console means lever can be easily reversed to sit on opposite side of console for left hand drive export markets minimising redesign costs mccarthy mckay newton robinson p 51 52 sportwagon thumb unlike its predecessor which utilised a longer wheelbase sportwagon my09 my09 5 sv6 pictured shares sedan s wheelbase introduced in july 2008 a 110 million ve sportwagon programme represented a departure from previous commodore station wagons holden was concerned that traditional wagon market was being severely eroded by growing sport utility vehicle suv sales and over reliance on fleet purchasing up to 90 percent of vz wagons were bought by fleet companies and holden sought to attract more retail customers decision was made to develop a sportier more stylish wagon as an alternative to suvs sportwagon unlike previous vz wagon which shared its long wheelbase with statesman caprice is built on same short wheelbase platform as sedan this shift in thinking means cargo capacity is reduced from vz s to but sedan s near 50 50 weight distribution is retained sportwagon is styled with an aggressively sloping rear profile to ensure cargo opening is sufficiently large with such a profile tailgate hinges part way up roof line design of tailgate is compact enough to open in just of space a publicised feature in sportwagon television commercials revisions were made to suspension over sedan s setup these included stiffer springs anti roll bar changes and an additional ball joint in rear suspension to handle extra load weight increases by over sedan aggressive pricing means sportwagon variants of each specification level receive a a 1 000 premium over sedan and are cheaper than outgoing vz wagons ute 2007 saw launch of ve ute a coupe utility based on ve commodore it was unveiled to media in august with showroom sales began later in month this generation of holden ute is aimed as a lifestyle vehicle a shift from traditional workhorse market ve series ute was marketed

series carpet mats z series badges rear view camera rear park assist exterior chrome highlights leather wrapped steering wheel chrome highlights in instrument cluster unlike previous vu vz generation no double cab cab chassis or awd variants are offered safety engine packaging became a contentious issue during development holden s designers wanted engine positioned well behind front axle to allow short overhangs and an overall sportier appearance whereas crash engineers were concerned that this would reduce body s impact absorption in an accident negotiation between designers and crash engineers resulted in moving some of engine components including relocating battery to boot freeing up valuable front end space robinson 2006 p 51 52 by having engine moved back and further down ve commodore also benefits from near perfect 50 50 weight distribution across all variants leading to superior handling crash engineers introduced several other safety initiatives including relocating fuel tank in front of rear axle line instead of behind robinson 2006 p 54 a more crash resistant rear end was also seen as necessary design though had to incorporate a spacious boot and a spare wheel bay that could house largest sized wheel to be fitted to car mccarthy mckay newton robinson p 36 crash test results from australasian new car assessment program ancap rate ve lower in offset frontal impact test than previous generation commodore overall crash score was marginally higher than outgoing vz due to improvements in side impact protection giving a score of 27 45 out of 37 or a four star rating out of a possible five holden s standardisation of six airbags in march 2008 for my09 made ve eligible for ancap side pole test yielding additional scoring points second stage of ve s safety rollout in october 2008 for my09 5 included addition of an energy absorbing steering column shroud and redesigned rear door latches across ve range inclusion of a seat belt reminder on omega sedan yielded another point thus allowing omega sedan to score five stars or a score of 33 45 when tested following december omega sportwagon was next model to be awarded full five stars following february following addition of a seat belt reminder in sportwagon production remaining ve models including ute and wm statesman caprice which had already received most of safety upgrades received seat belt reminder as standard fitment as of my10 production from august 2009 as a result all ve sedan and sportwagon variants along with extended length wm models received five star rating ve ute officially received rating on 19 october 2009 making entire line up of australian made five star ancap rated powertrains thumb left my07 commodore omega sedan thumb left my10 sv6 ute holden concerned about risks of introducing a new platform and drivetrain at same time introduced australian built alloytec v6 engine in proven vz model this allowed time to address any issues or faults before fitting it to ve robinson 2006 p 105 original base v6 benefited from power increases over vz with engine noise reduced by using new timing chains among other modifications butler dowling hagon newton p 32 an updated version of long serving four speed gm 4l60 e automatic transmission remained for this engine manual transmission options are aisin ay6 and tremec t 56 six speeders two automatics featuring active select five speed gm 5l40 e and six speed gm 6l80 e were also offered robinson 2006 p 214 215 latter was reserved exclusively for a modified l76 v8 engine giving an extra of power compared to vz this new engine designated l98 does not readily support fuel saving active fuel management technology unlike l76 in october 2006 holden introduced a bi fuel version of alloytec v6 available to omega and berlina able to run on both petrol and lpg it features an advanced sequential vapour gas injection system and hardened valve seats to cope bi fuel v6 produces and less than conventional v6 when run on lpg for a total of although lpg prices are lower engine uses a large cylindrical gas tank which causes decreased boot space and slightly increased fuel consumption holden was able to take advantage of a loophole in government legislation allowing an a 2 000 rebate on lpg installation because unit is fitted post production by holden s customisation arm normally people would only be entitled to a a 1 000 rebate for new cars pre installed with lpg due to possibility that these bi fuel commodores may have been fitted with undersized o rings in service valve hand tap holden issued a recall affecting first 981 of these models on 10 april 2007 there were also two ve recalls previous to this initial 16 october 2006 recall affecting 1 521 v8 commodore and wm statesman caprice models involved a faulty fuel hose causing a fuel smell to enter cabin a second 10 november 2006 recall affecting 12 830 commodores and wm models built prior to 11 september 2006 resulted from defective rear seat belt anchors on 7 december 2007 another recall was issued for over 86 000 ve and wm v6 models this was due to possibility that one of fuel lines in engine compartment may have a rub condition with a fuel vapour hose clip possibly causing a fuel smell to become evident thumb internal cut away revealing ve calais my07 engine bay and suspension setup thumb my09 5 berlina sedan for 2008 australian international motor show in sydney holden announced my09 5 upgrade involving standardisation of premium alloytec v6 across commodore range from 1 november 2008 whereas previously it had been reserved for sv6 and calais omega and berlina variants acquired variable valve timing like high output engine but not premium dual exhaust system and five speed automatic transmission these changes result in base petrol v6 producing less power and less torque than engine it replaces however omega and berlina sedans benefit from a two percent fuel efficiency improvement or four percent for wagons additionally emissions have also been reduced allowing petrol powered variants to achieve euro vi certification a pending emission standard for european introduction in 2014 these changes extend further than petrol engine as bi fuel lpg variants benefit from an eight percent improvement in fuel economy when run on lpg this reduced fuel consumption does however come at a cost lpg equipped models are rated at less than before also announced at 2008 motor show was a version of 6 0 litre v8 engine fitted with active fuel management afm technology known as l76 originally omitted from l98 v8 afm aids fuel consumption under light engine loads although it is available only when paired with automatic transmission and power output is reduced by announcement of afm coincided with announcement of ecoline a badge highlighting holden vehicles employing fuel saving technologies or those powered by fuels other than petrol for ve commodore both afm and lpg powered versions fall under ecoline umbrella on 7 april 2009 holden announced that dealerships were receiving their first deliveries of ecoline branded models including new l76 v8s on 4 august 2009 holden announced my10 revisions to ve and wm range to be released in september for ve omega and berlina 3 6 litre alloytec v6 has been downsized to 3 0 litres lowest engine displacement of a commodore since straight six engine fitted to 1986 vl series this smaller capacity engine features spark ignition direct injection sidi technology and is officially claimed to reduce fuel consumption by up to 12 percent depending on variant power increases to although torque is reduced to along with 3 0 litre engine a 3 6 litre version of same producing and was also unveiled other than manual transmission version of sv6 all sidi v6 models are coupled to gm s 6l50 automatic and fall under holden s ecoline banner benefits to fuel economy for 3 6 litre sidi can also be attributed to an improved deceleration fuel cut system which terminates fuel supply during engine coasting a higher efficiency alternator and voltage regulator a 50 rpm lower idle speed to 550 rpm and a new turbine damper for automatic transmission that works to suppress vibrations at low thus enabling earlier omega versions of ute and all bi fuel versions retain existing 3 6 litre and four speed automatic combination although lpg engine has been tweaked for further efficiency gains further powertrain improvement came in september 2010 with my11 upgrades omega versions of ute were upgraded to 3 0 litre sidi engine with six speed automatic transmission as used in sedan and wagons versions holden also modified both 3 0 litre v6 and 6 0 litre v8 engines to accept e85 bio ethanol in addition to petrol holden claims that running either engine on e85 provides a sizeable increase in performance and reduces emissions between 20 and 40 percent depending on distance fuel is transported from production site to filling station e85 compatibility extended to 3 6 litre v6 as

driven for at a maximum speed of concerns have been raised by public over its usefulness in remote australian outback areas far from any tyre repair centres and asserts that it is a cost cutting measure similar concerns have been raised in media although holden maintains that this is a weight saving feature and allows for full size spare tyres to be purchased at an additional cost likewise critics found omission of standard air conditioning for omega model unforgivable given both overall hot australian climate and cost of car this however was rectified in my09 upgrade of omega see below
