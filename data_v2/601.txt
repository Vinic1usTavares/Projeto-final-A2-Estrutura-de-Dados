received idea for first part of story he explained on a dvd audio commentary for episode that his grandmother was oldest citizen of his hometown west springfield massachusetts and they had a ceremony where she was awarded a cane that had a golden head on it and weird thing of ceremony is her name wasn t on cane and mayor of town stood up and he says and now of course as soon as hazel passes away her name will be engraved on cane so she would never live to see it happen but nonetheless she was given cane subplot of mansion family where mr burns gets a medical examination was inspired by swartzwelder s own visit to a mayo clinic meyer george 2008 commentary for mansion family in simpsons complete eleventh season dvd 20th century fox george meyer an executive producer on series has said that john i don t think is a guy who goes to doctor very often and every 20 or 30 years he decides he needs to get a tune up so he went to mayo clinic had they give him an entire battery of tests and as john jokingly tells it they said that his constant smoking had done no harm to him whatsoever might even be benefiting him while writing parts of episode that involve international waters writers did research and found that actual laws of international waters are more complex and ambiguous compared to what they had already written in story but they decided to ignore that long tim 2008 commentary for mansion family in simpsons complete eleventh season dvd 20th century fox american pop singer britney spears guest starred in episode as herself according to scully she was seventeen to eighteen years old when she recorded her lines and she was a lot of fun to work with she was a fan of show and she was willing to do all lines it was all people around her that were crazy management and all that we originally had her introduce herself in episode as i m teenage songbird britney spears and she recorded a few takes and they were fine and suddenly all these guys come rushing in saying she can t say songbird we asked what s wrong with songbird and they were somehow convinced that it was some sort of slam or an insult scully mike 2008 commentary for mansion family in simpsons complete eleventh season dvd 20th century fox staff members were therefore forced to change her opening line to i m teen sensation britney spears many scenes in mansion family were inspired by popular culture for example there is a painting hanging on one of walls in burns mansion that depicts burns playing poker with dogs referencing oil paintings series dogs playing poker another painting showing a nude burns is a callback to a previous episode of series brush with greatness 1991 in which marge produced painting for burns featured in episode is also a joke that makes fun of grammy awards during awards ceremony homer complains why won t anyone give me an award when lisa points out that you won a grammy homer says i mean an award that s worth winning at this point screen freezes and a message scrolls across bottom of screen reading legal disclaimer mr simpson s opinions do not reflect those of producers who don t consider grammy an award at all release and reviews episode

generally mixed reception from critics susan dunne of hartford courant described it as debauched but hilarious while reviewing eleventh season of simpsons dvd movie guide s colin jacobson commented on mansion family writing that although simpsons started out as moderately reality based pretty much any grounding was gone by point this episode aired that doesn t mean show fails to depict funny bits especially during dark humor of burns hospital visit nonetheless episode occasionally goes too far to side of silliness those gags are hit or miss in a review of episodes featured on simpsons gone wild popmatters critic stephen haag wrote that none of these episodes will end up in simpsons hall of fame and that mansion family is hardly a classic episode but lord knows there are plenty worse from season 11 he further commented that if anything this episode should be included in batshit crazy endings dvd referring to ending scenes with chinese pirates david packard of dvd verdict was more positive in his review of simpsons gone wild writing that mansion family is another all around hilarious episode with a nice swipe at grammy awards simpsons family running amok in mansion and enjoying all it has to offer and burns various tests at mayo clinic my favorite gag is when burns is slid into an mri machine only to hear thing grind to a halt with an error message reading clear body jam in
