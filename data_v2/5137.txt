love of god and is compared to similar themes in works of later poets william blake walt whitman and gerard manley hopkins his love for natural world is frequently expressed in his works by a treatment of nature that evokes romanticism two centuries before romantic movement biography early life and education traherne s birth or baptism are not recorded in parish registers according to

december 1657 he was appointed as rector of credenhill near hereford by commissioners for approbation of public preachers although at time he was not an ordained priest a curious note appended to

his lifetime and his works were not known or appreciated until long after his death as a country priest he led a devout humble life and did not participate in literary circles only one of his works roman forgeries 1673 was published in his lifetime christian ethicks 1675 followed soon after his death and later a serious and patheticall contemplation of mercies of god 1699 which was published as work of an anonymous author whose character and background were discussed in a brief introduction by publisher at traherne s death in 1674 most of his manuscripts were bequeathed to his brother philip after philip s death they apparently passed into possession of family of ledbury in herefordshire where they languished for almost 200 years in 1888 family s assets were dissolved yet manuscripts did not re emerge until 10 years later later publication history in winter of 1896 97 william t brooke of london discovered some anonymous manuscripts in a barrow of books about to be trashed or a street brooke thought that they might be lost works by henry vaughan and showed them to alexander grosart 1827 99 a scottish clergyman and expert on elizabethan and jacobean literature who reprinted rare works grosart agreed that manuscripts were by vaughan and planned to include them in an edition of vaughan s works that he was preparing for publication grosart died in 1899 and proposed edition was never completed grosart s collection including manuscripts was purchased by charles higham a london bookseller who asked his friend bertram dobell 1842 1914 to examine them dobell was convinced that they were not by vaughan and soon discovered that they were by traherne manuscripts included poetry as well as a collection of contemplative paragraphs embodying reflexions on religion and morals poetical works of thomas traherne was published in 1903 and centuries of meditations in 1908 other publications followed eventually centuries were to be described as one of finest prose poems in our language and passages from them were set to music almost as often as poems manuscripts a traherne manuscript of centuries dobell folio also called commonplace book church s year book and early notebook also called philip traherne s notebook is held at bodleian library oxford burney manuscript also known as poems of felicity at british library london and select meditations in osborn collection beinecke library new haven a manuscript discovered in 1996 in folger library in washington dc by julia smith and laetitia was later identified as an unfinished 1 800 line epic poem by traherne entitled ceremonial law in 1997 jeremy maule a fellow of trinity college cambridge discovered more works by traherne among 4 000 manuscripts in library of lambeth palace london residence of archbishop of canterbury lambeth manuscripts mostly prose encompass four complete works and a fragment of a fifth inducements to a sober view of dr twisse seeds of eternity kingdom of god and fragmentary love reception of poetry although traherne is now counted one of leading metaphysical poets name of that school went unmentioned on his first publication in his preface to poetical works dobell linked him with that small group of religious poets which includes herbert vaughan and crawshaw but distinguished him as uniquely individual and neither a follower nor imitator of any of these in selection of his poems that followed two years later they were accompanied in same volume by verse remains of henry vaughan s twin brother thomas eugenius and john norris of reputation of two latter was then and remains as philosophers both were also clergymen and norris was incumbent of herbert s former parsonage it was not until much later that he was to be described also as last of traherne then is being presented by as a representative of line of 17th century devotional poets rather than member of a particular school at time of publication those writers whom samuel johnson had described dismissively as metaphysical poets had yet to achieve critical prominence they were given after appearance of herbert grierson s anthology metaphysical lyrics and poems of seventeenth century 1921 in any case none of traherne s poems were included there and when he did come to notice of t s eliot it was only to be put aside as more a mystic than a poet after that it took decades before his work was given more serious scrutiny certainly mystical element is strikingly evident in traherne but his metaphysical credentials are confirmed by way in which he seeks to explain issues of truth knowledge and faculties of mind and heart by methods of theological and rational examination typical also is way in which these meditations are worked out as extended baroque conceits of which shadows in water is a particularly striking example a further link with fellow devotional poets of his period is found in idealisation of childish innocence and use of platonic themes which traherne shares with henry vaughan and john norris influences development of personal faith given some of autobiographical and confessional material in his works notably in centuries of meditations traherne must have suffered from a lack of faith in his formative years at oxford he describes this as a period of apostasy and that he later found his way back to faith however there is an alternative reading possible which may be closer to facts of traherne s experience as he expresses them in quote above this is that he did not suffer a loss of faith but rather identified his maturation away from a natural innocent child s view of world and his place in it from an innate understanding of wonder of god s creation to a burdened grappling with rules and expectation of church and society as an apostasy itself which he had to overcome then by careful and disciplined study highest reason this childlike accepting and joyous view of faith and religious ecstasy is at core of writing from which excerpt above is drawn and is part of reason for traherne s appeal neoplatonism traherne is heavily influenced by works of neoplatonist philosophers and several of his contemporaries who were called cambridge platonists cambridge platonists were in that they argued for moderation and dialogue between factions of puritans and high churchmen in anglican church they believed that religion and reason could be in harmony with one another based on a mystical understanding of reason believing that reason rose beyond mere sense perception but was candle of lord and an echo of divine residing within human soul reason was both god given and of god indeed critic k w salter notes that traherne writes of senses as if they were spiritual and of spirit as if it were sensuous however according to gladys wade s 1946 biography of traherne she distinguished that cambridge platonists wasted their energies on hermetic and and rosicrucian lore and on incredible experiments in magic and necromancy and remarked that traherne s mysticism was perfectly free from any taint of this theology and ethical themes thumb right 300px st mary s credenhill in herefordshire where traherne was rector defence of anglican and criticism of catholic churches traherne was also concerned with stability of christian church in england during period of restoration in some of his theological writings traherne exhibits a passion for anglican faith and national church that is evident in his confrontations with roman catholicism and nonconformism during this time of political and religious upheaval recent discoveries of previously unknown manuscripts further establish traherne s reputation as an anglican divine and his works offer fresh and comprehensive arguments on ongoing theological arguments regarding nature of divinity ethics and morality and nature of sin for instance traherne passionately critiques roman catholicism in roman forgeries 1673 only work published during his lifetime it is a polemical treatise in form of a dialogue between two men a protestant and a roman catholic relying on scriptures and pronouncements of first council of nicaea to formulate idea of a legitimate church authority traherne criticises state of contemporary catholic church and claims through a conspiracy theory that because vatican has had control over manuscripts that catholic church was in a position to corrupt misuse or suppress documents to support its claim to authority abusive nature of narrator s critique of church of rome is in sharp contrast to tenor of traherne s poetry or his other writings on theological topics however traherne takes a less polemic tone in posthumously published christian ethicks 1675 in which he explores theological implications of calvinist thought on freedom and necessity in this work traherne refuses to define ethics as a secular phenomenon instead pointing to a firm reliance on will of god because of human limitations and failings one cannot build a suitable and coherent moral system of beliefs those virtues must derive from a divine source and their reward from perceiving infinite love of god at root of all things sin traherne dedicated considerable examination to subject of sin and its place vis a vis church doctrines in recently discovered work a sober view of dr twisse traherne discusses sin and salvation within frame of a larger discussion of questions of election and reprobation traherne writes mysticism and divine union traherne s works are inherently mystical in that they seek to understand and embrace nature of god within his creation and within man s soul traherne seems to describe his own journey of faith in centuries of meditation which was likely written when traherne was at credenhill a work that is noted for its spiritual intensity and wide scope of writer s survey which includes all heaven and earth he takes for province of pious soul traherne s work is said to look upon hidden things of soul and in them he sees image of glory and love of god and eternal theme of goodness and splendour of god traherne s poems frequently explore glory of creation and what he perceived as his intimate relationship with god he drew deeply on writings of aristotle and on early church fathers for his concept of man and human nature little mention is made of sin and suffering in works that have dominated 20th century criticism and some critics have seen his verse as bordering upon pantheism or perhaps panentheism felicity at core of traherne s work is concept of felicity that highest state of bliss in which he describes essence of god as a source of delights of inestimable value traherne says that understanding set in him secured his felicity he argues that man can only experience this felicity by understanding will of god and divine love and he describes beauty of this in childlike terms traherne seeks to explain principle of nature in which through his inclination to love truth light and beauty seek him to identify felicity as its source and a natural experience other themes nature another great passion that is depicted in traherne s work is his love of nature and natural world frequently displayed in a very romantic treatment of nature that has been described as characteristically pantheist or while traherne credits a divine source for its creation his praise of nature seems nothing less than what one would expect to find in thoreau many scholars consider traherne a writer of sublime and in his writing he seems to have tried to reclaim lost appreciation for natural world as well as paying tribute to what he knew of in nature that was more powerful than he was in this sense traherne seems to have anticipated romantic movement more than 130 years before it actually occurred there is frequent discussion of man s almost symbiotic relationship with nature as well as frequent use of literal setting that is an attempt to faithfully reproduce a sense experience from a given moment a technique later used frequently by william wordsworth childlike joy and attitude in spirit of gospels but jesus said suffer little children and forbid them not to come unto me for of such is kingdom of heaven truly i tell you unless you change and become like little children you will never enter kingdom of heaven but note also brothers and sisters stop thinking like children in regard to evil be infants but in your thinking be adults traherne s great theme is visionary innocence of childhood and his writings suggest that adults have lost joy of childhood and with it an understanding of divine nature of creation traherne seems to convey idea that paradise can only be rediscovered and regained through this childlike innocence a state which precedes knowledge of good and evil and seems to be composed of a boundless love and wonder in this respect traherne s work is often compared to abounding joy and mysticism found in works of william blake walt whitman and gerard manley hopkins according to traherne scholar denise inge traherne s introduction of a child s viewpoint to narrate his theological and moral premises was unknown or certainly unappreciated in literature of this time happiness achieving happiness is another focus of traherne s work he wrote i will first spend a great deal of time in seeking happiness and then a great deal more in enjoying it he wrote that many people despise happiness but that heaven is a place where our happiness shall be seen of all we shall there enjoy happiness of being seen in happiness without danger of ostentation practical philosophy traherne was intent that insights gained through philosophy be used in daily life legacy traherne s works remained largely unpublished until their publication at start of 20th century those who have acknowledged an influence since then have been trappist monk thomas merton christian humanist dorothy l sayers poet elizabeth jennings and c s lewis who called centuries of meditations almost most beautiful book in english thumb upright 1 1 traherne was interred at st mary s church teddington middlesex they also had their influence within anglican

acclamation or local custom diocese of oxford anglican history of diocese calendar of commemoration retrieved 14 january 2014 following this precedent and in commemoration of his poems and spiritual
