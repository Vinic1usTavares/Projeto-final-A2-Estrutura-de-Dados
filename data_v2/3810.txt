uturunku is a dormant high volcano in bolivia with two summit peaks it consists of a complex of lava domes and lava flows with a total volume of and bears traces of a former glaciation even though it does not currently carry glaciers volcanic activity took place during pleistocene and last eruption was 250 000 years ago since then uturuncu has not erupted but active fumaroles occur in summit region volcano rises within altiplano puna volcanic complex a larger province of large volcanoes and calderas which over last few million years have emplaced about in sometimes very large eruptions volcano has two summits with a fumarole field between them underneath it lies so called altiplano puna magmatic body a large sill formed by partially molten rocks starting in 1992 satellite observations have indicated a large area of regional uplift centered on uturunku which has been interpreted as an indication of large scale magma intrusion under volcano this might be a prelude to large scale volcanic activity including supervolcanic activity and caldera formation geography and geomorphology uturuncu lies in sur lipez area of southern bolivia southeast of town of quetena and just northeast of eduardo andean fauna national reserve in cordillera de lipez a former sulfur mine is situated on mountain close to summit and was considered to be one of highest in world a serpentine road leads up on mountain and additional roads pass along northern eastern and southwestern foot of uturuncu region is almost uninhabited and volcano was little known until ongoing large scale ground deformation was discovered in early 21st century since then scientific interest has increased including a reconnaissance mission carried out by scientists in 2003 additionally volcano has been used to reconstruct regional history of glaciation term means jaguar in quechua language structure with elevation uturuncu is highest mountain in southwestern bolivia and dominates its geomorphology rising about above surrounding terrain and giving a good view of surrounding mountains from summit volcano has two summit peaks and high about apart and separated by a high saddle it is a stratovolcano with remnants of a crater and consists of lava domes and lava flows erupted from a number of vents in central part of volcano about 105 lava flows propagate outward from central sector of volcano reaching lengths of and featuring levees flow ridges and steep blocky fronts over thick northernmost lava flow is known as lomo escapa and with a length of it is also largest lava flow at uturuncu five lava domes south west and northwest of summit form a northwest southeast trending alignment that appears to be an older volcanic system southern of these domes have volumes of about and western dome bears traces of a large collapse broad edifice covers an area of about and a volume of it appears to consist entirely of lava flows and lava domes while occurrence of pyroclastic flow deposits was reported at first later research has not found any evidence of explosive eruptions aside from volcanic deposits there are also traces of glaciation which has smoothened slopes of uturuncu as well as pleistocene and holocene alluvium and colluvium lakes and rivers several lakes surround uturuncu mama lies on eastern foot of uturuncu and is bordered by steep slopes while laguna celeste is located northeast southeast and south of uturuncu respectively beach terraces deposits of diatomaceous earth and former shorelines are visible around lakes rio grande de lipez flows along western foot of volcano and receives tributaries which originate close to uturuncu s northeastern foot it eventually flows into salar de uyuni these watercourses are usually confined between steep bedrock walls and are characterized by a gravelly beds anastomosing channels and wetlands which are used to keep llamas and sheep geology regional eastward subduction of nazca plate beneath south america plate has generated three volcanic belts within andes including central volcanic zone which spans parts of peru chile bolivia and argentina and includes uturuncu aside from uturuncu it includes about 69 holocene volcanoes in a high elevation region including potentially active volcanoes irruputuncu olca paruma aucanquilcha ollague san pedro putana licancabur and acamarachi local uturuncu has formed about east of main volcanic front in western cordillera in a terrain formed by various volcanic and sedimentary rocks of miocene to quaternary age region is characterized by altiplano high plateau which reaches an elevation of and in terms of dimension is only exceeded by tibet 8 41 million years old vilama and 5 65 million years old guacha ignimbrites underlie volcano and crop out in quetena river valley while 4 million years old vilama lavas are found southwest of uturuncu and are partly buried by volcano crust in region is about thick volcanic activity in area occurred between 15 and 10 million years ago and cerro san antonio a heavily eroded 3 million years old miocene volcano with a westward opening collapse scar lies just north of uturuncu other volcanoes from east counterclockwise to west are cerro caldera cerro lipez suni k ira and quetena volcanoes as well as many more minor volcanic centres many of them are formed along northwest southeast trending lineaments such as lipez and pastos grandes lineament that passes through uturuncu geologic history and altiplano puna volcanic complex geological history of region is complex after subduction commenced in jurassic 26 million years ago breakup of farallon plate into cocos plate and nazca plate was accompanied by an increased subduction rate and onset of andean orogeny this subduction process at first involved a relatively flat descend of nazca plate until 12 million years ago after which it beginning from 10 million years ago then altiplano puna volcanic complex formed with a flare up occurring during miocene it covers an area of of altiplano puna in argentina bolivia and chile and consists of a number of calderas composite volcanoes and about of ignimbrite uturuncu lies at its centre but unlike uturuncu most surrounding volcanic systems have been characterized by explosive eruptions including several so called with volcanic explosivity indexes of 8 at cerro guacha la pacana pastos grandes and vilama over 50 volcanoes in region are potentially active within last two million years laguna colorada tatio and chico ignimbrites were erupted in surrounding terrain 4 million years old atana and 3 million years old pastos grandes ignimbrites are other large ignimbrites in area while 10 33 0 64 million years old san antonio ignimbrite is more sparse altiplano puna volcanic complex is underpinned at about depth by a wide magmatic sill where rocks are partially molten altiplano puna magmatic body its existence has been established with various techniques it extends over an area of and has a volume of about with a thickness variously estimated to be between it has been referred to as largest reservoir of magma in continental crust of earth altiplano puna magmatic body is source of magmas for many of volcanoes in altiplano puna volcanic complex in addition about of brine are contained in rocks underneath uturuncu composition and magma genesis uturuncu has erupted dacite but also andesite in form of inclusions within dacite rocks are vesicular or porphyric and contain phenocrysts of biotite clinopyroxene hornblende ilmenite magnetite orthopyroxene plagioclase and quartz along with apatite monazite and zircon within a rhyolite groundmass and define a potassium rich calc alkaline suite xenoliths consisting of gneiss igneous rocks and have also been found of which first two appear to be derived from country rocks while third is a by product of magma generation process additionally occurrence of cumulates gabbros hornfels limestones and sandstones as phases has been reported mixing processes involving hotter or more mafic magmas played a role in genesis of uturuncu rocks as did fractional crystallization processes and contamination with crustal rocks origin of these magmas appears to relate to altiplano puna magmatic body which generates melts through differentiation of basaltic magmas first to andesites and then to dacites before being transferred to shallow crust below uturuncu from where it was then erupted through buoyancy dependent processes magma composition has been stable over history of volcano glaciation uturuncu currently features no glaciers however perennial ice was reported in 1956 existence of sporadic snow fields in 1994 and summit area is occasionally ice covered conversely evidence of past glaciation such as glacial striations glacially eroded valleys both recessional and terminal moraines and roches can be found on northern eastern and southern flanks of uturuncu past glaciation of uturuncu was not very extensive owing to its steep flanks one of these valleys on uturuncu s southwestern flank has been subject to glaciology studies which identified a former glacier originating both from summit and from an area about south of summit this only weakly erosive glacier deposited five sets of up to high moraines within shallow valley lowest of these lies at elevation and appears to be a product of an early last glacial maximum between 65 000 and 37 000 years ago earlier than global last glacial maximum afterwards not much retreat occurred until 18 000 years ago conversely uppermost of these moraines is about 16 000 14 000 years old and correlates to a glacial advance in altiplano that has been correlated to maximum growth of former lake tauca north of uturuncu and a wet and cold climate associated with heinrich event 1 at this same time 17 000 13 000 years ago shorelines formed around lakes that surround uturuncu lake tauca may have been a source of moisture for uturuncu after 14 000 glacier receded at same time as climate warmed during bolling warming and region became drier climate and vegetation there is little information on local climatology but mean annual precipitation is about or even less than that most of it originating in amazon basin to east and falling during december january and february this low amount of precipitation is not adequate to sustain glaciers even though summit of uturuncu lies above freezing level but it is enough to generate a seasonal snowcap on mountain annual temperatures in region range between regional vegetation is relatively sparse at high elevations and gets classified as puna grassland with low biodiversity quinoa woods and polylepis trees are found on lower slopes of volcano trees reach height birds such as flamingoes make up much of animal life in area and are concentrated at open waterbodies andean mountain cats southern and vicunas form rest of animal life eruption history uturuncu was active during pleistocene with a lower unit emplaced during lower and middle pleistocene 890 000 549 000 years ago and which makes up most of peripheral sectors of volcano and an upper unit of middle to upper pleistocene age 427 000 271 000 years ago which makes up its central sector and is less extensive several rocks have been dated through argon argon dating and have yielded ages ranging from 1 050 000 5 000 to 250 000 5 000 years ago among these dates are 271 000 26 000 years ago for rocks in summit area 250 000 5 000 for youngest dated lava flow found just south southeast of summit and 544 000 years for lomo escapa lava flow while aligned lava domes have been dated to be between 549 000 3 000 and 1 041 000 12 000 years old overall uturuncu was active for about 800 000 years volcanic eruptions at uturuncu were effusive and involved emission of voluminous lava flows between pauses lasting between 50 000 and 180 000 years with a mean eruption rate of less than much less than other rhyolitic volcanoes there is no evidence of large ignimbrite eruptions nor of large flank collapses but some lavas may have interacted with water or ice as they were erupted and were reportedly emplaced over moraines holocene and fumarolic activity no large effusive eruptions have occurred since 250 000 5 000 eruption and holocene or recent eruptions have not been reported while it was at first proposed that postglacial lavas existed it is now known that volcano has been dormant since 271 000 years ago and glaciation has affected youngest lava flows volcano is considered to be dormant alt a snow covered mountain slope is surmounted by steam clouds mountainous landscape in background thumb fumaroles on uturuncu active fumaroles occur in two fields below summit with a number of tiny vents located between two summit peaks vapour emissions are visible from close distance summit fumaroles have temperatures of less than and their gases contain large quantities of carbon dioxide water and larger amounts of hydrogen sulfide than sulfur dioxide perhaps due to latter being filtered out by a hydrothermal system fumaroles have emplaced abundant sulfur and has been observed satellite images have observed relatively invariant temperature anomalies hot spots on uturuncu between its two summit peaks these temperature anomalies of about are among largest fumarole fields visible to satellites existence of intense fumarolic activity on northwestern slope at was already reported in 1956 additionally a spring on northwestern flank produces water with temperatures of presence of a weak hydrothermal system is likely at uturuncu albeit probably at great depth considering low temperature and spread out nature of fumarolic activity there may be a shallow magma chamber below volcano at depth below sea level recent unrest and threats insar imaging has discovered that a region of about around uturuncu is uplifting between 1992 and 2006 uplift amounted to in an area wide but with variations over time such as a temporary acceleration after a 1998 earthquake a gradual slowdown either continuing or followed by an acceleration to about in few years before 2017 along with seasonal variations overall total volume change between 1992 and 2006 was about with a total volume change of about such rates are typical for intrusions in altiplano puna volcanic complex and historical lava dome eruptions and might reflect a short term rate deformation is centered on an area west of summit and is most likely of magmatic origin given lack of a large hydrothermal system at volcano and depth of deformation form of deforming structure is not well known but it lies presumably at a depth of below sea level uplifting area is surrounded by a ring shaped area of subsidence which is occurring at a rate of total width of deforming terrain is about although is it not clearly visible in all insar data this joint uplift subsidence has been called a sombrero pattern and subsidence may reflect either a sideward or an upward migration of magma a second shallow subsidence area has been found south of uturuncu which may relate to changes in a hydrothermal system deformation it most likely caused by magma intruding into crust from altiplano puna magmatic body with intrusion taking place at a level below that where magma accumulated prior to past eruptions of uturuncu it has been described as an ascending diapir or as a growing pluton although an alternative theory holds ascent of volatiles along a magma column reaching to altiplano puna magmatic body as responsible for surface deformation in that case uplift might reverse over time such surface uplift has been observed at other volcanic centres in central volcanic zone but on global scale it is unusual both for its long duration and its spatial extent and in case of uturuncu demonstrates continuing activity of altiplano puna magmatic body in addition there is no evidence for a net uplift in geomorphology of region and findings in terrain around uturuncu indicate that this uplift certainly began less than 1 000 years ago and likely also less than 100 years ago uplift might be either a temporary deformation of volcano that eventually deflates over time or current uplift might only be in its beginning stage term zombie volcano has been coined to describe volcanoes like uturuncu which have been inactive for a long time but are actively deforming seismicity in addition volcano features persistent seismic activity with occasional bursts of higher activity about three or four earthquakes occur every day at volcano and seismic swarms lasting minutes to hours with up to 60 earthquakes occur several times per month intensities of earthquakes reach most of this seismic activity occurs below summit of uturuncu around sea level and some earthquakes appear to relate to northwest southeast tectonic trend of region although swarms occur in several areal clusters whether there are long term trends in seismic activity is difficult to estimate as detection and reconnaissance techniques of seismic activity at uturuncu have changed over time this amount of seismic activity is large when compared to neighbouring volcanoes and seismic activity may be a consequence of deformation as intruding magma and destabilizes local faults with further triggering possible by large earthquakes such as 2010 maule earthquake which triggered an intense seismic swarm in february 2010 studies magnetotelluric imaging of volcano has found a number of high conductivity anomalies below uturuncu including a wide deep conductor that extends to volcanic arc to west and several shallower ones which ascend from deep conductor which appears to coincide with altiplano puna magmatic body shallow conductors appear to relate to local volcanoes such as laguna colorada vent but also uturuncu latter conductor lies between depth is less than wide and may consists of molten rock with saline aqueous fluids seismic tomography has found a tooth shaped anomaly that begins at depth and continues to over of depth such structures have been found at other volcanoes and explained by presence of magma seismic activity concentrates at top of this anomaly finally tectonic stress patterns delineate a wide ring surrounding volcano that may be prone to fracturing such a ring could constitute a future pathway for magma transport or margin of a future caldera threats whether ongoing unrest at uturuncu is part of a benign process of pluton growth or prelude of a new eruption or even a caldera forming eruption is an open question a large caldera forming eruption could have catastrophic globe spanning consequences as demonstrated by 1815 eruption of mount tambora in indonesia and 1600 eruption of huaynaputina in peru this possibility has resulted in international media attention evidence does not clearly indicate that a future super eruption such as past events in region is possible and there is no indication for a near future eruption but there is certainly potential for a smaller eruption see also geology of bolivia list of volcanoes in bolivia mount nelly references sources category
