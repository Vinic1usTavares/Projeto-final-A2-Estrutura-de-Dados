this charming man is a song by english rock band smiths written by guitarist johnny marr and singer morrissey released as group s second single in october 1983 on independent record label rough trade it is defined by marr s jangle pop guitar riff and morrissey s characteristically morose lyrics which revolve around recurrent smiths themes of sexual ambiguity and lust feeling detached from early 1980s mainstream gay culture morrissey wrote this charming man to evoke an older more coded and self aware underground scene singer said of song s lyrics i really like idea of male voice being quite vulnerable of it being taken and slightly manipulated rather than there being always this heavy machismo thing that just bores everybody although only moderately successful on first release single peaked at number 25 on uk singles chart this charming man has been widely praised in both music and mainstream press re issued in 1992 it reached number 8 on uk singles chart making it smiths biggest uk hit by chart position in 2004 bbc radio 2 listeners voted it number 97 on station s sold on song top 100 poll mojo magazine journalists placed track at number 1 on their 2008 50 greatest uk indie records of all time feature it was certified silver by british phonographic industry in 2015 background by early 1983 smiths had gained a large following on uk live circuit and had signed a record deal with indie label rough trade deal along with positive concert reviews in weekly music press and an upcoming session on john peel s radio show on bbc radio 1 generated a large media buzz for band in a music scene dominated by corporate and video driven acts smiths camp and bookish image stood out and many expected band to be breakthrough act of uk post punk movement previous october frankie goes to hollywood released their iconic track relax which was seen as an anthem to an out alpha male self assertiveness and alien to many uk homosexuals however smiths may 1983 debut single hand in glove failed to live up to critical and commercial expectations mostly due to its perceived low production values when rough trade label mates aztec camera began to receive day time national radio play with their track walk out to winter marr admitted to feeling a little jealous my competitive urges kicked in guitarist believed smiths needed an up beat song in a major key to gain a chart positioning that would live up to expectations marr wrote music to this charming man especially for peel session on same night that he wrote still ill and pretty girls make graves based on peel performance rough trade label head geoff travis suggested that band release song as a single instead of slated release reel around fountain which had gathered notoriety in press due to what were seen as lyrical references to pedophilia smiths entered matrix studios in london on september 1983 to record a second studio version of song for release as a single however result known as london version was unsatisfactory and soon after band travelled to strawberry studios in stockport to try again here they recorded more widely heard a side music and lyrics lyrics of this charming man comprise a first person narrative in which male protagonist punctures one of his bicycle s wheels on a remote hillside a passing charming man in a luxury car stops to offer cyclist a lift and although protagonist is at first hesitant after much deliberation he accepts offer while driving together pair flirt although protagonist finds it difficult to overcome his reluctance i would go out tonight but i haven t got a stitch to wear motorist tells cyclist it s gruesome that someone so handsome should care morrissey deliberately used archaic language when composing voice over style lyrics for this charming man his use of phrases and words such as hillside desolate stitch to wear handsome and charming are used to convey a more courtly world than mid eighties north of england and evoke a style that has in words of music critic mat snow nothing to do with fashion morrissey had already used word handsome in a song title in handsome devil b side to hand in glove and observed in a 1983 interview with barney hoskyns that he used word to try and revive some involvement with language people no longer use in daily scheme of things people s language is so frighteningly limited and if you use a word with more than 10 letters it s absolute snobbery snow puts forward case that through use of dated word charming morrissey sought to rebel against then mainstream gay culture from which he felt alienated morrissey told hoskyns i hate this festive faggot thing people listen to this charming man and think no further than what anyone would presume i hate that angle and it s surprising that gay press have harped on more than anyone else i hate it when people talk to me about sex in a trivial way as with many of morrissey s compositions song s lyrics features dialogue borrowed from a cult film line a jumped up pantry boy who never knew his place is borrowed from 1972 film adaptation of anthony shaffer s 1970 homoerotic play sleuth in which laurence olivier plays a cuckolded author to michael caine s bit of rough both studio versions begin with an introductory guitar riff joined by rhythm section morrissey s vocals are first heard eight seconds into track his vocal melodies are diatonic and consciously avoid blues inflections chorus is played twice first time it is followed by a brief pause second by closing of song rhythm section of andy rourke and mike joyce provide a beat more danceable than usual for a smiths track drums were originally programmed on a linn drum computer under direction of producer john porter porter used programme to trigger sampled sounds of live drum kit featuring a bassline marr s guitar part consists of single notes and thirds as opposed to strummed bar chords and his guitar serves to creates a counter melody throughout song marr overdubbed numerous guitar parts onto song and in a december 1993 interview told guitar player magazine chord progression for song from instrumental intro to lyric will nature make a man of me is a asus4 a e bm7 d7 c m e a e a asus4 e reception on release song received near unanimous critical praise paul morley of nme wrote this charming man is an accessible bliss and seriously moving this group fully understand that casual is not enough this is one of greatest singles of year a poor compliment unique and indispensable like blue monday and karma chameleon that s better a contemporary review in face asked where has all wildness and daring got to some of it has found its way onto smiths record this charming man it jangles and crashes and morrissey jumps in middle with his mutant choir boy voice sounding jolly and angst ridden at same time it should be given out on street corners to unsuspecting passers by of all ages another contemporary review by treble magazine described song as a stellar jangle pop track based on one of marr s first truly iconic guitar licks while band was little known in united states at time robert palmer of new york times described song as sparkling soaring superlative pop rock and proof that guitar band format pioneered by beatles is still viable for groups with something to say following year palmer chose song as second best single of 1984 allmusic s ned raggett noted that early elvis would have approved of music wilde of words and described track as an audacious end result by any standard tim digravina of same organisation wrote that debating merits of track here would be a bit pointless as it s a classic song from one of last great classic bands it might as well be called this charming song in 2007 oasis songwriter noel gallagher described first time he heard track second i heard this charming man everything made sense sound of that guitar intro was incredible lyrics are fuckin amazing too people say morrissey s a miserable cunt but i knew straight away what he was on about in 2006 liz hoggard from independent said that this charming man is about age gap gay sex during an appearance on top of pops morrissey appeared waving gladioli a 2004 bbc radio 2 feature on song noted that performance was most people s introduction to smiths and therefore to weird wordy world of morrissey and music of johnny marr uncut magazine commentating on nationally televised debut wrote that thursday evening when manchester s first appeared on top of pops would be an unexpected pivotal cultural event in lives of a million serious english boys his very english camp was a revolt into sixties kitchen sink greyness against gaudiness of eighties new wave music as exemplified by culture club and their ilk smiths subject matter may have been squalid but there was a purity of purpose about them that you messed with at your peril noel gallagher said of performance none of my mates liked them they were more hooligan types they came into work and said fuckin hell did you see that poof on top of pops with bush in his back pocket but i thought it was life changing versions and release history earliest version of
