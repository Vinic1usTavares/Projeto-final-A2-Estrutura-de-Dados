natural history is a work by pliny elder it is one of largest single works to have survived from roman empire to modern day and purports to cover all ancient knowledge work s subject area is thus not limited to what is today understood by natural history pliny himself defines his scope as natural world or life natural history i 13 it is encyclopedic in scope but its structure is not like that of a modern encyclopedia it is only work by pliny to have survived and last that he published he published first 10 books in ad 77 but had not made a final revision of remainder at time of his death during ad 79 eruption of vesuvius rest was published posthumously by pliny s nephew pliny younger work is divided into 37 books organised into ten volumes these cover topics including astronomy mathematics geography ethnography anthropology human physiology zoology botany agriculture horticulture pharmacology mining mineralogy sculpture painting and precious stones pliny s natural history became a model for later encyclopedias and scholarly works as a result of its breadth of subject matter its referencing of original authors and its index overview thumb naturalis historia work printed by johannes in 1499 in venice italy pliny s natural history was written alongside other substantial works which have since been lost pliny ad 23 79 combined his scholarly activities with a busy career as an imperial administrator for emperor vespasian much of his writing was done at night daytime hours were spent working for emperor as he explains in dedicatory preface addressed to vespasian s elder son future emperor titus with whom he had served in army and to whom work is dedicated as for nocturnal hours spent writing these were seen not as a loss of sleep but as an addition to life for as he states in preface vita est to be alive is to be watchful in a military metaphor of a sentry keeping watch in night natural history dedication to titus c plinius secundus to his friend titus vespasian pliny claims to be only roman ever to have undertaken such a work in his prayer for blessing of universal mother natural history xxxvii 77 hail to thee nature thou parent of all things and do thou deign to show thy favour unto me who alone of all citizens of rome have in thy every department thus made known thy praise natural history is encyclopaedic in scope but its format is unlike a modern encyclopaedia however it does have structure pliny uses aristotle s division of nature animal vegetable mineral to recreate natural world in literary form introduction to natural history bks i ii loeb classical library rev ed 1989 pp vii x rather than presenting compartmentalised stand alone entries arranged alphabetically pliny s ordered natural landscape is a coherent whole offering reader a guided tour a brief excursion under our direction among whole of works of nature natural history viii 44 loeb work is unified but varied my subject is world of nature or in other words life he tells titus thumb left a cynocephalus or dog head as described by pliny in his natural history from nuremberg chronicle 1493 nature for pliny was divine a pantheistic concept inspired by stoic philosophy which underlies much of his thought but deity in question was a goddess whose main purpose was to serve human race nature that is life is human life in a natural landscape after an initial survey of cosmology and geography pliny starts his treatment of animals with human race for whose sake great nature appears to have created all other things natural history vii 1 rackham et al this teleological view of nature was common in antiquity and is crucial to understanding of natural history natural history vii components of nature are not just described in and for themselves but also with a view to their role in human life pliny devotes a number of books to plants with a focus on their medicinal value books on minerals include descriptions of their uses in architecture sculpture painting and jewellery pliny s premise is distinct from modern ecological theories reflecting prevailing sentiment of his time introduction to natural history books iii vii loeb classical library rev ed 1989 pp xi xiii thumb a described by pliny in his natural history from nuremberg chronicle 1493 pliny s work frequently reflects rome s imperial expansion which brought new and exciting things to capital exotic eastern spices strange animals to be put on display or herded into arena even alleged phoenix sent to emperor claudius in ad 47 although as pliny admits this was generally acknowledged to be a fake pliny repeated aristotle s maxim that africa was always producing something new nature s variety and versatility were claimed to be infinite when i have observed nature she has always induced me to deem no statement about her incredible natural history xi 2 rackham et al this led pliny to recount rumours of strange peoples on edges of world these monstrous races or dog heads whose single foot could act as a who lived on scents were not strictly new they had been mentioned in 5th century bc by greek historian herodotus whose history was a broad mixture of myths legends and facts but pliny made them better known natural history vii 2 as full of variety as nature itself pliny younger letters 3 5 stated pliny s nephew pliny younger and this verdict largely explains appeal of natural history since pliny s death in eruption of mount vesuvius in 79 pliny had gone to investigate strange cloud shaped like an umbrella pine according to his nephew rising from mountain pliny younger

writing natural history was to cover all learning and art so far as they are connected with nature or draw their materials from nature he says my subject is a barren one world of nature or in other words life and that subject in its least elevated department and employing either rustic terms or foreign nay barbarian words that actually have to be introduced with an apology moreover path is not a beaten highway of authorship nor one in which mind is eager to range there is not one of us who has made same venture nor yet one among greeks who has tackled single handed all departments of subject sources pliny studied original authorities on each subject and took care to make excerpts from their pages his indices auctorum sometimes list authorities he actually consulted though not exhaustively in other cases they cover principal writers on subject whose names are borrowed second hand from his immediate authorities he acknowledges his obligations to his predecessors to own up to those who were means of one s own achievements pliny elder 21 in preface author claims to have stated 20 000 facts gathered from some 2 000 books and from 100 select authors extant lists of his authorities cover more than 400 including 146 roman and 327 greek and other sources of information lists generally follow order of subject matter of each book this has been shown in heinrich brunn s disputatio bonn 1856 cf heinrich brunn s kleine schriften von hermann brunn und heinrich bulle bd zur griechischen kunstgeschichte mit 69 abbildungen im text und auf einer 1905 reproduction by ulan press 2012 one of pliny s authorities is marcus terentius varro in geographical books varro is supplemented by topographical commentaries of agrippa which were completed by emperor augustus for his zoology he relies largely on aristotle and on juba scholarly mauretanian king quam regno v 16 juba is one of his principal guides in botany theophrastus is also named in his indices and pliny had translated theophrastus s greek into latin another work by theophrastus on stones was cited as a source on ores and minerals pliny strove to use all greek histories available to him such as herodotus and thucydides as well as bibliotheca historica of diodorus siculus cf mary beagon roman nature thought of pliny elder clarendon press 1992 s v trevor murphy pliny elder s natural history empire in

younger with introduction by john b firth does it surprise you that a busy man found time to finish so many volumes many of which deal with such minute details he used to begin to study at night on festival of vulcan not for luck but from his love of study long before dawn in winter he would commence at seventh hour he could sleep at call and it would come upon him and leave him in middle of his work before daybreak he would go to vespasian for he too was a night worker and then set about his official duties on his return home he would again give to study any time that he had free often in summer after taking a meal which with him as in old days was always a simple and light one he would lie in sun if he had any time to spare and a book would be read aloud from which he would take notes and extracts pliny younger told following anecdote illustrating his uncle s enthusiasm for study after dinner a book would be read aloud and he would take notes in a cursory way i remember that one of his friends when reader pronounced a word wrongly checked him and made him read it again and my uncle said to him did you not catch meaning when his friend said yes he remarked why then did you make him turn back we have lost more than ten lines through your interruption so jealous was he of every moment lost style pliny s writing style emulates that of seneca cf trevor murphy pliny elder s

quod manum de tabula memorabili praecepto this might be translated everything from a salutary warning onwards represents ablative absolute phrase starting with memorabili praecepto publication history first publication pliny wrote first ten books in ad 77 and was engaged on revising rest during two remaining years of his life work was probably published with little revision by author s nephew pliny younger who when telling story of a tame dolphin and describing floating islands of lake thirty years later pliny younger letters 8 20 9 33 ref has apparently forgotten that both are to be found in his uncle s work he describes naturalis historia as a naturae historia and characterises it as a work that is learned and full of matter and as varied as nature herself ref pliny younger letters 3 5 see also true story of lake absence of author s final revision may explain many errors including why text is as john healy writes disjointed discontinuous and not in a logical order healy 2004

however bede updated and corrected pliny on tides healy 2004 introduction xxxvi xxxvii there are about 200 extant manuscripts but best of more ancient manuscripts that at bamberg state library

made a complete translation in 1855 topics natural history is generally divided into organic plants and animals and inorganic matter although there are frequent digressions in each section encyclopedia also notes uses made of all of these by romans its description of metals and minerals is valued for its detail in history of science being most extensive compilation still available from ancient world book i serves as pliny s preface explaining his approach and providing a table of contents astronomy thumb left upright 1 8 how hipparchus found distances to sun and moon first topic covered is astronomy in book ii pliny starts with known universe roundly criticising attempts at cosmology as madness including view that there are countless other worlds than earth he doubts four aristotelian elements fire earth air and water natural history ii 10 but records seven planets including sun and moon natural history ii 28 51 earth is a sphere suspended in middle of space natural history ii 5 6 10 he considers it a weakness to try to find shape and form of god natural history ii 14 or to suppose that such a being would care about human affairs natural history ii 20 he mentions eclipses but considers hipparchus s almanac grandiose for seeming to know how nature works natural history ii 24 he cites posidonius s estimate that moon is 230 000 miles away he describes comets noting that only aristotle has recorded seeing more than one at once natural history i 89 90 book ii continues with natural meteorological events lower in sky including winds weather whirlwinds lightning and rainbows natural history ii 119 153 he returns to astronomical facts such as effect of longitude on time of sunrise and sunset natural history ii 181 variation of sun s elevation with latitude affecting by sundials natural history ii 182 and variation of day length with latitude natural history ii 186 187 geography in books iii to vi pliny moves to earth itself in book iii he covers geography of iberian peninsula and italy book iv covers europe including britain book v looks at africa and asia while book vi looks eastwards to black sea india and far east anthropology book vii discusses human race covering anthropology and ethnography aspects of human physiology and assorted matters such as greatness of julius caesar outstanding people such as hippocrates and asclepiades happiness and fortune zoology thumb upright 1 25 a collection of roman amber from archeological museum of aquileia zoology is discussed in books viii to xi encyclopedia mentions different sources of purple dye particularly murex snail highly prized source of tyrian purple it describes elephant and hippopotamus in detail as well as value and origin of pearl and invention of fish farming and oyster farming keeping of aquariums was a popular pastime of rich and pliny provides anecdotes of problems of owners becoming too closely attached to their fish pliny correctly identifies origin of amber as fossilised resin of pine trees evidence cited includes fact that some samples exhibit encapsulated insects a feature readily explained by presence of a viscous resin pliny refers to way in which it exerts a charge when rubbed a property well known to theophrastus he devotes considerable space to bees which he admires for their industry organisation and honey discussing significance of queen bee and use of smoke by beekeepers at hive to collect honeycomb he praises song of nightingale botany botany is handled in books xii to xviii with theophrastus as one of pliny s sources manufacture of papyrus and various grades of papyrus available to romans are described different types of trees and properties of their wood are explained in books xii to xiii vine viticulture and varieties of grape are discussed in book xiv while book xv covers olive tree in detail natural history xv 1 34 followed by other trees including apple and pear natural history xv 47 54 fig natural history xv 68 78 cherry natural history xv 102 104 myrtle and laurel natural history xv 119 138 among others pliny gives special attention to spices such as pepper ginger and cane sugar he mentions different varieties of pepper whose values are comparable with that of gold and silver while sugar is noted only for its medicinal value he is critical of perfumes perfumes are most pointless of luxuries for pearls and jewels are at least passed on to one s heirs and clothes last for a time but perfumes lose their fragrance and perish as soon as they are used he gives a summary of their ingredients such as attar of roses which he says is most widely used base other substances added include myrrh cinnamon and balsam gum drugs medicine and magic a major section of natural history books xx to xxix discusses matters related to medicine especially plants that yield useful drugs pliny lists over 900 drugs compared to 600 in dioscorides s de materia medica 550 in theophrastus and 650 in galen healy 2004 introduction xxix poppy and opium are mentioned pliny notes that opium induces sleep and can be fatal natural history xx 198 200 diseases and their treatment are covered in book xxvi pliny addresses magic in book xxx he is critical of magi attacking astrology and suggesting that magic originated in medicine creeping in by pretending to offer health he names zoroaster of ancient persia as source of magical ideas he states that pythagoras empedocles democritus and plato all travelled abroad to learn magic remarking that it was surprising anyone accepted doctrines they brought back and that medicine of hippocrates and magic of democritus should have flourished simultaneously at time of peloponnesian war agriculture thumb right detail of a relief depicting a gallo roman harvesting machine methods used to cultivate crops are described in book xviii he praises cato elder and his work de agri cultura which he uses as a primary source pliny s work includes discussion of all known cultivated crops and vegetables as well as herbs and remedies derived from them he describes machines used in cultivation and processing crops for example he describes a simple mechanical reaper that cut ears of wheat and barley without straw and was pushed by oxen book xviii chapter 72 it is depicted on a bas relief found at trier from later roman period he also describes how grain is ground using a pestle a hand mill or a mill driven by water wheels as found in roman water mills across empire metallurgy pliny extensively discusses metals starting with gold and silver book xxxiii and then base metals copper mercury lead tin and iron as well as their many alloys such as electrum bronze pewter and steel book xxxiv he is critical of greed for gold such as absurdity of using metal for coins in early republic he gives examples of way rulers proclaimed their prowess by exhibiting gold looted from their campaigns such as that by claudius after conquering britain and tells stories of midas and croesus he discusses why gold is unique in its malleability and ductility far greater than any other metal examples given are its ability to be beaten into fine foil with just one ounce producing 750 leaves four inches square fine gold wire can be woven into cloth although imperial clothes usually combined it with natural fibres like wool he once saw agrippina younger wife of claudius at a public show on lake involving a naval battle wearing a military cloak made of gold he rejects herodotus s claims of indian gold obtained by ants or dug up by griffins in scythia silver he writes does not occur in native form and has to be mined usually occurring with lead ores spain produced most silver in his time many of mines having been started by hannibal one of largest had galleries running up to two miles into mountain while men worked day and night draining mine in shifts pliny is probably referring to reverse overshot water wheels operated by treadmill and found in roman mines britain he says is very rich in lead which is found on surface at many places and thus very easy to extract production was so high that a law was passed attempting to restrict mining thumb left upright 1 25 roman coins were struck not cast so these coin moulds were created for forgery fraud and forgery are described in detail in particular coin counterfeiting by mixing copper with silver or even admixture with iron tests had been developed for counterfeit coins and proved very popular with victims mostly ordinary people he deals with liquid metal mercury also found in silver mines he records that it is toxic and amalgamates with gold so is used for refining and extracting that metal he says mercury is used for gilding copper while antimony is found in silver mines and is used as an eyebrow cosmetic main ore of mercury is cinnabar long used as a pigment by painters he says that colour is similar to probably kermes insect dust is very toxic so workers handling material wear face masks of bladder skin copper and bronze are says pliny most famous for their use in statues including colossi gigantic statues as tall as towers most famous being colossus of rhodes he personally saw massive statue of nero in rome which was removed after emperor s death face of statue was modified shortly after nero s death during vespasian s reign to make it a statue of sol hadrian moved it with help of architect and 24 elephants to a position next to flavian amphitheatre now called colosseum pliny gives a special place to iron distinguishing hardness of steel from what is now called wrought iron a softer grade he is scathing about use of iron in warfare mineralogy thumb upright amethyst intaglio 1st century ad depicting nero as apollo playing lyre cabinet des medailles in last two books of work books xxxvi and xxxvii pliny describes many different minerals and gemstones building on works by theophrastus and other authors topic concentrates on most valuable gemstones and he criticises obsession with luxury products such as engraved gems and hardstone carvings he provides a thorough discussion of properties of fluorspar noting that it is carved into vases and other decorative objects natural history xxxvii 18 22 account of magnetism includes myth of magnes shepherd pliny moves into crystallography and mineralogy describing octahedral shape of diamond and recording that diamond dust is used by gem engravers to cut and polish other gems owing to its great hardness natural history xxxvii 55 60 he states that rock crystal is valuable for its transparency and hardness and can be carved into vessels and implements he relates story of a woman who owned a ladle made of mineral paying sum of 150 000 sesterces for item nero deliberately broke two crystal cups when he realised that he was about to be deposed so denying their use to anyone else natural history xxxvii 23 29 pliny returns to problem of fraud and detection of false gems using several tests including scratch test where counterfeit gems can be marked by a steel file and genuine ones not perhaps it refers to glass imitations of jewellery gemstones he refers to using one hard mineral to scratch another presaging mohs hardness scale diamond sits at top of series because pliny says it will scratch all other minerals natural history xxxvii 196 200 art history pliny s chapters on roman and greek art are especially valuable because his work is virtually only available classical source of information on subject in history of art original greek authorities are duris of samos xenocrates of sicyon and antigonus of carystus element has been ascribed to duris xxxiv 61 notices of successive developments of art and list of workers in bronze and painters to xenocrates and a large amount of miscellaneous information to antigonus both xenocrates and antigonus are named in connection with xxxv 68 while antigonus is named in indexes of xxxiii xxxiv as a writer on art of embossing metal or working it in ornamental relief or intaglio greek epigrams contribute their share in pliny s descriptions of pictures and statues one of minor authorities for books xxxiv xxxv is heliodorus of athens author of a work on monuments of athens in indices to xxxiii xxxvi an important place is assigned to pasiteles of naples author of a work in five volumes on famous works of art xxxvi 40 probably incorporating substance of earlier greek treatises but pliny s indebtedness to pasiteles is denied by who holds that pliny used chronological work of apollodorus of athens as well as a current catalogue of artists pliny s knowledge of greek authorities was probably mainly due to varro whom he often quotes e g xxxiv 56 xxxv 113 156 xxxvi 17 39 41 thumb laocoon and his sons for a number of items relating to works of art near coast of asia minor and in adjacent islands pliny was indebted to general statesman orator and historian gaius licinius mucianus who died before 77 pliny mentions works of art collected by vespasian in temple of peace and in his other galleries xxxiv 84 but much of his information about position of such works in rome is from books not personal observation main merit of his account of ancient art only classical work of its kind is that it is a compilation ultimately founded on lost textbooks of xenocrates and on biographies of duris and antigonus on these compare dictionary of art historians s v xenocrates a dalby curriculum vitae of duris of samos in classical quarterly new series vol 41 1991 pp 539 541 d duris of samos in who was who in greek world

laocoon and his sons in palace of titus widely believed to be statue that is now in vatican to all pictures and bronzes in world xxxvi 37 statue is attributed by pliny to three sculptors from island of rhodes agesander possibly son of agesander and in temple near circus pliny admires ares and aphrodite of which would suffice to give renown to any other spot he adds at rome indeed works of art are legion besides one another from memory and however beautiful they may be we are distracted by overpowering claims of duty and business for to admire art we need leisure and profound stillness xxxvi 27 mining thumb striking landscape of las medulas most important gold mine in roman empire resulted from ruina montium mining technique pliny provides lucid descriptions of roman mining he describes gold mining in detail natural history xxxiii 36 81 with large scale use of water to scour alluvial gold deposits description probably refers to mining in northern spain especially at large las medulas site pliny describes methods of underground mining including use of fire setting to attack gold bearing rock and so extract ore in another part of his work pliny describes use of undermining to gain access to veins pliny was scathing about search for precious metals and gemstones or quartzite is considered hardest of all things except for greed for gold which is even more stubborn book xxxiv covers base metals their uses and their extraction copper mining is mentioned using a variety of ores including copper pyrites and marcasite some of mining being underground some on surface natural history xxxiv

pliny as a source for his own work in this regard pliny s influence over medieval period has been argued to be quite extensive for example one twentieth century historian has argued that pliny s reliance on book based knowledge and not direct observation shaped intellectual life to degree that it stymie d progress of western science this can be observed in early modern period when niccolo s 1509 de plinii on pliny s errors attacked pliny for lacking a proper scientific method unlike theophrastus or dioscorides and for lacking knowledge of philosophy or medicine sir thomas browne expressed scepticism about pliny s dependability in his 1646 pseudodoxia epidemica available at university of chicago site modern grundy steiner of northwestern university in a 1955 judgement considered by thomas r to represent collective opinion of pliny s critics wrote of pliny that he was not an original creative thinker nor a pioneer of research to be compared either with aristotle and theophrastus or with any of great moderns he was rather compiler of a secondary sourcebook italian author italo calvino in his 1991 book why read classics wrote that while people often consult pliny s natural history for facts and curiosities he is an author who deserves an extended read for measured movement of his prose which is enlivened by his admiration for everything that exists and his respect for infinite diversity of all phenomena first published as perche i classici mondadori 1991 calvino notes that while pliny is eclectic he was not uncritical though his evaluations of sources are inconsistent and unpredictable further calvino compares pliny to immanuel kant in that god is prevented by logic from conflicting with reason even though in calvino s view pliny makes a pantheistic identification of god as being immanent in nature as for destiny calvino writes art historian jacob isager writes in introduction to his analysis of pliny s chapters on art in natural history that his intention is to show how pliny in his encyclopedic work which is result of adaptations from many earlier writers and according to pliny himself was intended as a reference work nevertheless throughout expresses a basic attitude to man and his relationship with nature how he understands man s role as an inventor scientist and artist and finally his attitude to use and abuse of nature s and man s creations to progress and decay more specifically isager writes that guiding principle in pliny s treatment of greek and roman art is function of art in society while pliny uses his art history to express opinions about ideology of state paula findlen writing in cambridge history of science asserts that natural history was an ancient form of scientific knowledge most closely associated with writings of roman encyclopedist pliny elder his loquacious and witty historia naturalis offered an expansive definition of this subject it broadly described all entities found in nature or derived from nature that could be seen in roman world and read about in its books art artifacts and peoples as well as animals plants and minerals were included in his project findlen contrasts pliny s approach with that of his intellectual predecessors aristotle and theophrastus who sought general causes of natural phenomena while pliny was more interested in cataloguing natural wonders and his contemporary dioscorides explored nature for its uses in roman medicine in his great work de materia medica in view of mary beagon writing in classical tradition in 2010 historia naturalis has regained its status to a greater extent than at any time since advent of humanism work by those with scientific as well as philological expertise has resulted in improvements both to pliny s text and to his reputation as a scientist essential coherence of his enterprise has also been rediscovered and his ambitious portrayal in all its manifestations of nature that is life is recognized as a unique cultural record of its time see also his biography is featured in natural history naturales quaestiones a similar shorter encyclopedia written by seneca notes references sources
