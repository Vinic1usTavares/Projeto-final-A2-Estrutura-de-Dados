meddle is sixth studio album by english rock band pink floyd released on 31 october 1971 by harvest records album was produced between band s touring commitments from january to august 1971 at a series of locations around london including abbey road studios and morgan studios with no material to work with and no clear idea of album s direction band devised a series of novel experiments which eventually inspired album s signature track echoes although band s later albums would be unified by a central theme with lyrics written entirely by roger waters meddle was a group effort with lyrical contributions from each member and is considered a transitional album between syd barrett influenced group of late 1960s and emerging pink floyd cover has been explained by its creator storm thorgerson to be an ear underwater as with several previous albums designed by hipgnosis though thorgerson was unhappy with final result album was well received by critics upon its release and was commercially successful in united kingdom but lackluster publicity on part of band s american label capitol records led to poor sales there upon initial release recording returning from a series of tours across america and england in support of atom heart mother at start of 1971 pink floyd commenced work on new material at abbey road studios in london at time abbey road was equipped only with eight track multitrack recording facilities which band found insufficient for increasing technical demands of their project they transferred their best efforts including opening of what became echoes to 16 track tape at smaller studios in london namely air and morgan in west hampstead and resumed work with advantage of more flexible recording equipment engineers john leckie and peter bown recorded main abbey road and air sessions while for minor work at morgan rob black and roger quested handled engineering duties lacking a central theme for project band used several experimental methods in an attempt to spur creative process one exercise involved each member playing on a separate track with no reference to what other members were doing tempo was entirely random while band played around an agreed chord structure and moods such as first two minutes romantic next two up tempo each recorded section was named but process was largely unproductive after several weeks no complete songs had been created leckie had worked on albums such as george harrison s all things must pass and ringo starr s sentimental journey and was employed as a tape operator on meddle partly for his proclivity for working into early hours of morning he has said that pink floyd s sessions would often begin in afternoon and end early next morning during which time nothing would get done there was no record company contact whatsoever except when their label manager would show up now and again with a couple of bottles of wine and a couple of joints band would apparently spend long periods of time working on simple sounds or a particular guitar riff they also spent several days at air attempting to create music using a variety of household objects a project which would be revisited between their next albums dark side of moon and wish you were here following these early experiments called nothings band developed son of nothings which was followed by return of son of nothings working title of new album one of these early works involved use of richard wright s piano wright had fed a single note through a leslie speaker producing a submarine like ping band tried repeatedly to recreate this sound in studio but were unsuccessful and so demo version was used on what would later become echoes mixed almost exclusively at air studios combined with david gilmour s guitar band were able to develop track further experimenting with accidental sound effects such as gilmour s guitar being plugged into a wah wah pedal back to front an effect they used live from 1970 for central section of embryo unlike with atom heart mother new multi track capabilities of studio enabled them to create track in stages rather than performing it in a single take final 23 minute piece would eventually take up entire second side of album one of these days was developed around an ostinato bassline created by roger waters by feeding output through a binson bassline was performed by waters and gilmour using two bass guitars one on old strings drummer nick mason s abstruse one of these days i m going to cut you into little pieces vocal line was recorded at double speed using a falsetto voice and replayed at normal speed meddle was recorded between band s various concert commitments and therefore its production was spread over a considerable period of time band recorded in first half of april 1971 but in latter half played at doncaster and norwich before returning to record at end of month in may they split their time between sessions at abbey road and rehearsals and concerts in london lancaster stirling edinburgh glasgow and nottingham june and july were spent mainly performing at venues across europe august was spent in far east and australia september in europe and october to november in us in same period group also produced relics a compilation album of some of pink floyd s earlier works a quadraphonic mix of album was prepared at command studios on 21 and 26 september but remains unreleased new 2016 stereo and 5 1 mixes of album were inadvertently released as hidden tracks on reverberation blu ray disc in early years box set composition although tracks possess a variety of moods meddle is generally considered more cohesive than its 1970 predecessor atom heart mother largely instrumental one of these days is followed by a pillow of winds which is distinguished by being one of few quiet acoustic love songs in pink floyd catalogue these two songs segue into each other across windy sound effects anticipating technique that would later be used on wish you were here title of a pillow of winds was inspired by games of mahjong that waters mason and their wives played while in south of france song fearless includes field recordings of liverpool f c kop singing you ll never walk alone their anthem which brings song to an end in a heavily reverberated fade out san tropez by contrast is a jazz inflected pop song with a shuffle tempo composed by waters in his increasingly deployed style of breezy off cuff songwriting song was inspired by band s trip to south of france in 1970 pink floyd uncharacteristically displayed their sense of humour with seamus a pseudo blues novelty track featuring steve marriott s dog which gilmour was looking after howling along to music although seamus often tops polls of worst songs pink floyd ever created band would use animal sounds again on animals final song on album is 23 minute echoes first performed as return of son of nothing on 22 april 1971 in norwich band spent about six months on track in three studios morgan air and abbey road track opens with wright s ping echoes was recorded almost entirely at air studios and completed in july 1971 in background of track a shepard tone can be heard echoes also gave its name to compilation album echoes best of pink floyd on which a much edited version of title track was included on compilation multiple edits throughout entire song cut running length of piece down by some seven minutes some of material composed during creation of meddle was not used however one song would eventually become brain damage on dark side of moon packaging thumb roger waters nick

suggested a close up shot of a baboon s anus for album cover photograph he was overruled by band who informed him via an intercontinental telephone call while on tour in japan that they would rather have an ear underwater cover image was photographed by bob dowling image represents an ear underwater collecting waves of sound represented by ripples in water thorgerson later expressed dissatisfaction with cover claiming it to be his least favourite pink floyd album sleeve i think meddle is a much better album than its cover thorgerson s colleague aubrey powell shared his sentiments saying meddle was a mess i hated that cover i don t think we did them justice with that at all it s half hearted gatefold contains a group photograph of band floyd s last until 1987 s a momentary lapse of reason release and reception meddle was released on 31 october 1971 in us and 13 november in uk meddle was later released as a remastered lp by mobile fidelity sound lab and in april 1989 on their gold cd format album was included as part of box set shine on on 2 november 1992 although in uk it reached number three lacklustre publicity on part of capitol records led to weak sales in us and a chart position of number 70 pink floyd had a strong following in uk and other parts of europe recalled rupert perry then head of a r at capitol but they needed to be bigger in united states where they were only doing 200 000 units they were very much an album act no singles which was bad news for us they had a high credibility factor without sales on 29 november 1971 one of these days was released as a 7 inch single in us with fearless on b side one of these days and echoes were performed during live at pompeii latter in two parts and also on bbc s 1971 in concert meddle was later certified gold by riaa on 29 october 1973 and then double platinum on 11 march 1994 following added attention garnered by band s later successes in united states critical response on release meddle received generally positive reviews from music critics rolling stones jean charles costa wrote meddle not only confirms lead guitarist david gilmour s emergence as a real shaping force with group it states forcefully and accurately that group is well into growth track again and nme called it an exceptionally good album steve peterson of hit parader cited fearless as its best song and said of album this has got to be their best ever ed kelleher of circus called it another masterpiece by a masterful group noting fearless as fascinating and praising echoes as a tone poem that allows all four group members much time to stretch their muscles however melody maker was more reserved describing it as a soundtrack to a non existent movie in christgau s record guide rock albums of seventies 1981 robert christgau said meddle was a fairly good progression over group s previous work and featured folk songs highlighted by unique melodies although he lamented lyrics to a pillow of winds word behold should never cross their filters again in his critique of echoes he believed lyrics imitate across universe by beatles but over 23 minutes of music that flows with a timeless calm similar to interstellar overdrive daryl easlea of bbc felt it was a similar but more consistent and tuneful version of atom heart mother highlighted by echoes which he said dominates entire work and is everything right about progressive rock engaging intelligent and compelling in new rolling stone album guide 2004 rob sheffield said echoes showed pink floyd to be a more developed group than before coloring slow guitar ripples with deep in studio sonic details that only truly baked would notice much less appreciate writing for allmusic editor stephen thomas erlewine called meddle best album from their transitional years leading up to dark side of moon as it spends most of its time with sonic textures and elongated compositions most notably on its epic closer echoes he noted a uniform tone but not song structure and wrote of album s significance in group s catalogue pink floyd were nothing if not masters of texture and meddle is one of their greatest excursions into little details pointing way to measured brilliance of dark side of moon and entire roger waters era it was voted number 255 in third edition of colin larkin s all time top 1000 albums 2000 track listing personnel credits
