tomorrow never knows is a song by english rock band beatles it was released in august 1966 as final track on their album revolver although it was first song recorded for lp credited as a lennon mccartney song it was written primarily by john lennon song marked a radical departure for beatles as band fully embraced potential of recording studio without any consideration for being able to reproduce results in concert when writing song lennon drew inspiration from his experiences with hallucinogenic drug lsd and from book psychedelic experience a manual based on tibetan book of dead by timothy leary richard alpert and ralph metzner on recording beatles incorporated musical elements that were unconventional in pop music including musique concrete avant garde composition and electro acoustic sound manipulation song features an indian inspired modal backing of tambura and sitar drone and bass guitar with minimal harmonic deviation from a single chord underpinned by a constant but non standard drum pattern added to this tape loops prepared by band were overdubbed live onto rhythm track part of lennon s vocal was fed through a leslie speaker cabinet which was normally used as a loudspeaker for a hammond organ song s backwards guitar parts and effects marked first use of reversed sounds in a pop recording although beatles 1966 b side rain which they recorded soon afterwards using same technique was issued over three months before revolver on release tomorrow never knows was source of confusion and ridicule for many fans and journalists it has since been recognised as most effective evocation of a lsd experience ever recorded in author colin larkin s description and as a song that introduced into popular music lyrical themes espousing mind expansion anti materialism and eastern spirituality it has also been cited as an early and highly influential recording in psychedelic music and electronic music genres particularly for its pioneering use of sampling tape manipulation and other production techniques pitchfork media placed track at number 19 on its list of 200 greatest songs of 1960s and rolling stone ranked it at number 18 on magazine s list of 100 greatest beatles songs background and inspiration thumb timothy leary before a crowd of university students during a lecture tour in 1969 in his lyrics to tomorrow never knows lennon drew from leary s espousal of lsd as a means to transcend material concerns john lennon wrote tomorrow never knows in january 1966 with lyrics adapted from book psychedelic experience a manual based on tibetan book of dead by timothy leary richard alpert and ralph metzner which was in turn adapted from tibetan book of dead although beatles aide peter brown believed that lennon s source for lyrics was tibetan book of dead itself which he said lennon had read while under influence of lsd george harrison later stated that idea for lyrics came from leary alpert and metzner s book paul mccartney confirmed this stating that when he and lennon visited newly opened indica bookshop lennon had been looking for a copy of portable nietzsche and found a copy of psychedelic experience that contained lines whenever in doubt turn off your mind relax float downstream lennon said he bought book went home took lsd and followed instructions exactly as stated in text book held that ego death experienced under influence of lsd and other psychedelic drugs is essentially similar to dying process and requires similar guidance this is a state of being known by eastern mystics and masters as samadhi a state of being totally aware of present moment a one pointedness of mind title never actually appears in song s lyrics lennon later revealed that like a hard day s night it was taken from one of ringo starr s malapropisms in a television interview in early 1964 starr had uttered phrase tomorrow never knows when laughing off an incident that took place at british embassy in washington dc during which one of guests had cut off a portion of his hair piece was originally titled mark i and remained so until beatles were mixing revolver album in june void is cited as another working title but according to beatles historian mark lewisohn this resulted from neil aspinall band s road manager and assistant erroneously referring to it as such in a contemporary issue of beatles book lennon said he settled on starr s phrase to sort of take edge off heavy philosophical lyrics according to aspinall s account in beatles monthly musical portion of song was result of all four beatles working to ensure music matched power of lennon s lyrics basic tune was written during first hours of recording session musical structure mccartney remembered that even though song s harmony was mainly restricted to chord of c george martin beatles producer accepted it as it was and said it was rather interesting harmonic structure is derived from indian music a genre that harrison had introduced to beatles sound late in 1965 with his sitar part on norwegian wood and is based on a high volume c drone played on a tambura song s musical key is c mixolydian chord over drone is generally c major but some changes to b major result from vocal modulations as well as orchestral and guitar tape loops according to author peter lavezzoli composition is first pop song to eschew formal chord changes altogether despite this limitation musicologist dominic pedler sees beatles harmonic ingenuity displayed in upper harmonies turn off your mind for example is a run of unvarying e melody notes before relax involves an e g melody note shift and float downstream an e c g descent it is not dying involves a run of three g melody notes that rise on dying to a b at start of verse s fifth bar creating a vii i b c slash due to lennon s adherence to leary s text tomorrow never knows was also first song by beatles to depart from any form of rhyming scheme recording thumb 200px right a cross section showing inner workings of a leslie speaker cabinet tomorrow never knows was first song attempted during sessions for revolver which started at 8 pm on 6 april 1966 in studio 3 at emi studios subsequently abbey road studios geoff emerick who was promoted to role of beatles recording engineer for revolver recalled that band encouraged us to break rules and ensure that each instrument should sound unlike itself lennon sought to capture atmosphere of a tibetan buddhist ceremony he told martin that song should sound like it was being chanted by a thousand tibetan monks with his vocal evoking dalai lama singing from a mountaintop latter effect was achieved by using a leslie speaker when concept was explained to lennon he enquired if same effect could be achieved by hanging him upside down and spinning him around a microphone while he sang into it emerick made a connector to break into electronic circuitry of leslie cabinet and then re recorded vocal as it came out of revolving speaker thumb left detail of a tibetan buddhist temple lennon sought to capture mood of tibetan monks chanting from a mountaintop further to their approach when recording rubber soul late previous year beatles and martin embraced idea of recording studio as an instrument on revolver particularly tomorrow never knows as lennon hated doing a second take to double his vocals ken townsend studio s technical manager developed an alternative form of double tracking called artificial double tracking adt system taking signal from sync head of one tape machine and delaying it slightly through a second tape machine two tape machines used were not driven by mains electricity but from a separate generator which put out a particular frequency same for both thereby keeping them locked together by altering speed and frequencies he could create various effects which beatles used throughout recording of revolver lennon s vocal is double tracked on first three verses of song effect of leslie cabinet can be heard after backwards guitar solo track includes highly compressed drums that beatles favoured at time with reverse cymbals reverse guitar processed vocals looped tape effects and sitar and tambura drone in description of musicologist russell reising meditative state of a psychedelic experience is conveyed through musical drone enhancing lyrical imagery while buzz of a drug induced high is sonically reproduced in harrison s tambura rhythm and starr s heavily treated drum sound despite implied chord changes in verses and repeatedly at end of song mccartney s bass maintains a constant ostinato in c reising writes of drum part starr s accompaniment throughout piece consists of a kind of stumbling march providing a bit of temporal disruption first accent of each bar falls on measure s first beat and second stress occurs in second half of measure s third quarter double sixteenth notes in stuttering pre emption of normal rhythmic emphasis on second backbeat hardly a classic rock and roll gesture use of 1 4 inch audio tape loops resulted primarily from mccartney s admiration for stockhausen s gesang der by disabling erase head of a tape recorder and then spooling a continuous loop of tape through machine while recording tape would constantly overdub itself creating a saturation effect a technique also used in musique concrete tape could also be induced to go faster and slower mccartney encouraged other beatles to use same effects and create their own loops after experimentation on their own various beatles supplied a total of 30 or so tape loops to martin who selected 16 for use on song each loop was about six seconds long overdubbing of tape loops took place on 7 april loops were played on tape machines located in various studios of abbey road building and controlled by emi technicians in studio three each machine was monitored by one technician who had to hold a pencil within each loop to maintain tension four beatles controlled faders of mixing console while martin varied stereo panning and emerick watched meters eight of tapes were used at one time changed halfway through song tapes were made like most of other loops by superimposition and acceleration according to martin finished mix of tape loops could not be repeated because of complex and random way in which they were laid over music harrison similarly described mix of loops as spontaneous given that each run through might favour different sounds over another thumb 150px right a 7 inch reel of audio recording tape which was type used to create song s tape loops five tape loops are prominent in finished version of song according to author ian macdonald writing in 1990s these loops contain following a recording of mccartney s laughter sped up to resemble sound of a seagull enters at 0 07 an orchestral chord of b major 0 19 a mellotron on its flute setting 0 22 a mellotron strings sound alternating between b and c in 6 8 time 0 38 a sitar playing a rising phrase recorded with heavy saturation and sped up 0 56 author robert rodriguez writes that content of five loops has continued to invite debate among commentators however and that manipulation applied to each of recordings has made them impossible to decipher with authority based on most widely held views he says that aside from mccartney s laughter and b major chord sounds were two loops of sitar passages both reversed and sped up and a loop of mellotron string and brass voicings in their book recording beatles kevin ryan and brian list two loops of sitar recordings yet rather than mellotron list a mandolin or acoustic guitar treated with tape echo final overdubs were recorded on 22 april according to lewisohn who had access to emi s studios logs and notes these overdubs comprised harrison s sitar and lennon s leslie treated vocal part after completing recording mccartney was eager to gauge reaction of band s contemporaries on 2 may he played song to bob dylan at latter s hotel suite in london as track started dylan said dismissively oh i get it you don t want to be cute anymore according to marianne faithfull who was also present dylan then walked out of room mccartney recalled that when beatles played song to members of rolling stones and who they visibly sat up and were interested whereas cilla black just laughed lennon later told beatles biographer hunter davies i should have tried to get near my original idea monks singing i realise now that s what i wanted after experimenting with techniques on tomorrow never knows beatles used reversed sounds and tape speed variation extensively throughout revolver sessions on rain which was issued as b side of their paperback writer single in may 1966 part of lennon s vocal track was reprised backwards over coda while harrison planned and recorded his lead guitar parts for i m only sleeping with tape direction reversed in order to achieve a dislocated effect while highlighting love you to as an example of beatles fully exploring indian musical form during sessions music historian simon philo nevertheless identifies tomorrow never knows as track that made few if any concessions to formula and so confirmed that beatles had unequivocally moved on tomorrow never knows was barely a song let alone a pop song musicologist william echard describes it as an example of a raga rock song ing shoulders with classical avant garde discarded take 1 was issued on anthology 2 compilation in 1996 interpretation harrison questioned whether lennon fully understood meaning of song s lyrics you can hear and i am sure most beatles fans have tomorrow never knows a lot and not know really what it is about basically it is saying what meditation is all about goal of meditation is to go beyond that is transcend waking sleeping and dreaming so song starts out by saying turn off your mind relax and float downstream it is not dying then it says lay down all thoughts surrender to void it is shining that you may see meaning of within it is being from birth to death all we ever do is think we have one thought we have another thought another thought another thought even when you are asleep you are having dreams so there is never a time from birth to death when mind isn t always active with thoughts but you can turn off your mind and go to part which maharishi described as where was your last thought before you thought it whole point is that we are song self is coming from a state of pure awareness from state of being all rest that comes about in outward manifestation of physical world including all fluctuations which end up as thoughts and actions is just clutter true nature of each soul is pure consciousness so song is really about transcending and about quality of transcendent i am not too sure if john actually fully understood what he was saying he knew he was onto something when he saw those words and turned them into a song but to have experienced what lyrics in that song are actually about i don t know if he fully understood it release and reception tomorrow never knows was sequenced as final track on revolver which emi s parlophone label issued on 5 august 1966 in his design for lp cover klaus voormann drew inspiration from song recognising need for artwork that would capture beatles new direction and avant garde aspect of recording voormann later said that he found tomorrow never knows frightening adding that it was so far away from early beatles stuff that even i myself thought well normal kind of beatles fan won t want to buy this record but they did in an interview in october 1966 harrison described song as easily most amazing new thing we ve ever come up with but acknowledged that it might represent a terrible mess of a sound to listeners who approached track without open ears he added it s like indian stuff you mustn t listen to eastern music with a western ear in advance of release emi had issued songs to radio stations throughout july in increments to prepare beatles audience for new music tomorrow never knows was last track to receive a public airing a few days before album was issued commercially reaction to revolver was generally ecstatic according to macdonald with listeners at album s aural invention to beatles less progressive fans however radical changes in band s sound were source of confusion editor of australian teen magazine wrote everyone from brisbane to bootle hates that daft song lennon sang at end of revolver in his review for nme allen evans said in response to lyric s exhortation to relax and float downstream but how can you relax with electronic outer space noises often sounding like seagulls only ringo s rock steady drumming is natural peter jones of record mirror commented you need some sort of aural microscope to get message from this but it s darned compelling listening green richard jones peter 30 july 1966 beatles revolver parlophone record mirror available at rock s backpages subscription required in recently launched crawdaddy paul williams derided tomorrow never knows and album s single yellow submarine saying of lennon s song a good artist doesn t publish first drafts writing in 1977 author nicholas schaffner said that those who had been confused by lyrics were most likely unfamiliar with hallucinogenic drugs and timothy leary s message but that transcendental quality became clear during build up to 1967 summer of love song was parodied as l s bumblebee as part of a satirical sketch on swinging london phenomenon in not only but also 1966 christmas tv special which included a cameo appearance by lennon sung by comedians peter cook and dudley moore both of whom are dressed in indian clothing song evokes seagull sounds of tomorrow never knows through presence of a bird squawking in studio and includes lyrics playing on sensory contradictions of lines such as listen to colour of your dreams from beatles track in 2006 pitchfork ranked tomorrow never knows at number 19 on its list of 200 greatest songs of 1960s and q magazine placed track 75th on a list of 100 greatest songs of all time tomorrow never knows appears at number 18 on rolling stones list of best beatles songs and at number 4 on a similar list compiled by mojo in 2006 in 2018 music staff of time out london ranked it at number 2 on their list of best beatles songs according to acclaimed music it is 144th most celebrated song in popular music history love remix thumb 200px right love project which combined tomorrow never knows and within you without you in 2006

tomorrow never knows was mixed with vocals and melody from within you without you creating a different version of two songs reviewing album for popmatters zeth lundy wrote within you without you tomorrow never knows mash up perhaps most thrilling and effective track on entire disc fuses two especially transcendental songs into one a union of two ambiguous open ended declarations of spiritual pursuit in their chapter on beatles psychedelic period in cambridge companion to beatles authors russell reising and jim leblanc describe within you without you tomorrow never knows as most musically and visually stunning segment of cirque du soleil show love remix is one of main songs in beatles rock band in popular culture according to colin larkin writing in encyclopedia of popular music tomorrow never knows has been recognised as most effective evocation of a lsd experience ever recorded ian macdonald says that song s message represented a revolutionary concept in mainstream society in 1966 he adds tomorrow never knows launched till then elite preserved concept of mind expansion into pop simultaneously drawing attention to consciousness enhancing drugs and ancient religious philosophies of orient utterly alien to western thought in their anti materialism rapt passivity and world sceptical focus on visionary consciousness in music hernan campbell of sputnikmusic recognises tomorrow never knows as most important psychedelic composition in history of genre and epitome of everything that psychedelia stands for in opinion of former mojo editor paul trynka track benefited most from beatles ability to channel their ideas into a recognisable song form a discipline that ensured their psychedelic recordings were superior to those by grateful dead and other contemporary san francisco acts writing in his book electronic and experimental music thom holmes includes tomorrow never knows in his list of pioneering works in electronic music he says that track ushered in a new era in use of electronic music in rock and pop music in book encyclopedia of classic rock david and michael larson say that with revolver beatles erased boundaries of time and culture adding ancient met modern on tomorrow never knows as sitars encountered tape loops tomorrow never knows reintroduced sustained repetition of drone absent in western music since middle ages and only recently discovered by avant garde composer la monte young according to peter lavezzoli in his book dawn of indian music in west tomorrow never knows was most groundbreaking production to date in popular music and he says it still retains a terrifying visceral power musicologist walter everett describes revolver as an innovative example of electronic music and says that tomorrow never knows was also highly influential on psychedelic rock he identifies its studio effects and musical form as central to pink floyd s pow r toc h and recognises same use of extreme tape speed manipulation in subsequent recordings by jimi hendrix and frank zappa and backwards tapes in work of hendrix pink floyd byrds who electric prunes spirit tomorrow soft machine and first edition he also identifies leslie treated vocal as a precedent for similar experimentation by hendrix grateful dead moody blues cream yes led zeppelin and black sabbath journalist steve turner highlights sound sampling and tape manipulation on song as having had a profound effect on everyone from jimi hendrix to jay z having introduced these techniques to mainstream pop turner writes tomorrow never knows inspired sampling that became commonplace over ten years later such as in sugarhill gang s rapper s delight and other examples of an artist taking a well known riff or musical motif from an existing song in david byrne and brian eno s my life in bush of ghosts with its use of assorted spoken word and vocal samples in recordings by big audio dynamite which included samples from film soundtracks and in moby s play with its incorporation of little known and disparate vocal tracks in 2011 dj spooky said that beatles song remained in dna of so much going on these days and that use of tape collage alone makes it one of first tracks to use sampling really successfully i also think that brian eno s idea of studio as instrument comes from this kind of recording recalling his introduction to tomorrow never knows in 1966 american producer tony visconti has said it was incredible how music matched lyrics and previous to this album nobody was writing like that he also said that revolver showed how studio could be used as an instrument and contributed to his decision to relocate to london because i had to learn how people made records like this in his 2004 book sonic alchemy visionary music producers and their maverick recordings david howard pairs martin s work on tomorrow never knows with phil spector s 1966 production of river deep mountain high as two visionary achievements in sound that ensured that recording studio was now its own instrument record production had been elevated into art song is referenced in lyric to oasis 1995 song morning glory tomorrow never knows what it doesn t know too soon chemical brothers have referred to tomorrow never knows as template for their music their 1996 track setting sun is a direct tribute to it as is let forever be john foxx of ultravox also cited song as an influence saying that as soon as i heard it i knew it contained almost everything that i would want to investigate for rest of my life cover versions junior parker recorded a version in
