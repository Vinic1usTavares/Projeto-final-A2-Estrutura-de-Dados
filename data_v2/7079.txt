thumb upright 1 25 right percival lowell originator of planet x hypothesis following discovery of planet neptune in 1846 there was considerable speculation that another planet might exist beyond its orbit search began in mid 19th century and continued at start of 20th with percival lowell s quest for planet x lowell proposed planet x hypothesis to explain apparent discrepancies in orbits of giant planets particularly uranus and neptune speculating that gravity of a large unseen ninth planet could have perturbed uranus enough to account for irregularities tombaugh 1946 p 73 clyde tombaugh s discovery of pluto in 1930 appeared to validate lowell s hypothesis and pluto was officially named ninth planet in 1978 pluto was conclusively determined to be too small for its gravity to affect giant planets resulting in a brief search for a tenth planet search was largely abandoned in early 1990s when a study of measurements made by voyager 2 spacecraft found that irregularities observed in uranus s orbit were due to a slight overestimation of neptune s mass after 1992 discovery of numerous small icy objects with similar or even wider orbits than pluto led to a debate over whether pluto should remain a planet or whether it and its neighbours should like asteroids be given their own separate classification although a number of larger members of this group were initially described as planets in 2006 international astronomical union iau reclassified pluto and its largest neighbours as dwarf planets leaving neptune farthest known planet in solar system while astronomical community widely agrees that planet x as originally envisioned does not exist concept of an as yet unobserved planet has been revived by a number of astronomers to explain other anomalies observed in outer solar system as of march 2014 observations with wise telescope have ruled out possibility of a saturn sized object 95 earth masses out to 10 000 au and a jupiter sized 318 earth masses or larger object out to 26 000 au in 2014 based on similarities of orbits of a group of recently discovered extreme trans neptunian objects astronomers hypothesized existence of a super earth planet 2 to 15 times mass of earth and beyond 200 au with possibly a high inclined orbit at some 1 500 au in 2016 further work showed this unknown distant planet is likely on an inclined eccentric orbit that goes no closer than about 200 au and no farther than about 1 200 au from sun orbit is predicted to be anti aligned to clustered extreme trans neptunian objects because pluto is no longer considered a planet by iau this new hypothetical object has become known as planet nine early speculation thumb right jacques babinet an early proponent of a trans neptunian planet in 1840s french mathematician urbain le verrier used newtonian mechanics to analyse perturbations in orbit of uranus and hypothesised that they were caused by gravitational pull of a yet undiscovered planet le verrier predicted position of this new planet and sent his calculations to german astronomer johann gottfried galle on 23 september 1846 night following his receipt of letter galle and his student heinrich d arrest discovered neptune exactly where le verrier had predicted croswell 1997 p 43 there remained some slight discrepancies in giant planets orbits these were taken to indicate existence of yet another planet orbiting beyond neptune even before neptune s discovery some speculated that one planet alone was not enough to explain discrepancy on 17 november 1834 british amateur astronomer reverend thomas john hussey reported a conversation he had had with french astronomer alexis bouvard to george biddell airy british astronomer royal hussey reported that when he suggested to bouvard that unusual motion of uranus might be due to gravitational influence of an undiscovered planet bouvard replied that idea had occurred to him and that he had corresponded with peter andreas hansen director of seeberg observatory in gotha about subject hansen s opinion was that a single body could not adequately explain motion of uranus and postulated that two planets lay beyond uranus in 1848 jacques babinet raised an objection to le verrier s calculations claiming that neptune s observed mass was smaller and its orbit larger than le verrier had initially predicted he postulated based largely on simple subtraction from le verrier s calculations that another planet of roughly 12 earth masses which he named hyperion must exist beyond neptune le verrier denounced babinet s hypothesis saying there is absolutely nothing by which one could determine position of another planet barring hypotheses in which imagination played too large a part in 1850 james ferguson assistant astronomer at united states naval observatory noted that he had lost a star he had observed which lt matthew maury superintendent of observatory claimed was evidence that it must be a new planet subsequent searches failed to recover planet in a different position and in 1878 chf peters director of hamilton college observatory in new york showed that star had not in fact vanished and that previous results had been due to human error in 1879 camille flammarion noted that comets 1862 iii and 1889 iii had aphelia of 47 and 49 au respectively suggesting that they might mark orbital radius of an unknown planet that had dragged them into an elliptical orbit astronomer george forbes concluded on basis of this evidence that two planets must exist beyond neptune he calculated based on fact that four comets possessed aphelia at around 100 au and a further six with aphelia clustered at around 300 au orbital elements of a pair of hypothetical trans neptunian planets these elements suggestively with those made independently by another astronomer named david peck todd suggesting to many that they might be valid however sceptics argued that orbits of comets involved were still too uncertain to produce meaningful results george forbes is today considered to be first describing planet nine in 1900 and 1901 harvard college observatory director william henry pickering led two searches for trans neptunian planets first was begun by danish astronomer hans emil lau who after studying data on orbit of uranus from 1690 to 1895 concluded that one trans neptunian planet alone could not account for discrepancies in its orbit and postulated position of two planets he believed were responsible second was launched when gabriel dallet suggested that a single trans neptunian planet lying at 47 au could account for motion of uranus pickering agreed to examine plates for any suspected planets in neither case were any found in 1909 thomas jefferson jackson see an astronomer with a reputation as an egocentric contrarian opined that there is certainly one most likely two and possibly three planets beyond neptune tentatively naming first planet oceanus he placed their respective distances at 42 56 and 72 au from sun he gave no indication as to how he determined their existence and no known searches were mounted to locate them in 1911 indian astronomer venkatesh p ketakar suggested existence of two trans neptunian planets which he named brahma and vishnu by reworking patterns observed by pierre simon laplace in planetary satellites of jupiter and applying them to outer planets three inner galilean moons of jupiter io europa and ganymede are locked in a complicated 1 2 4 resonance called a laplace resonance ketakar suggested that uranus neptune and his hypothetical trans neptunian planets were locked in laplace like resonances his calculations predicted a mean distance for brahma of 38 95 au and an orbital period of 242 28 earth years 3 4 resonance with neptune when pluto was discovered 19 years later its mean distance of 39 48 au and orbital period of 248 earth years were close to ketakar s prediction pluto in fact has a 2 3 resonance with neptune ketakar made no predictions for orbital elements other than mean distance and period it is not clear how ketakar arrived at these figures and his second planet vishnu was never located planet x in 1894 with help of william pickering percival lowell a wealthy bostonian founded lowell observatory in flagstaff arizona in 1906 convinced he could resolve conundrum of uranus s orbit he began an extensive project to search for a trans neptunian planet which he named planet x a name previously used by gabriel dallet x in name represents an unknown and is pronounced as letter as opposed to roman numeral for 10 at time planet x would have been ninth planet lowell s hope in tracking down planet x was to establish his scientific credibility which had eluded him due to his widely derided belief that channel like features visible on surface of mars were canals constructed by an intelligent civilization croswell 1997 p 43 lowell s first search focused on ecliptic plane encompassed by zodiac where other planets in solar system lie using a 5 inch photographic camera he manually examined over 200 three hour exposures with a magnifying glass and found no planets at that time pluto was too far above ecliptic to be imaged by survey tombaugh 1946 after revising his predicted possible locations lowell conducted a second search from 1914 to 1916 in 1915 he published his memoir of a trans neptunian planet in which he concluded that planet x had a mass roughly seven times that of earth about half that of neptune and a mean distance from sun of 43 au he assumed planet x would be a large low density object with a high albedo like giant planets as a result it would show a disc with diameter of about one arcsecond and an apparent magnitude of between 12 and 13 bright enough to be spotted littman 1990 p 70 separately in 1908 pickering announced that by analysing irregularities in uranus s orbit he had found evidence for a ninth planet his hypothetical planet which he termed planet o because it came after n i e neptune possessed a mean orbital radius of 51 9 au and an orbital period of 373 5 years plates taken at his observatory in arequipa peru showed no evidence for predicted planet and british astronomer p h cowell showed that irregularities observed in uranus s orbit virtually disappeared once planet s displacement of longitude was taken into account lowell himself despite his close association with pickering dismissed planet o out of hand saying this planet is very properly designated o for it is nothing at all croswell p 50 unbeknownst to pickering four of photographic plates taken in search for planet o by astronomers at mount wilson observatory in 1919 captured images of pluto though this was only recognised years later pickering went on to suggest many other possible trans neptunian planets up to year 1932 which he named p q r s t and u none were ever detected discovery of pluto thumb right upright clyde william tombaugh lowell s sudden death in 1916 temporarily halted search for planet x failing to find planet according to one friend virtually killed him croswell 1997 p 49 lowell s widow constance engaged in a legal battle with observatory over lowell s legacy which halted search for planet x for several years croswell 1997 pp 32 55 in 1925 observatory obtained glass discs for a new wide field telescope to continue search constructed with funds from abbott lawrence lowell percival lowell s three early searches for planet x astronomy magazine may 14 2015 percival s brother in 1929 observatory s director vesto melvin slipher summarily handed job of locating planet to clyde tombaugh a 22 year old kansas farm boy who had only just arrived at lowell observatory after slipher had been impressed by a sample of his astronomical drawings tombaugh s task was to systematically capture sections of night sky in pairs of images each image in a pair was taken two weeks apart he then placed both images of each section in a machine called a blink comparator which by exchanging images quickly created a time lapse illusion of movement of any planetary body to reduce chances that a faster moving and thus closer object be mistaken for new planet tombaugh imaged each region near its opposition point 180 degrees from sun where apparent retrograde motion for objects beyond earth s orbit is at its strongest he also took a third image as a control to eliminate any false results caused by defects in an individual plate tombaugh decided to image entire zodiac rather than focus on those regions suggested by lowell thumb left discovery photographs of pluto by beginning of 1930 tombaugh s search had reached constellation of gemini on 18 february 1930 after searching for nearly a year and examining nearly 2 million stars tombaugh discovered a moving object on photographic plates taken on 23 january and 29 january of that year tombaugh 1946 p 79 a lesser quality photograph taken on january 21 confirmed movement upon confirmation tombaugh walked into slipher s office and declared doctor slipher i have found your planet x object lay just six degrees from one of two locations for planet x lowell had suggested thus it seemed he had at last been vindicated after observatory obtained further confirmatory photographs news of discovery was telegraphed to harvard college observatory on march 13 1930 new object was later on photographs dating back to 19 march 1915 p 563 decision to name object pluto was intended in part to honour percival lowell as his initials made up word s first two letters after discovering pluto tombaugh continued to search ecliptic for other distant objects he found hundreds of variable stars and asteroids as well as two comets but no further planets pluto loses planet x title thumb discovery image of charon to observatory s disappointment and surprise pluto showed no visible disc it appeared as a point no different from a star and at only 15th magnitude was six times dimmer than lowell had predicted which meant it was either very small or very dark because lowell astronomers thought pluto was massive enough to perturb planets they assumed that its albedo could be no less than 0 07 meaning that it reflected only 7 of light that hit it about as dark as asphalt and similar to that of mercury least reflective planet known this would give pluto an estimated mass of no more than 70 that of earth observations also revealed that pluto s orbit was very elliptical far more than that of any other planet almost immediately some astronomers questioned pluto s status as a planet barely a month after its discovery was announced on april 14 1930 in an article in new york times armin o leuschner suggested that pluto s dimness and high orbital eccentricity made it more similar to an asteroid or comet lowell result confirms possible high eccentricity announced by us on april 5 among possibilities are a large asteroid greatly disturbed in its orbit by close approach to a major planet such as jupiter or it may be one of many long period planetary objects yet to be discovered or a bright cometary object in that same article harvard observatory director harlow shapley wrote that pluto was a member of solar system not comparable with known asteroids and comets and perhaps of greater importance to cosmogony than would be another major planet beyond neptune in 1931 using a mathematical formula ernest w brown asserted in agreement with e c bower that presumed irregularities in orbit of uranus could not be due to gravitational effect of a more distant planet and thus that lowell s supposed prediction was purely accidental throughout mid 20th century estimates of pluto s mass were revised downward in 1931 nicholson and mayall calculated its mass based on its supposed effect on giant planets as roughly that of earth a value somewhat in accord with 0 91 earth mass calculated in 1942 by lloyd r wylie at us naval observatory using same assumptions in 1949 gerard kuiper s measurements of pluto s diameter with 200 inch telescope at mount palomar observatory led him to conclusion that it was midway in size between mercury and mars and that its mass was most probably about 0 1 earth mass in 1973 based on similarities in periodicity and amplitude of brightness variation with triton dennis rawlins conjectured pluto s mass must be similar to triton s in retrospect conjecture turns out to have been correct it had been argued by astronomers walter baade and e c bower as early as 1934 however because triton s mass was then believed to be roughly 2 5 of earth moon system more than ten times its actual value rawlins s determination for pluto s mass was similarly incorrect it was nonetheless a meagre enough value for him to conclude pluto was not planet x rawlins also took into account pluto s stellar occultation failure as reported by in 1976 dale cruikshank carl pilcher and david morrison of university of hawaii analysed spectra from pluto s surface and determined that it must contain methane ice which is highly reflective this meant that pluto far from being dark was in fact exceptionally bright and thus was probably no more than earth mass croswell 1997 p 57 mass estimates for pluto year 1 earth nicholson 0 91 earth wylie 1948 0 1 1 10 earth kuiper 1973 0 025 1 40 earth rawlins 01 1 100 earth cruikshank pilcher morrison 002 1 500 earth christy harrington 00218 1 459 earth buie et al pluto s size was finally determined conclusively in 1978 when american astronomer james w christy discovered its moon charon this enabled him together with robert sutton harrington of u s naval observatory to measure mass of pluto charon system directly by observing moon s orbital motion around pluto they determined pluto s mass to be 1 kg roughly one five hundredth that of earth or one sixth that of moon and far too small to account for observed discrepancies in orbits of outer planets lowell s prediction had been a coincidence if there was a planet x it was not pluto croswell 1997 pp 57 58 further searches for planet x after 1978 a number of astronomers kept up search for lowell s planet x convinced that because pluto was no longer a viable candidate an unseen tenth planet must have been perturbing outer planets in 1980s and 1990s robert harrington led a search to determine real cause of apparent irregularities croswell pp 56 71 he calculated that any planet x would be at roughly three times distance of neptune from sun its orbit would be highly eccentric and strongly inclined to ecliptic planet s orbit would be at roughly a 32 degree angle from orbital plane of other known planets this hypothesis was met with a mixed reception noted planet x sceptic brian g marsden of minor planet center pointed out that these discrepancies were a hundredth size of those noticed by le verrier and could easily be due to observational error croswell 1997 pp 62 63 in 1972 joseph brady of lawrence livermore national laboratory studied irregularities in motion of halley s comet brady claimed that they could have been caused by a jupiter sized planet beyond neptune at 59 au that is in a retrograde orbit around sun however both marsden and planet x proponent p kenneth seidelmann attacked hypothesis showing that halley s comet randomly and irregularly ejects jets of material causing changes to its own orbital trajectory and that such a massive object as brady s planet x would have severely affected orbits of known outer planets croswell 1997 p 63 although its mission did not involve a search for planet x iras space observatory made headlines briefly in 1983 due to an unknown object that was at first described as possibly as large as giant planet jupiter and possibly so close to earth that it would be part of this solar system further analysis revealed that of several unidentified objects nine were distant galaxies and tenth was interstellar cirrus none were found to be solar system bodies in 1988 a a jackson and r m killen studied stability of pluto s resonance with neptune by placing test planet x es with various masses and at various distances from pluto pluto and neptune s orbits are in a 3 2 resonance which prevents their collision or even any close approaches regardless of their separation in z axis it was found that hypothetical object s mass had to exceed 5 earth masses to break resonance and parameter space is quite large and a large variety of objects could have existed beyond pluto without disturbing resonance four test orbits of a trans plutonian planet have been integrated forward for four million years in order to determine effects of such a body on stability of neptune pluto 3 2 resonance planets beyond pluto with masses of 0 1 and 1 0 earth masses in orbits at 48 3 and 75 5 au respectively do not disturb 3 2 resonance test planets of 5 earth masses with semi major axes of 52 5 and 62 5 au disrupt four million year libration of pluto s argument of perihelion planet x disproved harrington died in january 1993 without having found planet x croswell 1997 p 66 six months before e myles standish had used data from voyager 2 apos s 1989 flyby of neptune which had revised planet s total mass downward by 0 5 an amount comparable to mass of mars to recalculate its gravitational effect on uranus when neptune s newly determined mass was used in jet propulsion laboratory developmental ephemeris jpl de supposed discrepancies in uranian orbit and with them need for a planet x vanished there are no discrepancies in trajectories of any space probes such as pioneer 10 pioneer 11 voyager 1 and voyager 2 that can be attributed to gravitational pull of a large undiscovered object in outer solar system littman 1990 p 204 today most astronomers agree that planet x as lowell defined it does not exist discovery of further trans neptunian objects after discovery of pluto and charon no more trans neptunian objects tnos were found until albion in 1992 since then thousands of such objects have been discovered most are now recognized as part of kuiper belt a swarm of icy bodies left over from solar system s formation that orbit near ecliptic plane just beyond neptune though none were as large as pluto some of these distant trans neptunian objects such as sedna were initially described in media as new planets in 2005 astronomer mike brown and his team announced discovery of later named after greek goddess of discord and strife a trans neptunian object then thought to be just barely larger than pluto soon afterwards a nasa jet propulsion laboratory press release described object as tenth planet eris was never officially classified as a planet and 2006 definition of planet defined both eris and pluto not as planets but as dwarf planets because they have not cleared their neighbourhoods they do not orbit sun alone but as part of a population of similarly sized objects pluto itself is now recognized as being a member of kuiper belt and largest dwarf planet larger than more massive eris a number of astronomers most notably alan stern head of nasa s new horizons mission to pluto contend that iau s definition is flawed and that pluto and eris and all large trans neptunian objects such as and should be considered planets in their own right however discovery of eris did not rehabilitate planet x theory because it is far too small to have significant effects on outer planets orbits subsequently proposed trans neptunian planets although most astronomers accept that lowell s planet x does not exist a number have revived idea that a large unseen planet could create observable gravitational effects in outer solar system these hypothetical objects are often referred to as planet x although conception of these objects may differ considerably from that proposed by lowell orbits of distant objects thumb right orbit of sedna red set against orbits of jupiter orange saturn yellow uranus green neptune blue and pluto purple alt orbit of sedna lies well beyond these objects and extends many times their distances from sun sedna s orbit when sedna was discovered its extreme orbit raised questions about its origin its perihelion is so distant approximately 75 au that no currently observed mechanism can explain sedna s eccentric distant orbit it is too far from planets to have been affected by gravity of neptune or other giant planets and too bound to sun to be affected by outside forces such as galactic tides hypotheses to explain its orbit include that it was affected by a passing star that it was captured from another planetary system or that it was tugged into its current position by a trans neptunian planet most obvious solution to determining sedna s peculiar orbit would be to locate a number of objects in a similar region whose various orbital configurations would provide an indication as to their history if sedna had been pulled into its orbit by a trans neptunian planet any other objects found in its region would have a similar perihelion to sedna around 80 au excitement of kuiper belt orbits in 2008 tadashi mukai and patryk sofia lykawka suggested a distant mars or earth sized planet currently in a highly eccentric orbit between 100 and and orbital period of 1000 years with an inclination of 20deg to 40deg was responsible for structure of kuiper belt they proposed that perturbations of this planet excited eccentricities and inclinations of trans neptunian objects truncated planetesimal disk at 48 au and detached orbits of objects like sedna from neptune during neptune s migration this planet is posited to have been captured in an outer resonance of neptune and to have evolved into a higher perihelion orbit due to kozai mechanism leaving remaining trans neptunian objects on stable orbits elongated orbits of group of kuiper belt objects in 2012 rodney gomes modelled orbits of 92 kuiper belt objects and found that six of those orbits were far more elongated than model predicted he concluded that simplest explanation was gravitational pull of a distant planetary companion such as a neptune sized object at 1 500 au this neptune sized object would cause perihelia of objects with semi major axes greater than 300 au to oscillate delivering them into planet crossing orbits like those of and or detached orbits like sedna s discovery of and orbital clustering of kuiper belt objects in 2014 astronomers announced discovery of a large object with a sedna like 4 200 year orbit and a perihelion of roughly 80 au which led them to suggest that it offered evidence of a potential trans neptunian planet trujillo and sheppard argued that orbital clustering of arguments of perihelia for and other extremely distant tnos suggests existence of a super earth of between 2 and 15 earth masses beyond 200 au and possibly on an inclined orbit at 1500 au in 2014 astronomers at universidad complutense in madrid suggested that available data actually indicate more than one trans neptunian planet subsequent work further suggests that evidence is robust enough further analysis and planet nine hypothesis thumbnail right prediction of hypothetical planet nine s orbit based on unique clustering on january 20 2016 brown and konstantin batygin published an article corroborating trujillo and sheppard s initial findings proposing a super earth dubbed planet nine based on a statistical clustering of arguments of perihelia noted before near zero and also ascending nodes near of six distant trans neptunian objects they estimated it to be ten times mass of earth about 60 mass of neptune with a semimajor axis of approximately 400 1500 au probability even without gravitational evidence mike brown discoverer of sedna has argued that sedna s 12 000 year orbit means that probability alone suggests that an earth sized object exists beyond neptune sedna s orbit is so eccentric that it spends only a small fraction of its orbital period near sun where it can be easily observed this means that unless its discovery was a freak accident there is probably a substantial population of objects roughly sedna s diameter yet to be observed in its orbital region mike brown noted that sedna is about three quarters size of pluto if there are sixty objects three quarters size of pluto out there then there are probably forty objects size of pluto if there are forty objects size of pluto then there are probably ten that are twice size of pluto there are probably three or four that are three times size of pluto and biggest of these objects is probably size of mars or size of earth however he notes that should such an object be found even though it might approach earth in size it would still be a dwarf planet by current definition because it would not have cleared its neighbourhood sufficiently kuiper cliff additionally speculation of a possible trans neptunian planet has revolved around so called kuiper cliff kuiper belt terminates suddenly at a distance of 48 au from sun and melita have speculated that this sudden drop off may be attributed to presence of an object with a mass between those of mars and earth located beyond 48 au presence of an object with a mass similar to that of mars in a circular orbit at 60 au leads to a trans neptunian object population incompatible with observations for instance it would severely deplete plutino population astronomers have not excluded possibility of an object with a mass similar to that of earth located farther than 100 au with an eccentric and inclined orbit computer simulations by patryk lykawka of kobe university have suggested that an object with a mass between 0 3 and 0 7 earth masses ejected outward by neptune early in solar system s formation and currently in an elongated orbit between 101 and 200 au from sun could explain kuiper cliff and peculiar detached objects such as sedna and although some astronomers such as renu malhotra and david jewitt have cautiously supported these claims others such as alessandro morbidelli have dismissed them as contrived in 2017 malhotra and kat volk argued that an unexpected variance in inclination for kbos farther than cliff at 50 au provided evidence of a possible mars sized planet residing at edge of solar system other proposed planets tyche was a hypothetical gas giant proposed to be located in solar system s oort cloud it was first proposed in 1999 by astrophysicists john matese patrick whitman and daniel whitmire of university of louisiana at lafayette they argued that evidence of tyche s existence could be seen in a supposed bias in points of origin for long period comets in 2013 matese and whitmire re evaluated comet data and noted that tyche if it existed would be detectable in archive of data that was collected by nasa s wide field infrared survey explorer wise telescope in 2014 nasa announced that wise survey had ruled out any object with tyche s characteristics indicating that tyche as hypothesized by matese whitman and whitmire does not exist oligarch theory of planet formation states that there were hundreds of planet sized objects known as oligarchs in early stages of solar system s evolution in 2005 astronomer eugene chiang speculated that although some of these oligarchs became planets we know today most would have been flung outward by gravitational interactions some may have escaped solar system altogether to become free floating planets whereas others would be orbiting in a halo around solar system with orbital periods of millions of years this halo would lie at between 1 000 and 10 000 au from sun or between a third and a thirtieth distance to oort cloud new scientist 23 july 2005 issue far out worlds just waiting to be found in december 2015 astronomers at atacama large millimeter array alma detected a brief series of 350 ghz pulses that they concluded must either be a series of independent sources or a single fast moving source deciding that latter was most likely they calculated based on its speed that were it bound to sun object which they named after a fast moving messenger goddess in norse mythology would be about 12 25 au distant and have a dwarf planet sized diameter of 220 to 880 km however if it were a rogue planet not gravitationally bound to sun and as far away as 4000 au it could be much larger paper was never formally accepted and has been withdrawn until detection is confirmed scientists reactions to notice were largely sceptical mike brown commented that if it is true that alma accidentally discovered a massive outer solar system object in its tiny tiny tiny field of view that would suggest that there are something like 200 000 earth sized planets in outer solar system even better i just realized that this many earth sized planets existing would destabilize entire solar system and we would all die constraints on additional planets as of 2016 following observations severely constrain mass and distance of any possible additional solar system planet an analysis of mid infrared observations with wise telescope have ruled out possibility of a saturn sized object 95 earth masses out to 10 000 au and a jupiter sized or larger object out to 26 000 au wise has continued to take more data since then and nasa has invited public to help search this data for evidence of planets beyond these limits via backyard worlds planet 9 citizen science project using modern data on anomalous precession of perihelia of saturn earth and mars lorenzo iorio concluded that any unknown planet with a mass of 0 7 times that of earth must be farther than 350 400 au one with a mass of 2 times that of earth farther than 496 570 au and finally one with a mass of 15 times that of earth farther than 970 1 111 au moreover iorio stated that modern ephemerides of solar system outer planets has provided even tighter constraints no celestial body with a mass of 15 times that of earth can exist closer than 1 100 1 300 au however work by another group of astronomers using a more comprehensive model of solar system found that iorio s conclusion was only partially correct their analysis of cassini data on saturn s orbital residuals found that observations were inconsistent with a planetary body with orbit and mass similar to those of batygin and brown s planet nine having a true anomaly of 130deg to 110deg or 65deg to 85deg furthermore analysis found that saturn s orbit is slightly better explained if such a body is located at a true anomaly of at this location it would be approximately 630 au from sun see also
