morchella snyderi is a species of fungus in family morchellaceae described as new to science in 2012 it occurs in non burned montane forests of western north america including california idaho montana oregon and washington it produces fruit bodies up to tall with ridged and pitted conical caps and stipes that become pitted in maturity color of morel is yellow to tan when young but cap ridges become brown to black in maturity or when dried taxonomy morchella snyderi was described as new to science in 2012 along with 13 other morels from united states and canada study published in journal mycologia resulted from morel data collection project which aimed to help clarify taxonomy biology and distribution of morel species in north america specific epithet honors leon c snyder who described similar morels in washington state in 1930s according to michael kuo who coauthored species description morel should have been named morchella as it was previously described by snyder in 1938 from collections made in washington however molecular analysis determined that snyder s type collection contained two distinct species rendering validity of taxon dubious m snyderi was also previously identified as phylogenetic species mel 12 i e defined by dna sequence in a 2011 study despite light coloration of young fruit bodies morchella snyderi groups in elata clade named after european black morel m elata along with other black morels such as m angusticeps and m tomentosa morphological characteristics of morels in this clade include pits on cap that are usually elongated vertically in mature fruit bodies and often presence of a sinus a space or indentation where cap attaches to stipe description thumb left stipe becomes pocketed lacunose in maturity in this specimen cap ridges are tan where they were buried in plant litter and black where they were exposed fruit bodies are high conical cap is high and wide at widest point cap surface features pits and ridges formed by intersection of 16 22 primary vertical ridges and frequent shorter secondary vertical ridges with occasional sunken horizontal ridges cap is attached to stipe with a sinus about 2 4 mm deep and 2 4 mm wide ridges are smooth or very finely tomentose covered with densely matted filaments they are initially pale yellowish becoming pale tan then grayish brown in maturity eventually darkening to nearly black when dried they are flattened when young but sometimes become sharpened or eroded in maturity pits are somewhat elongated vertically particularly when mature they are finely tomentose yellowish when young becoming pale tan to pale grayish brown fruit bodies are often found in a transitional stage where upper part of cap has turned dark while lower part remains light whitish to pale brownish stipe is long by wide and is roughly equal in width throughout its length or sometimes slightly thicker near base its surface initially covered with whitish granules becomes more granulated as mushroom ages and typically develops prominent ridges and pits i e becomes lacunose with maturity flesh is whitish measuring 1 2 mm thick in hollow cap it becomes layered and chambered particularly in base of stipe sterile inner surface of cap is whitish and pubescent covered with short soft hair thumb right smooth elliptical spores measure up to 37 um ascospores of m snyderi are elliptical and smooth measuring 25 37 by 15 23 um asci spore bearing cells are eight spored cylindrical and measure 225 300 by 7 5 32 5 um paraphyses are cylindrical septate and measure 100 200 by 7 5 20 um their tips are variably shaped from rounded to club shaped to fuse shaped contents of paraphyses are hyaline translucent to faintly brownish in dilute potassium hydroxide koh hyphae on sterile cap ridges are septate and measure 75 175 by 10 20 um terminal cells are variably shaped similar to paraphyses and have hyaline to brownish contents in koh north american morchella are generally considered choice edibles but edibility of m snyderi was not mentioned in its original description similar species morchella snyderi can be distinguished from similar north american morels by differences in ecological and morphological features m frustrata resembles young specimens of m snyderi but ridges of caps of former species do not darken in maturity and it has smaller ascospores measuring 20 29 by 14 19 um another potential lookalike m brunnea has a browner fruit body color in young specimens and a stipe that is not lacunose habitat distribution and ecology morchella snyderi is suspected of being both saprobic and mycorrhizal at different stages in its life cycle fruit bodies grow singly scattered or in groups on ground under conifers particularly douglas fir pseudotsuga menziesii ponderosa pine p ponderosa and white fir abies concolor fruiting occurs from april to june fungus has been collected in california idaho montana oregon washington new mexico and arizona m snyderi identified as phylogenetic species mel 12 has been shown to colonize non native species bromus tectorum cheatgrass as an endophyte this is hypothesized to be a contributing factor in success of cheatgrass as an invasive species in western north america references external links category morchellaceae category edible fungi category fungi described in 2012 category fungi of north america
