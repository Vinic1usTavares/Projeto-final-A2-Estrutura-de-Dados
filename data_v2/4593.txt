county of oneida v oneida indian nation of new york state 470 u s 226 1985 was a landmark united states supreme court case concerning aboriginal title in united states case sometimes referred to as oneida ii was first indian land claim case won on basis of nonintercourse act 1988 at 145 supreme court held that indian tribes have a common law cause of action for possessory land claims based upon aboriginal title that nonintercourse act did not preempt that cause of action and that cause of action was not barred by a statute of limitations abatement implicit federal ratification or nonjusticiability four dissenting justices would have held for counties on defense of laches a question which majority did not reach but expressed doubts about furthermore court held that due to eleventh amendment federal courts could not exercise ancillary jurisdiction over cross claims by counties against states although only two other justices agreed with entirety of justice powell s majority opinion brennan and marshall agreed with parts i iv and vi oneida s claims against counties and burger white and rehnquist agreed with part v counties claims against state thus forging separate majorities case is often referred to as oneida ii because it is second of three times oneida indian nation reached supreme court in litigating its land rights claims it followed oneida indian nation of new york v county of oneida oneida i 1974 holding that there was federal subject matter jurisdiction and was followed by city of sherrill v oneida indian nation of new york 2005 rejecting tribe s attempt in a later lawsuit to re assert tribal sovereignty over parcels of land re acquired by tribe in fee simple background this was second time supreme court had granted certiorari to oneida s land claim over a decade earlier in oneida indian nation of new york v county of oneida 1974 supreme court had allowed same suit to proceed by unanimously holding that there was federal subject matter jurisdiction to hear claim oneida indian nation of new york v county of oneida oneida i 414 u s 661 1974 since then justices william o douglas and potter stewart had departed replaced by john paul stevens and sandra day o connor on remand united states district court for northern district of new york had found counties liable to oneida for wrongful possession of their lands awarded damages of 16 694 plus interest representing fair rental value of land in question for 2 year period specified in complaint finally district court required new york state to indemnify counties united states court of appeals for second circuit affirmed 719 f 2d 525 2d cir 1983 supreme court granted certiorari to determine whether an indian tribe may have a live cause of action for a violation of its possessory rights that occurred 175 years ago ultimately agreeing with district court and second circuit that tribe may 470 u s at 230 on appeal counties did not dispute district court s findings that oneida held aboriginal title to lands in question and that 1795 conveyances of lands to state violated nonintercourse act 470 u s at 232 33 counties instead argued that nonintercourse act preempted oneida s cause of action that any cause of action was time barred and abated and that any conveyance was ratified by federal government 470 u s at 233 change of counsel case was initiated by george shattuck of bond king bs k on a contingency fee basis rather than as a pro bono matter 1991 at 6 retainer agreement between firm and tribe approved as required by department of interior provided that firm would litigate tribe s nonintercourse act claim only against government and would not sue private land owners another firm was handling tribe s claim before indian claims commission 1991 at 9 11 26 39 41 73 94 202 shattuck argued oneida i alone before supreme court 1991 at 34 native american rights fund narf which had assisted initially assisted firm 1991 at ix 29 31 33 37 59 61

possessory claims against landowners over additional lands 1991 at 75 79 as of march 2011 bs k had yet to receive any attorney s fees from tribe glen coin syracuse law firm wants more money for work it did early on in oneida land claim case march 11 2011 on july 11 2011 united states district court for northern district of new york ruled that bs k was entitled to 5 174 54 in fees district court reduced fees to that number after finding that bs k had breached its duty of loyalty to oneida s by also representing canadian claimants oneida indian nation v cnty of oneida nos 5 70 cv 0035 lek 5 74 cv 187 lek drh 2011 wl n d n y july 12 2011 opinion of court majority opinion by justice lewis f powell jr recognized oneida s federal common law cause of action and rejected all counties affirmative defenses cause of action second circuit held that oneida s had both a federal common law cause of action and an implied cause of action under nonintercourse act of 1793 version that governed 1795 transaction supreme court did not reach statutory question because it held that indians common law right to sue is firmly established court recognized that n decisions of this court prior to oneida i recognized at least implicitly that indians have a federal common law right to sue to enforce their aboriginal land rights citing a string of examples back to johnson v m intosh 1823 470 u s at 235 court concluded w e hold that oneidas can maintain this action for violation of their possessory rights based on federal common law 470 u s at 236 as to nonintercourse act court held that it did not preempt cause of action because t he nonintercourse act of 1793 does not speak directly to question of remedies for unlawful conveyances of indian land 470 u s at 237 court noted that act did not establish a comprehensive remedial plan for dealing with violations of indian property rights and that there was no indication in legislative history that congress intended to pre empt common law remedies because act contained no remedial provisions and because subsequent congressional enactments contemplated possessory land suits by indians court found that preemption was not indicated 470 u s at 237 39 court reviewed its recent aboriginal title decisions and reiterated its statement in oneida i that act merely put in statutory form what was or came to be accepted rule 470 u s at 240 quoting oneida i 414 u s at 678 statute of limitations thumb right justice lewis f powell jr sustained oneida s federal common law cause of action and rejected all of counties affirmative defenses where there is no statute of limitations for a federal cause of action general rule is to borrow analogous state statute of limitations unless such would be inconsistent with underlying federal policies 470 u s at 240 however here court held that borrowing of a state limitations period in these cases would be inconsistent with federal policy 470 u s at 241 reviewing congressional actions in context of indian claims commission court concluded that it would be a violation of congress will were we to hold that a state statute of limitations period should be borrowed in these circumstances 470 u s at 244 laches majority noted that four dissenting justices would have barred oneida s claim under laches however majority noted that we do not reach this issue today because district court had ruled against counties laches defense and counties had not raised issue in second circuit in a footnote majority opined that application of equitable defense of laches in an action at law would be novel indeed 470 u s at 245 n 16 same footnote cited ewert v bluejacket 259 u s 129 1922 for proposition that laches cannot properly have application to give vitality to a void deed and to bar rights of indian wards in lands subject to statutory restrictions majority called application of laches questionable and noted that such would appear to be inconsistent with established federal policy in its final footnote majority noted that on t he question whether equitable considerations should limit relief available to present day oneida indians we express no opinion as to final disposition of this case should congress not exercise its authority to resolve these far reaching indian claims 470 u s at 254 n 27 abatement counties advanced theory that causes of action under nonintercourse acts of 1790 1793 1796 1799 and 1802 unlike final 1833 version abated upon expiration of statutes however court held that because different versions of act contained substantially same restraint on alienation of indian lands precedents of this court compel conclusion that oneidas cause of action has not abated 470 u s at 246 ratification counties advanced theory that later treaties between oneidas and united states which ceded different lands to new york constituted a ratification of earlier conveyances and thus those conveyances were in compliance with nonintercourse act court found this interpretation untenable under canons of construction of federal indian law which provide that inter alia treaties should be construed liberally in favor of indians 470 u s at 247 nonjusticiability counties final argument was that oneida s land claim was a political question court found this argument to be non meritorious in light of similar indian law precedents 470 u s at 248 50 ancillary jurisdiction final question before court was whether district court rightly exercised ancillary jurisdiction over counties cross claim against state for indemnification court rejected as having no basis in law second circuit s theory that by violating a federal statute state consented to suit in federal court by any party on any claim state or federal growing out of same nucleus of operative facts as statutory violation 470 u s at 251 although counties cross claim would meet traditional criteria for ancillary jurisdiction court found those criteria foreclosed by eleventh amendment conclusion court concluded by remarking upon potential consequences of affirmance arguing that this litigation makes abundantly clear necessity for congressional action to extinguish indian title by statute 470 u s at 253 in words of court one would have thought that claims dating back for more than a century and a half would have been barred long ago as our opinion indicates however neither petitioners nor we have found any applicable statute of limitations or other relevant legal basis for holding that oneidas claims are barred or otherwise have been satisfied brennan and marshall justices william j brennan jr and thurgood marshall joined entirety of majority s opinion except ancillary jurisdiction portion in a brief opinion brennan reiterated his view from yeomans v kentucky 1975 that eleventh amendment bars federal court suits against states only by citizens of other states 470 u s at 254 brennan j joined by marshall j concurring stevens burger white and rehnquist thumb right justice john paul stevens would have barred oneida s claim under equitable doctrine of laches justice john paul stevens joined by chief justice warren e burger and justices byron white and william rehnquist joined majority s opinion as to no 83 1240 cross claims against state but dissented as to no 83 1065 oneida s claims against counties 470 u s at 255 stevens j joined by burger c j white j and rehnquist j dissenting dissenters would have barred oneida s claim under equitable doctrine of laches noting in 1795 oneidas made no attempt to assert claim and their successors in interest waited 175 years before bringing suit to avoid a 1795 conveyance that tribe freely made for a valuable consideration absence of any evidence of deception concealment or interference with tribe s right to assert a claim together with societal interests that always underlie statutes of repose particularly when title to real property is at stake convince me that this claim is barred by extraordinary passage of time it is worthy of emphasis that this claim arose when george washington was president of united states 470 u s at 255 56 dissenters noted various historical examples of court applying laches to indian equitable claims and argued that doctrine should also be applied to action of ejectment which they admitted was an action at law not equity 470 u s at 256 specifically they cited t decisions of this court illustrate application of doctrine of laches to actions seeking to set aside conveyances made in violation of federal law 470 u s at 263 moreover dissenters quoted lewis v marshall 30 u s 470 1831 for proposition that best interests of society require that causes of action should not be deferred an unreasonable time this remark is peculiarly applicable to land titles nothing so much retards growth and prosperity of a country as insecurity of titles to real estate labor is paralysed where enjoyment of its fruits is uncertain and litigation without limit produces ruinous consequences to individuals dissent concluded court no doubt believes that it is undoing a grave historical injustice but in doing so it has caused another which only congress may now rectify 470 u s at 273 dissent did not address other defenses raised by counties subsequent developments remand on remand after decades of settlement efforts judge mccurn entered judgments of 15 994

validly extinguished and thus did not disturb its holding in oneida ii city of sherrill v oneida indian nation of n y 544 u s 197 2005 on remand district court held that although counties could tax
