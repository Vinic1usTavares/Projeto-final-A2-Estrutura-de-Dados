weymouth ended their holiday by purchasing an apartment above compass point studios in nassau bahamas where talking heads had recorded their second album more songs about buildings and food byrne joined duo and harrison there in early 1980 bowman p 167 band members realised that it had been solely up to byrne to craft songs even though they were performed as a quartet they had tired of notion of a singer leading a backup band ideal they aimed for according to byrne was sacrificing our egos for mutual cooperation pareles p 38 byrne additionally wanted to escape psychological paranoia and personal torment he had been writing and feeling in new york instead of band writing music to byrne s lyrics talking heads performed instrumental jams using fear of music song i as a starting point eno arrived in bahamas three weeks after byrne he was reluctant to work with band again after collaborating on previous two albums he changed his mind after being excited by instrumental demo tapes band and eno experimented with communal african way of making music in which individual parts mesh as polyrhythms afrodisiac 1973 afrobeat record by nigerian musician fela kuti became template for

microphone is standing in front of an abstract painting containing blotches of orange and lime green and corrugated lines eno here photographed in 2007 produced remain in light using stylised methods and sonic experiments recording sessions started at compass point studios in july 1980 album s creation required use of additional musicians particularly percussionists talking heads used working title melody attack throughout studio process after watching a japanese game show of same name bowman p 169 harrison said ambition was to blend rock and african genres rather than simply imitate african music eno s production techniques and personal approach were key to record s conception process was geared to promote expression of instinct and spontaneity without overtly focusing on sound of final product eno compared creative process to looking out to world and saying what a fantastic place we live in let s celebrate it sections and instrumentals were recorded one at a time in a discontinuous process loops played a key part at a time when computers could not yet adequately perform such functions talking heads developed remain in light by recording jams isolating best parts and learning to play them repetitively basic tracks focused wholly on rhythms and were all performed in a minimalist method using only one chord each section was recorded as a long loop to enable creation of compositions through positioning or merging of loops in different ways byrne likened process to modern sampling we were human samplers after a few sessions in bahamas engineer rhett davies left following an argument with producer over fast speed of recording steven stanley who since age of 17 had engineered for musicians such as bob marley stepped in to cover workload bowman p 168 he is credited by frantz with helping create once in a lifetime which was released as a single a lexicon 224 digital reverb effects unit obtained by engineer and mixer dave jerden was used on album machine was one of first of its kind and able to simulate environments such as echo chambers and rooms through interchangeable programs like davies jerden was unhappy with fast pace at which eno wanted to record sonically complicated compositions but did not complain tracks made byrne rethink his vocal style and he tried singing to instrumental songs but sounded stilted few vocal sections were recorded in bahamas writing process for lyrics occurred when band returned to us and was split between new york city and california bowman p 374 harrison booked talking heads into sigma sound which focused primarily on r b music after convincing owners that band s work could bring them a new type of clientele in new york city byrne struggled with writer s block harrison and eno spent their time tweaking compositions recorded in bahamas while frantz and weymouth often did not show up at studio doubts began to surface about whether album would be completed recording sessions only built up pace after recruitment of guitarist adrian belew at request of byrne harrison and eno he was advised to add guitar solos to compass point tracks making use of a roland guitar synthesiser bowman p 170 byrne recorded all tracks as they were after belew had performed on them to a cassette and looked to africa to break his writer s block he realised that when african musicians forget words they often improvise and make new ones up he used a portable tape recorder and tried to create onomatopoeic rhymes in style of eno who believed that lyrics were never center of a song s meaning byrne continuously listened to his recorded scatting until convinced that he was no longer hearing nonsense bowman p 171 after he was satisfied harrison invited nona hendryx to sigma sound to record backing vocals for album she was advised extensively on her vocal delivery by byrne frantz and weymouth and often sang in a trio with byrne and eno bowman p 175 voice sessions were followed by overdubbing process brass player jon hassell who had been working on parts of my life in bush of ghosts was hired to perform trumpet and horn sections in august 1980 half of album was mixed by eno and engineer john potoker in new york city with assistance of harrison while other half was mixed by byrne and jerden at eldorado studios in los angeles bowman p 179 music and lyrics alt casual portrait of john dean sitting in his office with his feet on desk thumb upright testimony of watergate scandal conspirator john dean was one of several inspirations for lyrics on remain in light remain in light features new wave post punk worldbeat dance rock and different types of funk specifically afrofunk and avant funk critic stephen thomas erlewine described album as a dense amalgam of african percussion funk bass and keyboards pop songs and electronics it contains eight songs that possess a striking free associative feel according to psychoanalyst michael a brog in that there is no long lasting coherent thought process that can be followed in stream of consciousness lyrics david gans instructed byrne to be freer with his lyrical content by advising him that rational thinking has its limits brog p 166 frontman included a bibliography with album press kit along with a statement that explained how album was inspired by african mythologies and rhythms release stressed that major inspiration to lyrics was professor john miller chernoff s african rhythm and african sensibility bowman p 182 which examined musical enhancement of life in continent s rural communities academic travelled to ghana in 1970 to study native percussion and wrote about how africans have complicated conversations through drum patterns bowman p 173 one of songs great curve exemplifies african theme by including line world moves on a woman s hips which byrne used after reading professor robert farris thompson s book african art in motion he also studied straight speech from john dean s watergate testimony to stories of african american former slaves like all other tracks album opener born under punches heat goes on borrows from preaching shouting and ranting expression and heat goes on used in title and repeated in chorus is based on a new york post headline eno read in summer of 1980 whilst byrne rewrote song title don t worry about government from talking heads debut album talking heads 77 into lyric look at hands of a government man rhythmical rant in crosseyed and painless facts are simple and facts are straight facts are lazy and facts are late is influenced by old school rap specifically kurtis blow s breaks given to byrne by frantz once in a lifetime borrows heavily from preachers diatribes bowman p 172 some critics have suggested that song is a kind of prescient jab at excesses of 1980s byrne disagreed with categorisation and commented that its lyrics are meant to be taken literally he stated we re largely unconscious you know we operate half awake or on autopilot and end up whatever with a house and family and job and everything else and we haven t really stopped to ask ourselves how did i get here byrne has described album s final mix as a spiritual piece of work joyous and ecstatic and yet it s serious he has pointed out that in end there was less africanism in remain in light that we implied but african ideas were far more important to get across than specific rhythms pareles p 39 according to eno record uniquely blends funk and punk rock or new wave music none of compositions include chord changes and instead rely on use of different harmonics and notes spidery riffs and layered tracks of bass and percussion are used extensively throughout album first side contains more rhythmic songs born under punches heat goes on crosseyed and painless and great curve which include long instrumental interludes great curve contains extended synthesiser treated guitar solos from belew second side features more introspective songs once in a lifetime pays homage to early rap techniques and music of art rock band velvet underground track was originally called weird guitar riff song because of its composition it was conceived as a single riff before band added a second boosted riff over top of first eno alternated eight bars of each riff with corresponding bars of its counterpart houses in motion incorporates lengthy brass performances from jon hassell while listening wind features arabic music elements final track on album overload was talking heads attempt to emulate sound of british post punk band joy division song was made despite no band member having heard music of joy division rather it was based on an idea of what british quartet might sound like based on descriptions in music press track features tribal cum industrial beats created primarily by harrison and byrne packaging and title thumb upright alt black and white aerial shot of four planes with white stars on each wing and body flying in formation adjacent to each other over clouds grumman avengers used by us navy in which weymouth s father had served inspired initial cover art later used on back of lp sleeve after album name change cover art was conceived by weymouth and frantz with help of massachusetts institute of technology researcher walter bender and his team precursor to mit media lab using melody attack as inspiration couple created a collage of red warplanes flying in formation over himalayas planes are an artistic depiction of grumman avenger planes in honour of weymouth s father ralph weymouth who was a us navy admiral idea for back cover included simple portraits of band members weymouth attended mit regularly during summer of 1980 and worked with bender s colleague scott fisher on computer renditions of ideas process was tortuous because computer power was limited in early 1980s and mainframe alone took up several rooms bowman p 176 weymouth and fisher shared a passion for masks and used concept to experiment with portraits faces except for eyes noses and mouths were blotted out with blocks of red colour weymouth considered superimposing eno s face on top of all four portraits to insinuate his egotism producer wanted to be on cover art together with talking heads but decided against it in end bowman p 177 rest of artwork and liner notes were crafted by graphic designer tibor kalman and his company m co kalman was a fervent critic of formalism and professional design in art and advertisements bowman p 174 he offered his services for free to create publicity and discussed using unconventional materials such as sandpaper and velour for lp sleeve weymouth who was skeptical of hiring a designing firm vetoed kalman s ideas and held firm on mit computerised images designing process made band members realise that title melody attack was too flippant for music recorded and they adopted remain in light instead byrne has noted besides not being all that melodic music had something to say that at time seemed new transcendent and maybe even revolutionary at least for funk rock songs image of warplanes was relegated to back of sleeve and doctored portraits became front cover kalman later suggested that planes were not removed altogether because they seemed appropriate during iranian hostage crisis of 1979 81 weymouth advised kalman that she wanted simple typography in a bold sans serif font m co followed instructions and came up with idea of inverting a s in talking heads weymouth and frantz decided to use joint credit acronym c t for artwork while bender and fisher used initials and code names because project was not an official mit venture bowman p 178 design credits read hcl ddd walter gp paul c t final mass produced version of remain in light boasted one of first computer designed record jackets psychoanalyst michael a brog has called its front cover a disarming image which suggests both splitting and obliteration of identity and which introduces listener to album s recurring theme of identity disturbance he states image is in bleak contrast to title with obscured images of band members unable to remain in light brog p 167 talking heads and eno originally agreed to credit all songs in alphabetical order to david byrne brian eno chris frantz jerry harrison and tina weymouth after failing to devise an accurate formula for split but album was released with label credit all songs written by david byrne brian eno except houses in motion and overload written by david byrne brian eno jerry harrison frantz harrison and weymouth disputed credits especially for a process they had partly funded according to weymouth byrne told kalman to doctor credits on eno s advice bowman p 183 later editions credit all band members frantz said we felt very burnt by credits dispute promotion and release thumb alt a guitarist a drummer and a keyboardist are performing a song live in concert talking heads hired five additional musicians for

voice described record as one in which david byrne conquers his fear of music in a visionary afrofunk synthesis clear eyed detached almost mystically optimistic michael kulp of daily collegian
