yetzer hara and regard him as a literal agent of god orthodox judaism on other hand outwardly embraces talmudic teachings on satan and involves satan in religious life far more inclusively than other sects satan is mentioned explicitly in some daily prayers including during and certain post meal benedictions as described in talmud and jewish code of law in reform judaism satan is generally seen in his talmudic role as a metaphor for yetzer hara and symbolic representation of innate human qualities such as selfishness christianity names most common english synonym for satan is devil which descends from middle english from old english that in turn represents an early germanic borrowing of latin diabolus also source of diabolical this in turn was borrowed from greek diabolos slanderer from to slander dia across through to hurl in new testament words satan and diabolos are used interchangeably as synonyms beelzebub meaning lord of flies is contemptuous name given in hebrew bible and

mountain as well there he shows him kingdoms of earth and promises to give them all to him if he will bow down and worship him each time jesus rebukes satan and after third temptation he is administered by angels satan s promise in and to give jesus all kingdoms of earth implies that all those kingdoms belong to him fact that jesus does not dispute satan s promise indicates that authors of those gospels believed this to be true satan plays a role in some of parables of jesus namely parable of sower parable of weeds parable of sheep and goats and parable of strong man according to parable of sower satan profoundly influences those who fail to understand gospel latter two parables say that satan s followers will be punished on judgement day with parable of sheep and goats stating that devil his angels and people who follow him will be consigned to eternal fire when pharisees accused jesus of exorcising demons through power of beelzebub jesus responds by telling parable of strong man saying how can someone enter a strong man s house and plunder his goods unless he first binds strong man then indeed he may plunder his house strong man in this parable represents satan synoptic gospels identify satan and his demons as causes of illness including fever leprosy and arthritis while epistle to hebrews describes devil as him who holds power of death author of luke acts attributes more power to satan than both matthew and mark in jesus grants satan authority to test peter and other apostles states that judas iscariot betrayed jesus because satan entered him and in

this cosmos who is destined to be overthrown through jesus s death and resurrection promises that holy spirit will accuse world concerning sin justice and judgement a role resembling that of satan in old testament refers to a dispute between michael archangel and devil over body of moses some interpreters understand this reference to be an allusion to events described in classical theologian origen attributes this reference to non canonical assumption of moses according to james h charlesworth there is no evidence surviving book of this name ever contained any such content james charlesworth old testament pseudepigrapha p 76 google books link others believe it to be in lost ending of book assumption of moses a critical edition with commentary by johannes tromp p 270 second chapter of second epistle of peter a letter which falsely claims to have been written by peter copies much of content of epistle of jude but omits specifics of example regarding michael and satan with

revelation thumb right upright 1 2 st michael vanquishing satan 1518 by raphael depicting satan being cast out of heaven by michael archangel as described in book of revelation represents satan as supernatural ruler of roman empire and ultimate cause of all evil in world in as part of letter to church at smyrna john of patmos refers to jews of smyrna as a synagogue of satan and warns that devil is about to cast some of you into prison as a test and for ten days you will have affliction in in letter to church of pergamum john warns that satan lives among members of congregation and declares that satan s throne is in their midst pergamum was capital of roman province of asia and satan s throne may be referring to monumental pergamon altar in city which was dedicated to greek god zeus or to a temple dedicated to roman emperor augustus describes a vision of a great red dragon with seven heads ten horns seven crowns and a massive tail an image which is clearly inspired by vision of four beasts from sea in book of daniel and leviathan described in various old testament passages great red dragon knocks a third of sun a third of moon and a third of stars out sky and pursues woman of apocalypse declares and war broke out in heaven michael and his angels fought against dragon dragon and his angels fought back but they were defeated and there was no longer any place for them in heaven dragon great was thrown down that ancient serpent who is called devil and satan one deceiving whole inhabited world he was thrown down to earth and his angels were thrown down with him then a voice booms down from heaven heralding defeat of accuser ho identifying satan of revelation with satan of old testament in satan is bound with a chain and hurled into abyss where he is imprisoned for one thousand years in he is set free and gathers his armies along with gog and magog to wage war against righteous but is defeated with fire from heaven and cast into lake of fire some christians associate satan with number 666 which describes as number of beast however beast mentioned in revelation 13 is not satan and use of 666 in book of revelation has been interpreted as a reference to roman emperor nero as 666 is numeric value of his name in hebrew patristic era despite fact that book of genesis never mentions satan christians have traditionally interpreted serpent in garden of eden as satan due to which calls satan that ancient serpent this verse however is probably intended to identify satan with leviathan a monstrous sea serpent whose destruction by yahweh is prophesied in first recorded individual to identify satan with serpent from garden of eden was second century ad christian apologist justin martyr in chapters 45 and 79 of his dialogue with other early church fathers to mention this identification include theophilus and tertullian early christian church however encountered opposition from pagans such as celsus who claimed in his treatise true word that it is blasphemy to say that greatest god has an adversary who constrains his capacity to do good and said that christians impiously divide kingdom of god creating a rebellion in it as if there were opposing factions within divine including one that is hostile to god thumb left lucifer 1890 by franz stuck because of patristic interpretations of and jerome s latin vulgate translation name lucifer

was vanquished by god of sun name is used in in metaphorical reference to king of babylon uses a description of a cherub in eden as a polemic against ii king of tyre church father origen of alexandria 184 253 who was only aware of actual text of these passages and not original myths to which they refer concluded in his treatise on first principles which is preserved in a latin translation by rufinus that neither of these verses could literally refer to a human being and must therefore be alluding to a certain angel who had received office of governing nation of but was hurled down to earth after he was found to be corrupt origen on first principles book i chapter 5 paragraphs 4 5 in his apologetic treatise contra however origen changed his interpretations of isaiah 14 12 and ezekiel 28 12 15 now interpreting both of them as referring to satan according to henry ansgar kelly origen seems to have adopted this new interpretation to refute unnamed persons who perhaps under influence of zoroastrian radical dualism believed that satan s original nature was darkness later church father jerome 347 420 translator of latin vulgate accepted origen s theory of satan as a fallen angel and wrote about it in his commentary on book of isaiah in christian tradition ever since both isaiah 14 12 and ezekiel 28 12 15 have been understood as allegorically referring to satan for most christians satan has been regarded as an angel who rebelled against god according to ransom theory of atonement which was popular among early christian theologians satan gained power over humanity through adam and eve s sin and christ s death on cross was a ransom to satan in exchange for humanity s liberation this theory holds that satan was tricked by god because christ was not only free of sin but also incarnate deity whom satan lacked ability to enslave irenaeus of lyons described a prototypical form of ransom theory but origen was first to propose it in its fully developed form theory was later expanded by theologians such as gregory of nyssa and rufinus of aquileia in eleventh century anselm of canterbury criticized ransom theory along with associated christus victor theory resulting in theory s decline in western europe theory has nonetheless retained some of its popularity in eastern orthodox church most early christians firmly believed that satan and his demons had power to possess humans and exorcisms were widely practiced by jews christians and pagans alike belief in demonic possession continued through middle ages into early modern period exorcisms were seen as a display of god s power over satan vast majority of people who thought they were possessed by devil did not suffer from hallucinations or other spectacular symptoms but complained of anxiety religious fears and evil thoughts middle ages satan had minimal role in medieval christian theology but he frequently appeared as a recurring comedic stock character in late medieval mystery plays in which he was portrayed as a comic relief figure who fell and farted in background jeffrey burton russell describes medieval conception of satan as more pathetic and repulsive than terrifying and he was seen as little more than a nuisance to god s overarching plan golden legend a collection of saints lives compiled in around 1260 by dominican friar jacobus da contains numerous stories about encounters between saints and satan in which satan is constantly duped by saints cleverness and by power of god henry ansgar kelly remarks that satan comes across as opposite of fearsome golden legend was most popular book during high and late middle ages and more manuscripts of it have survived from period than for any other book including even bible itself canon episcopi written in eleventh century ad condemns belief in witchcraft as heretical but also documents that many people at time apparently believed in it witches were believed to fly through air on consort with demons perform in lurid sexual rituals in forests murder human infants and eat them as part of satanic rites and engage in conjugal relations with demons in 1326 pope john xxii issued papal bull super illius specula which condemned folk divination practices as consultation with satan by 1430s catholic church began to regard witchcraft as part of a vast conspiracy led by satan himself early modern period during early modern period christians gradually began to regard satan as increasingly powerful and fear of satan s power became a dominant aspect of worldview of christians across europe during protestant reformation martin luther taught that rather than trying to argue with satan christians should avoid temptation altogether by seeking out pleasant company luther especially recommended music as a safeguard against temptation since devil cannot endure gaiety john calvin repeated a maxim from saint augustine that man is like a horse with either god or devil as rider in late fifteenth century a series of witchcraft panics erupted in france and germany german inquisitors heinrich kramer and jacob argued in their book malleus maleficarum published in 1487 that all sorcery was rooted in work of satan in mid sixteenth century panic spread to england and switzerland both protestants and catholics alike firmly believed in witchcraft as a real phenomenon and supported its prosecution in late 1500s dutch demonologist johann weyer argued in his treatise de daemonum that witchcraft did not exist but that satan promoted belief in it to lead christians astray panic over witchcraft intensified in 1620s and continued until end of 1600s brian levack estimates that around 60 000 people were executed for witchcraft during entire span of witchcraft hysteria early english settlers of north america especially puritans of new england believed that satan visibly and palpably reigned in new world john winthrop claimed that devil made rebellious puritan women give birth to stillborn monsters with claws sharp horns and on each foot three claws like a young fowl cotton mather wrote that devils swarmed around puritan settlements like frogs of egypt puritans believed that native americans were worshippers of satan and described them as children of devil some settlers claimed to have seen satan himself appear in flesh at native ceremonies during first great awakening new light preachers portrayed their old light critics as ministers of satan by time of second great awakening satan s primary role in american evangelicalism was as opponent of evangelical movement itself who spent most of his time trying to hinder ministries of evangelical preachers a role he has largely retained among present day american fundamentalists by early 1600s skeptics in europe including english author reginald scot and anglican bishop john bancroft had begun to criticize belief that demons still had power to possess people this skepticism was bolstered by belief that miracles only occurred during apostolic age which had long since ended later enlightenment thinkers such as david hume denis diderot and voltaire attacked notion of satan s existence altogether voltaire labelled john milton s paradise lost a disgusting fantasy and declared that belief in hell and satan were among many lies propagated by catholic church to keep humanity enslaved by eighteenth century trials for witchcraft had ceased in most western countries with notable exceptions of poland and hungary where they continued belief in power of satan however remained strong among traditional christians modern era thumb right genius of evil 1848 by guillaume mormonism developed its own views on satan according to book of moses devil offered to be redeemer of mankind for sake of his own glory conversely jesus offered to be redeemer of mankind so that his father s will would be done after his offer was rejected satan became rebellious and was subsequently cast out of heaven in book of moses cain is said to have loved satan more than god and conspired with satan to kill abel it was through this pact that cain became a master mahan book of moses also says that moses was tempted by satan before calling upon name of only begotten which caused satan to depart douglas davies asserts that this text reflects temptation of jesus in bible belief in satan and demonic possession remains strong among christians in united states and latin america according to a 2013 poll conducted by yougov fifty seven percent of people in united states believe in a literal devil compared to eighteen percent of people in britain fifty one percent of americans believe that satan has power to possess people w scott poole author of satan in america devil we know has opined that in united states over last forty to fifty years a composite image of satan has emerged that borrows from both popular culture and theological sources and that most american christians do not separate what they know about satan from movies from what they know from various ecclesiastical and theological traditions catholic church generally played down satan and exorcism during late twentieth and early twenty first centuries but pope francis brought renewed focus on devil in early 2010s stating among many other pronouncements that devil is intelligent he knows more theology than all theologians together according to encyclopaedia britannica liberal christianity tends to view satan as a figurative mythological attempt to express reality and extent of evil in universe existing outside and apart from humanity but profoundly influencing human sphere bernard mcginn describes multiple traditions detailing relationship between antichrist and satan in dualist approach satan will become incarnate in antichrist just as god became incarnate in jesus however in orthodox christian thought this view is problematic because it is too similar to christ s incarnation instead indwelling view has become more accepted which stipulates that antichrist is a human figure inhabited by satan since latter s power is not to be seen as equivalent to god s islam arabic equivalent of word satan is shaitan from root word itself is
