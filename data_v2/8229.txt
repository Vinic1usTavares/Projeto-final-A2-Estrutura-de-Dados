its roots in a chance encounter with past collaborator bibi andersson in a stockholm street andersson who was with liv ullmann introduced ullmann to him ullmann placed meeting in 1964 and said that bergman recognized her and asked her on spot if she would like to work with him he said that an image of two women formed in his mind in hospital he found an uncanny resemblance between actresses in photographs of them sunbathing this inspired beginning of his story a vision of two women wearing big hats and laying their hands alongside each other andersson said liv and i had worked together before and we were very close bergman had been in a romantic relationship with andersson and was attracted to ullmann of personas conception andersson said he saw our friendship and he wanted to get inside of it involved bergman wrote persona in nine weeks while recovering from pneumonia and much of his work was done in sophiahemmet hospital with this project he abandoned his practice of writing

shared his vision of women comparing hands fant assumed that film would be inexpensive and agreed to fund it in his book images bergman wrote today i feel that in persona and later in cries and whispers i had gone as far as i could go and that in these two instances when working in total freedom i touched wordless secrets that only cinema can discover he also said at some time or other i said that persona saved my life that is no exaggeration if i had not found strength to make that film i would probably have been all washed up one significant point for first time i did not care in least whether result would be a commercial success although filmmakers considered titles sonat for tva sonata for two women ett kinematografi a piece of cinematography opus 27 and kinematografi fant

ullmann in cannibals a large project he abandoned after becoming ill but he still hoped to pair them in a project ullmann said that she began to be cast in bergman s films beginning with mute character elisabet it was because my face could say what he wanted to say that made me one he wanted to work with because it was my face and i also understood what he was writing steve vineberg wrote that with conception of project with andersson and ullmann bergman parted with his past uses of ensemble casts in films such as smiles of a summer night and focused on two leads vineberg called roles

children in other films bergman was uncredited narrator filming principal photography took place on island of faro including with its in background and bergman s property at hammars and at rasunda studios in stockholm shooting began on 19 july 1965 and wrapped by 15 september ullmann described initial stockholm shoot as marred by awkward performances and unprepared direction crew opted to retreat to faro where bergman found a house to shoot in faro s weather was ideal during shooting crew redid much of footage filmed in stockholm recreating summer house on stockholm set and using a faro museum as hospital andersson said that she and ullmann agreed to play their parts as different sides of same personality and they assumed that personality was bergman s actress said that they tried to balance each other in their performances bergman told his actresses not to ask him what each scene meant ullmann believed that cinematographer sven nykvist was also not informed of director s intentions and left to work intuitively although scene where alma describes her orgy was in screenplay andersson said in 1977 that bergman had been advised to remove it from film she insisted that it be shot volunteering to alter dialogue she felt was too obviously written by a man scene took two hours to shoot using close ups of ullmann and andersson in single takes andersson later said that while she thought some of her performances in films such as wild strawberries were corny she was proud of her work in persona ullmann described her response shots as an unprepared natural reaction to story s erotic nature for scene in which andersson and ullmann meet in bedroom at night and their faces overlap a large amount of smoke was used in studio to make a shot bergman used a mirror to compose shots post production screenplay called for a close up of alma with a strange resemblance to elisabet on faro bergman conceived a shot where ullmann and andersson s faces merge into one this was done by lighting what bergman considered unflattering side of each actress s face in different shots and combining lighted sides actresses were unaware of effect until a screening in moviola neither actress recognized herself in resulting imagery each assuming that shot was of other according to ullmann scene where alma describes elisabet s motherhood was filmed with two cameras one filming each actress and shots of each were intended to be mixed in editing then bergman decided that each angle communicated something important and used both in their entirety one after other bergman was unhappy with sound in scene where alma describes orgy so he told andersson to reread scene which she did in a lower voice it was recorded and dubbed in score by lars johan werle uses four

kane it is probably most written about film in canon critic peter cowie wrote everything one says about persona may be contradicted opposite will also be true academic frank gado called cowie s assessment patent nonsense but agreed there was critical disarray editor lloyd michaels said that although cowie exaggerated somewhat he welcomed critical licence to study film michaels summarized what he calls most widely held view of persona that it is a kind of modernist horror movie elisabet s condition described by a doctor as hopeless dream to be is shared condition of both life and film art film scholar marc gervais has suggested several possible interpretations a metaphor of subconscious or unconscious one personality consuming other fusing of two personalities into one or different sides of same personality fleetingly merging gado suggested that persona was an investigation of schizophrenia a story about lesbian attraction or a parable about artist bergman said that although he had an idea of what story meant he would not share it because he felt that his audience should draw its own conclusions he hoped film would be felt rather than understood silence of god is a theme bergman explored extensively in his previous work according to author paul coates persona was aftermath of that exploration gervais added that persona and other bergman films between 1965 and 1970 were not god centred gervais also quoted philosopher friedrich nietzsche as a guide to understanding persona belief in absolute immorality of nature in lack of purpose and in meaninglessness is affect psychologically necessary once belief in god and an essentially moral order is no longer supportable identity and duality 150px thumb left alt double exposure photograph of late 19th century actor richard mansfield as dr jekyll and mr hyde professor irving singer compared bergman s merged characters to dr jekyll and mr hyde analysis has focused on characters resemblance demonstrated in shots of overlapping faces in which one face is visible and part of another is seen behind it suggesting possibility that characters are one and their duality critic john simon commented this duality can be embodied in two persons as it is here but it has a distinct relevance to contradictory aspects of a single person if they are one person questions exist of whether alma is fantasizing about actress she admires elisabet is examining her psyche or boy is trying to understand his mother susan sontag suggested that persona is a series of variations on theme of doubling according to sontag film s subject is violence of spirit professor irving singer examining shot in which alma and elisabet s faces are combined compared its repulsive effect to that of seeing robert louis stevenson s character mr hyde instead of his benign alter ego dr jekyll singer wrote that bergman expanded on stevenson s exploration of duality good and evil light and dark aspects of our nature depicting it as oneness in shot gado saw persona as a double threaded process of discovery involving motherhood elisabet s withdrawal into silence could be her rejection of motherhood only role actress could not slough off nurse realizes that she has done what elisabet tried and failed to do erase a child from her life by abortion psychiatrist barbara young viewed boy in morgue in film s prologue as a stand in for bergman in a morgue he remembered reaching out to his mother young compared bergman s relationship with his mother karin to alma hungry for someone to listen to her and to love her and elisabet ravenous for precious time about theme of duality author birgitta steene wrote that alma represents soul and elisabet a stern goddess theologian hans nystedt called elisabet a symbol of god and alma symbolic of mortal consciousness coates noted female face or near goddess succeeding god previously studied by bergman referring to jungian theories to examine themes of duality and identity two different people with a grounding in one self trade identities coates described elisabet as a fusion of mythological figures thanatos and eros with alma as her hapless counterpart and a close up

interviewer asked bergman about jungian connotations of film s title acknowledging an alternative interpretation that it references persona masks worn by actors in ancient drama but saying that jung s concept admirably matched film bergman agreed saying that jung s theory fits well in this case coates also connected masks to themes of identity and duality mask is janus faced alma s secret is revealed in her orgy monologue and critic robin wood related it to a combination of shame and nostalgia perhaps indicating character s sexual liberation according to wood incident touched on unfaithfulness and juvenile sexuality in swedish young boys are called pojkar and are in need of coaching arnold weinstein wrote that alma s story is hardest hitting example of cracks in character s mask belying her persona of a nurse and leading to a collapse of self her monologue is so intense that it verges on pornography although there is no depiction of sexual escapade cinema historian p adams sitney summarized story as following course of psychoanalysis a referral followed by first interview disclosures and discovery of patient s root problem according to sitney story seems to begin from alma s point of view after elisabet compares their hands her point of view is revealed as source of story another possible reference to psychology is that when elisabet falls mute play she is in is electra by sophocles or euripides according to wood bergman did not focus on greek tragedy in his work but character of electra inspired idea of electra complex sitney felt that bergman s choice of play related to sexual identities a key concept in psychoanalysis gender and sexuality story fits bergman s motif of warring women seen earlier in silence and later in cries and whispers and autumn sonata according to professor marilyn johns blackwell elisabet s resistance to speaking can be interpreted as resistance to her gender role by depicting this tension as experienced primarily by women bergman may be said to position of woman as other role society assigns women is essentially foreign to their blackwell wrote that attraction between elisabet and alma and absence of male sexuality cohere with their identification with each other creating a doubling that reveals multiple shifting self contradictory identity a notion of identity that undermines male ideology theme of merging and doubling surfaces early in film when alma says that she saw one of elisabet s films and was struck by thought that they were alike blackwell also writes that one of film s original titles a piece of cinematography may allude to nature of representation analysts have noted possible lesbian under and overtones alison darren profiled persona in her lesbian film guide calling alma and elisabet s relationship halfway between love and hate they may come close to having sex in one scene though this might easily be an illusion scholar gwendolyn audrey foster interpreted film in feminist terms as a depiction of lesbianism viewing scene where elisabet enters alma s room as seduction professor alexis luko also felt that characters touching and resemblance in scene in addition to symbolizing their personalities merging indicated intimacy and eroticism foster believed that elisabet s gaze presents alma with questions about her engagement to karl henrik according to foster sexual encounters between men and women are associated with abortion lesbian romance has an increasingly shared identity but if persona dramatizes a lesbian relationship it is not clearly favorable as it is later characterized by narcissism and violence if lesbianism is considered a stronger version of female friendship or motherly love alma and elisabet s relationship replaces depiction of oedipus complex in prologue when boy reaches for his mother in vain according to jeremi bergman s use of homoeroticism gay and lesbian in persona hour of wolf cries and whispers and face to face was a rebellion against

a setting in his films elisabet is a stage actress and according to singer is seen in mask like makeup suggesting a theatrical persona singer wrote that elisabet wears thick and artificial eyelashes even when she is not acting scholar egil tornqvist noted that when elisabet is onstage as electra she looks away from theatre audience and breaks fourth wall by looking at camera according to tornqvist elisabet makes a fist symbolizing her revolt against notion of meaningful performance singer concluded that although elisabet develops a very personal relationship with alma she cannot shed

filmmaking although alma initially believes that artists created out of compassion out of a need to help she sees elisabet laugh at performances on a radio program and finds herself subject of actress s study she rejects her earlier belief how stupid of me as elisabet studies alma bergman studies them both michaels wrote that bergman and elisabet share a dilemma they cannot respond authentically to large catastrophes such as holocaust or vietnam war political columnist carsten jensen identified vietnam footage elisabet sees as 1963 self immolation of thich quang duc according to jensen photographs of quang duc s death were widely circulated and were used in persona academic benton meadows wrote that elisabet sees herself in quang duc s death fearing that it would be a consequence of her silent rebellion tornqvist wrote that elisabet is struck by truth that monk is a true rebel while her rebellion is a cowardly retreat behind a persona of muteness vampires 200px thumb alt painting

alma gervais wrote that persona is an impressionistic vampire film tornqvist called vampire portrayal connecting it to spider seen in prologue and fat spider mentioned in screenplay but omitted from final cut although psychologist daniel shaw interpreted elisabet as a vampire and alma as her sacrificial lamb bergman replied when asked if alma was entirely consumed style persona has been called an experimental film singer acknowledged marc gervais s theory that its style is a postmodern rejection of realistic narration although he said this was of secondary importance to its commentary on cinema independent journalist christopher hooton said that symmetry was used and fourth wall sometimes broken quoting essayist steven benedict on use of reflections splitting screen and shadows fourth wall seems to break when alma and elisabet look into camera and when elisabet takes photographs in direction of camera 175px thumb left alt a smiling liv ullmann in 1966 bergman believed in importance

clips of classic animation a comedic silent film crucifixion and a penis concluding that it summarized cinema montage s imagery is rapid fire with bergman saying penis is onscreen for one sixth of a second and intended to be subliminal sheep is from luis bunuel s 1929 un chien andalou and personification of death was used in bergman s 1949 film prison michaels linked spider in prologue with spider god in bergman s 1961 through a glass darkly tornqvist said that spider is visible under a microscope indicating its use for study when boy reaches out to his mother it is to shifting photographs of ullmann and andersson in addition to prologue story is interrupted by a midpoint celluloid break scenes creating a strange or eerie effect include elisabet entering alma s room where it is uncertain if she is sleepwalking or alma is having a dream and mr vogler having sex with alma it is uncertain if he mistook her for elisabet other scenes are dreamlike sometimes nightmarish story s small scale is supplemented with references to external horrors such as images of self immolation included in opening sequence and hospital scene and holocaust photograph subject of increasing close ups biographer jerry vermilye wrote that despite experimenting with colour in 1964 s all these women persona represented bergman and nykvist s return to stark black and white austerity of earlier chamber pieces they include through a glass darkly winter light and silence with vermilye calling persona a sequel to trilogy bergman returned to through a glass faro for its backdrop which he used symbolically according to professor john orr an island setting offered boldness and fluidity that brought different dynamics to drama orr wrote that island romanticism was a transition from bergman s earlier films into dream and abstraction examining visuals and depiction of social isolation and mourning critics christopher heathcote and jai marshall found parallels to edvard munch s paintings according to vineberg ullmann and andersson s acting styles are dictated by fact that andersson does nearly all talking she delivers monologues and ullmann is a naturalistic mime a notable exception is when elisabet is coaxed into saying word nothing which vineberg called ironic elisabet speaks only 14 words bergman said human face is great subject of cinema everything is there vineberg wrote that performances use mirror exercise in which actresses look directly at each other one makes facial movements which other tries to imitate ford wrote that ullmann s performance is defined by twitching lips ambivalent gazes and desire music and other sounds also define bergman s style this includes prologue with a discordant score accompanied by dripping and a ringing telephone in scene where elisabet meets alma in her bedroom foghorns accompany werle s music musicologist alexis luko described score as conveying semantic meaning with diabolus in musica devil in music a common style in horror cinema addition of a foghorn indicates a meeting of diegetic and non diegetic complementing breaking of fourth wall when alma and elisabet look at audience music elisabet hears in hospital bach s violin concerto in e major is meant to be nice and soothing and divert elisabet from her mental torment it fails to comfort wood calls it one of bach s most somber and tragic utterances and
