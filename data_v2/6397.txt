between alannah and myself explained tom bailey in an august 2014 interview with songfacts we actually decided well this is an interesting emotional subject what it feels like to get back together again after separation and kind of ideas that come up and way that emotion and physicality somehow are brought together in 1983 after commercial success of their third album quick step and side kick thompson twins collaborated again with producer alex sadkin to record into gap at compass point studios in bahamas bailey and sadkin co produced album including hold me now which according to bailey had a very strong idea behind it and was written very quickly when they were going to record song bailey said that he was excited nervous and almost over prepared for it he knew exactly what instruments were going on every track it took three days to record before release song was remixed by sadkin at rak studios in london about process bailey commented you know what a great producer is it s someone who takes great ideas and makes them into good records in our field great music is a hit record song became thompson twins biggest hit in america crouse 2000 p 228 but at same time it pressured band to produce top selling music even if they were not completely comfortable with that as alannah currie stated in an interview with david oriard of spokesman review biggest trouble that we ve had basically is that song hold me now was a huge hit it was really big here it was really big all over world which is great but it was just an accidental thing it was just a song that we wrote but after that then we got everybody managers record company on our back to write hold me now part 2 and harassing you to try and find a formula but we can t really we ll never find a formula for what we did and that upsets some of them composition hold me now is a pop new wave and synthpop ballad performed with a hypnotic swaying groove that features sound of a marimba in background song is composed in key of d major with a time signature set in common time and moves at a moderate tempo of 108 beats per minute while most of group s previous songs have a dance oriented sound hold me now has a mainstream piano based melody but keeps prominent bass line and currie s latin percussion of earlier releases song is in a verse chorus form employing a simple melody end chorus which includes leeway performing song s harmonies repeats for a full minute and a half nearly one third of song s full length critical reception originally hold me now received a mixed response from pop music critics in a review of group s album into gap parke puterbaugh from rolling stone magazine said that band took a new and drastic tangent and that they have slowed it all down to bring human factor into clearer focus adding that hold me now maintains a hypnotic swaying groove that suggests reserves of pastoral contentment even in wake of storm robert christgau in a review for village voice said that song is a classic on chord changes alone even though tom bailey sings it adding that nothing else in album into gap approaches its heart tugging mastery j d considine in a review for washington post commented that song s melody adds accessibility but could easily turn to dreary monotony two decades later song received positive reviews from critics jose f promis from allmusic commented that years later it still sounded as fresh and innocent as when it was first released stewart mason also from allmusic commented that song is an unexpected departure from group s previous dance oriented sound comparing it with spandau ballet s true adding that bailey is not actually technically very good but he s clearly trying very hard and felt that song is a bit labored but overall hold me now deserved its huge hit status raymond fiore from entertainment weekly said that song still sounds good today and called it sound of new wave pop brilliance in 2005 song ranked 308 in blenders list of
