follow up to their 1998 album aquemini duo worked to create an expansive and experimental musical aesthetic incorporating a diverse array of styles including funk rave music psychedelia gospel and rock within a dirty south oriented hip hop context during recording sessions andre 3000 began moving beyond traditional rapping in favor of a more melodic vocal style an approach to which big boi and

tang clan member raekwon who collaborated on song skew it on bar b from aquemini recalled before that south just wasn t played in new york but that song was hot flows was crazy cycle changed it really opened up door for southern rappers in march 1998 andre 3000 and big boi purchased a studio off northside drive in atlanta which had formerly belonged to r b singer bobby brown studio had sentimental value for duo as it was first place two had ever recorded vocals together on a remix of tlc s what about your friends 1992 two named studio stankonia a word created by andre 3000 as a combination of words stank a slang synonym for funky and title of a poster in his bedroom depicting a futuristic city he explained stankonia is this place i imagined where you can open yourself up and be free to express anything recording recording of stankonia began in spring of 1999 and lasted for about a year owning a studio helped band expand creatively as duo did not need to worry about time constraints that would occur with a rented studio andre 3000 observed you can sit there and fuck with just a kick and a snare all day long if you want to you re not working on clock really you re just working on your mind big boi spent majority of recording time in studio while andre 3000 worked at home creating beats and experimenting with an acoustic guitar one song that came from a jam session on guitar was ms jackson album s second single andre 3000 also created song lyrics by writing words on walls of his home i had planned to paint my house anyway writing on walls was just something i would do one stray lyric on his wall eventually developed into gasoline dreams much of album was formulated during vibe sessions in which group and producers would visit clubs in downtown atlanta select performers they saw and invite them to studio they would then sit around smoke a few drink a few and create ideas for new songs however recording sessions became difficult as andre 3000 grew tired of rapping on songs which made big boi and producers uneasy about how music would sound to maintain musical cohesion with big boi while continuing to expand his vocal palette andre decided to combine rapping with soul inspired crooning which had a major influence on stankonia s sound features a guest appearance from then unknown rapper killer mike rapper noted that while working with outkast he used opportunity to try to compete with duo to improve his rapping skills big boi was impressed with killer mike s abilities noting when i first heard him spit his voice was just so commanding he s a very intelligent guy composition music and style while outkast s previous albums were considered to be laid back mellow efforts stankonia contains faster more high energy tempos partially to reflect chaotic times at turn of 21st century group took note of new harder drugs hitting hip hop scene and teenagers using ecstasy cocaine and methamphetamine big boi reflected niggas living this life at a fast speed don t know what s going on around them if you live fast you gonna come out of here real fast so music need to show that while recording stankonia band refrained from listening to hip hop that music was starting to sound real comfortable there wasn t any adventure to it moon 2008 p 569 instead duo drew influence from musicians such as jimi hendrix chuck berry little richard and prince crazy horse p 183 however band refrained from producing a throwback sound with record and instead hoped to utilize these influences in a modern experimental fashion on stankonia outkast experimented with a wide variety of musical genres according to m matos of vibe stankonia turned south s predominantly reclined hip hop sound into something freaky and menacing allmusic s steve huey said their experimentation resulted in a trippy sort of techno psychedelic funk b o b features jittery drum n bass rhythms and has been classified as a stylistic tour de force combining hendrix ian guitars organs and gospel vocals wang 2003 p 133 on track andre 3000 and big boi employ a frantic flow in order to keep pace with song s high speed tempo which runs at 155 beats per minute hess 2007 p 465

has also been described as an homage of sorts to gospel choirs and 60s doo wop groups while also including a slowed down coda reminiscent of chopped and screwed hip hop lyrics paul lester of guardian described outkast s lyrical style on album by saying they are in a way post hip hop combining pm dawn s kooky confections with pharcyde s hallucinatory whimsy public enemy s hardline politicking with de la soul s cartoon dementia to fashion something vital and new album commonly features words stank and smell in their blues definition to mean low down blunt pungent a measure of authenticity group often incorporates word play into lyrics including references to underground and chants of i stank i can i stank i can an allusion to little engine that could song red velvet discusses materialistic nature of hip hop scene humble mumble addresses critics who make negative assumptions about hip hop based on preconceived notions andre 3000 raps in song i met a critic i made her shit her draws she said she thought hip hop was only guns and alcohol i said oh hell naw but yet it s that too you can t hate cause you done read a book or two boyd 2003 p 59 much of album discusses status of women in south and contrasts with misogynistic attitudes common in hip hop music in his book classic material hip hop album guide oliver wang writes that songs such as slum beautiful and toilet tisha reimagine round way girls not only as just more than one dimensional accessories but as objects of affection with lives and concerns that are worth exploring in toilet tisha duo empathizes with suicidal pregnant teenagers ms jackson is dedicated to mother of a mother of an out of wedlock child which andre 3000 refers to as baby s mama s mamas song was inspired by his relationship with singer erykah

of song designs that are often disarmingly subtle steve huey of allmusic commented that given variety of moods it helps that album is broken up by brief usually humorous interludes which serve as a sort of reset button it takes a few listens to pull everything together but given immense scope it s striking how few weak tracks there are hight of popmatters stated within stankonia outkast successfully presented a southern perspective of life liberty and pursuit of happiness but on surface phat beats and pure funk should suffice alternative press commented that experienced acclaimed groups rarely make albums as bold and confrontational as stankonia because they have too much to lose but felt that outkast don t care writing that they coalesced political and societal challenges of hip hop s past into what is one of genre s most artistically unorthodox releases so far robert christgau of village voice observed more bounce to ounce and less molasses in jams more delight and less
