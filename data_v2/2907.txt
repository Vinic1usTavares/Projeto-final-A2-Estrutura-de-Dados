to remove advertisements gameplay thumb left an example of slither io gameplay showing one player s worm eating remains of another worm that has died this is only a part of map objective of game is to control a worm around a wide area and eat pellets defeating and consuming other players to gain mass to grow largest and longest in game once player starts game and is spawned into virtual world their avatar cannot stop moving forward if player s worm s head collides into a part of another worm player will die defeated avatar s body turns into bright shining pellets for other players to consume as much pellets as it takes for equivalent amount of mass as worm had exactly before its death will be transmuted these pellets that remain from death of an avatar will correspond to color of avatar itself and are both brighter and bigger than normal pellets which spawn naturally throughout world normal pellets do not give as much mass as pellets dropped from other worms chase pellets will appear individually in various places of world and when eaten give a greater amount of mass than pellets dropped by other worms chase pellets avoid worms and flee when they draw near chase pellets can be obtained by boosting by pressing and holding space bar or left right mouse button on mobile double tapping touchscreen player can use their boost which causes avatar to speed up when button or on mobile finger on touchscreen is released worm will stop using its boost when a player uses their boost worm loses some mass causing worm s size to shrink slightly with mass that is lost from boost appearing as a line of small pellets where boost was used mass lost can be regained by consuming pellets similar to pellets dropped from defeated avatars boost pellets correspond to color of avatar boost feature is useful to outmaneuver and defeat opponents a common strategy that is used by players to defeat opponents is of player s avatar coiling around opponent s in a loop until opponent trapped in loop crashes into player there is a border that confines avatars within circular game board if a worm hits border player automatically dies without turning into aforementioned pellets as of now it is removed in 2016 player with biggest worm at end of day was able to share a victory message with world on each server leaderboards are displayed at top right showing top ten players with worms that have most mass out of all other worms in entire server skins there are 16 default skins each one a different solid color along with multiple repeating patterns colors are randomly chosen when player joins server players can choose to customize their worm s appearances using custom skins with unique designs including different countries flags as well as skins with motifs and colors representing well known youtubers such as jelly and pewdiepie or player may choose to create their own skin with a tool known as build a slither which shows different colors that an avatar can be made of that can be placed on worm upon clicking previously in order to unlock custom skins in browser mode players were forced to share game on twitter or facebook using external links found on website by june 2016 ability to add skins was also added to ios and android versions mobile version there are three control schemes on ios and android apps classic where worm follows player s finger joystick where left thumb controls worm using a virtual joystick and right thumb makes it go faster and arrow which is exactly like joystick but with an arrow above worm s head indicating direction it is moving in since june 2016 mobile versions also allow players to play offline against computer using an artificial intelligence mode development according to game creator steven howse he was inspired to create game while he was experiencing financial problems as a result of these financial issues he had to move from minneapolis to michigan where he realized popularity of agar io he had long wanted to create an online multiplayer game but only option for development at time was in adobe flash and not wanting to use this method he gave up idea for a while howse finally created game when he realized that a low latency protocol supported by most major browsers was sufficient and stable enough to run an html game similar to other games such as agar io most difficult part of development was in making each server stable enough to handle 600 players at a time howse struggled to find space on servers with enough space in regions where there was more demand and tried to avoid cloud services like amazon web services owing to high cost that these services would incur based on amount of bandwidth used after six months of development slither io was released for browsers and ios on march 25 2016 with servers supporting up to 500 players two days after ios browser versions release an android version was made available by studios only way howse could make revenue was to display advertising in app after player s worm died this option could be removed for us 3 99 he chose not to sell virtual currency or power ups so that those who paid would not have an advantage over players who did not as there was no money to advertise for game only way to advertise was various let s plays by players on youtube including pewdiepie who had more than 47 million subscribers at time in weeks following release howse worked on updates to stabilize game and provide a better experience for players in addition he plans to add new features such as a friendly mode that allows people to set up teams and a way for player to choose a server to play on howse said that two major gaming companies had approached him to buy slither io he had considered idea since he felt that it was stressful to maintain game reception soon after release slither io reached top of app store sales charts in free software category in several regions including united states and united kingdom by end of 2016 slither io had become google s most searched video game of year in united states patricia hernandez of kotaku said that game s low barriers to entry and similarity to agar io explained slither io popularity she noted game s fast pace boing boing compared game s core mechanic to that of 2009 game brandt ran writing for business insider said that despite running into some technical hiccups game can lag heavily at times i doubt slither io will be leaving my home screen anytime soon harry slater writing for pocket gamer defined game as interesting gameplay as a compulsive experience and structure as simple and similar to agar io although it did not have a large replay value techcrunch felicia williams praised designs getting pleasantly surprised with variety of skins for customization lian amaris of gamezebo found game to be far more interesting than agar io because it involved an ever growing languid body rather than just a flat circle and praised dark environment with neon worms which gave game a retro arcade feel amaris also compared concept of slither io to that of agar io and stated that slither io was reminiscent of classic arcade game snake shortly after release of mobile versions game
