battle of ramillies fought on 23 may 1706 was a battle of war of spanish succession for grand alliance austria england and dutch republic battle had followed an indecisive campaign against bourbon armies of king louis xiv of france in 1705 although allies had captured barcelona that year they had been forced to abandon their campaign on moselle had stalled in spanish netherlands and suffered defeat in northern italy yet despite his opponents setbacks louis xiv wanted peace but on reasonable terms because of this as well as to maintain their momentum french and their allies took offensive in 1706 campaign began well for louis xiv s generals in italy marshal vendome defeated austrians at battle of calcinato in april while in alsace marshal villars forced margrave of baden back across rhine encouraged by these early gains louis xiv urged marshal villeroi to go over to offensive in spanish netherlands and with victory gain a fair peace accordingly french marshal set off from leuven louvain at head of 60 000 men and marched towards tienen tirlemont as if to threaten zoutleeuw also determined to fight a major engagement duke of marlborough commander in chief of anglo dutch forces assembled his army some 62 000 men near maastricht and marched past zoutleeuw with both sides seeking battle they soon encountered each other on dry ground between mehaigne and petite gheete rivers close to small village of ramillies in less than four hours marlborough s dutch english and danish never joined grand alliance but danish troops hired by maritime powers england and dutch republic were central to allied success at both battle of blenheim in 1704 and ramillies 1706 overwhelmed villeroi s and max emanuel s franco spanish bavarian army duke s subtle moves and changes in emphasis during battle something his opponents failed to realise until it was too late caught french in a tactical vice with their foe broken and routed allies were able to fully exploit their victory town after town fell including brussels bruges and antwerp by end of campaign villeroi s army had been driven from most of spanish netherlands with prince eugene s subsequent success at battle of turin in northern italy allies had imposed greatest loss of territory and resources that louis xiv would suffer during war thus year 1706 proved for allies to be an annus mirabilis background after their disastrous defeat at blenheim in 1704 next year brought french some respite duke of marlborough had intended 1705 campaign an invasion of france through moselle valley to complete work of blenheim and persuade king louis xiv to make peace but plan had been thwarted by friend and foe alike barnett marlborough 140 reluctance of his dutch allies to see their frontiers denuded of troops for another gamble in germany had denied marlborough initiative but of far greater importance was margrave of baden s pronouncement that he could not join duke in strength for coming offensive this was in part due to sudden switching of troops from rhine to reinforce prince eugene in italy and part due to deterioration of baden s health brought on by re opening of a severe foot wound he had received at storming of schellenberg previous year chandler marlborough as military commander 154 marlborough had to cope with death of emperor leopold i in may and accession of joseph i which unavoidably complicated matters for grand alliance resilience of french king and efforts of his generals also added to marlborough s problems falkner ramillies 1706 year of miracles 18 marshal villeroi exerting considerable pressure on dutch commander count overkirk along meuse took huy on 10 june before pressing on towards liege with marshal villars sitting strong on moselle allied commander whose supplies had by now become very short was forced to call off his campaign on 16 june what a disgrace for marlborough exulted villeroi to have made false movements without any result chandler marlborough as military commander 157 with marlborough s departure north french transferred troops from moselle valley to reinforce villeroi in flanders while villars marched off to rhine lynn wars of louis xiv 1667 1714 298 anglo dutch forces gained minor compensation for failed moselle campaign with success at elixheim and crossing of lines of brabant in spanish netherlands huy was also retaken on 11 july but a chance to bring french to a decisive engagement eluded marlborough barnett marlborough 152 year 1705 proved almost entirely barren for duke whose military disappointments were only partly compensated by efforts on diplomatic front where at courts of dusseldorf frankfurt vienna berlin and hanover marlborough sought to bolster support for grand alliance and extract promises of prompt assistance for following year s campaign chandler marlborough as military commander 164 prelude on 11 january 1706 marlborough finally reached london at end of his diplomatic tour but he had already been planning his strategy for coming season first option although it is debatable to what extent duke was committed to such an enterprise was a plan to transfer his forces from spanish netherlands to northern italy once there he intended linking up with prince eugene in order to defeat french and safeguard savoy from being overrun barnett marlborough 158 savoy would then serve as a gateway into france by way of mountain passes or an invasion with naval support along mediterranean coast via nice and toulon in connexion with redoubled allied efforts in spain trevelyan england under queen anne ramillies and union with scotland 102 it seems that duke s favoured scheme was to return to moselle valley where marshal marsin had recently taken command of french forces and once more attempt an advance into heart of france chandler marlborough as military commander 169 but these decisions soon became academic shortly after marlborough landed in dutch republic on 14 april news arrived of big allied setbacks in wider war determined to show grand alliance that france was still resolute louis xiv prepared to launch a double surprise in alsace and northern italy barnett marlborough 159 on latter front marshal vendome defeated imperial army at calcinato on 19 april pushing imperialists back in confusion french forces were now in a position to prepare for long anticipated siege of turin in alsace marshal villars took baden by surprise and captured haguenau driving him back across rhine in some disorder thus creating a threat on landau chandler marlborough as military commander 168 with these reverses dutch refused to contemplate marlborough s ambitious march to italy or any plan that denuded their borders of duke and their army falkner ramillies 1706 year of miracles 33 in interest of coalition harmony marlborough prepared to campaign in low countries on move thumb 300px map of low countries during war of spanish succession village of ramillies lies near mehaigne a tributary of

unless french do what i am very confident they will not in other words court battle barnett marlborough 160 on 17 may duke concentrated his dutch and english troops at near maastricht hanoverians hessians and danes despite earlier undertakings found or invented pressing reasons for withholding their support marlborough wrote an appeal to duke of wurttemberg commander of danish contingent i send you this express to request your highness to bring forward by a double march your cavalry so as to join us at earliest moment falkner ramillies 1706 year of miracles 38 additionally king in prussia frederick i had kept his troops in quarters behind rhine while his personal disputes with vienna and states general at hague remained unresolved nevertheless duke could think of no circumstances why french would leave their strong positions and attack his army even if villeroi was first reinforced by substantial transfers from marsin s command chandler marlborough as military commander 170 but in this he had miscalculated although louis xiv wanted peace he wanted it on reasonable terms for that he needed victory in field and to convince allies that his resources were by no means exhausted trevelyan england under queen anne ramillies and union with scotland 103 thumb left 170px john churchill 1st duke of marlborough 1650 1722 by sir godfrey kneller following successes in italy and along rhine louis xiv was now hopeful of similar results in flanders far from standing on defensive therefore and unbeknown to marlborough louis xiv was persistently goading his marshal into action villeroi began to imagine wrote st simon that king doubted his courage and resolved to stake all at once in an effort to vindicate himself saint simon memoirs vol i 298 accordingly on 18 may villeroi set off from leuven at head of 70 battalions 132 squadrons and 62 cannon comprising an overall force of some 60 000 troops and crossed river dyle to seek battle with enemy spurred on by his growing confidence in his ability to out general his opponent and by versailles determination to avenge blenheim villeroi and his generals anticipated success villeroi was convinced that marlborough had won battle of blenheim by mere chance neither opponent expected clash at exact moment or place where it occurred chandler marlborough as military commander 172 french moved first to tienen as if to threaten zoutleeuw abandoned by french in october 1705 before turning southwards heading for jodoigne this line of march took villeroi s army towards narrow aperture of dry ground between mehaigne and petite gheete rivers close to small villages of ramillies and taviers but neither commander quite appreciated how far his opponent had travelled villeroi still believed on 22 may allies were a full day s march away when in fact they had camped near waiting for danish squadrons to catch up for his part marlborough deemed villeroi still at jodoigne when in reality he was now approaching plateau of mont st andre with intention of pitching camp near ramillies see map at right however prussian infantry was not there marlborough wrote to lord raby english resident at berlin if it should please god to give us victory over enemy allies will be little obliged to king frederick for success trevelyan england under queen anne ramillies and union with scotland 104 following day at 01 00 marlborough dispatched cadogan his quartermaster general with an advanced guard to reconnoitre same dry ground that villeroi s army was now heading toward country that was well known to duke from previous campaigns two hours later duke followed with main body 74 battalions 123 squadrons 90 pieces of artillery and 20 mortars totalling 62 000 troops barnett marlborough 161 at about 08 00 after cadogan had just passed his force made brief contact with a party of french hussars gathering forage on edge of plateau of jandrenouille after a brief exchange of shots french retired and cadogan s dragoons pressed forward with a short lift in mist cadogan soon discovered smartly ordered lines of villeroi s advance guard some off a galloper hastened back to warn marlborough two hours later duke accompanied by dutch field commander field marshal overkirk general daniel and allied staff rode up to cadogan where on horizon to westward he could discern massed ranks of french army deploying for battle along front marlborough later told bishop burnet that french army looked best of any he had ever seen trevelyan england under queen anne ramillies and union with scotland 106 battle battlefield battlefield of ramillies is very similar to that of blenheim for here too there is an immense area of arable land unimpeded by woods or hedges barnett marlborough 162 villeroi s right rested on villages of franquenee and taviers with river mehaigne protecting his flank a large open plain about wide lay between taviers and ramillies but unlike blenheim there was no stream to hinder cavalry his centre was secured by ramillies itself lying on a slight eminence which gave distant views to north and east french left flank was protected by broken country and by a stream petite gheete which runs deep between steep and slippery slopes on french side of stream ground rises to offus village which together with autre eglise farther north anchored villeroi s left flank to west of petite

perhaps 30 000 men facing offus and ramillies also facing ramillies marlborough placed a powerful battery of thirty 24 pounders dragged into position by a team of oxen further batteries were positioned overlooking petite gheete on their left on broad plain between taviers and ramillies and where marlborough thought decisive encounter must take marlborough 163 overkirk drew 69 squadrons of

which were of three barrelled kind first seen at elixheim previous year enjoyed good arcs of fire able to fully cover approaches of plateau of jandrenouille over which allied infantry would have to pass marlborough however noticed several important weaknesses in french dispositions chandler a guide to battlefields of europe 30 tactically it was imperative for villeroi to occupy taviers on his right and autre eglise on his left but by adopting this posture he had been forced to over extend his forces lynn wars of louis xiv 1667 1714 304 moreover this disposition concave in relation to allied army gave marlborough opportunity to form a more compact line drawn up in a shorter front between horns of french crescent when allied blow came it would be more concentrated and carry more weight additionally duke s disposition facilitated transfer of troops across his front far more easily than his foe a tactical advantage that would grow in importance as events of afternoon unfolded although villeroi had option of enveloping flanks of allied army as they deployed on plateau of jandrenouille threatening to encircle their army duke correctly gauged that characteristically cautious french commander was intent on a defensive battle along ridge line falkner wars of louis xiv 1667 1714 55 taviers at 13 00 batteries went into action a little later two allied columns set out from extremities of their line and attacked flanks of franco bavarian army chandler a guide to battlefields of europe 31 to south dutch guards under command of colonel wertmuller came forward with their two field guns to seize hamlet of franquenee small swiss garrison in village shaken by sudden onslaught and unsupported by battalions to their rear were soon compelled back towards village of taviers taviers was of particular importance to franco bavarian position it protected otherwise unsupported flank of general de guiscard s cavalry on open plain while at same time it allowed french infantry to pose a threat to flanks of dutch and danish squadrons as they came forward into position falkner ramillies 1706 year of miracles 57 but hardly had retreating swiss rejoined their comrades in that village when dutch guards renewed their attack fighting amongst alleys and cottages soon deteriorated into a fierce bayonet and clubbing melee but superiority in dutch firepower soon told accomplished

guiscard ordered an immediate attack with 14 squadrons of french dragoons currently stationed in rear two other battalions of greder suisse regiment were also sent but attack was poorly co ordinated

villeroi posting himself near offus watched anxiously redcoats advance mindful of counsel he had received on 6 may from louis xiv have particular care to that part of line which will endure first shock of english troops heeding this advice french commander began to transfer battalions from his centre to reinforce left drawing more foot from already weakened right to replace them as english battalions descended gentle slope of petite gheete valley struggling through boggy stream they were met by major general de la guiche s disciplined walloon infantry sent forward from around offus

plateau of mont st andre beyond this was potentially dangerous for allied infantry who would then be at mercy of elector s bavarian and walloon squadrons patiently waiting on plateau for order to move falkner ramillies 1706 year of miracles 71 although henry lumley s english cavalry had managed to cross marshy ground around petite gheete it was soon evident to marlborough that sufficient cavalry support would not be practicable and that battle could not be won on allied right chandler marlborough as military commander 176 duke therefore called off attack against offus and autre eglise to make sure that orkney obeyed his order to withdraw marlborough sent his quartermaster general in person with command despite orkney s protestations cadogan insisted on compliance and reluctantly orkney gave word for his troops to fall back to their original positions on edge of plateau of jandrenouille it is still not clear how far orkney s advance was planned only as a feint according to historian david chandler it is probably more accurate to surmise that marlborough launched orkney in a serious probe with a view to sounding out possibilities of sector nevertheless attack had served its purpose villeroi had given his personal attention to that wing and strengthened it with large bodies of horse and foot that ought to have been taking part in decisive struggle south of ramillies

were from observation by a slight fold in land their commander brigadier general van ordered regimental colours to be left in place on edge of plateau to convince their opponents they were still in their initial position therefore unbeknown to french who remained oblivious to allies real strength and intentions on opposite side of petite gheete marlborough was throwing his full weight against ramillies and open plain to south villeroi meanwhile was still moving more reserves of infantry in opposite direction towards his left flank crucially it would be some time before french commander

they approached they advanced their second and fourth lines into intervals of their first and third lines so that when they made their advance upon us they formed only one front without any intermediate spaces falkner ramillies 1706 year of miracles 80 initial clash favoured dutch and danish squadrons disparity of numbers exacerbated by villeroi stripping their ranks of infantry to reinforce his left flank enabled overkirk s cavalry to throw first line of french horse back in some disorder towards their second line squadrons this line also came under severe pressure and in turn was forced back to their third line of cavalry and few battalions still remaining on plain falkner ramillies 1706 year of miracles 81 but these french horsemen were amongst best in louis xiv s army

english squadrons in support of orkney thanks to a combination of battle smoke and favourable terrain his redeployment went unnoticed by villeroi who made no attempt to transfer any of his own 50 unused squadrons while he waited for fresh reinforcements to arrive marlborough flung himself into melee rallying some of dutch cavalry who were in confusion but his personal involvement nearly led to

assisting him onto his mount unfortunate bringfield was hit by an errant cannonball that sheared off his head one account has it that cannonball flew between captain general s legs before hitting unfortunate colonel whose torso fell at marlborough s feet a moment subsequently depicted in a lurid set of contemporary playing cards nevertheless danger passed enabling duke to attend to positioning
