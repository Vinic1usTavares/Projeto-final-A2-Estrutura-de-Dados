obsessed many critics believed track to be about eminem and its accompanying music video portrayed carey being followed by a male stalker which critics also thought bore a strong resemblance to rapper

critical reception bill lamb of about com placed up out my face in his list of album s top four tracks although j edward keyes of newsday described track as exuberant he was critical of its placement on album production courtesy of reliable tricky stewart and dream feels boilerplate at best at 17 songs record is far too long and by time exuberant up out my face arrives it feels like it was grafted on from a better record ann powers of los angeles times thought that carey lacked conviction in her approach to song writing that despite its aggressive tone restraint stops serving her agenda similar to original track remix had a blended reception washington post alison stewart praised track writing that addition of minaj made it more lively sometime in past six months minaj became go to girl for artists who wanted to add some to their tracks without themselves in process here she enlivens an otherwise polite track from carey s upcoming remix disc robbie daw of idolator felt that track was too reminiscent to one of carey s previous singles don t forget about us which he thought in turn was very similar to another preceding single we belong together he contained to add but still if mimi s going to mine from her own extensive back catalog of ballads those are primo melodies to go for a reviewer for dj booth thought that minaj ruined song music video accompanying music video for remix of up out my face was directed by carey s husband nick cannon minaj spoke about filming a video with carey and how she did not believe that video would ever be released i didn t even tell anyone i shot a video with mariah because i didn t even believe in back of my mind i felt like this video is not gonna come out there s no way i m gonna do a video with mariah carey before i even put out my album then when it came out i think it was 1 video on youtube in one day something crazy like that it premiered simultaneously with video for angels cry with ne yo on vevo on january 28 2010 carey and minaj play different characters include barbie dolls who escape from their boxes sexy nurses in matching outfits two women in a nail salon and two divas shopping carey s doll box has she sings written on front while minaj s say she raps cannon makes a cameo appearance in video which chris ryan of mtv buzzworthy thought was a reference to 2002 film drumline according to anna pickard of guardian escape from their packaging demonstrates a theme of being independent women and that they will not be restrained by men minaj spoke about video in an interview for mtv news a lot of times more famous artists or more confident artists take from a younger artist but they ll never include you in that i feel like she liked whole doll thing and she wanted to do it with me but she said that she said everybody s gonna say she s doing nicki but i told her she s always had a doll persona like all that doll baby stuff so it goes perfect with barbie and we had fun that s all that matters melina newman of hitfix thought that it looked like one of carey s lowest production budgets for a music video to date but explained that it was not necessarily a bad thing and that carey looked adorable in a nurses outfit she likened use of a red and white color scheme for video to a target commercial anna pickard commented that carey and minaj looked grumpier than what dolls usually do because their men are low down dirty dogs who should henceforth get up out of mimi and nicki s faces she compared use of a red and white palette to kylie minogue s music video for can t get you out of my head cheryl fernandez s fight for this love and lady gaga s bad romance and that it appeared to be a go to device for directors who want their pop video to pop visually without need for too much pesky plot to worry about
