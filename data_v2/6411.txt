banksia marginata commonly known as silver banksia is a species of tree or woody shrub in plant genus banksia found throughout much of southeastern australia it ranges from eyre peninsula in south australia to north of armidale new south wales and across tasmania and islands of bass strait it grows in various habitats including eucalyptus forest scrub heathland and moorland banksia marginata varies widely in habit ranging from a small shrub high to a large tree tall narrow leaves are linear and yellow inflorescences flower spikes occur from late summer to early winter flower spikes fade to brown and then grey and develop woody follicles bearing winged seeds originally described by antonio jose cavanilles in 1800 further collections of b marginata were described as several separate species by robert brown in 1810 however all were reclassified as a single species by george bentham in 1870 no distinct subspecies have been recognised by banksia expert alex george who nonetheless concedes that further work is needed many species of bird in particular honeyeaters forage at flower spikes as do native and european honeybees response to bushfire varies some populations are serotinous they are killed by fire and regenerate from large stores of seed which have been held in cones in plant canopy and are released after a fire others regenerate from underground lignotubers or suckers from lateral roots although it has been used for timber banksia marginata is most commonly seen as a garden plant with dwarf forms being commercially propagated and sold description thumb left alt tree in grassland tree habit rail line nature conservation reserve banksia marginata is a highly variable species usually ranging from a small shrub around a metre 3 ft tall to a tree unusually large trees of 15 to possibly 30 m 50 100 ft have been reported near in victoria s western district as well as several locations in tasmania while compact shrubs limited to high have been recorded on coastal heathland in tasmania such as at rocky cape national park salkin p 145 shrubs reach only high in gibraltar range national park bark is pale grey and initially smooth before becoming finely tessellated with age new branchlets are hairy at first but lose their hairs as they mature new growth a pale or pinkish brown leaves are alternately arranged on stems on 2 5 mm long petioles and characteristically toothed in juvenile or younger leaves long narrow adult leaves are dull green in colour and generally linear oblong or wedge shaped cuneate and measure long and wide margins become entire with age and tip is most commonly truncate or emarginate but can be acute or mucronate cellular makeup of leaves shows evidence of and leaves themselves are somewhat stiff leaves also have sunken leaf undersurface is white with a prominent midrib covered in brownish hairs complex flower spikes known as inflorescences appear generally from late summer to early winter february to june in new south wales and victoria although flowering occurs in late autumn and winter in gibraltar range cylindrical in shape they are composed of a central woody spike or axis perpendicularly from which a large number of compact floral units arise which measure tall and wide pale yellow in colour they are composed of up to 1000 individual flowers 784 recorded in gibraltar range and arise from nodes on branchlets that are at least three years old sometimes two may grow from successive nodes in same flowering season they can have a grey or golden tinge in late bud as with most banksias anthesis is acropetal opening of individual buds proceeds up flower spike from base to top over time flower spikes fade to brown and then grey and old flowers generally persist on cone woody follicles grow in six months after flowering with up to 150 developing on a single flower spike in many populations only a few follicles develop small and elliptic they measure long high and wide in coastal and floodplain populations these usually open spontaneously and release seed while they generally remain sealed until burnt by fire in plants from heathland and montane habitats salkin p 146 each follicle contains one or two fertile seeds between which lies a woody dark brown separator of similar shape to seeds measuring in length seed is egg to wedge shaped obovate to cuneate and composed of a dark brown wide membranous wing and wedge or sickle shaped cuneate falcate seed proper which measures long by wide seed surface can be smooth or covered in tiny ridges and often glistens resulting seedling first grows two obovate cotyledon leaves which may remain for several months as several more leaves appear cotyledons of banksia marginata b paludosa and b integrifolia are very similar in appearance taxonomy and naming thumb left leaf undersides are white with a prominent midrib downcurved margin gives leaves a bordered appearance which is inspiration for species name banksia marginata is commonly called silver banksia because white undersides of its leaves contrast with otherwise green foliage and give plant a silvery look alternate common names include honeysuckle and dwarf honeysuckle aboriginal name in language of western victoria was while kaurna name from adelaide plains was and local name in macquarie harbour region in tasmania was a widely distributed and diverse plant b marginata was described independently and given many different names by early explorers on his third voyage captain james cook reported a most common tree about ten feet high branching pretty much with narrow leaves and a large yellow cylindrical flower consisting only of a vast number of filaments which being shed leave a fruit like a pine top in january 1777 species was first collected by luis nee in 1793 from somewhere between sydney and parramatta in 1800 spanish botanist antonio jose cavanilles gave species binomial name it still bears today species name is latin adjective marginatus bordered and refers to appearance of lower surface of recurved margins of leaves when viewed from underneath cavanilles also described another specimen collected by nee in same locality as a different species banksia cav a smaller shrub with dentate leaves this turned out to be an immature plant of same species with juvenile leaves salkin p 25 robert brown described 31 species of banksia in his 1810 work prodromus florae novae hollandiae et insulae van diemen including six taxa b marginata a and b plus four further species now attributable to b marginata he split genus into two subgenera placing these species in subgenus banksia verae true banksias he described banksia australis r br giving location of collection as port phillip bay in victoria in 1802 having crossed out van diemen s land 1804 brown s other collections which were reduced to synonymy with b marginata were banksia depressa r br a prostrate shrub from margate rivulet in southeastern tasmania banksia insularis r br from flinders and king island and banksia patula r br a shrub from vicinity of port lincoln south australia french naturalist aime bonpland in 1816 called it banksia marcescens deemed an illegitimate name as by that time name banksia marginata already had been published still more synonyms are banksia vent ex and banksia thumb right plate titled banksia marcescens in description des plantes rares a malmaison et a navarre by aime bonpland by time carl meissner published his 1856 arrangement of genus there were 58 described banksia species meissner divided brown s banksia verae which had been renamed eubanksia by stephan endlicher in 1847 into four series based on leaf properties he listed six species and a further four varieties all now sunk into b marginata in series salicinae in 1870 george bentham published a thorough revision of banksia in his landmark publication flora australiensis in bentham s arrangement number of recognised banksia species was reduced from 60 to 46 bentham observed that characteristics brown used to define b australis b depressa b patula and b insularis were unable to distinguish separate forms as more specimens came to light and hence declared them synonyms of b marginata meissner s four series were replaced by four sections based on leaf style and pollen presenter characters b marginata was placed in section eubanksia along with b integrifolia and b dentata placement within banksia current taxonomic arrangement of genus banksia is based on botanist alex george s 1999 monograph for flora of australia book series in this arrangement b marginata is placed in banksia subgenus banksia because its inflorescences take form of banksia s characteristic flower spikes section banksia because of its straight styles and series salicinae because its inflorescences are cylindrical in a morphological cladistic analysis published in 1994 kevin thiele placed it as most basal member of a newly described subseries integrifoliae within series salicinae however this subgrouping of salicinae was not supported by george george did concede that major work is needed on banksia marginata which shows such a high degree of variability over its range thumb right seed separator of banksia marginata with winged seeds still nestled against it b marginata s placement within banksia may be summarised as follows genus banksia subgenus isostylis subgenus banksia section oncostylis section coccinea section banksia series grandes series banksia series crocinae series prostratae series cyrtostylis series tetragonae series bauerinae series quercinae series salicinae b dentata b aquilonia b integrifolia b plagiocarpa b oblongifolia b robur b conferta b paludosa b marginata b canei b saxicola since 1998 american botanist austin mast and co authors have been publishing results of ongoing cladistic analyses of dna sequence data for subtribe banksiinae which then comprised genera banksia and dryandra their analyses suggest a phylogeny that differs greatly from george s taxonomic arrangement banksia marginata resolves as closest relative or sister to b saxicola two taxa part of a larger group containing b paludosa and three subspecies of b integrifolia early in 2007 mast and thiele rearranged genus banksia by merging dryandra into it and published b subg spathulatae for taxa having spoon shaped cotyledons thus b subg banksia was redefined as encompassing taxa lacking spoon shaped cotyledons they foreshadowed publishing a full arrangement once dna sampling of dryandra was complete in meantime if mast and thiele s nomenclatural changes are taken as an interim arrangement then b marginata is placed in b subg spathulatae hybrids with other species hybridisation with banksia conferta subsp penicillata at site of an old abandoned railway between newnes and clarence in blue mountains has been recorded a single b marginata plant was surrounded by plants with intermediate features but more strongly resembling b conferta subsp penicillata b marginata can also interbreed with b paludosa where they are found together a hybrid with b saxicola was recorded from mount william during banksia atlas project a purported hybrid with b integrifolia thought to be from cape paterson on victoria s south coast was first described by alf salkin and is commercially available in small quantities it forms an attractive hardy low growing plant to salkin observed an intermediate form which occurred in coastal areas where banksia marginata and b integrifolia are found together calling it wilsons promontory he noted that it colonised sand dunes had leaves similar to but narrower than integrifolia and had persisting flowers on old spikes but not as persistent as marginata he had collected this form from in new south wales as well as cape paterson and had received reports of similar plants at marlo and rivers salkin p 142 stands of plants intermediate between b integrifolia and b marginata have been recorded near mallacoota in east gippsland distribution and habitat left thumb distribution of b marginata across southeastern australia alt a map of australia with a green area across a broad swathe of southeastern corner of continent plus tasmania and bass strait islands banksia marginata is found from and gibraltar range national park in northern new south wales southwards into victoria and south australia as well as across tasmania it is found on major islands of bass strait including king flinders and cape barren islands there is one report of a collection from mountains southwest of southport in southeastern queensland it is extremely rare in southwestern new south wales in victoria it is predominantly coastal or near coastal east of traralgon but in new south wales it is absent from coastal areas in sydney region banksia marginata often grew as a large tree on basalt plains west of melbourne but has almost disappeared in vicinity of adelaide it was common in western suburbs on old sand dunes behind beach it remains common in adelaide foothills annual rainfall over its distribution ranges from in gibraltar range national park it is a dominant shrub of open heathland and a non dominant shrub of closed heath mostly found in swampy heath associated with sedges plants here have some degree of self compatibility in sydney region it grows in association with

south gippsland it is generally a shrub which regenerates from a lignotuber or suckers after bushfire and sets few seed it has been recorded as a low spreading shrub in national park in east gippsland in wombat state forest west of melbourne it grows as a high shrub on less fertile soils and as a large tree to on more fertile soils few trees remain having been cleared for agriculture or for fuel similarly further west in corangamite region it is either a tree or suckering shrub in tasmania banksia marginata occupies a wide range of habitats in mixed forest where it grows as a small tree button grass moorlands flood plains of loddon franklin and huon rivers as well as coastal regions salkin pp 144 45 in parts of west and southwest of tasmania species is dominant within threatened native vegetation community known as banksia marginata wet scrub there is no record for species so it is unclear whether it is a recent introduction from mainland or has only recently evolved although its presence on both mainland and tasmania suggests it has been present since pleistocene it grows in coastal habitats that would be occupied by banksia integrifolia on mainland banksia marginata grows on a variety of soil types from clay loams shale and peaty loams to sandy or rocky soils composed of quartzite sandstone limestone or granite although sandier soils predominate it is restricted to sandy soils in adelaide region soil types are of a wide range of ph from highly acidic soils in grampians to alkaline soils in south australia plants have been recorded at altitudes ranging from sea level to as high as ahd at mount field national park ecology thumb right inflorescence part way through anthesis with individual flowers at base opened and those further up spike still closed

blowflies and brown butterflies have been recorded as visitors to flower spikes wasp kerri of subfamily within family braconidae causes stem galls on b marginata in southeastern south australia galls are either round to a diameter of or cigar shaped to their effect on plant is unclear b marginata is a host plant for larval and adult stages of beetle imperialis much more pathological is banksia longicorn beetle australis which bores holes in base of banksia plants which then weaken and fall or blow over with wind and die several species of fungus have been recorded growing on foliage including elegans asterina systema solare botryosphaeria banksiae a species of banksiae banksiae episphaerella banksiae a species australiensis and a species of all banksias have developed proteoid or cluster roots in response to nutrient poor conditions of australian soils particularly lacking in phosphorus root system of suckering forms of banksia marginata in victoria and south australia have a characteristic pattern with a deep tap root and an extensive system of thick lateral roots below surface during winter months segments around in length develop vegetative buds capable of forming suckers clusters of fine proteoid roots up to long arise from these lateral roots left thumb a seedling growing in wombat state forest displays serrated juvenile leaves which are larger and broader than adult ones response of banksia marginata to fire is variable in gibraltar range and sydney regions plants are killed by fire and regenerate from seed they are serotinous storing their seed in old cones forming a seedbank in their canopy which is released after bushfire a field study found that seeds were dispersed short distances generally or less with those closest to parent plant faring best in little desert national park in northwestern victoria and also eastern south australia it grows as a low shrub which suckers shoots growing from lateral roots after fire plants do not appear to live longer than 25 years after this time ageing plants begin to die and are succeeded by younger plants arising from suckers around parent a field study in gippsland found counting nodes of banksia marginata plants to be accurate in indicating age within a year up to 21 years since last fire there is evidence of plants reaching 150 years old in this region plant species from communities dependent on fire are thought to self select to be more flammable banksia marginata tested from a dry sclerophyll community in southeastern tasmania was shown to burn readily and fire would spread easily through it tasmanian forms have been shown to be frost tolerant at any time of year which might explain some of their success in spreading and growing in different habitats around island this attribute might have allowed them to survive cold periods in tasmania in pleistocene a trial in western australia showed banksia marginata to be mildly sensitive to phytophthora cinnamomi dieback at brisbane ranges national park west of melbourne which was invaded by phytophthora cinnamomi in 1970s banksia marginata along with such species as grevillea was part of a secondary regrowth of understory species after more resistant shrubs such as grasses and sedges had grown back uses aboriginal australian uses plant was often used by many indigenous clans and tribes throughout east coast and used in similar fashion as a large amount as others banksia trees sweet nectar from flowers was sucked or drained by soaking in water and in some cases mixed with some wattle gum in order to make a sweet lolly woods was also used to make needles and dried flowers were used to strain water for plant use in snowy river catchment page 14 timber red hued heartwood is coarse grained and soft it is sometimes used for turning but requires careful drying before use to avoid warping a sample was prepared in victoria in 1885 as part of a collection of local timber species under direction of government botanist ferdinand von mueller collection was displayed in various exhibitions including exposition universelle in paris in 1889 and is housed at melbourne museum cultivation banksia marginata was first introduced into cultivation in england in 1802 and was also listed as b australis b insularis and b marcescens it was grown at kew cambridge botanic gardens woburn abbey and private gardens in chelsea hackney and house one specimen grown in a glasshouse at kew was described as a tree high with a trunk girth of two feet 60 cm at 40 years of age b marginata is generally fairly easy to grow in a well drained sunny or part shaded position in garden it can be leggy in positions or a more compact bushy shrub in full sun some varieties from drier areas seem to do poorly in areas of summer humidity flowers are not prominent unless they are numerous established plants can withstand drought coastal exposure and temperatures as low as propagation of plants can be by seed or cuttings latter is essential if trying to replicate plants of particular habit such as dwarf specimens some banksia marginata seed of subalpine provenance require stratification namely keeping at for 60 days before germination takes place over 6 to 25 days salkin proposed this was necessary so that seed released in a summer or autumn bushfire would lie dormant over winter months before germinating in spring banksia saxicola and banksia canei seed also share this trait some dwarf forms have been commercially available in australian nurseries although some selections do not maintain their dwarf status in cultivation banksia mini marg is a small form selected from northeastern coast of tasmania which reaches high and wide mallacoota dwarf was selected from a natural population at mallacoota victoria alf salkin reported a form from kanangra walls with a peach tinged limb as having horticultural potential as well as a prostrate form from cape in victoria banksia marginata and
