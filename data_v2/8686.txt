lancaster s chevauchee of 1346 was a series of offensives directed by henry earl of lancaster in southwestern france during autumn 1346 as a part of hundred years war year had started with a huge french army under john duke of normandy son and heir of king philip vi besieging strategically important town of aiguillon in gascony lancaster refused battle and harassed french supply lines while preventing aiguillon from being blockaded after a five month siege french were ordered north to confront main english army which on 12 july had landed in normandy under edward iii of england and commenced crecy campaign this left french defences in southwest both weak and disorganised lancaster took advantage by launching offensives into quercy and bazadais and himself leading a third force on a large scale mounted raid a chevauchee between 12 september and 31 october 1346 all three offensives were successful with lancaster s chevauchee of approximately 2 000 english and gascon soldiers meeting no effective resistance from french penetrating north and storming rich city of poitiers his force then burnt and looted large areas of saintonge aunis and poitou capturing numerous towns castles and smaller fortified places as they went offensives completely disrupted french defences and shifted focus of fighting from heart of gascony to or more beyond its borders background since norman conquest of 1066 english monarchs had held titles and lands within france possession of which made them vassals of kings of france by 1337 only gascony in southwestern france and ponthieu in northern france were left independent minded gascons preferred their relationship with a distant english king who left them alone to one with a french king who would interfere in their affairs following a series of disagreements between philip vi of france and edward iii of england on 24 may 1337 philip s great council agreed gascony should be taken back into philip s hands on grounds that edward was in breach of his obligations as a vassal this marked start of hundred years war which was to last 116 years thumb upright 0 75 alt a map of french territory as it was in 1340 showing enclave of gascony in southwest france in 1330 before war commenced well over 1000 ships a year departed from gascony for england among their cargoes were over of locally produced wine duty levied by english crown on wine from bordeaux was more than all other customs duties combined and by far largest source of state income bordeaux capital of gascony had a population of over 50 000 greater than london s and was possibly richer however by this time english gascony had become so truncated by french encroachments that it relied on imports of food largely from england any interruptions to regular shipping were liable to starve gascony and financially cripple england french were well aware of this border between english and french territory in gascony was extremely unclear many landholders owned a patchwork of widely separated estates perhaps owing fealty to a different overlord for each each small estate was likely to have a fortified tower or keep with larger estates having castles fortifications were also constructed at transport choke points to collect tolls and to restrict military passage fortified towns grew up alongside all bridges and most fords over many rivers in region military forces could support themselves by foraging so long as they moved on frequently if they wished to remain in one place for any length of time as was necessary to besiege a castle then access to water transport was essential for supplies of food and fodder and desirable for such items as siege equipment although gascony was cause of war in most campaigning seasons gascons had had to rely on their own resources and had been hard pressed by french in 1339 french besieged bordeaux capital of gascony even breaking into city with a large force before they were repulsed typically gascons could field 3 000 6 000 men large majority infantry although up to two thirds of them would be tied down in garrisons warfare was usually a struggle for possession of castles and other fortified points and for mutable loyalty of local nobility 1345 campaign upright 1 thumb left alt a colourful medieval image of a town under attack by 1345 after eight years of war english controlled territory mostly consisted of a coastal strip from bordeaux to bayonne with isolated strongholds further inland in 1345 edward iii had sent henry earl of lancaster to gascony and had assembled his main army for action in northern france or flanders it had sailed but never landed after fleet was scattered in a storm knowledge of edward iii s intent had kept french focus on north until late in campaigning season meanwhile 1345 campaign he was known as earl of derby but his father died in september 1345 and he became earl of lancaster had led a whirlwind campaign at head of an anglo gascon army he had smashed two large french armies at battles of bergerac and auberoche captured french towns and fortifications in much of perigord and most of agenais and given english possessions in gascony strategic depth during winter following this successful campaign lancaster s second in command ralph earl of stafford had marched on vitally important town of aiguillon which commanded junction of rivers garonne and lot making it important both for trade and for military communications inhabitants had attacked garrison and opened gates to english french offensive john duke of normandy son and heir of philip vi was placed in charge of all french forces in southwest france as he had been previous autumn in march 1346 a french army under duke john numbering between 15 000 and 20 000 enormously superior to any force anglo gascons could field marched on aiguillon and besieged it on 1april on 2april an arriere ban a formal call to arms for all able bodied males was announced for southern france french national financial logistical and manpower efforts were focused on this offensive edward iii again gathered a large army in england french were aware of this but given extreme difficulty of disembarking an army other than at a port english no longer having access to a port in flanders and existence of friendly ports in brittany and gascony they assumed that edward would sail for one of latter probably gascony in order to relieve aiguillon to guard against any possibility of an english landing in northern france philip vi relied on his powerful navy this reliance was misplaced given naval technology of time and french were unable to prevent edward iii successfully crossing channel and landing in cotentin peninsula in northern normandy on 12 july with an army between 12 000 and 15 000 strong english achieved complete strategic surprise and marched south cutting a wide swath of destruction through some of richest lands in france and burning every town they passed philip vi immediately recalled his main army under duke john from gascony after a furious argument with his advisers and according to some accounts his father s messenger duke john refused to move until his honour was satisfied on 29 july philip vi called an arriere ban for northern france at rouen on 7august english reached seine philip vi again sent orders to john of normandy insisting that he abandon siege of aiguillon and march his army north edward iii marched south east and on 12 august his army was from paris on 14 august duke john attempted to arrange a local truce lancaster well aware of situation in north and in french camps around aiguillon refused on 20 august after over five months french abandoned siege and marched away in considerable haste and disorder duke john did not rejoin french army in north until after it had been heavily defeated at battle of crecy six days later anglo gascon offensive alt image of a man dressed in late medieval finery upright 0 75 thumb henry of grosmont earl of lancaster earl of derby withdrawal of duke john s army led to collapse of french positions in southern perigord and most of agenais french only held on to their strongholds in garonne valley port sainte marie agen and downstream of aiguillon english extended their control to include whole of lot valley below villeneuve and most of remaining french outposts between lot and dordogne during late august lancaster was able to capture most towns without a fight john count of armagnac was appointed french royal lieutenant in region after duke john s withdrawal he struggled to provide effective resistance because of lack of troops insufficient funds and repeatedly having his orders countermanded by philip vi he formally offered his resignation within three months of his appointment lancaster now held operational initiative in early september he launched three separate offensives local english sympathisers in agenais under gaillard i de durfort blockaded agen and porte sainte marie and raided into quercy to west a large detachment of gascons was split up to reoccupy french held territory to south and west of garonne under overall command of de caumont in a mopping up operation lancaster took command of 1 000 men at arms and approximately same number of mounted infantry and led them north on 12 september most of this force was gascon force in agenais raided deep into quercy penetrating over gaillard leading 400 cavalry captured small town of tulle this sparked widespread panic in province of auvergne army of john of armagnac was diverted to tulle which it besieged from mid november until late december when gascon occupiers surrendered on terms and were taken prisoner all were ransomed whole french field army of southwest was tied down by gaillard s small force modern historian jonathan sumption describes this as dislocating royal administration in central and southern france for three months troops under caumont swept through bazadais capturing numerous french held towns and fortifications for little or no loss many of these were handed over after negotiations bazas itself for example surrendered after negotiating access for its products through english occupied territory on favourable terms french presence in area was all but extinguished lancaster s chevauchee thumb alt a map of lancaster s route in 1346 lancaster targeted rich provincial capital of poitiers deep in french held territory north of his starting point he marched from garonne to charente in eight days arriving at chateauneuf sur charente which he captured he then diverted to saint jean d angely to rescue some english prisoners saint jean d angely was stormed captured and sacked leaving a garrison lancaster turned back towards poitiers covering 20 miles a day and taking towns of melle and lusignan on way lancaster reached poitiers late on 3october poitiers occupied a naturally strong position but its defences had seen little maintenance for centuries city had no royal garrison and townspeople and local notables had fallen out of habit of maintaining a guard defensive responsibilities were split between town and three different church bodies which had effect of preventing any effective action english launched an immediate assault but they were repulsed by an improvised force organised by some local noblemen during night english found a breach in wall which had been deliberately created years before to allow easy access from city to a nearby watermill in morning they seized it and forced their way into eastern poitiers killing everyone they came across as was usual only those who appeared wealthy enough to afford a ransom were spared most of population fled city but over 600 were killed town was thoroughly sacked for eight days lancaster was unable to take royal mint at montreuil west of poitiers and marched rapidly back to saint jean d angely he made no attempt to hold poitiers in province of poitou he only left troops at lusignan a small town with good walls and a strong modern castle once back in saintonge he took control of valley all way to sea including major port of rochefort and well fortified island of oleron lancaster then marched south taking a large number of small towns and fortifications french were left in control of much of saintonge eastern parts larger fortifications such as province s capital saintes and its strongest castle taillebourg and several strategically important strongholds on east bank of gironde lancaster arrived in bordeaux capital of english gascony on 31 october seven weeks after he set out on his chevauchee he returned to england in early 1347 aftermath lancaster left garrisons in captured towns and castles throughout saintonge and aunis with an especially large garrison at saint jean d angely anglo gascons supported themselves by raiding french held and french leaning territory as sumption puts it they were not so much expected to control territory as to create chaos and insecurity whole provinces securely held by french only months before were overrun by bandits freebooters deserters and retained troops of both sides population moved away from villages to relative safety of towns townsfolk who could moved away from area and much of agricultural land went uncultivated french ability to counter attack was lost as they concentrated on attempting to defend host of newly vulnerable locations or on recovering towns captured deep in what had been considered safe territory as at tulle french trade declined and their taxation income from area was severely curtailed lancaster had moved focus of fighting from heart of gascony to 50 miles or more beyond its borders english army in north after its victory at crecy went on to besiege calais lancaster joined it there in summer of 1347 and was present when calais fell after an eleven month siege securing an english entrepot into northern france which was held for two hundred years war in southwest france stayed far from gascony in 1355 edward iii s eldest son edward black prince led a large scale chevauchee north from bordeaux that devastated france after another devastating chevauchee in 1356 french army commanded by duke john now king john ii of france intercepted it and forced outnumbered english to battle from poitiers french were decisively
