uss kentucky bb 66 was an uncompleted battleship originally intended to be second ship of however urgent need for more warships at outbreak of world war ii and u s navy s experiences in pacific theater led it to conclude that rather than battleships larger and more heavily armed than it quickly needed more fast battleships of that class to escort new s being built as a result hulls bb 65 and bb 66 were reordered and laid down as iowa class battleships in 1942 as such she was intended to be sixth and final member of iowa class constructed at time of her construction she was second ship of united states navy to be named in honor of u s state of kentucky like her sister ship laid down as one of last pair of iowa class ahead of her kentucky was still under construction at end of hostilities and became caught up in post war draw down of armed services her construction was suspended twice during which times she served as a parts hulk in 1950s several proposals were made to complete ship as a guided missile battleship abandoned primarily due to cost concerns and rampant pace of evolving missile technology kentucky ultimately was sold for scrap in 1958 background kentucky was conceived in 1935 when united states navy initiated design studies for creation of an extended that was not restricted by second london naval treaty this resulted in one of fast battleship designs planned in 1938 by preliminary design branch at bureau of construction and repair passage of second vinson act in 1938 had cleared way for construction of four south dakota class battleships and first two iowa class fast battleships those with hull numbers bb 61 and bb 62 latter four battleships of class those designated with hull numbers bb 63 bb 64 bb 65 and bb 66 missouri wisconsin illinois and kentucky respectively were not cleared for construction until 12 july 1940 while bb 63 and bb 64 were originally planned as final ships in iowa class bb 65 and bb 66 were intended to be first ships of montana class which was larger and slower while mounting twelve mark 7 guns hore p 222 however passage of an emergency war building program on 19 july 1940 resulting in illinois and kentucky being re ordered as fifth and sixth ships respectively of in order to save time on construction so first ship of would be reassigned as bb 67 gardiner p 99 johnston pp 108 123 orders for bb 65 and bb 66 were placed on 9 september 1940 and ships were laid down on 6 december 1942 and 7 march 1942 respectively by 1942 united states navy shifted its building focus from battleships to aircraft carriers after successes of carrier combat in both battle of coral sea and to a greater extent battle of midway naval historical center bureau of ships spring styles book 3 1939 1944 naval historical center lot s 511 battleship preliminary design drawings retrieved 1 december 2007 as a result construction of us fleet of s had been given highest priority for completion in us shipyards by us navy essex class carriers were proving vital to war effort by enabling allies to gain and maintain air supremacy in pacific war and were rapidly becoming principal striking arm of united states navy in ongoing effort to defeat empire of japan accordingly united states accepted shortcomings in armor of their s in favor of additional speed which could steam at a comparable speed with essex class and provide carriers with maximum amount of anti aircraft protection as a result construction of was canceled before their keels could be laid construction kentuckys main battery would have consisted of nine 50 cal mark 7 guns which could hurl armor piercing shells some her secondary battery would have consisted of 20 38 cal guns arranged in 10 turrets which could fire at targets up to away with advent of air power and mandate to gain and maintain air superiority came a need to protect growing fleet of allied aircraft carriers to this end kentucky was to be fitted with an array of oerlikon 20 mm and bofors 40 mm anti aircraft guns to defend allied carriers from enemy airstrikes thumb left hull of incomplete kentucky is floated out of drydock in early 1950 to allow to drydock for repairs after she had run aground like iowa class ships from missouri hull number bb 63 onwards frontal bulkhead armor was increased from original to in order to better protect against fire from frontal sectors because iowa class torpedo defense was virtually same as preceding south dakota class battleships it was proposed that and kentuckys hull be redesigned to provide a greater degree of torpedo protection for battleship under original construction schematics for class each side of ship was protected below waterline by two tanks mounted outside belt armor and separated by a bulkhead these tanks were initially planned to be empty but in practice were filled with water or fuel oil armored belt tapered to a thickness of below waterline behind armored belt there was a void and then another bulkhead outer hull was intended to detonate a torpedo with outer two compartments absorbing shock and with any splinters or debris being stopped by armored belt and empty compartment behind it in 1939 navy discovered that this system was less effective than earlier torpedo defense system of north carolina class due to excessive rigidity of lower belt armor causing leakage into adjacent compartments subsequently design of torpedo defense system was modified for illinois and kentucky such as eliminating knuckles along certain holding bulkheads intended construction format was estimated to provide up to 20 improvement to torpedo defense of battleship while simultaneously reducing flooding in event of a torpedo strike kentuckys construction was plagued by suspensions her keel was laid down at norfolk navy yard portsmouth virginia on 7 march 1942 however work on ship was suspended in june that year and kentuckys bottom structure was launched to make room for lst construction on 10 june while her construction was suspended bureau of ships considered an aircraft carrier conversion proposal for kentucky and illinois in aftermath of battles of coral sea and midway as proposed converted kentucky would have had an long by wide flight deck with armament identical to carriers of four twin 5 inch gun mounts and four more 5 inch guns in single mounts along with six 40 mm quadruple mounts idea was abandoned after bureau of ships decided that converted ships would carry fewer aircraft than essex class that more essex class carriers could be built in same amount of time and that conversion project would be significantly more expensive than new instead kentucky and illinois were to be completed as battleships but their construction was given very low priority work on ship resumed on 6 december 1944 when keel structure was returned to slipway work on battleship proceeded at a slow pace and her completion was projected for third quarter of 1946 in december 1945 it was recommended that kentucky be completed as an anti aircraft battleship and work on ship was suspended in august 1946 while this was considered construction resumed again on 17 august 1948 without any decision having been made on her final design work on kentucky continued until 20 january 1950 when it was decided to halt work on ship following this she was floated out of her drydock to clear a space for repairs to sister ship which had run aground en route from hampton roads guided missile battleship as early as 1946 missile conversion projects for kentucky and incomplete large cruiser were discussed in early 1950s advances in guided missile technology led to a proposal to create a large warship armed with both guns and missiles to this end incomplete kentucky was chosen for conversion from an all gun ship into a guided missile battleship this proposal would have been relatively conservative and would have involved installation of a pair of twin arm launchers for rim 2 terrier surface to air missile sam on aft deckhouse with a pair of antennas for associated an apg 55 pulse doppler interception radar installed forward of these and an sps 2b air search radar on a short mast since battleship was already approximately 73 complete construction had been halted at second deck installation of missile system and associated electronics would have involved only adding necessary equipment without any need to rebuild ship to accommodate system some guided missile concepts included one or two launchers for eight regulus ii or ssm n 2 triton nuclear cruise missiles friedman p 398 399 guided missile battleship project was authorized in 1954 and kentucky was renumbered from bb 66 to bbg 1 with conversion due to be complete in 1956 however project was soon cancelled with conversion ideas transferred to a smaller platform that led to guided missile cruiser these partial conversions of two heavy cruisers proved only partially successful in their new role as pace of change in cruise missile technology rendered their new weapons systems obsolete while their remaining heavy guns proved in demand another conversion project in early 1956 called for installation of two polaris nuclear ballistic missile launchers with a capacity for sixteen weapons also proposed were four rim 8 talos sam launchers with eighty missiles per launcher and twelve rim 24 tartar sam launchers with 504 missiles a july 1956 estimate projected completing ship by july 1961 but cost of conversion ultimately forced navy to abandon project fate thumb bow of kentucky transported in one
