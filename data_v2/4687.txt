earl by his son thomas coke s main legacy is as an agricultural reformer not as a politician he has historically been credited with sparking british agricultural revolution through reforms he made to farming on his estates later historians have questioned this however noting that developments credited to him are most likely work of other individuals nevertheless he has still been described as real hero of norfolk agriculture early life and education coke was born on 6 may 1754 in london to wenman coke originally wenman roberts and elizabeth cokes were a landowning family of derbyshire

whig amiable in his disposition mild in his manners he was beloved of his friends martins 2009 p 10 family s prospects improved significantly in 1759 when coke was five when his uncle thomas coke 1st earl of leicester died cause of thomas s death is not certain although there are chances it was a duel but result was that upon death of thomas s wife margaret wenman would inherit substantial norfolk estate including holkham hall a palladian masterpiece margaret avoided rest of family vowing to outlive wenman simply to ensure that he did not inherit estate martins 2009 p 11 in event she died in

on one occasion 70 snipes he had killed were found in his room and on another he narrowly avoiding being punished for shooting a pheasant in windsor park he was not particularly interested in his academic studies but by time he left eton in 1771 coke had developed a close circle of friends and connections from landowning class and practical skills to deal with his future estates martins 2009 p

parliament with his father elected coke travelled with him to london meeting members of british high society his sister elizabeth and her husband james dutton were also visiting with dutton s sister jane and coke fell in love with her wenman was not impressed when coke asked him to let them be married as he had picked out daughter of a baronet for his son but with intercession of wenman s friend harbord harbord he finally consented to their marriage which occurred on 5 october 1775 martins 2009 pp 24 25 new couple lived in godwick manor their peace disturbed in 1776 when wenman s health began to fail he finally died on 10 april after a constipation which medicine could not remove leaving coke in charge of a 30 000 acre estate at age of 22 soon after his father s death harbord and other senior whigs visited coke and asked him to stand for norfolk in his father s stead coke was not enthusiastic not seeing himself as a politician and hoping to enjoy his new estates and wealth but after his visitors pointed out a tory might otherwise replace him my blood chilled all over me from my head to my foot and i came forward on 12 april he issued a manifesto to norfolk electorate soon returning to campaign and after being unanimously nominated on 27 april he was elected in may martins 2009 pp 29 31 entry to parliament thumb right william windham coke s friend and supporter during american revolutionary war little is known of coke s early career in parliament he spoke relatively infrequently and parliamentary session was dissolved soon after his election during that summer however he struck up a relationship with charles james fox a soon to be famous whig politician noted for his outspoken and flamboyant lifestyle coke later recounted that when i first went into parliament i attached myself to fox and clung to him through life i lived in closest bond of friendship with him period was one of economic stability and political calm under lord north which ended due to american revolution and resulting american revolutionary war coke was noted for his support of american colonists as a strong supporter of 1688 glorious revolution and resulting bill of rights 1689 he felt that support of espoused principles of justice and tolerance in britain and overseas was his duty as a british subject and saw no conflict between his position as a supporter of colonists and his patriotism following battles of saratoga it became clear that any victory in america would be long and expensive and in an attempt to raise funds king george iii asked subjects to donate in norwich a meeting was held in january 1778 for this purpose it raised ps4 500 in less than an hour windham and coke attended this meeting windham making an impassioned speech pointing out that campaign had so far resulted only in disappointment shame and dishonour and that peace and reconciliation with america was only option martins 2009 p 35 windham coke and their supporters then withdrew to a nearby pub where they drafted a petition to king from nobility gentry clergy freeholders and inhabitants of county of norfolk this was presented to parliament by coke on 17 february 1778 signed by 5 400 people from norfolk george iii took this as a personal insult and as a result disliked coke until his death martins 2009 p 36 coke also brought up issue of hunting game during late 18th century a series of laws were passed protecting a landowner s right to hunt and giving severe penalties to poachers on 27 february coke an enthusiastic hunter suggested in parliament that these laws be relaxed combinations had been formed in country against execution of these laws and some lives had been lost before any motion could be brought it was not until 1827 that laws were revised situation in america came up again on 22 february henry seymour conway brought a motion asking king to listen to humble prayer and advice of his faithful commons that war on continent of north america may no longer be pursued for impractical purpose of reducing inhabitants of that country to obedience by force while motion failed it was again brought on 27 february and passed with this conway moved that an humble address be presented to his majesty george iii replied that he would see them on 3 march at st james s palace it was then that most important and symbolic act of coke s political career occurred martins 2009 p 38 as a knight of shire coke had right to appear in court dressed in his boots as opposed to in formal court dress this he did appearing in front of george iii dressed in leather breeches boots and spurs martins 2009 p 39 eventually king began negotiations with american colonies and accepted resignation of lord north an action which would eventually lead to coke leaving parliament a new government was formed in april 1782 with lord rockingham as prime minister and fox and lord shelburne as secretaries of state rockingham and shelburne disagreed constantly particularly over situation in north america and with rockingham s death on 1 july shelburne was made prime minister at this rest of government resigned and after a period of political chaos short lived fox north coalition was formed in april 1783 coke was disgusted by this arrangement describing it as a revolting compact an east india bill which created 7 commissioners to oversee india brought chaos to coalition controversially commissioners would be appointed by government not by crown which challenged what king saw as his constitutional right defeated in house of lords bill was used by george iii to overturn fox s government and install a government led by william pitt younger martins 2009 p 41 parliament was eventually dissolved on 25 march 1784 and thanks to coke s long standing support of fox and his actions ensuing general election led to coke losing his seat martins 2009 p 42 norfolk work thumb left humphry repton who coke employed to modify grounds at holkham hall in between his parliamentary work coke and his wife had been maintaining and improving his estates since they took possession of it in april 1776 cornerstone was holkham house a temple to arts built by coke s great uncle knowing that he did not have same understanding of classical architecture and art coke mainly left it alone instead focusing on park and gardens martins 2009 p 45 grounds had been laid out during 1720s and 1730s in a design which quickly became seen as old fashioned coke had lake massively expanded shifting a total of 36 000 cubic yards of earth and employed gardener john sandys from 1781 sandys created several large pieces of woodland planting over 7 000 trees in 22 acres near eastern lodge another ten acres near lake and four acres on marshland in 1784 a further woodland expansion was undertaken with 40 acres and 11 000 trees and between 1785 and 1789 396 750 trees were planted on a further 179 acres he retired in 1805 and was replaced a year later by james loose but continued to advise coke on forestry matters martins 2009 p 47 library was also expanded through work of william roscoe who bought books including mainz psalter for coke between 1814 and 1842 skeat 1952 p 24 coke also expanded estate itself incorporating farms around house as their leases ended and by 1800 estate covered 3 500 acres samuel wyatt was also employed from 1799 to 1805 to build new lodges at entrance of extended estate and until 1806 also worked on a new kitchen garden this covered six acres humphry repton was employed to extend lake yet again and proposed building a boathouse and fishing pavilion as well as a chain ferry leading to a snug thatched cottage there is no evidence this proposal was ever approved martins 2009 p 50 most of work was completed by 1810 and from then on coke s attention turned to hunting game estate was explicitly designed with that in mind and game books note between 1 300 and 2 500 partridges killed most years in 1822 elizabeth coke s daughter recorded that 800 birds were shot in one day martins 2009 p 52 thumb daughter jane coke jane dutton coke s wife gave birth to their first child in 1777 a daughter named jane two more daughters followed anne margaret in 1779 and elizabeth in 1795 before jane s death in 1800 jane was married to charles nevison howard viscount andover on 21 june 1796 but on 11 january 1800 andover died in a shooting accident on holkham estate jane remarried to henry digby in 1806 and they had 11 children martins 2009 p 68 landlord and agriculturalist as a landlord coke was a firm believer in right and moral obligation of a landowner to improve quality of life of those living on his estates roles of landlord and tenant were clearly set out by late 18th century landlord was to provide fields roads and buildings while tenant would provide seed implements and manual labour martins 2009 p 81 coke s estate included 54 farms when he inherited it with excellent farm output there were however significant debts as a result of his uncle s work on holkham hall with interest alone being ps4 000 a year he had some difficulties dealing with people employed before he inherited estates and when steward ralph cauldwell appointed by coke s uncle retired in 1782 coke failed to replace him until 1816 this replacement was francis blaikie a scottish man who had previously been employed as estate steward for lord chesterfield blaikie paid close attention to where farms were doing badly or could do better but often struggled to deal with coke martins 2009 p 87 coke lacked financial sense in matters other than agricultural on one occasion selling all his land near manchester it wasn t until 20 years later that blaikie became aware of this after receiving a query from new owners about mineral rights blaikie travelled to manchester to meet solicitor who had handled sale finding not only poorly drafted conveyances but that all sold land had been rich in coal martins 2009 p 88 in early 18th century farmland was run through an open field system which were commonly overstocked and made trying experimental methods very difficult enclosed farms on other hand were higher quality and useful for experimentation with result that they commanded a rent almost double a similarly sized open field compounding this problem many of enclosures were split up into strips with result that ownership was unclear between 1776 and 1816 coke rapidly bought strips of land near his estates and had them enclosed much of this came during napoleonic wars where grain prices and therefore farming profits peaked martins 2009 p 92 coke was influenced by turnip townshend who had owned a nearby estate who promoted crop rotation and farm improvement along with enclosure marling and improved grasses townshend s improvements resulted in a course of husbandry utterly unlike that practised a hundred years ago martins 2009 p 108 thumb right english leicester a breed of sheep coke introduced into norfolk and cross bred with native norfolk horn coke s big improvements came in two areas grasses and husbandry he pioneered use of and lucerne as grass and feed respectively with result that by 1793 he was claiming to have 2 400 sheep in holkham as opposed to 700 kept when he inherited estates husbandry involved milking comparisons of various types of cow along with first planting of scottish turnips which are a good table vegetable being more palatable and nutritious and not so watery as norfolk variety martins 2009 p 110 his prime area of experimentation was on selective breeding for sheep most common sheep in area was norfolk horn which was long legged and slow to mature coke became a promoter of english leicester a breed noted as fast maturing and excellent when fed turnips coke cross bred two with resulting sheep being highly tame and superior to pure norfolk breed martins 2009 p 111 coke also bred cattle and used oxen for ploughing rather than horse being first to use them harnessed rather than yoked and winning a prize for his oxen in 1837 martins 2009 p 114 through sheep shearings competitions and his contacts within nobility coke soon spread his new ideas and breeds initially small events of local farmers shearings soon became 200 person formal dinners rising to 300 people in 1821 and 700 soon after with even american ambassador richard rush attending in 1819 along with french consul and duke of sussex martins 2009 p 117 board of agriculture was formed in 1793 with coke sitting as one of 30 ordinary members as a leading agriculturalist he was made vice president in 1805 board published a series of county reports for most of united kingdom describing new farming measures being undertaken in various parts of country martins 2009 p 124 coke has been described as real hero of norfolk agriculture despite fact that his land was so poor one critic is said to have remarked that thin sandy soil must be ploughed by rabbits yoked to a pocket knife riches 1967 p 33 however academics and writers dispute his importance 19th and early 20th century historians held him to be crucial figure of british agricultural revolution crediting him with inventing four crop rotation mitchell 2010 p 27 naomi riches describes this as an error riches 1967 p 7 and r a c parker writing in economic history review states that many of innovations he is supposed to have introduced should be attributed to his predecessors in norfolk however that is not to deny substantial contribution of coke himself to advance of farming technique in england parker 1955 p 165 further parliamentary career thumb left coke in 1817 coke was re elected to parliament in 1790 at a time of great political trouble french revolution a year earlier had torn whig party in half with coke and fox in isolated minority who supported revolutionaries as their acts became more brutal with declaration of war in 1793 an impact was finally felt in britain with a rise in agricultural prices and rent it also led to establishment of local yeomanry forces to defend country something coke opposed this reduced his popularity in norfolk and led to suspicions he might be a jacobin to point where he was forced to publicly declare that he was not a republican and detested their principles martins 2009 p 73 eventually late september 1798 he raised holkham yeoman cavalry commanding it as a major to defend against any invasion this unit was dissolved in 1802 with peace of amiens but after war broke out again a year later more volunteer regiments were formed coke was notably absent from any preparations for defence feeling that risks of invasion were exaggerated but was eventually persuaded by public opinion to reform yeoman cavalry in 1803 it was again dissolved in 1805 martins 2009 pp 74 75 french revolution had split whigs into two factions but as it progressed fox s group in support of revolutionaries began to dwindle coke stuck by fox and with outbreak of war split became finalised fox refused to accept that britain need be involved in conflict as did coke in parliament coke spoke out against conflict debating motion to raise money for war through a new tax in april 1794 and supporting wilberforce s anti war motion on 24 march 1795 martins 2009 p 130 he felt more comfortable with local matters however and his main concerns were those of agricultural interest arguing against a new land tax and introducing a bill to shorten shooting season allowing for production of more corn coke was again returned to parliament in 1796 despite an anti war and anti government address to electorate which was condemned as arrogant and dictatorial but found on his return that had agreed to withdraw from parliamentary activity martins 2009 p 131 after parliament was dissolved in june 1802 another election saw coke again returned although in a contested election that cost candidates ps35 000 martins 2009 p 133 with death of william pitt in 1806 two whig groups agreed to an alliance which took form of ministry of all talents fox was confirmed as foreign secretary and windham as secretary for war and colonies government apparently offered coke a peerage which he refused and primarily focused on abolition of slavery which was accomplished only after death of fox on 13 september 1806 fox s death made parliament lose some of its appeal to coke as they had been close friends martins 2009 p 135 his attendance in next two years was very limited and next occasion of note was his support of corn laws which were highly unpopular in norfolk and led to him being physically attacked by a mob in 1815 martins 2009 p 140 with defeat of napoleon at battle of waterloo wars in europe ended and troops returned home as a result nation underwent dramatic shifts due to rising unemployment as economy shifted and government began to pay off its debts incurred during 20 years of war agricultural prices slumped and coke became active in opposing tax increases which would impact on farmers in february 1816 he spoke out against income and malt tax and in march attacked property tax as utterly at variance with civil liberty an opponent of government excess in a time of unemployment and high taxation he also voted against army estimates and opposed civil list in may with a county meeting on 5 april 1817 coke spoke on king s intent on overturning democracy and enslaving country by restricting freedom of speech and press suggesting that government needed to be removed martins 2009 p 142 returning to parliament in 1818 he argued against royal households bill and introduced a game law amendment bill which was defeated following peterloo massacre and government s introduction of a seditious meetings prevention bill coke accused government of being most strongly implicated in events in manchester saying that meeting would have been peaceful had it not been interfered with by officious agents of authority martins 2009 p 143 1820s saw coke speak far less firstly because of continued tory domination of parliament and secondly because of his remarriage in 1822 at age of 68 and after 21 years as a widower he married anne keppel daughter of lord albemarle and coke s 18 year old godchild anne had initially been brought to holkham to partner with his nephew william who due to coke s lack of sons would inherit estate but they failed to get on anne and coke s marriage was met with bemusement and described as absurd but despite opposition took place on 26 february soon after wedding anne became pregnant and their son thomas was born on 22 december martins 2009 p 177 in 1831 coke s personal friend earl grey became prime minister as a result coke s appearances in parliament became more regular he expressed delight at great reform act 1832 although he only spoke on subject once and chose its passage on 4 june 1832 as appropriate moment to retire as an mp martins 2009 p 149 as greatest commoner in england coke finally accepted a peerage in july 1837 having been offered one six times before becoming earl of leicester he took no pleasure in attending house of lords however describing it as hospital for incurables martins 2009 p 180 death thumb coke monument holkham hall coke remained in prime of life after his retirement records show him killing 24 deer with 25 shots at age of 79 and having another child three years later a portrait painted of him which appears to be of a man 20 years younger is according to stirling no flattering likeness but instead completely accurate stirling 2008 p 455 after a short and painful illness while visiting his estate and childhood home at longford hall derbyshire coke died in early hours of 30 june 1842 at age of 88 his last words were reported to be well perhaps i have talked too much stirling 2008 p 479 body lay in state for two days with funeral procession finally setting out on 7 july it travelled through king s lynn where black flags of mourning were flown and thousands came to pay their respects on final leg of journey with a funeral procession two miles in length led by 150 holkham tenants on horseback and followed by several hundreds of private carriages 200 gentlemen on horseback riding two abreast and lastly a long train of neighbours tenants and yeomen coke was eventually buried at family mausoleum in tittleshall on 11 july stirling 2008 pp 480 482 immediately after coke s death a committee formed to create a monument to him over a thousand subscribers contributed ps5 000 eventual coke monument found in grounds of holkham hall was designed by
