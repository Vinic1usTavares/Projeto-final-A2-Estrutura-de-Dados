connecticut when troops landed patriot messengers were dispatched to warn danbury and local militia leaders of movements major general david wooster and brigadier general benedict arnold were in new

had only reached bethel connecticut about short of danbury their gunpowder was wet making battle impossible so they spent night there rather than pressing on to danbury bailey 1896 p 63 ridgefield

around dawn and marched south toward village of ridgefield in an attempt to avoid general wooster s force hoping to delay general tryon until overwhelming reinforcements arrived general wooster split his force main body about 400 men went with generals arnold and silliman across countryside to ridgefield where they were met by another 100 militiamen and erected crude barricades on road through town general wooster personally chased after british column with remaining 200 his effort was assisted by local patriots who created impediments before british column including destruction of at least one bridge bailey 1896 p 75 taking advantage of element of surprise wooster engaged tryon s rear guard as it paused for breakfast about north of town of ridgefield killing at least two british soldiers wooster took about forty prisoners in this first engagement and then retreated for cover in nearby woods he struck again an hour later but british were more prepared for a second engagement

boys never mind such random shots about from ridgefield s town center his inexperienced militia dissolved in confusion burr 1906 p 147 wooster died five days later in danbury at home of nehemiah dibble whose house had also served as general tryon s temporary quarters in danbury wooster s last words were reported to be i am dying but with a strong hope and persuasion that my country will gain her independence wooster s harassment of british column had provided enough time for arnold and silliman to prepare a crude defensive position at ridgefield martin 1997 p 319 british column arrived at base of arnold s barricade at northern end of ridgefield s town center sometime after noon following an hour long artillery barrage of barricade tryon dispatched flanking parties to test both sides of american position having anticipated this move general silliman posted forces at both flanks that blunted initial thrusts outnumbering patriot forces by more than three to one tryon chose to advance on all three fronts including a 600 man column under covering artillery fire against barricade itself under leadership of general erskine tryon directed general agnew to send out flankers whose enfilading fire helped breach barricade british then pursued patriot forces in a running battle length of town street and gained control of town with 12 dead and 24 wounded americans withdrew under general arnold s orders after barricade was breached arnold was positioned between his men and an advancing enemy platoon when his horse was struck by nine musket shots horse went down and arnold was pinned and tangled in its trappings bailey 1896 p 81 a british soldier charged him shouting for arnold to surrender arnold shouted not yet and shot and killed soldier he then ran off with his troops with a slightly injured leg this entire engagement took around fifteen minutes bailey 1896 p 78 british return to fleet after encamping for night just south of ridgefield british forces departed next morning leaving six houses and episcopal church a patriot supply depot and field hospital in flames during night militia had regrouped under command of continental army colonel jedediah huntington and were expanded to about 500 men by arrival of more militia from connecticut as well as a militia force from neighboring dutchess county new york led by colonel henry ludington this force engaged in a

company of continental artillery led by colonel john lamb arnold adopted a strong position on compo hill that commanded roads leading across saugatuck river toward beach and waited for british to arrive tryon s force forded saugatuck river well above arnold s position this prompted arnold and chasing militia now led by general silliman to attempt an entrapment of british before they reached beach however british column moving at full speed was able to gain high ground and was joined by some fresh marines landed from ships to provide cover for embarkation arnold then prepared his force to attack british but a well timed bayonet charge by erskine s men broke formation in spite of determined action by lamb s artillery and arnold s attempts to rally troops during skirmish arnold had a second horse shot out under him and lamb was injured british successfully embarked and sailed for new york official british report listed 26 killed 117 wounded and 29 missing beatson 1804 p 73

about 20 killed with between 40 and 80 wounded ward 1952 p 495 although british claimed in their reports that more than 100 americans were killed and over 250 were wounded they also incorrectly reported that colonel lamb was killed his injuries were severe enough that he appeared to be dead on field beatson 1804 p 72 aftermath although tryon s raid on danbury and actions in ridgefield were tactical british successes resistance by american forces and a consequent rise in american military enrollments in area deterred british from ever again attempting a landing by ship to attack inland colonial strongholds during war british also would never again conduct inland operations in connecticut despite western connecticut s strategic importance in securing hudson river valley 100px thumb

state s general assembly in 1787 which resulted in awarding of land in ohio country that now includes sandusky ohio bailey 1896 pp 91 93 raid increased support in area for patriot cause thus negating

for patriot cause before battle an exhausted messenger arrived at ludington house to inform them of british advance on danbury and she volunteered to ride throughout county to round up local militia
