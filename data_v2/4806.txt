beat and that timbaland fully phones it in while noting song follows same blueprint of nelly furtado s promiscuous sal cinquemani of slant magazine said it was a satisfying pop romp and said even though hilson lacked furtado s distinctiveness that it shouldn t have a problem striking a chord at radio nick levine of digital spy said song was a perfectly decent slice of midtempo timba pop but it s not really in same league as brilliant way i are mtv buzzworthy said slightly less out there are beats which sound an awful lot like hilson and timbaland s first collaboration way i are and cameo from timba himself sophie bruce of bbc music thought that song lacked a catchy hook such as in way i are less than impressed with timbaland s rapping and less than sexy vocal appeal jon caramanica of
