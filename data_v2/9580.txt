melody is played line by line as a by oboe embellished and in a dancing 6 4 time instead of 4 4 first interval in voices and continuo is same as in chorale countersubject is inversion of theme in german reflection in a mirror it reflects theme as human mercy should reflect divine mercy john eliot gardiner who conducted bach cantata pilgrimage with monteverdi choir in 2000 comments in his diary of project cast as a siciliano for soprano and tenor with cello continuo there is a warm glow to this opening duet with trills on each of main beats to signify flickering flame of love and a plea to come melt my heart agricola s chorale tune is meanwhile intoned by a clarino hovering above two amorous vocal lines 2 alto recitative you hearts which have changed yourselves into rocks and stones is first accompanied by strings but ends as an arioso with continuo 3 alto aria be inspired at present time shows richest instrumentation with figurative oboe solos 4 bass recitative self love flatters itself is accompanied only by continuo 5 text of bass aria with continuo this is christian s art summarizes all injunctions in one long sentence but bach splits it in parts all introduced by keywords bass as voice of christ delivers sermon in leipzig continuo of cello and bass in octaves was doubled by strings another octave higher gardiner admires bach s treatment as a gentle way he portrays rhetorical displays of a pompous preacher 6 closing chorale i call to you lord jesus christ summarizes topic of cantata to love and serve neighbour it is illuminated by a soaring violin as a fifth part similar to treatment in cantata for pentecost previous year reception musicologist isoyama summarizes we are bound to admire emotional wealth with which bach s music infuses poetry in that it
