album more conducive to dynamic live performance in 1988 public enemy released their second album it takes a nation of millions to hold us back to critical and commercial success their music s dense textures provided by group s production team bomb squad exemplified a new production aesthetic in hip hop myrie 2008 p 131 controversial politically charged lyrics by group s lead rapper chuck d whose braggadocio raps contained references to political figures such as shakur and nelson mandela as well as endorsements of nation of islam leader louis farrakhan intensified group s affiliation with black nationalism and farrakhan it takes a nations success helped raise hip hop s profile as both art and sociopolitical statement amid media criticism of genre reeves 2009 p 76 it helped give hip hop a critical credibility and standing in popular music community after it had been largely dismissed as a fad since its introduction at turn of 1980s in promoting record public enemy expanded their live shows and performing dynamic with album s content and group s rage filled showmanship in concert they became vanguard of a movement in hip hop that reflected a new black consciousness and socio political dynamic that were taking shape in america at time reeves 2009 p 73 in may 1989 chuck d bomb squad producer hank shocklee and publicist bill stepheny were negotiating with several labels for a production deal from a major record company their goal since starting public enemy in early 1980s as they were in negotiations group member professor griff made anti semitic remarks in an interview with washington times in which he said that jews were cause of majority of wickedness in world public enemy received media scrutiny and criticism from religious organizations and liberal rock critics which added to charges against group s politics being racist homophobic and misogynistic mark dery et al forman neal 2004 p 473 amid controversy chuck d was given an ultimatum by and stepheny to dismiss griff from group or production deal would fall through he fired griff in june but he later rejoined and has since denied holding anti semitic views and apologized for remarks several people who had worked with public enemy expressed concern about chuck d s leadership abilities and role as a social spokesman def jam director of publicity bill adler later said that controversy partly fueled writing of album to follow up it takes a nation of millions to hold us back group sought to make a more thematically focused work and to condense dr frances cress welsing s theory of color confrontation and racism white supremacy into an album length recording according to chuck d this involved telling people well color s an issue created and concocted to take advantage of people of various characteristics with benefit of a few he recalled their concept for album in an interview with billboard we wanted really to go with a deep complex album more conducive to high and lows of great stage performance chuck d also cited commercial circumstances for hip hop at time having quickly transitioned from a singles to an album medium in music industry during 1980s in an interview for westword he later said we understood magnitude of what an album was so we set out to make something that not only epitomized standard of an album but would stand test of time by being diverse with sounds and textures and also being able to home in on aspect of peaks and valleys recording and production fear of a black planet was recorded in sessions held during june to october 1989 at greene st recording in new york city music palace in west hempstead and spectrum city studios in hempstead it was produced entirely by bomb squad which included chuck d eric vietnam sadler and brothers hank and keith shocklee sessions marked first time that keith was credited as a member of team myrie 2008 p 150 playing a significant role in composing main tracks and music for album hank shocklee directed them and was referred to by chuck d as phil spector of hip hop for fear of a black planet they sought to expand on dense sample layered wall of noise production of it takes a nation of millions to hold us back bomb squad worked out an elaborate method that involved members assembling different types of sounds in studio they reconfigured and recontextualized fragments from various sources into their own compositions each member brought a different philosophy to composing arranging sounds and working with technology while sampled material was taken from singles lp albums and radio among other sources hank shocklee called group a production assembly line where each person had their own particular specialty shocklee came from a dj s perspective eric sadler is coming from a musician s perspective so together you know we started working out different ideas sadler advocated a more traditional structured approach to songwriting while shocklee s approach was more experimental as main lyricist chuck d wanted to sampled material into his lyrics and create a theme bomb squad listened to various music records and used devices such as e mu sp 1200 drum machine and sampler akai sampler and a macintosh computer to arrange samples and sequence tracks mark dery et al forman neal 2004 p 479 sessions which were recorded by shocklee for future reference had group playing beats and records while collecting potential sample material chuck d has said that 95 percent of time it sounded like mess but there was 5 percent of magic that would happen shocklee compared their production to filmmaking with different lighting effects or film speeds or whatever while chuck d likened their efforts to blend sounds to an artist creating green from yellow and blue he said of their approach in a 1990 interview for keyboard we approach every record like it was a painting sometimes on sound sheet we have to have a separate sheet just to list samples for each track we used about 150 maybe 200 samples on fear of a black planet thumb left an e mu sp 1200 drum machine and sampler one of devices used by bomb squad for album instead of selecting from numerous basic backing tracks sadler had collected before sessions chuck d had production team improvise beats in studio this led to much of fear of a black planets music being composed on spot myrie 2008 p 146 chuck d spent hours listening to various tapes music records and other audio sources in search of samples for album shocklee said when you re talking about kind of sampling that public enemy did we had to comb through thousands of records to come up with maybe five good pieces and as we started putting together those pieces sound got a lot more dense to synchronize samples bomb squad used and arranged and overdubbed parts of backing tracks which had been inspected by members for snare bass and hi hat sounds chuck d said our music is all about samples in right area layers that pile on each other we put loops on top of loops on top of loops but then in mix we cut things away their production was innovative according to journalist jeff chang they re figuring out how to jam with samples and to create these layers of sound chang said i don t think it s been matched since then after tracks were completed bomb squad began sequencing what was at first a seemingly discontinuous album amid internal disputes final mixing took place at greene st recording and lasted until february 1990 according to sadler a lot of people were like wow it s a brilliant album but it really shoulda been much better if we had more time and we didn t have to deal with situation of nobody talking fear of a black planet was conceived during golden age of hip hop a period roughly between 1987 and 1992 when artists took advantage of emerging sampling technology before record labels and lawyers took notice accordingly public enemy were not compelled to obtain sample clearance for album this preceded legal limits and clearance costs later placed on sampling which limited hip hop production and complexity of its musical arrangements in an interview with stay free chuck d said public enemy s music was affected more than anybody s because we were taking thousands of sounds if you separated sounds they wouldn t have been anything they were unrecognizable sounds were all collaged together to make a sonic wall an analysis by law professors peter and kembrew mcleod estimated that under sample clearance system that developed after album s release public enemy were to lose at least five dollars per copy if they were to clear album s samples at 2010 rates a loss of five million dollars on a platinum record for track burn hollywood burn chuck d dealt with clearance issues from different record labels to collaborate with rappers big daddy kane and ice cube who had been pursuing bomb squad to produce his debut album recording marked one of first times in which mcs from different rap crews collaborated and it led to bomb squad working with ice cube on his 1990 debut album s most wanted myrie 2008 p 151 152 for album s artwork public enemy enlisted b e johnson a nasa illustrator his design illustrated chuck d s concept of two planets black planet and earth eclipsing cey adams creative director for def jam at time said it was so interesting to me that a black hip hop act did an illustration for their album cover at that time black hip hop artists for most part had photos of themselves on their covers but this was first time someone took a chance to do something in rock n roll vein musical style fear of a black planets music features assemblage compositions that draw on numerous sources production s musique concrete influenced approach reflects political and confrontational tones of group s lyrics with sound collages that feature varying rhythms aliased or scratchy samples media sound bites and eccentric music loops mark dery et al forman neal 2004 p 471 recordings sampled for fear of a black planet include those from funk soul rock and hip hop genres elements such as choruses guitar sounds or vocals from sampled recordings are reappropriated as riffs in songs on album while sampled dialogue from speeches is incorporated to support chuck d s arguments and commentary on certain songs bomb squad s hank shocklee compared their produced sounds surrounding chuck d s rhythmic baritone voice to putting voice of god in a storm according to greenwood encyclopedia of african american folklore 2006 fear of a black planet introduced a production style that borrowed elements from jazz especially that of john coltrane to craft a soundscape that was more challenging than that of their previous two albums but still complemented complex social commentary journalist kembrew mcleod called music both agitprop and pop mixing politics with live wire thrill of popular music experience adding that bomb squad took sampling to level of high art while keeping intact hip hop s populist heart they would graft together dozens of fragmentary samples to create a single song collage simon reynolds said it was a work of unprecedented density for hip hop its claustrophobic backs against wall feel harking back to sly stone s there s a riot goin on or even miles davis on corner some tracks used elements from public enemy s previous material which pete watrous of new york times interpreted as a dual reference to hip hop tradition and history of group watrous described music as sound of urban alienation where silence doesn t exist and sensory stimulation is oppressive and predatory and writes that its dense textures envelop chuck d s voice and make his rapping sound as if it is under duress as if he were fighting against a background intent on taking him over layer after layer of sounds are placed on top of each other until music becomes nearly tactile chuck d called fear of a black planet a record entirely of found sounds probably most elaborate smorgasbord of sound that we did when we put together our music we try to put together layers that complement each other and then voice tries to complement that and theme tries to complement that and then song itself tries to complement album as a whole fitting into overall context in his essay on hip hop aesthetics richard schur interpreted such layering as a motif in hip hop and as process by which new meanings are created and communicated primarily to an equally knowledgeable audience concluding that public enemy probably took ideal of layering to its farthest point themes fear of a black planet contains themes of organization and empowerment within african american community reeves 2009 p 85 and of confrontation santoro 1995 p 124 chuck d s critical lyrics on album interspersed with surrealism of flavor flav also concern contemporary black life state of race relations and criticisms of institutional racism white supremacy and power elite greg sandow called chuck d s language strong and elusive often fragmentary and embedded with critical sometimes brutal thoughts although he viewed that some people might disagree with some of these ideas sandow wrote that it s hard to dispute lyrics assertion that many whites are afraid of blacks adding that album touches on idea of an age when whites understand that they re a minority in world robert hilburn believed that songs decried what chuck d saw as consequences of white european cultural domination in united states and throughout much of world sputnikmusic s nick butler observed two recurring themes inter racial relationships and racism inherent in american media in his book somebody scream rap music s rise to prominence in aftershock of black power marcus reeves said that fear of a black planet was as much a musical assault on america s racism as it was a call to blacks to effectively react to it according to greg kot album was hardly a black power manifesto for world domination but a statement about racial paranoia though he spares virtually no one with his withering raps public enemy s chuck d is harshest of all on his fellow blacks expounding on everything from history to fashion use your brain instead of a gun drugs are death know your past so you won t screw up future gold chains worn around neck demean brotherhood in south africa kot wrote of chuck d s perspective and theme of fear it s fear that divides us he says understand me better and you won t run fear of a black planet is about achieving that understanding but on public enemy s terms in presenting their view of life from an afro centric as opposed to euro centric perspective p e challenges listeners to step into their world songs opening track contract on world love jam is a sound collage made up of samples scratch cuts jenkins 2002 p 128 and snippets recorded by chuck d from radio stations and sound bites of interviews and commercials tension building track introduces album s dense sample based production according to chuck d song features about forty five to fifty sampled voices that interweave as part of an assertive sonic collage and underscore album s themes incident at 66 6 fm another collage that segues into welcome to terrordome contains snippets from a radio call in show interview of chuck d and alludes to media persecution perceived by public enemy burn hollywood burn use of black stereotypes in movies and who stole soul condemns record industry s exploitation of black recording artists and calls for reparations revolutionary generation celebrates strength and endurance of black women with lyrics related to black feminism an unfamiliar topic in hip hop it also addresses sexism within black community and misogyny in hip hop culture title track discusses racial classification and root of white fear of african americans particularly racist concerns by some whites over effect of miscegenation in song chuck d argues that they should not worry as original man was black and white comes from black no need to be confused song features a vocal sample of comedian and activist dick gregory black man black woman black baby white man black woman black baby pollywanacraka also concerns interracial relations including blacks who leave their communities to marry wealthy whites and societal views of matter this system had no wisdom devil split us in pairs and taught us white is good black is bad and black and white is still too bad meet g that killed me features homophobic etiology and condemns homosexuality man to man i don t know if they can from

unity among african americans with chuck d preaching brothers that try to work it out they get mad revolt revise realize they re superbad small chance a smart brother s gonna be a victim of his own circumstance 1992 p 55 richard harrington of washington post writes that songs such as war at 33 1 3 and fight power may sound like a call to ohms and arms but they are really a call to action turn us loose and we shall overcome a message to conscience and a plea for unity move as team never move alone both cautionary advice and game plan war at 33 1 3 has a theme of resistance and a 128 bpm tempo

wrote most of song trying to adapt isley brothers fight power to a modernist perspective myrie 2008 p 122 song s third verse contains disparaging lyrics about popular american icons elvis presley and john wayne myrie 2008 p 124 as chuck d rhymes elvis was a hero to most but he never meant shit to me straight up racist sucker was simple and plain with flavor flav following him and john wayne myrie 2008 p 123 lyrics were shocking and offensive to many listeners upon single s release chuck d s lyrics express identification of presley with racism either personally or symbolically and largely held notion among blacks that presley whose musical and visual performances owed much to african american sources unfairly achieved cultural acknowledgment and commercial success largely denied his black peers in rock and roll line regarding john wayne refers to his controversial personal views including racist remarks made in his 1971 interview for playboy fight power has since become group s best

audiences and music journalists urban radio outlets had mostly rejected def jam s requests to include group s singles in their regular rotation lommel 2007 p 50 this incited def jam co founder russell simmons to attempt grassroots promotional tactics from his earlier years of promoting hip hop shows in promoting fear of a black planet he recruited young street crews to put up posters billboards and stickers on public surfaces lommel 2007 p 51 while simmons himself met with nightclub djs and college radio program directors to persuade them to add albums tracks such as fight power 911 is a joke

more than half of 2 million fans who bought fear of a black planet are white critical reception fear of a black planet received rave reviews from contemporary critics after asserting prior to its release that it was bound to be one of most dissected pop collections in years robert hilburn of los angeles times wrote that album rivals force and power of it takes a nation while maintaining commercial and artistic credibility in fast changing rap world with original music usa todays edna gundersen called it a masterpiece of innovation and challenging music that makes group s pro black lyrics more interesting and plausible rolling stone magazine s alan light praised public enemy s self assured and realistic lyrics and viewed album as a deeper more focused version of careening rage of nation of millions greg sandow of entertainment weekly found it powerfully relevant to contemporary american culture and unparalleled by anything in popular music it sounds like a partly african partly postmodern collage stitched together on tumultuous urban streets tom moon of philadelphia inquirer observed some of genre s most sophisticated sound designs and unconventionally agile rapping on album and called it a major piece of work first hard evidence of rap s maturity and a measure of its continuing relevance in washington post richard harrington said because fear of a black planet is a challenging listen how it s met depends on how it s understood robert christgau writing for village voice felt that its brutal pace loses momentum and that group s lyrics are ideologically flawed but wrote that although their rebel music is gimmicky this is show business and they still think harder than anybody else working their beat peter watrous of new york times called it an essential pop album and stated on their own lyrics seen functional taken with music they bloom with meaning simon reynolds of melody maker remarked that content epitomizes group s significance at time public enemy are important because of angry questions that seethe in their music in very fabric of their sound bewilderment and rage that in this case have made for one hell of strong scary album chicago tribune critic greg kot felt that with album public enemy affirms that it is not just a great rap group but one of best rock bands on planet black or otherwise at end of 1990 fear of a black planet appeared

influence fear of a black planets success with critics and consumers was viewed as a significant factor to hip hop s mainstream emergence in 1990 which billboard editor paul grein said was year that rap exploded in a july 1990 article kot compared public enemy s influence on hip hop with album at start of 1990s to impact of bob dylan george clinton and bob marley on each of their respective genres and eras having given it legitimacy and authority far beyond its core following chuck d later said of album in retrospect if it takes a nation was our nation record fear of a black planet was our world record with respect to hip hop album was important in field of sampling as copyright lawyers took notice of bomb squad s production and such a sample heavy work would not be cost effective in future myrie 2008 p 149 chuck d later said of its sampling issues we got sued for everything we knew that door on sampling was gonna close subsequent use of sampled material particularly use of whole songs on top of a beat by other hip hop artists prompted stricter sampling laws fear of a black planet was group s commercial apex with sales dropping off for their subsequent albums prahlad 2006 p 1027 chuck d said it was their most successful record not because of all hype and hysteria it was a world record because of all different feels and different textures and flow it had fear of a black planet also helped popularize political subject matter in hip hop music as it epitomized resurgence in black consciousness among african american youths at turn of 1990s amid a turbulent social and political zeitgeist during bush administration and south african apartheid reeves 2009 p 86 black consciousness became prevailing subject matter of many hip hop acts exemplified by x clan s cultural nationalism on their debut album to east revolutionary black panther minded devil made me do it by paris and five religious nationalism of poor righteous teachers debut holy intellect christgau wrote in 1990 that public enemy had become not only most innovative popular musicians in america if not world but also most politically ambitious not even in heyday of clash has any group come so close to elusive and perhaps ridiculous 60s rock ideal of raising political consciousness with music their music on album inspired leftist and afrocentric ideals among rap listeners who were previously exposed to more materialist themes in music reeves said it introduced black consciousness to hip hop youth of post black power generation as leather african medallions made popular by rappers like p e replaced thick gold chains as ultimate fashion statement p e s million seller sat at front of a full blown black pride resurgence within rap however this resurgence soon became commodified as a trend while actual awareness within african american community was limited and ineffectual to issues such as drug dealing and prevalence of liquor stores in such neighborhoods reeves 2009 p 87 public enemy responded to this and other deep rooted problems of black america on their following album apocalypse 91 enemy strikes black 1991 which featured more critical assessments of african americans denouncing black drug dealers who donned afrocentric merchandise hip hop artists who promoted malt liquor black radio stations for lacking significant airplay to hip hop and even africans at onset of atlantic slave trade for lacking unity reappraisal since fear of a black planet was first released it has been viewed by critics as one of greatest and most important hip hop albums of all time mcleod 2007 p 68 alim 2008 p 13 as well as a culturally significant work stephen thomas erlewine from allmusic believed that as a piece of music this is best hip hop has ever had to offer calling it a remarkable piece of modern art a record that ushered in 90s in a hail of multi culturalism and kaleidoscopic confusion alex ross cited it as one of most densely packed sonic assemblages in musical history ross 2010 p 60 while q said it achieved near impossible by being every bit as good as its predecessor in opinion of kembrew mcleod public enemy had worked with production equipment that would seem primitive decades later but still managed to invent new techniques and workarounds that electronics manufacturers never imagined sputnikmusic staff writer nick butler said album remained an enduring and vital work in a genre that has a habit of moving at such a pace that records date in a matter of years left thumb fear of a black planet is archived at
