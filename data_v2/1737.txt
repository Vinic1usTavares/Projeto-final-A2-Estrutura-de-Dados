thumb graph of a function drawn in black and a tangent line to that function drawn in red slope of tangent line is equal to derivative of function at marked point derivative of a function of a real variable measures sensitivity to change of function value output value with respect to a change in its argument input value derivatives are a fundamental tool of calculus for example derivative of position of a moving object with respect to time is object s velocity this measures how quickly position of object changes when time advances derivative of a function of a single variable at a chosen input value when it exists is slope of tangent line to graph of function at that point tangent line is best linear approximation of function near that input value for this reason derivative is often described as instantaneous rate of change ratio of instantaneous change in dependent variable to that of independent variable derivatives may be generalized to functions of several real variables in this generalization derivative is reinterpreted as a linear transformation whose graph is after an appropriate translation best linear approximation to graph of original function jacobian matrix is matrix that represents this linear transformation with respect to basis given by choice of independent and dependent variables it can be calculated in terms of partial derivatives with respect to independent variables for a real valued function of several variables jacobian matrix reduces to gradient vector process of finding a derivative is called differentiation reverse process is called antidifferentiation fundamental theorem of calculus relates antidifferentiation with integration differentiation and integration constitute two fundamental operations in single variable calculus differentiation differentiation is action of computing a derivative derivative of a function of a variable is a measure of rate at which value of function changes with respect to change of variable it is called derivative of with respect to if and are real numbers and if graph of is plotted against derivative is slope of this graph at each point right thumb 250px slope of a linear function simplest case apart from trivial case of a constant function is when is a linear function of meaning that graph of is a line in this case for real numbers and and slope is given by where symbol delta is an abbreviation for change in and combinations and refer to corresponding changes i e above formula holds because thus this gives value for slope of a line if function is not linear i e its graph is not a straight line then change in divided by change in varies over considered range differentiation is a method to find a unique value for this rate of change not across a certain range but at any given value of idea illustrated by figures 1 to 3 is to compute rate of change as limit value of ratio of differences as becomes infinitely small notation two distinct notations are commonly used for derivative one deriving from leibniz and other from joseph louis lagrange in leibniz s notation an infinitesimal change in is denoted by and derivative of with respect to is written suggesting ratio of two infinitesimal quantities above expression is read as derivative of y with respect to x dy by dx or dy over dx oral form dy dx is often used conversationally although it may lead to confusion in lagrange s notation derivative with respect to of a function is denoted math f x read as f prime of x or read as f prime x of x in case of ambiguity of variable implied by differentiation lagrange s notation is sometimes incorrectly attributed to newton rigorous definition thumb 250px a secant approaches a tangent when most common approach to turn this intuitive idea into a precise definition is to define derivative as a limit of difference quotients of real numbers spivak 1994 chapter 10 this is approach described below let be a real valued function defined in an open neighborhood of a real number in classical geometry tangent line to graph of function at was unique line through point that did not meet graph of transversally meaning that line did not pass straight through graph derivative of with respect to at is geometrically slope of tangent line to graph of at slope of tangent line is very close to slope of line through and a nearby point on graph for example these lines are called secant lines a value of close to zero gives a good approximation to slope of tangent line and smaller values in absolute value of will in general give better approximations slope of secant line is difference between values of these points divided by difference between values that is this expression is newton s difference quotient passing from an approximation to an exact answer is done using a limit geometrically limit of secant lines is tangent line therefore limit of difference quotient as approaches zero if it exists should represent slope of tangent line to this limit is defined to be derivative of function at when limit exists is said to be differentiable at here is one of several common notations for derivative see below from this definition it is obvious that a differentiable function is increasing if and only if its derivative is positive and is decreasing iff its derivative is negative this fact is used extensively when analyzing function behavior e g when finding local extrema equivalently derivative satisfies property that which has intuitive interpretation see figure 1 that tangent line to at gives best linear approximation to near i e for small this interpretation is easiest to generalize to other settings see below substituting 0 for in difference quotient causes division by zero so slope of tangent line cannot be found directly using this method instead define to be difference quotient as a function of is slope of secant line between and if is a continuous function meaning that its graph is an unbroken curve with no gaps then is a continuous function away from if limit exists meaning that there is a way of choosing a value for that makes a continuous function then function is differentiable at and its derivative at equals in practice existence of a continuous extension of difference quotient to is shown by modifying numerator to cancel in denominator such manipulations can make limit value of for small clear even though is still not defined at this process can be long and tedious for complicated functions and many shortcuts are commonly used to simplify process definition over hyperreals relative to a hyperreal extension of real numbers derivative of a real function at a real point can be defined as shadow of quotient for infinitesimal where here natural extension of to hyperreals is still denoted here derivative is said to exist if shadow is independent of infinitesimal chosen example thumb square function square function given by is differentiable at and its derivative there is 6 this result is established by calculating limit as approaches zero of difference quotient of last expression shows that difference quotient equals when and is undefined when because of definition of difference quotient however definition of limit says difference quotient does not need to be defined when limit is result of letting go to zero meaning it is value that tends to as becomes very small hence slope of graph of square function at point is and so its derivative at is more generally a similar computation shows that derivative of square function at is continuity and differentiability thumb right this function does not have a derivative at marked point as function is not continuous there specifically it has a jump discontinuity if is differentiable at then must also be continuous at as an example choose a point and let be step function that returns value 1 for all less than and returns a different value 10 for all greater than or equal to cannot have a derivative at if is negative then is on low part of step so secant line from to is very steep and as tends to zero slope tends to infinity if is positive then is on high part of step so secant line from to has slope zero consequently secant lines do not approach any single slope so limit of difference quotient does not exist right thumb absolute value function is continuous but fails to be differentiable at since tangent slopes do not approach same value from left as they do from right however even if a function is continuous at a point it may not be differentiable there for example absolute value function given by is continuous at but it is not differentiable there if is positive then slope of secant line from 0 to is one whereas if is negative then slope of secant line from 0 to is negative one this can be seen graphically as a kink or a cusp in graph at even a function with a smooth graph is not differentiable at a point where its tangent is vertical for instance function given by is not differentiable at in summary a function that has a derivative is continuous but there are continuous functions that do not have a derivative most functions that occur in practice have derivatives at all points or at almost every point early in history of calculus many mathematicians assumed that a continuous function was differentiable at most points under mild conditions for example if function is a monotone function or a lipschitz function this is true however in 1872 weierstrass found first example of a function that is continuous everywhere but differentiable nowhere this example is now known as weierstrass function in 1931 stefan banach proved that set of functions that have a derivative at some point is a meager set in space of all continuous functions cited by informally this means that hardly do any random continuous functions have a derivative at even one point derivative as a function thumb derivative at different points of a differentiable function in this case derivative is equal to let be a function that has a derivative at every point in its domain we can then define a function that maps every point to value of derivative of at this function is written and is called derivative function or derivative of sometimes has a derivative at most but not all points of its domain function whose value at equals whenever is defined and elsewhere is undefined is also called derivative of it is still a function but its domain is strictly smaller than domain of using this idea differentiation becomes a function of functions derivative is an operator whose domain is set of all functions that have derivatives at every point of their domain and whose range is a set of functions if we denote this operator by then is function since is a function it can be evaluated at a point by definition of derivative function for comparison consider doubling function given by is a real valued function of a real number meaning that it takes numbers as inputs and has numbers as outputs operator however is not defined on individual numbers it is only defined on functions because output of is a function output of can be evaluated at a point for instance when is applied to square function outputs doubling function which we named this output function can then be evaluated to get and so on higher derivatives let be a differentiable function and let be its derivative derivative of if it has one is written and is called second derivative of similarly derivative of second derivative if it exists is written and is called third derivative of continuing this process one can define if it exists th derivative as derivative of th derivative these repeated derivatives are called higher order derivatives th derivative is also called derivative of order if represents position of an object at time then higher order derivatives of have specific interpretations in physics first derivative of is object s velocity second derivative of is acceleration third derivative of is jerk and finally fourth derivative of is a function need not have a derivative for example if it is not continuous similarly even if does have a derivative it may not have a second derivative for example let calculation shows that is a differentiable function whose derivative at is given by math f x is twice absolute value function at and it does not have a derivative at zero similar examples show that a function can have a th derivative for each non negative integer but not a th derivative a function that has successive derivatives is called times differentiable if in addition th derivative is continuous then function is said to be of differentiability class this is a stronger condition than having derivatives as shown by second example of a function that has infinitely many derivatives is called infinitely differentiable or smooth on real line every polynomial function is infinitely differentiable by standard differentiation rules if a polynomial of degree is differentiated times then it becomes a constant function all of its subsequent derivatives are identically zero in particular they exist so polynomials are smooth functions derivatives of a function at a point provide polynomial approximations to that function near for example if is twice differentiable then in sense that if is infinitely differentiable then this is beginning of taylor series for evaluated at around inflection point a point where second derivative of a function changes sign is called an inflection point at an inflection point second derivative may be zero as in case of inflection point of function given by or it may fail to exist as in case of inflection point of function given by at an inflection point a function switches from being a convex function to being a concave function or vice versa notation details leibniz s notation symbols and were introduced by gottfried wilhelm leibniz in 1675 manuscript of november 11 1675 vol 2 page 204 it is still commonly used when equation is viewed as a functional relationship between dependent and independent variables then first derivative is denoted by and was once thought of as an infinitesimal quotient higher derivatives are expressed using notation for nth derivative of these are abbreviations for multiple applications of derivative operator for example with leibniz s notation we can write derivative of at point in two different ways leibniz s notation allows one to specify variable for differentiation in denominator which is relevant in partial differentiation it also makes chain rule easier to remember lagrange s notation sometimes referred to as prime notation one of most common modern notation for differentiation is due to joseph louis lagrange and uses prime mark so that derivative of a function is denoted similarly second and third derivatives are denoted and to denote number of derivatives beyond this point some authors use roman numerals in superscript whereas others place number in parentheses or latter notation generalizes to yield notation for nth derivative of this notation is most useful when we wish to talk about derivative as being a function itself as in this case leibniz notation can become cumbersome newton s notation newton s notation for differentiation also called dot notation places a dot over function name to represent a time derivative if then and denote respectively first and second derivatives of this notation is used exclusively for derivatives with respect to time or arc length it is typically used in differential equations in physics and differential geometry dot notation however becomes unmanageable for high order derivatives order 4 or more and cannot deal with multiple independent variables euler s notation euler s notation uses a differential operator which is applied to a function to give first derivative nth derivative is denoted if is a dependent variable then often subscript x is attached to d to clarify independent variable x euler s notation is then written or although this subscript is often omitted when variable x is understood for instance when this is only independent variable present in expression euler s notation is useful for stating and solving linear differential equations rules of computation derivative of a function can in principle be computed from definition by considering difference quotient and computing its limit in practice once derivatives of a few simple functions are known derivatives of other functions are more easily computed using rules for obtaining derivatives of more complicated functions from simpler ones rules for basic functions most derivative computations eventually require taking derivative of some common functions following incomplete list gives some of most frequently used functions of a single real variable and their derivatives derivatives of powers if where r is any real number then wherever this is defined for example if then and derivative function is defined only for positive x not for when this rule implies that f x is zero for which is almost constant rule stated below exponential and logarithmic functions trigonometric functions inverse trigonometric functions rules for combined functions in many cases complicated limit calculations by direct application of newton s difference quotient can be avoided using differentiation rules some of most basic rules are following constant rule if f x is constant then sum rule for all functions f and g and all real numbers and product rule for all functions f and g as a special case this rule includes fact whenever is a constant because by constant rule quotient rule for all functions f and g at all inputs where chain rule for composite functions if then computation example derivative of function given by is here second term was computed using chain rule and third using product rule known derivatives of elementary functions x2 x4 sin x ln x and as well as constant 7 were also used in higher dimensions vector valued functions a vector valued function y of a real variable sends real numbers to vectors in some vector space rn a vector valued function can be split up into its coordinate functions y1 t y2 t yn t meaning that this includes for example parametric curves in r2 or r3 coordinate functions are real valued functions so above definition of derivative applies to them derivative of y t is defined to be vector called tangent vector whose coordinates are derivatives of coordinate functions that is equivalently if limit exists subtraction in numerator is subtraction of vectors not scalars if derivative of y exists for every value of t then y is another vector valued function if e1 en is standard basis for rn then y t can also be written as if we assume that derivative of a vector valued function retains linearity property then derivative of y t must be because each of basis vectors is a constant this generalization is useful for example if y t is position vector of a particle at time t then derivative y t is velocity vector of particle at time t partial derivatives suppose that f is a function that depends on more than one variable for instance f can be reinterpreted as a family of functions of one variable indexed by other variables in other words every value of x chooses a function denoted fx which is a function of one real number that is once a value of x is chosen say a then determines a function fa that sends y to in this expression a is a constant not a variable so fa is a function of only one real variable consequently definition of derivative for a function of one variable applies above procedure can be performed for any choice of a assembling derivatives together into a function gives a function that describes variation of f in y direction this is partial derivative of f with respect to y here is a rounded d called partial derivative symbol to distinguish it from letter d is sometimes pronounced der del or partial instead of dee in general partial derivative of a function in direction xi at point a1 an is defined to be in above difference quotient all variables except xi are held fixed that choice of fixed values determines a function of one variable and by definition in other words different choices of a index a family of one variable functions just as in example above this expression also shows that computation of partial derivatives reduces to computation of one variable derivatives an important example of a function of several variables is case of a scalar valued function on a domain in euclidean space rn e g on r2 or r3 in this case f has a partial derivative f xj with respect to each variable xj at point a1 an these partial derivatives define vector this vector is called gradient of f at a if f is differentiable at every point in some domain then gradient is a vector valued function f that takes point a1 an to vector f a1 an consequently gradient determines a vector field directional derivatives if f is a real valued function on rn then partial derivatives of f measure its variation in direction of coordinate axes for example if f is a function of x and y then its partial derivatives measure variation in f in x direction and y direction they do not however directly measure variation of f in any other direction such as along diagonal line these are measured using directional derivatives choose a vector directional derivative of f in direction of v at point x is limit in some cases it may be easier to compute or estimate directional derivative after changing length of vector often this is done to turn problem into computation of a directional derivative in direction of a unit vector to see how this works suppose that substitute into difference quotient difference quotient becomes this is l times difference quotient for directional derivative of f with respect to u furthermore taking limit as h tends to zero is same as taking limit as k tends to zero because h and k are multiples of each other therefore because of this rescaling property directional derivatives are frequently considered only for unit vectors if all partial derivatives of f exist and are continuous at x then they determine directional derivative of f in direction v by formula this is a consequence of definition of total derivative it follows that directional derivative is linear in v meaning that same definition also works when f is a function with values in rm above definition is applied to each component of vectors in this case directional derivative is a vector in rm total derivative total differential and jacobian matrix when f is a function from an open subset of rn to rm then directional derivative of f in a chosen direction is best linear approximation to f at that point and in that direction but when no single directional derivative can give a complete picture of behavior of f total derivative gives a complete picture by considering all directions at once that is for any vector v starting at a linear approximation formula holds just like single variable derivative is chosen so that error in this approximation is as small as possible if n and m are both one then derivative is a number and expression is product of two numbers but in higher dimensions it is impossible for to be a number if it were a number then would be a vector in rn while other terms would be vectors in rm and therefore formula would not make sense for linear approximation formula to make sense must be a function that sends vectors in rn to vectors in rm and must denote this function evaluated at v to determine what kind of function it is notice that linear approximation formula can be rewritten as notice that if we choose another vector w then this approximate equation determines another approximate equation by substituting w for v it determines a third approximate equation by substituting both w for v and for a by subtracting these two new equations we get if we assume that v is small and that derivative varies continuously in a then is approximately equal to and therefore right hand side is approximately zero left hand side can be rewritten in a different way using linear approximation formula with substituted for v linear approximation formula implies this suggests that is a linear transformation from vector space rn to vector space rm in fact it is possible to make this a precise derivation by measuring error in approximations assume that error in these linear approximation formula is bounded by a constant times v where constant is independent of v but depends continuously on a then after adding an appropriate error term all of above approximate equalities can be rephrased as inequalities in particular is a linear transformation up to a small error term in limit as v and w tend to zero it must therefore be a linear transformation since we define total derivative by taking a limit as v goes to zero must be a linear transformation in one variable fact that derivative is best linear approximation is expressed by fact that it is limit of difference quotients however usual difference quotient does not make sense in higher dimensions because it is not usually possible to divide vectors in particular numerator and denominator of difference quotient are not even in same vector space numerator lies in rm while denominator lies in domain rn furthermore derivative is a linear transformation a different type of object from both numerator and denominator to make precise idea that is best linear approximation it is necessary to adapt a different formula for one variable derivative in which these problems disappear if then usual definition of derivative may be manipulated to show that derivative of f at a is unique number such that this is equivalent to because limit of a function tends to zero if and only if limit of absolute value of function tends to zero this last formula can be adapted to many variable situation by replacing absolute values with norms definition of total derivative of f at a therefore is that it is unique linear transformation such that here h is a vector in rn so norm in denominator is standard length on rn however f a h is a vector in rm and norm in numerator is standard length on rm if v is a vector starting at a then is called pushforward of v by f and is sometimes written if total derivative exists at a then all partial derivatives and directional derivatives of f exist at a and for all v is directional derivative of f in direction v if we write f using coordinate functions so that then total derivative can be expressed using partial derivatives as a matrix this matrix is called jacobian matrix of f at a existence of total derivative f a is strictly stronger than existence of all partial derivatives but if partial derivatives exist and are continuous then total derivative exists is given by jacobian and depends continuously on a definition of total derivative subsumes definition of derivative in one variable that is if f is a real valued function of a real variable then total derivative exists if and only if usual derivative exists jacobian matrix reduces to a 1x1 matrix whose only entry is derivative f x this 1x1 matrix satisfies property that is approximately zero in other words that up to changing variables this is statement that function is best linear approximation to f at a total derivative of a function does not give another function in same way as one variable case this is because total derivative of a function has to record much more information than derivative of a single variable function instead total derivative gives a function from tangent bundle of source to tangent bundle of target natural analog of second third and higher order total derivatives is not a linear transformation is not a function on tangent bundle and is not built by repeatedly taking total derivative analog of a higher order derivative called a jet cannot be a linear transformation because higher order derivatives reflect subtle geometric information such as concavity which cannot be described in terms of linear data such as vectors it cannot be a function on tangent bundle because tangent bundle only has room for base space and directional derivatives because jets capture higher order information they take as arguments additional coordinates representing higher order changes in direction space determined by these additional coordinates is called jet bundle relation between total derivative and partial derivatives of a function is paralleled in relation between kth order jet of a function and its partial derivatives of order less than or equal to k by repeatedly taking total derivative one obtains higher versions of frechet derivative specialized to rp kth order total derivative may be interpreted as a map which takes a point x in rn and assigns to it an element of space of k linear maps from rn to rm best in a certain precise sense k linear approximation to f at that point by it with diagonal map d a generalized taylor series may be begun as where f a is identified with a constant function are components of vector and and are components of and as linear transformations generalizations concept of a derivative can be extended to many other settings common thread is that derivative of a function at a point serves as a linear approximation of function at that point an important generalization of derivative concerns complex functions of complex variables such as functions from a domain in complex numbers c to c notion of derivative of such a function is obtained by replacing real variables with complex variables in definition if c is identified with r2 by writing a complex number z as then a differentiable function from c to c is certainly differentiable as a function from r2 to r2 in sense that its partial derivatives all exist but converse is not true in general complex derivative only exists if real derivative is complex linear and this imposes relations between partial derivatives called cauchy riemann equations see holomorphic functions another generalization concerns functions between differentiable or smooth manifolds intuitively speaking such a manifold m is a space that can be approximated near each point x by a vector space called its tangent space prototypical example is a smooth surface in r 3 derivative or differential of a differentiable map between manifolds at a point x in m is then a linear map from tangent space of m at x to tangent space of n at f x derivative function becomes a map between tangent bundles of m and n this definition is fundamental in differential geometry and has many uses see pushforward differential and pullback differential geometry differentiation can also be defined for maps between infinite dimensional vector spaces such as banach spaces and frechet spaces there is a generalization both of directional derivative called derivative and of differential called frechet derivative one deficiency of classical derivative is that very many functions are not differentiable nevertheless there is a way of extending notion of derivative so that all continuous functions and many other functions can be differentiated using a concept known as weak derivative idea is to embed continuous functions in a larger space called space of distributions and only require that a function is differentiable on average properties of derivative have inspired introduction and study of many similar objects in algebra and topology see for example differential algebra discrete equivalent of differentiation is finite differences study of differential calculus is unified with calculus of finite differences in time scale calculus also see arithmetic derivative history calculus known in its early history as infinitesimal calculus is a mathematical discipline focused on limits functions
