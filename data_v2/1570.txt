battle of tsimba ridge was an engagement of second world war involving australian and japanese forces part of wider bougainville campaign of pacific theatre battle occurred in northern sector of bougainville island between 17 january and 9 february 1945 when lead battalion of australian 11th brigade 31st 51st infantry battalion advanced towards genga river as part of a drive north to bonis peninsula on peninsula an enclave of japanese troops had established itself after withdrawing north following earlier engagements in centre of island throughout 1944 45 coming up against heavy resistance along tsimba ridge australians advance was halted for three weeks as they fought to wrest control of ridge from defending japanese from 81st infantry regiment whose strength was roughly equal to that of australians main australian attack took place on 6 february but it was not until 9 february that japanese completely withdrew from position small scale fighting in surrounding area continued until 22 february next stage of campaign saw australians take ratsua as they sought to establish a defensive line across base of bonis peninsula between ratsua and ruri bay background strategic situation 170px thumb left some key locations in bougainville campaign alt map showing key locations on bougainville japanese forces had landed on bougainville in early 1942 capturing it from small force of australians garrisoning island they had subsequently developed several airbases on island using it to conduct operations in northern solomon islands and to attack allied lines of communication between united states australia and southwest pacific area these bases also helped protect rabaul major japanese garrison and naval base in papua new guinea throughout 1943 allied planners determined that bougainville was vital for neutralising japanese base around rabaul us marines conducted an amphibious landing at cape torokina on western coast of bougainville north of empress augusta bay in november 1943 after an initial counter attack that was repulsed marines had been replaced by a garrison of us army troops who began consolidating their position around torokina establishing a strong perimeter in march 1944 japanese launched a heavy counter attack which was turned back with many casualties after this situation on bougainville became largely static as japanese focused primarily on subsistence and us forces chose to adopt a mostly defensive posture aimed at maintaining perimeter around torokina in november december 1944 australian ii corps consisting of militia troops from 3rd division and 11th brigade under lieutenant general stanley savige took over responsibility for allied operations on bougainville from american xiv corps as part of a plan to free up us troops for fighting in philippines mistakenly believing that japanese forces on island numbered just 17 500 men it was decided that australians should pursue an aggressive campaign to clear japanese from bougainville after taking over us perimeter that had been established around torokina australian campaign developed into three separate drives in north it was planned that japanese forces would be forced into narrow bonis peninsula and contained in centre seizure of pearl ridge would give australians control of east west avenues of approach as well as affording them protection against further counter attacks while also opening way for a drive to east coast and main campaign in south where bulk of japanese forces were concentrated allied estimates of japanese strength were later found to be grossly inaccurate and after war it was found that number of japanese alive on island at this time was closer to 40 000 preliminary moves on 31 december 1944 savige ordered brigadier john stevenson commander of 11th brigade to begin clearing operations along northwest coast of island towards soraken harbour as australians attempted to drive japanese in sector on to narrow bonis peninsula at time australians believed there were around 390 japanese defending area surrounding genga river considered to be main japanese defence line in northern sector but it was later determined to be closer to 900 men from 81st infantry regiment under command of lieutenant colonel shinzo nakamura nakamura who according to peter charlton was considered to be a master of jungle warfare had been ordered to prevent australian advance along coast he had perceived likelihood of stopping australians well forward of genga as being unlikely and had therefore decided that he would concentrate his defence around river itself establishing a strong position on tsimba ridge about south of river described by war correspondent fred aldridge as a horseshoe volcanic feature with steep jungle clad sides each toe of ridge ended close to sea forming a natural amphitheatre by beach it was a textbook fortress according to aldridge it was a maze of dugouts trenches and foxholes and was well camouflaged and heavily defended by snipers machine guns and artillery while supporting elements had been placed to north in depth behind genga near kunamatoro taking over control of northern sector from 7th brigade which was subsequently transferred to southern sector to take part in main offensive 11th brigade advanced along coast from kuraio mission sending out patrols into interior to flush japanese out of their positions in mountains as they went 31st 51st infantry battalion under command of lieutenant colonel joseph kelly and roughly 800 strong formed vanguard of advance its main body moving along coast road towards amun and rukussia while patrols were sent inland from totokei towards lalum and soraken both of which were considered key japanese positions by 16 january 1945 lead company of 31st 51st reached rukussia having encountered no japanese up until that point battle 170px thumb right location of battle in north west bougainville alt a map show location of battle first contact came on 17 january when 31st 51st infantry battalion s advanced elements drawn mainly from d company under captain thomas titley moved north from rukussia and proceeded towards genga river reaching a clearing north of puto a platoon sized patrol came across several huts in a cleared area and proceeded to attack it one japanese was killed in initial assault but as australians took huts and pushed beyond them they were engaged from entrenchments in front of them japanese then launched a counter attack using light and heavy machine guns in response australians brought up another platoon and over course of two days counter attack was repulsed with six to eight japanese estimated to have been killed and others wounded while two australians were wounded during engagement japanese had opened up with artillery that they had brought up in support of main defensive position on tsimba ridge firing for first time in sector this barrage was largely ineffective inflicting only one casualty as many of shells proved to be faulty and did not detonate australians also came across a large camp including a field hospital which they captured intact another group of huts was also discovered from where they gained intelligence identifying japanese troops in area as belonging to 81st infantry regiment they also managed to capture two 70 mm guns and ammunition for them on 19 january 31st 51st infantry battalion s a company under captain clyde downs sent a platoon sized patrol out to outflank japanese forward positions this patrol moved first to right flank and then north along jungle tracks around totokei and discovering evidence of japanese movement in area they proceeded to village of kunamatoro about north of here they encountered a force of around 30 to 50 japanese and after initial contact in which australian platoon commander was wounded patrol attacked village within 10 minutes battle was over 14 japanese had been killed along with a further five wounded while australians lost one killed one wounded and one missing as darkness fell australian patrol withdrew from village following day 20 january advanced elements of australian force pressed on towards tsimba ridge a formation about long and about in height and stretching westerly to genga river where a steep cliff fell to southern bank of river ridge blocked australian advance across river while its south easternmost protrusion later known to australians as pimple was separated by a shallow saddle on top of ridge dense jungle provided good concealment while most of approaches to ridge were open to observation as australians approached ridge one of their platoons captured a 47 mm gun positioned along coast about south of ridge while another platoon contacted a lone japanese soldier who was killed in subsequent firefight as they entered a garden that curved along southern approach to ridge and which became known as amphitheatre after initial contact platoon s advance through garden was prevented by an intense burst of fire from ridge but australians managed to scale high ground that rose to their east and were able to occupy south eastern tip of pimple capturing two 75 mm guns in process reports had been received from locals that japanese had brought reinforcements down from soraken island and tarlena and at this point australians realised that japanese were concentrated in far greater numbers than anticipated and had in fact established their line of resistance in sector upon ridge this was confirmed later after australians moved forward once more on 21 january moving to within of genga river where track upon which they were advancing opened into a large garden that curved around edge of tsimba ridge from where japanese defenders had an excellent line of sight subsequent patrols determined extent of japanese position reporting that they had constructed a well fortified position with a continuous trench along crest of ridge weapons pits and pill boxes all with clear fields of fire stretching up to australian commander kelly ordered b company to move up and take ridge and over course of a week between 21 28 january they made several attempts against various parts of ridge approaching from south southeast and north these proved fruitless although one platoon managed to encircle position from north before being engaged with heavy machine gun fire on 23 january australians established fire support in form of guns from 2nd mountain battery another three unsuccessful attempts were made on 24 january and on 25 january c company carried out a movement to flank in an attempt to get around behind ridge and attack from north crossing crocodile infested waters of genga about from ridge australians established a bridgehead across river with a line of communications back to pimple which they kept open by constantly patrolling along it left thumb a 4 2 inch mortar of 101st brigade support company in action during 31st 51st infantry battalion s attack on 6 february alt a black and white image of soldiers standing in a fire pit around an indirect fire support weapon over following six days japanese attacked bridgehead launching a series of assaults that in words of robert bordered upon suicidal these attacks were repulsed and australians began to launch patrols in all directions around ridge on 29 january japanese launched a large scale attack on c company s positions and although australians resisted attack succeeded in breaking through one part of perimeter and managed to roll up position all way to main battalion position around puto before it was turned back australian counter attack organised by c company s commander captain alwyn shilton and supported by accurate artillery fire came on 1 february and resulted in over 30 japanese killed or wounded over next few days japanese made further probes which were also repulsed and australians consolidated their positions prior to an assault on ridge preparations included of a mountain gun from puto to a position from pimple from where it could fire directly upon japanese positions on ridge while aircraft from no 5 squadron royal australian air force carried out reconnaissance to maintain secrecy of these preparations mortar fire was brought down upon japanese positions to mask sounds of digging and movement while fire from vickers machine guns kept japanese defenders from being able to leave their shelter and observe following a day long artillery barrage main assault attack finally took place on 6 february supported by a barrage of over 500 artillery shells and mortar bombs and airstrikes from australian wirraways and new zealand corsairs three platoons from captain millett harris b company assaulted ridge from different points in an effort to encircle defenders following preparatory artillery fire attack began at 09 00 hours when two platoons 10 and 11 platoons along with company headquarters formed up south east of amphitheatre and began to advance to north west to attack ridge from behind while another force 12 platoon attacked from garden moving around pimple before assaulting ridge from east from north west 10 platoon in centre managed to capture its objectives by 09 25 hours however 12 platoon came under intense fire and after suffering several casualties stopped their advance by 11 30 hours northernmost australian platoon 11 platoon had reached high ground on north western side of ridge completing encirclement of japanese defenders subsequently withdrew from their forward positions but refused to give up position occupying reverse slope on western side of ridge attack cost australians nine killed and 20 wounded throughout night japanese artillery was very active firing down on australian positions around pimple after which a banzai attack was launched early on 7 february although repulsed it enabled japanese to maintain a small pocket of resistance on western tip of ridge on evening of 7 february captain kawakami s 10th company from iii battalion 81st infantry regiment withdrew nevertheless a small japanese force remained until 9 february when australians called down an airstrike upon position and defenders withdrew from feature one of australians private colin jorgensen was awarded military medal for charging a japanese weapon pit and knocking it out of action during final assault aftermath fighting around genga river continued for next couple of days with clashes occurring until australians had cleared northern and southern banks by 11 february during which time japanese artillery opened up on australians causing several casualties in securing ridge australians captured a large amount of japanese equipment including four field and six anti tank guns nine machine guns and 86 rifles japanese casualties were estimated at 66 killed while australian casualties in tsimba area were 12 killed and 20 wounded within context of campaign these losses were considered heavy by australians and an australian newspaper report from shortly after battle described it as bloodiest battle of campaign while another described it as fiercest fought on bougainville up to that point from documents captured after war it was shown that japanese believed that these losses would slow australian advance at time they did not perceive loss of tsimba ridge to be a defeat they had been prepared to hold position and had numbers to do it however nakamura had decided to withdraw from ridge when morale of his troops had fallen due to lack of ammunition and food and rising casualties from tropical diseases real size of force holding tsimba ridge was also revealed by documents captured after war highlighting gross underestimation of japanese strength by australian intelligence sources thumb right soldiers from australian 31st 51st infantry battalion patrol around tsimba ridge after main fighting 17 february 1945 alt soldiers patrol along a jungle track after fall of tsimba ridge fighting continued around genga river for next couple of weeks by 10 february area south of genga had been cleared of japanese and australians began to patrol along northern bank several minor clashes occurred most serious of which saw three japanese killed and three australians wounded when australians managed to capture a japanese 37 mm gun as japanese were forced to withdraw from a position along track which ran from river japanese artillery intensified and several men from 31st 51st infantry battalion became casualties 31st 51st infantry battalion continued operations around genga river until 26 february by which time three companies had reached gillman river while another had struck inland fighting a short engagement around kunamatoro before pressing on towards a ridge near soraken plantation throughout final weeks of february a company of 31st 51st under downs fought japanese defenders off position which was subsequently named downs ridge by australians on 26 february 31st 51st was relieved by lieutenant colonel bernard s 26th infantry battalion who continued advance north towards soraken peninsula while 55th 53rd infantry battalion advanced on ratsua as australians sought to establish a defensive line across base of bonis peninsula between ratsua and ruri bay 31st 51st would later take part in failed landing at porton plantation in june where they would suffer heavy casualties including downs who was killed leading his company in total australians lost 34 killed and 91 wounded in fighting around genga river while it was estimated that japanese lost 148 killed for its involvement in taking tsimba ridge 31st 51st infantry battalion was awarded battle honour tsimba ridge notes footnotes citations references
