was developed and published by strategic simulations inc a video game company that dominated 1980s market for digital wargames their products typically copied board game formula without adding revolutionary new elements most strategy games at this time featured hexagon based maps and a sequence of turns among players sword of aragon plainly exhibits influence of traditional board games in its design its maps are laid out in hexes and concept of stacking limits plays a strong part in game s strategies written in microsoft and other languages sword of aragon features a copy protection

session sword of aragon was released when fantasy themed wargames were gaining popularity and computer wargames were starting to flourish as rules of board games grew in complexity digital versions were simpler in terms of their gameplay as parts of complex mechanics were handled by computers instead freed of dice rolling complex calculations and coordination of sequence of play casual gamers were more amenable to playing these games according to advanced computer entertainments john minson sword of aragon complied with part of this trend its huge complicated set of rules would have made it an unplayable board game but by hiding its mechanics from player digital version could be played by anyone however as minson further explained scope of game was too large for casual gamers to handle overwhelming them with number of factors under their control and hardcore gamers are more likely to appreciate game s complexity lessers of dragon magazine believed that while game was exciting it suffered several design flaws that made game too difficult for them computer controlled enemies constantly outpaced their economy and military might and game gave them no immediate opportunity to retreat their army when ambushed by superior forces forcing them to suffer heavy losses conversely compute s adam starkweather found it too easy in later stages of game as his character s well developed armies their way through opposition lessers and amiga jokers werner hiersekorn felt game ran slow on their computers while starkweather reflected that battles could take up to one and a half hours to complete in 1990 and 1993 computer gaming world gave game three plus stars out of five stating that it had high playability several video game observers doubted classification of sword of aragon as a role playing game science fiction and fantasy novelist orson scott card and amiga computings lucinda orr considered it more of a strategy than a role playing game minson was of like mind and further elaborated that unlike dungeon and dragon series of video games sword of aragon failed to inspire players to identify themselves with characters giving a coldly mechanical experience instead hans ekholm thought otherwise he said gameplay did not require any strategy and considered sword of aragon a fantasy role playing adventure game and nothing else critics had minor criticisms with game s quality when comparing to its contemporaries minson called its interface old fashioned and computer gaming world said it was clunky and marginal a description it also gave game s graphics graphically orr and zzap 64s phil king found game primitive though adequate more troubling to several reviewers was game s copy protection system ekholm was not pleased that he had to unfold a flimsy poster to identify requested city his copy was falling apart after several identifications game further frustrated him when it failed to acknowledge correct key provided hints were incorrect a situation also experienced by lessers inaccuracies were not restricted to copy protection starkweather pointed out discrepancies in documentation several features of game were either not explained or wrongly documented ekholm dismissed sword of aragon for its flawed copy protection and perceived lack of strategy hiersekorn was more condemning rating game poorly for its graphics and sound and confused by its presented lists of military and economic data he called game a cheap clone regardless such issues did not deter other reviewers from praising game pleased with large number of options to manage their cities and to order their armies in combat they felt game was deep and offered many exciting moments judged system challenging and ultimately rewarding according to retro gamer magazine sword of aragon is considered by many to be best fantasy wargame ever starkweather was equally pronounced in his opinion he called sword of aragon addictive and was willing to overlook issues with game finding pleasure in formulating strategies and tactics to overcome enemy reviews 1 jan 1990 references external links category 1989 video games category 4x video games category amiga games
