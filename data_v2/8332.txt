brazza s martin phedina is a passerine bird in swallow family hirundinidae it is 12 cm 4 25 in long with grey brown upperparts heavily black streaked white underparts and a brownish tint to breast plumage sexes are similar but juvenile birds have more diffuse breast streaking and reddish brown edges to feathers of back and wings song consists of a series of short notes of increasing frequency followed by a complex buzz that is sometimes completed by a number of clicks range of this species falls within african countries of angola republic of congo and democratic republic of congo nesting in burrows in river banks it lays a clutch of three white eggs this bird feeds on flying insects including termites and may hunt over rivers or open savanna it forms mixed flocks with other swallows but is readily identified by its combination of brown upperparts streaked underparts and a square tail although this little known bird had been classified as data deficient by international union for conservation of nature iucn it actually appears to be common and widespread and it has been listed as a species of least concern since 2008 there may be some hunting of this martin for food but species does not appear to be facing any serious short term threats taxonomy brazza s martin was first described in 1886 under its current binomial name by french zoologist emile oustalet from a specimen obtained at in district of what is now republic of congo turner rose 1989 p 157 genus name phedina is derived from greek phaios phaios brown and italian swallow jobling 2010 p 302 species name commemorates italian born french explorer pierre savorgnan de brazza later to become governor general of french congo jobling 2010 p 76 who collected type specimen sharpe wyatt 1894 p 207 this species was often called congo martin but this invites confusion with congo sand martin or congo martin riparia phedina species are members of swallow family of birds and are classed as members of hirundininae subfamily which comprises all swallows and martins except very distinctive river martins dna sequence studies suggest that there are three major groupings within hirundininae broadly correlating with type of nest built these groups are core martins including burrowing species like sand martin nest adopters which are birds like tree swallow that utilise natural cavities and mud nest builders such as barn swallow which build a nest from mud phedina species nest in burrows and therefore belong to core martins group genus phedina is thought to be an early offshoot from main swallow lineage although striped plumage of its two species suggests a distant relationship with several streaked african hirundo species turner rose 1989 p 8 turner rose 1989 pp 70 72 only other member of genus is mascarene martin p although in past it has sometimes been suggested that brazza s martin should be moved to its own genus due to significant differences in vocalisations and nest type from its relative nearest relative of phedina martins is banded martin riparia cincta which appears not to be closely related to other members of its current genus and resembles brazza s martin in nesting habits and vocalisations current association of european rarities committees aerc recommended practice is to move banded martin to its own genus as cincta rather than to merge it into phedina since banded martin s larger size different bill and nostril shape and non colonial nesting are differences from other phedina species crochet et al 2011 p 4 description brazza s martin is 12 cm 4 25 in long with wings averaging 100 5 mm 4 4 in this small has grey brown upperparts with a somewhat darker brown head and white underparts heavily streaked with blackish brown from throat to vent there is a brownish tint to breast plumage square tail averages 46 8 mm 1 8 in long and has white edges to brown undertail coverts flight feathers are blackish brown and bill and legs are black eyes are dark brown and black bill averages 8 5 mm 0 33 in long sexes are similar but juvenile birds have more diffuse breast streaking and reddish brown or buff edges to feathers of back and wings turner rose 1989 pp 58 59 this bird has no subspecies song consists of a series of short notes increasing in frequency which are followed by a complex buzz and sometimes completed by a number of clicks song becomes increasingly loud although final clicks are quite soft song is similar to that of banded martin and does not resemble mascarene martin suggesting unresolved taxonomic problems flight is variously described as heavy or like that of a sand martin brazza s martin can be distinguished from most other swallows within its range by heavy streaking on underparts although lesser striped swallow also has white underparts with dark streaking it is larger has a deeply forked tail and a very different plumage with dark blue upperparts a red rump and a chestnut head turner rose 1989 pp 194 197 compared to mascarene martin this species is smaller has a plainer back and finer dashing on throat and chest reichenow 1903 p 425 but there is no range overlap turner rose 1989 pp 155 157 distribution and habitat distribution of brazza s martin was initially poorly known and until 1922 type specimen in paris museum was only recorded example of this species a father then collected 20 martins near luluabourg now kananga and this bird is now known to breed in south of democratic republic of congo drc republic of congo and in northern angola there is one probable sighting from southeast gabon in breeding season this martin is found near rivers with steep banks that are needed for nest burrows suitable habitat occurs along lowland tropical rivers like congo or rivers with sandbanks in highlands of angola highland locations have wide grassy riverways running through miombo woodlands whereas congo basin is tropical forest with over 200 cm 80 in of rain a year lowland habitats are a patchwork of dry seasonally flooded and permanently wet woodland and seasonally flooded savanna and swamp forests contain trees such as symphonia globulifera raffia palms and species and riverbanks are often lined with arrowroot world wildlife fund lead ed mcginley mark topic eds eastern swamp forests in cleveland cutler j ed 2006 encyclopedia of earth environmental information coalition and national council for science and environment retrieved 4 november 2012 this martin seems to be able to adapt to open savanna habitats containing in which it will roost overnight when not breeding and is therefore not heavily dependent on neighbouring forests as long as riverine breeding sites survive behaviour thumb breeding habitat in democratic republic of congo in a presumed example of courtship behaviour a male brazza s martin perched about 30 cm 1 ft away from a female and sang for about ten minutes as it sang male leant towards female which caused still folded wings and tail to rise relative to body brazza s martin nests in vertical banks of forested rivers from july to october at end of dry season but before river levels are high enough to cause flooding a small colony of four pairs was recorded breeding near a rocky outcrop on side of a valley brazza s martin nests singly or in loose colonies with sometimes widely separated burrows nest is a small heap of soft material such as feathers or dry grass at end of a typically 50 cm 20 in tunnel normal clutch is three white eggs eggs measure 18 5 x 112 5 mm 0 73 x 0 49 in and weigh 1 5 g 0 05 oz incubation and fledging times are unknown although as with all hirundines chicks are altricial hatching naked and blind turner rose 1989 p 4 as with other swallows brazza s martin feeds on flying insects including termites and may hunt over rivers or open savanna it can occur in single species flocks or with other swallows including barn swallows lesser striped swallows or rock martins status there has been little ornithological research in this part of africa and until 2008 brazza s martin was classified as data deficient it was thought to have a much more restricted distribution range but a 2007 paper presented evidence that extended its known range by 500 km 300 mi to north and 175 km 90 mi southwards a quadrupling of area it has a large range of 402 000 km2 155 000 sq mi although total population is unknown its extensive range and apparently stable population means this bird is classed as least concern on iucn red list it is likely that this species is dug out for food by humans but its small dispersed colonies in firm soil suggests that it is a less rewarding target than densely packed sandbank nests of species such as african river martin and rosy bee eater breeding colonies in river sandbars are liable to flooding but neither natural causes nor hunting appear to be having a serious impact and this species seems under no immediate threat its ability to use degraded habitats also aids its survival retrieved 5 december 2012 brazza s martin is not a protected species in angola de klemm lausche 1986 pp 262 266 drc de klemm lausche 1986 pp 515 518 or republic of congo
