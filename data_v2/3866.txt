angered delsin destroys entire reservation development origins and playstation 4 thumb right 300px sucker punch productions were very involved with development of playstation 4 platform they discussed with sony how much power they would like with new hardware and what refinements they would like to see on dualshock 4 gamepad sucker punch productions began to develop second son while playstation 4 was still being designed having finished work on infamous festival of blood they began to plan a new entry in infamous series under working title infamous 3 as early as 2010 they discussed with sony their desire to bring infamous to a new playstation platform sucker punch were in close connection with ps4 s lead system architect mark cerny who visited studio several times they gave cerny feedback about how much power a new playstation system would require to render their ideal open world how fast it would be capable of doing so and to what degree of texture detail we had some experience there that was useful for that team when they were planning some aspects of hardware design producer brian fleming explained he found that during ps4 s development there was a great level of interactivity between system s designers and game developers such as sucker punch sucker punch made suggested improvements they would like to see for dualshock 4 gamepad second sons designer jaime griesemer traveled to sony s headquarters in japan to discuss such improvements developers found they were able to adopt dualshock 4 s touchpad into second sons gameplay for example players emulate in game fingerprint scanner using dualshock 4 touchpad game was envisioned to take full advantage of hardware without imposition of porting to older platforms like playstation 3 hardware let developers improve particle system that lights delsin s face up while he draws neon power from billboards and add detailed reflections to game world increased memory bandwidth let team render characters with higher fidelity they found ps4 s simplified architecture so easy to work with that they were able to reach very high graphical quality even though hardware was new over 110 developers worked on game a number that director nate fox considered small he felt that working with a small team necessitated having a defined vision for game from outset to answer those first questions about what you want your game to be sometimes ideas came about during development that would have to be thrown out for not fitting with game s original vision we kill our darlings at sucker punch it s not easy it s necessary fox explained second son displays a native resolution of 1080p at 30 frames per second design thumb left 300px second sons graphical quality was possible because development was conducted on ps4 which sucker punch found powerful and easy to use their research for game world led to reproduction of seattle landmarks such as space needle alt a screenshot of game world s seattle skyline with space needle depicted in center lighting draw distances and weather effects are visible sucker punch elected to set second son in their hometown of seattle as they could draw from their personal experiences in open world s design during early development when team members debated where second son would be set seattle rated high on a list of possibilities fleming considered that city had not been featured in many games prior to second son and so would not be overblown and felt that seattle s weather and mixture of old and new architecture would make it an interesting setting team conducted fieldwork in seattle s nearby forests with audio and video equipment which was used to reproduce local flora and chirping sounds of local american robins seattle landmarks such as pioneer square space needle and elephant car washes feature in game developers licensed logos and signs from local businesses griesemer called game world an abstraction of seattle rather than a re creation since its layout did not suit second sons gameplay and required team to make necessary changes team wanted to thematically explore seattle s heritage of pacific northwest native american tribes in game designers used graphic sliders in game engine to determine amount of water covering streets like seattle rain is frequent in game lighting effects such as neon light from delsin s powers coupled with reflections help bring color into seattle s dark and rainy atmosphere because of move to ps4 sucker punch were able to render more open world than what was possible in previous infamous games you get a better feel of city when you can see more of it said griesemer after deciding on seattle for setting developers began to think about superpowers that delsin would possess they added neon lighting to city to amplify beautiful reflective streets and subsequently decided to make neon a source of power for delsin because of its prevalence animation director billy harper considered delsin s smoke powers challenging to design as team wanted to make powers feel more fluid than in previous infamous games they removed cole s contorted hand poses to improve connection between delsin and his powers fox felt that smoke helps delsin deftly navigate game world by letting him zip up buildings and through enemies griesemer who previously worked with bungie on halo series wanted to bring fluidity of first person shooters to second sons combat team reviewed control scheme of previous infamous games and removed some of complexity that was preventing people from interacting with game griesemer said that a recurring theme throughout infamous games that they wanted to continue with second son was idea of modern elemental powers variations on commonplace powers drawn from game world producer brian fleming found that graphical effects helped to inform players of amount of power delsin possesses this is a game about super powers so for us way effects look tells you a lot about how you re playing game he explained fox considered that game world s resemblance to seattle helped superpower elements feel authentic because we have that sweet foundation of plausibility you buy into super powered element he explained character development second sons premise is built from ending of infamous 2 that sees protagonist cole macgrath sacrifice himself to save humanity they looked at trophy data and found majority 78 of infamous 2 players chose this ending and concurred with popular choice this allowed them to create new protagonist delsin from scratch moving forward onto second son we said alright cole s dead people have voted for this let s make a new hero fox explained griesemer felt that taking infamous series to ps4 signified a new era and that departing from story of previous games would help them reach new audiences we needed a new entry point and delsin was first step for that he explained idea to move away from cole s story came about during pre production staff meetings and was confirmed after discussions both internally and with sony computer entertainment griesemer described contemporaneous sentiment as it s going to be new hardware a new platform and we re going to have a new audience thumb right 280px game informer journalist dan ryckert participated in a demonstration of motion capture process where people s faces were captured and rendered in game using high definition digital cameras alt a digital rendering of a man s face in a motion capture software delsin s native american heritage came from game s setting in pacific northwest which features a large native american population delsin wears a beanie inspired by one that harper would wear around studio harper recounted one particular staff meeting where four of six team members were wearing hats delsin s character was inspired by united kingdom street artist banksy as development team appreciated banksy s clandestine satirical work developing delsin s personality team posited hypothetical what if johnny knoxville had powers what would he do with it harper considered delsin full of reckless abandon kind of character that would upon gaining superpowers jump off a cliff to see what happens fox considered delsin flawed in a way i think a lot of us can relate to trying to live up to his successful brother reggie he called game s story a hero s journey digital domain were brought on board for motion capture work fox helped direct actors performances but found that they did not need much guidance for their roles you need to let them understand what you need from a scene but actors are so much better equipped to deliver that than me he explained fleming considered that using motion capture added authenticity to characters ability to capture delsin s facial reaction when he s like oh shit but doesn t say oh shit that s a big deal he explained most of non player characters npcs that inhabit open world were motion captured developers contacted casting agencies and asked their friends and families if they would like to appear as extras in game over 75 people were scanned in a three day period they were seated in chairs and told not to move or smile and a high definition digital camera captured a 3d model of their faces camera sent out strobe light patterns to capture volume and shape of each face a 360 degree setup captured actors moving bodies but mannequins were also used to help capture different clothing styles data collected from cameras was used by designers to render digital models each composed of roughly 1 4 million polygons any blank spots on models would be digitally filled in by designers to render models in game data would be compressed by reducing polygon count release on february 20 2013 sony held a conference in new york that announced playstation 4 fox appeared on stage during conference and recounted participating in an anti globalization protest in seattle in 1999 he announced second son and a debut trailer was shown that

pack infamous first light received mixed to positive reviews from critics reception infamous second son received generally favorable reviews according to review aggregator metacritic vince ingenito of ign recalled being left staring slack jawed at visuals and called open world beautifully and diversely realized with impressive lighting effects tom mc shea of gamespot called visuals incredible oli welsh of eurogamer praised seattle s art direction and found draw distances and frame rate consistent david meikleham of playstation official magazine opm was very impressed with graphics and 1080p definition but cited occasional frame rate dips during intense combat he enjoyed playing in seattle and using his powers to level destructible environments hussain of computer and video games cvg praised graphical details like particle and lighting systems game is colorful rich in detail and has some of best effects we ve seen on console he wrote gamespot s mc shea considered combat well balanced between infamous s slower pace and infamous 2s frenetic action and enjoyed delsin s agility and power chris carter of destructoid considered combat s simplicity its strength finding delsin easy to control and navigate world edge were underwhelmed with game s opening because of its skittish parkour but noted that once delsin gained powers and reached seattle game became very fun they felt that enemies were clever enough to make combat a fun challenge and called main missions for most part well designed and generously proportioned ign s ingenito enjoyed using delsin s powers in combat and called each set strong enough to hang an entire game on he found upgrading delsin s powers helped keep combat fresh and made for good replay value philip kollar of polygon favored using neon power but praised balance and variety between all of them he called combat a hell of a lot of fun eurogamer s welsh found combat imperfect yet fun but did not think that upgrading delsin s skills made enough of a difference to his power destructoid s carter thought that delsin was a more interesting protagonist than wooden cole which helped his investment into story ign s ingenito thought delsin was an interesting lead character especially because of chemistry with reggie he found troy baker s performance of delsin imbued with a charm and youthful abandon that keeps it from feeling or overwrought however he found supporting characters like fetch underdeveloped and narrative too straightforward although calling characters cliched edge felt that they were written and acted well gamespot s mc shea called delsin annoying and immature and found gameplay more interesting than tired story eurogamer s welsh considered plot driven by inconsequential macguffins and thought ending rushed but praised story for not stretching on too long polygon s kollar felt that story did not explore its themes of surveillance and security over freedom well enough such that its impact was diminished he was overall disappointed with narrative despite finding main characters written better than in previous infamous games opm s meikleham was put off by delsin s arrogance and was underwhelmed with story but he was impressed by quality of motion capture performances edge and eurogamer s welsh faulted morality system because they did not think it had enough influence on story ign s ingenito called it woefully outdated and felt that making evil choices severely jarred with delsin s character he found system redundant because delsin became more powerful when he strictly adhered to either a good or evil play style rather than crossing in between gamespot s mc shea felt that morality system was too binary because there was no moral gray area between playing good and evil polygon s kollar reflected mc shea s opinion that morality choices were too binary and had difficulty connecting to his choices because they were too polarized between good and evil opm s meikleham felt that morality system had little to no impact on gameplay danny cowan of joystiq thought that morality system was well balanced with equal incentive and drawback tied to delsin s choices gamespot s mc shea found second sons open world beholden to a dated formula he described seattle as a playground for you to go nuts in instead of a living breathing world with existing only as fodder for players hussain called seattle hauntingly empty with sparsely distributed npcs behaving he felt that open world s lifelessness was game s biggest detractor and he drew unfavorable comparison with grand theft auto v sleeping dogs and assassin s creed iv black flag which he felt featured better open worlds eurogamer s welsh felt that second son did not innovate open world genre as well as it could have because it relied too heavily on many of genre s tropes polygon s kollar felt that there was not enough variation in missions and activities as virtually all culminate in goal of beating up more soldiers or thugs edge found amount of content in game thin finding little merit in additional playthroughs because of repetitive side missions approach second son as an action game that just happens to be set in a nonlinear environment and it makes more sense they wrote destructoid s carter found amount of content ample and enjoyed liberating city and collecting blast shards tom watson wrote in new statesman that second son was his ps20 ps40 game of year and justification for his purchasing playstation 4 after owning xbox 360 sales infamous second son sold over one million copies in nine days after its launch making it one of best selling playstation 4 games as well as fastest selling installment in series references external links infamous second son entry at playstation com
