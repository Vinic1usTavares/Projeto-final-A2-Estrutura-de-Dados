echoes silence patience grace is sixth studio album by american rock band foo fighters released on september 25 2007 by rca records album is noted for a blend of regular rock and acoustic tracks with shifting dynamics which emerged from variety of styles employed on demos band produced it also marks second time band worked with producer gil norton whom frontman dave grohl brought to fully explore potential of his compositions and have a record that sounded different from their previous work grohl tried to focus on songs with messages that resonated with his audience writing reflective lyrics which drew inspiration from birth of his daughter critical reception to echoes silence patience grace was mostly positive with praise to sonic variety and songwriting though some reviewers found record inconsistent and uninspired album topped charts in united kingdom australia new zealand and austria and had three successful singles pretender long road to ruin and let it die echoes silence patience grace was nominated for five grammy awards winning best rock album and was also awarded brit award of best international album background and recording tour for foo fighters fifth album in your honor had both acoustic and electric shows to fit song variety in that record frontman dave grohl discussed this with rca music group president clive davis on how it d be so cool if foo fighters were band that did those different shows that appealed to specific audiences and they wouldn t necessarily have to go to both to which davis replied that you can do both together grohl took this advice when composing his following album grohl added that we didn t plan new album to be half rock and half acoustic picking songs band considered best with demos which ranged from psycho fucking nomeansno to sloppy tom petty country to fucking piano driven songs since grohl felt songs were different from band s previous input and had potential to be something great he considered that instead of doing something like last three albums band had to go out of our own comfort zone and needed someone to push us out of there so grohl decided to work again with gil norton who produced band s second album colour and shape citing how norton taught band of importance of pre production and refining composition and claiming norton s unconventional approach seems to capture best of this band considering that with him we re not going to do a straightforward ac dc record he s gonna make it different this is our best record in years kerrang august 2007 preparation was extensive first grohl had his usual start off by developing demos with drummer taylor hawkins but for first time grohl tried to input vocals and lyrics in this early composition stage after rounding up composition with guitarist chris shiflett and bassist nate mendel grohl spent two weeks with norton discussing arrangements harmony and melody and reducing song ideas and then band spent four weeks rehearsing playing a song a day from noon to midnight hawkins stated that we basically played each of these songs 100 different times trying every little thing every different way and that it was first time since colour and shape that dave had to deal with someone in room questioning all his ideas given more laid back approach of previous producer nick raskulinecz ten years with foo fighters and we still want to know who is taylor hawkins drum december 2007 grohl claimed choices were for most powerful dramatic songs there s a part of me that will never lose love of riffs kerrang september 2007 and that there was an effort to make everything sound as natural as possible just like on albums we grew up listening to citing 1970s artists such as neil young and wings as a major influence shiflett added that for first time he played lead guitar in some tracks while grohl usually works out all bits of composition recording began on march 2007 at studio 606 in dave grohl s virginia home s basement studio has since been moved to northridge california foo fighters deep into recording com april 27 2007 as band took a ten day break in april grohl thought that record needed another uptempo song so he spent his time developing an unfinished song that became pretender sessions wrapped in mid june beebe joe 6 8 07 post accessed april 15 2012 and for first time band did not feel need to rerecord any song grohl stated that while in your honor was a double album because he felt schizophrenic to alternate between loud and acoustic songs norton helped on sequencing tracks into an album that makes sense thumb left kaki king is featured in ballad of beaconsfield miners alt a bespectacled woman plays a guitar album features foo fighters first instrumental ballad of beaconsfield miners it was written by grohl after meeting with one of miners involved in beaconsfield mine collapse who requested an ipod with in your honor in it during incident as grohl was moved by this action he decided to write something just to dedicate to him that night because he definitely seemed like a hero and later promised to include instrumental on album cohen jonathan billboard com july 6 2007 album version features kaki king whom grohl invited to record song as she was visiting studio 606 grohl later said that i showed it to her once and she shredded 10 times better than i ever played it another guest was guitarist pat smear who had been a bandmember from 1995 to 1998 and a guest musician on tour for in your honor smear who has since been reinstated as a full on member described his participation as oddest recording experience i had with foo fighters given he had no input in composition and was going in and playing on a song that was already written composition echoes silence patience grace offers a mix of both electric and acoustic songs which grohl likened to band growing older and comfortable with all kinds of music instead of just focusing on straight rock songs saying that listening to album he felt like we ve gotten over our insecurities because it presents us in a way that we probably hid in past grohl also stated that idea now is to step up and make zombies and oracle album he claimed to have listened most during production and that it has always been my dream to mix steely dan with nomeansno amidst amount of heavier tracks and themes grohl decided to include song cheer up boys your make up is running described as most light hearted melodic song of all which seemed like a little ray of hope in middle of all this despair grohl added that there was a bigger focus on melodies even in heavier tracks such as pretender let it die and erase replace and that album closer home a ballad featuring grohl on piano was best song i ve ever written songs of album are noted for their changing dynamics with middle sections that turn into this mass orchestrated swarm and ridiculous time signatures which include musical references to 1970s soft rock bands such as wings eagles and bread summed by hawkins by saying band wanted to make sure that everything built on this record that each instrument started somewhere and went somewhere else in course of a song drummer attributed this to acoustic tour leading band to shed some of fear of incorporating mellower stuff with heavy stuff and grohl added that we wanted stops to be pin drop silent before exploding if we had a beautiful melody we d throw a fucking string quartet in there so we did everything we could to really magnify all those elements and that was fun usually you have a few parameters you re afraid to pass but this time there was no fear of going too far mix engineer rich costey added that his work to preserve what band had done to a fairly large degree with balancing and rides to get dynamics to happen was difficult given sonic variety of echoes which went from foo fighters endless walls of guitar overdubs almost like a swarm of bees to string quartets challenge of this type of mix is to retain power of track yet define a space for everything as acoustic tour made grohl realize we were making music worth listening to rather than music made for pummelling person next to you he decided to give more importance to lyrics and have a connection with crowd in front of us considering that among many compositions band made on pre production ones that stand out are ones that say something what we do isn t changing world kerrang september 2007 so for first time lyrics started being written before recording begun with grohl stating that he sat in back of studio and just wrote every day for about 14 hours a day most of lyrics of album deal with themes of birth death and life which grohl attributed to birth of his daughter violet considering that having a child changes your entire outlook on world and that he was suddenly more emotional so when you re writing music with that in mind or that in your heart everything just blooms into this fucking incredibly colourful colourful feeling helped by extensive lyrical preparation lyrics also tried to show more of grohl s feelings those things that you ve always wanted to do or always wanted to say with hawkins adding that he could not listen to stranger things have happened as i m one of his best friends and last thing i want to do is read a love letter to his wife or whoever it is packaging cover art was made by invisible creature and features a combination between an aerial bomb and a vacuum tube to juxtapose weapon with another object that traditionally wasn t associated with war or violence remainder of album sleeve has similar juxtapositions of objects that reflected album s tone of life and mortality album s title comes from a lyric on album s final song home grohl stated that as he struggled to think of a title given musical variety of album even considering title one with that song on it regarding chosen title grohl thought it was nice because it s open to interpretation and it s a beautiful title and i think album is beautiful in its diversity and its melody and its musicality it goes from delicate acoustic moments to heaviest shit we ve ever done release and promotion album s

that while record was not ground breaking foos have found a way to create their own archetype with an instinctive feel for what constitutes a killer song and praised how damn near flawless tone of whole set feels rolling stones david fricke praised sonic variety described by him as an anthology of strong new songs by a great bunch of bands all calling themselves foo fighters jessica letkemann of billboard was acceptive of delicious sundown grooves of quieter piece and foos usual soft louder loudest radio friendly unit shifters referencing a track of nirvana s in utero while considering

praised production of album and felt that grohl singing gets better and better with every record dave simpson of guardian called echoes silence patience grace band s most accomplished album praising composition and saying that gil norton s stunning production can t disguise raw humanity beneath sheen a few critics considered album not as inspired as band s previous work kyle anderson of spin wrote that two thirds of these tracks sound a lot like songs grohl has done before considering that album s strengths came from handful of songs that deviate from wallop n wail template allmusic reviewer stephen thomas erlewine also felt rock songs were not as remarkable compared to almost effortlessly engaging melodies of softer songs ultimately describing echoes silence patience grace as just another foo fighters album instead of consolidation of strengths that it was intended to be pitchfork s adam considered that album feels like a retread and that band was sounding less and less relatable with ineffective acoustic tracks and rock songs that sound cold and detached compared to heart wrenching foo pop gems like big me or while sputnikmusic reviewer john hanson was acceptive of rock songs where he felt boys are most comfortable he considered that songwriting has just become stale and ultimately described echoes silence patience grace as extremely boring and uninspired popmatters josh was very critical of overtly serious tone of record compared to lighthearted work band had done before joking that title of cheer up boys sounds like suggestion of a concerned fan for
