lord banquo thane of lochaber is a character in william shakespeare s 1606 play macbeth in play he is at first an ally to macbeth both are generals in king s army and they meet three witches together after prophesying that macbeth will become king witches tell banquo that he will not be king himself but that his descendants will be later macbeth in his lust for power sees banquo as a threat and has him murdered by two hired assassins banquo s son fleance escapes banquo s ghost returns in a later scene causing macbeth to react with alarm during a public feast shakespeare borrowed character banquo from holinshed s chronicles a history of britain published by raphael holinshed in 1587 in chronicles banquo is an accomplice to macbeth in murder of king rather than a loyal subject of king who is seen as an enemy by macbeth shakespeare may have changed this aspect of his character to please king james who was thought at time to be a descendant of real banquo critics often interpret banquo s role in play as being a foil to macbeth resisting evil whereas macbeth embraces it sometimes however his motives are unclear and some critics question his purity he does nothing to accuse macbeth of murdering king even though he has reason to believe macbeth is responsible sources alt two men on horseback meet three women all are in elizabethan dress right thumb macbeth and banquo meeting witches in a woodcut from holinshed s chronicles shakespeare often used raphael holinshed s chronicles of england scotland and ireland commonly known as holinshed s chronicles as a source for his plays and in macbeth he borrows from several of tales in that work holinshed portrays banquo as an historical figure he is an accomplice in mac bethad mac findlaich s macbeth s murder of donnchad mac crinain king duncan and plays an important part in ensuring that macbeth not mael coluim mac donnchada malcolm takes throne in coup that follows holinshed in turn used an earlier work scotorum historiae 1526 7 by hector boece as his source boece s work is first known record of banquo and his son fleance and scholars such as david bevington generally consider them fictional characters invented by boece in shakespeare s day however they were considered historical figures of great repute and king james i based his claim to throne in part on a descent from banquo house of stuart was descended from walter fitz alan steward of scotland and he was believed to have been grandson of fleance and gruffydd ap llywelyn s daughter nesta ferch gruffydd in reality walter fitz alan was son of alan fitz a breton knight unlike his sources shakespeare gives banquo no role in king s murder making it a deed committed solely by macbeth and his wife lady macbeth why shakespeare s banquo is so different from character described by holinshed and boece is not known though critics have proposed several possible explanations first among them is risk associated with portraying king s ancestor as a murderer and conspirator in plot to overthrow a rightful king as well as author s desire to flatter a powerful patron but shakespeare may also simply have altered banquo s character because there was no dramatic need for another accomplice to murder there was however a need to provide a dramatic contrast to macbeth a role that many scholars argue is filled by banquo similarly when jean de schelandre wrote about banquo in his in 1611 he also changed character by portraying him as a noble and honourable man critic d w maskell describes him as schelandre s paragon of valour and virtue probably for reasons similar to shakespeare s banquo s role in coup that follows murder is harder to explain banquo s loyalty to macbeth rather than malcolm after duncan s death makes him a passive accomplice in coup malcolm as prince of cumberland is rightful heir to throne and macbeth a usurper daniel argued that macbeth as it survives is a revision of an earlier play in which duncan granted macbeth not only title of thane of cawdor but greater honor of prince of cumberland i e heir to throne of scotland banquo s silence may be a survival from posited earlier play in which macbeth was legitimate successor to duncan role in play alt dark painting showing two figures encountering witch like creatures thumb upright macbeth and banquo with witches by henry fuseli banquo is in a third

wounded soldier describes manner in which macbeth thane of glamis and banquo thane of lochaber resisted invading forces fighting side by side in next scene banquo and macbeth returning from battle together encounter three witches who predict that macbeth will become thane of cawdor and then king banquo sceptical of witches challenges them to predict his own future and they foretell that banquo will never himself take throne but will beget a line of kings banquo remains sceptical after encounter wondering aloud if evil can ever speak truth he warns macbeth that evil will offer men a small hopeful truth only to catch them in a deadly trap macbeth act 1 scene 3 when macbeth kills king and takes throne banquo only one aware of this encounter with witches reserves judgment for god he is unsure whether macbeth committed regicide to gain throne but muses in a soliloquy that i fear thou play dst most for t macbeth act 3 scene 1 lines 2 3 he offers his respects to new king macbeth and pledges loyalty macbeth act 3 scene 1 later worried that banquo s descendants and not his own will rule scotland macbeth sends two men and then a third murderer to kill banquo and his son fleance during melee banquo holds off assailants so that fleance can escape but is himself killed macbeth act 3 scene 3 ghost of banquo later returns to haunt macbeth at banquet in act three scene four a terrified macbeth sees him while apparition is invisible to his guests he appears again to macbeth in a vision granted by three witches wherein macbeth sees a long line of kings descended from banquo macbeth act 4 scene 1 analysis foil to macbeth alt painting showing men meeting three figures emerging from a cave thumb macbeth and banquo meeting three witches by john wootton many scholars see banquo as a foil and a contrast to macbeth macbeth for example eagerly accepts three witches prophecy as true and seeks to help it along banquo on other hand doubts prophecies and intentions of these seemingly evil creatures whereas macbeth places his hope in prediction that he will be king banquo argues that evil only offers gifts that lead to destruction banquo steadily resists temptations of evil within play praying to heaven for help while macbeth seeks darkness and prays that evil powers will aid him this is visible in act two after banquo sees duncan to bed he says there s husbandry in heaven their candles are all out macbeth act 2 scene 1 lines 4 5 this premonition of coming darkness in association with macbeth s murders is repeated just before banquo is killed it will be rain to night macbeth act 3 scene 3 line 16 banquo tells his son fleance banquo s status as a contrast to macbeth makes for some tense moments in play in act two scene one banquo meets his son fleance and asks him to take both his sword and his dagger hold take my sword take thee that too he also explains that he has been having trouble sleeping due to cursed thoughts that nature gives way to in repose macbeth act 2 scene 1 lines 8 9 on macbeth s approach he demands sword returned to him quickly scholars have interpreted this to mean that banquo has been dreaming of murdering king as macbeth s accomplice to take throne for his own family as three witches prophesied to him in this reading his good nature is so revolted by these thoughts that he gives his sword and dagger to fleance to be sure they do not come true but is so nervous at macbeth s approach that he demands them back other scholars have responded that banquo s dreams have less to do with killing king and more to do with macbeth they argue that banquo is merely setting aside his sword for night then when macbeth approaches banquo having had dreams about macbeth s deeds takes back his sword as a precaution in this case macbeth eventually sees that banquo can no longer be trusted to aid him in his evil and considers his friend a threat to his newly acquired throne thus he has him murdered banquo s ability to live on in different ways is another oppositional force in this case to macbeth s impending death his spirit lives on in fleance his son and in his ghostly presence at banquet ghost scenes when macbeth returns to witches later in play they show him an apparition of murdered banquo along with eight of his descendants scene carries deep significance king james on throne when macbeth was written was believed to be separated from banquo by nine generations what shakespeare writes here thus amounts to a strong support of james right to throne by lineage and for audiences of shakespeare s day a very real fulfilment of witches prophecy to banquo that his sons would take throne this apparition is also deeply unsettling to macbeth who not only wants throne for himself but also desires to father a line of kings banquo s other appearance as a ghost during banquet scene serves as an indicator of macbeth s conscience returning to plague his thoughts banquo s triumph over death appears symbolically insofar as he literally takes macbeth s seat during feast shocked macbeth uses words appropriate to metaphor of usurpation describing banquo as crowned with wounds spirit drains macbeth s manhood along with blood from his cheeks as soon as banquo s form vanishes macbeth announces why so being gone i am a man again macbeth act 3 scene 4 lines 106 107 like vision of banquo s lineage banquet scene has also been subject of criticism critics have questioned whether not one but perhaps two ghosts appear in this scene banquo and duncan scholars arguing that duncan attends banquet state that macbeth s lines to ghost could apply equally well to slain king thou canst not say i did it for example can mean that macbeth is not man who actually killed banquo or it can mean that duncan who was asleep when macbeth killed him cannot claim to have seen his killer to add to confusion some lines macbeth directs to ghost such as thy bones are macbeth act 3 scene 4 line 91 cannot rightly be said of banquo who has only recently died scholars debate whether macbeth s vision of banquo is real or a hallucination macbeth had already seen a hallucination before murdering duncan a knife hovering in air several performances of play have even ignored stage direction to have ghost of banquo enter at all heightening sense that macbeth is growing mad since audience cannot see what he claims to see scholars opposing this view claim that while dagger is unusual ghosts of murdered victims are more believable having a basis in audience s superstitions spirits in other shakespeare plays notably hamlet and midsummer night s dream exist in ambiguous forms occasionally even calling into question their own presence concept of a character being confronted at a triumphant feast with a reminder of their downfall is not unique to shakespeare and may originate from belshazzar s feast as portrayed in bible term ghost at feast has entered popular culture and is often used as a metaphor for a subject a person would rather avoid considering or considering general plot of macbeth a reminder of a person s unpleasant past or likely future performances and interpretations left 300px thumb

text states enter ghost of banquo and sits in macbeth s place macbeth act 3 scene 4 several television versions have altered this slightly having banquo appear suddenly in chair rather than walking onstage and into it special effects and camera tricks also allow producers to make ghost disappear and reappear highlighting fact that only macbeth can see it stage directors unaided by post production effects and camera tricks have used other methods to depict ghost in late 19th century elaborate productions of play staged by henry irving employed a wide variety of approaches for this task in 1877 a green silhouette was used to create a ghostlike image ten years later a trick chair was used to allow an actor to appear in middle of scene and then again from midst of audience in 1895
