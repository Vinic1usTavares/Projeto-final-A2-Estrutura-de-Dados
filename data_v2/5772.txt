victoria cross vc is highest and most prestigious award of british honours system it is awarded for valour in presence of enemy to members of british armed forces it may be awarded posthumously it was previously awarded to commonwealth countries most of which have established their own honours systems and no longer recommend british honours it may be awarded to a person of any military rank in any service and to civilians under military command although no civilian has received award since 1879 since first awards were presented by queen victoria in 1857 two thirds of all awards have been personally presented by british monarch these investitures are usually held at buckingham palace vc was introduced on 29 january 1856 by queen victoria to honour acts of valour during crimean war since then medal has been awarded 1 358 times to 1 355 individual recipients only 15 medals of which 11 were to members of british army and four were to members of australian army have been awarded since second world war traditional explanation of source of metal from which medals are struck is that it derives from russian cannon captured at siege of sevastopol however research has suggested another origin for material historian john glanfield has established that metal for most of medals made since december 1914 came from two chinese cannon and that there is no evidence of russian origin glanfield 2005 pp 24 35 owing to its rarity vc is highly prized and medal has fetched over ps400 000 at auction a number of public and private collections are devoted to victoria cross private collection of lord ashcroft amassed since 1986 contains over one tenth of all vcs awarded following a 2008 donation to imperial war museum ashcroft collection went on public display alongside museum s victoria and george cross collection in november 2010 beginning with centennial of confederation in 1967 canada followed in 1975 by australia and new zealand developed their own national honours systems separate from and independent of british or imperial honours system as each country s system evolved operational gallantry awards were developed with premier award of each system victoria cross for australia canadian victoria cross and victoria cross for new zealand being created and named in honour of victoria cross these are unique awards of each honours system recommended assessed gazetted and presented by each country origin in 1854 after 39 years of peace britain found itself fighting a major war against russia crimean war was one of first wars with modern reporting and dispatches of william howard russell described many acts of bravery and valour by british servicemen that went unrewarded ashcroft 2006 preface before crimean war there was no official standardised system for recognition of gallantry within british armed forces officers were eligible for an award of one of junior grades of order of bath and brevet promotions while a mention in despatches existed as an alternative award for acts of lesser gallantry this structure was very limited in practice awards of order of bath were confined to officers of field rank original warrant foreword brevet promotions or mentions in despatches were largely confined to those who were under immediate notice of commanders in field generally members of commander s own staff british gallantry awards p 283 other european countries had awards that did not discriminate against class or rank france awarded legion d honneur legion of honour established 1802 and netherlands gave order of william established in 1815 there was a growing feeling among public and in royal court that a new award was needed to recognise incidents of gallantry that were unconnected with length or merit of a man s service queen victoria issued a warrant under royal sign manual on 29 january 1856 gazette publishing original royal warrant gazetted 5 february 1856 that officially constituted vc order was backdated to 1854 to recognise acts of valour during crimean war ashcroft michael p 7 10 queen victoria had instructed war office to strike a new medal that would not recognise birth or class medal was meant to be a simple decoration that would be highly prized and eagerly sought after by those in military services to maintain its simplicity queen victoria under guidance of prince albert vetoed suggestion that award be called military order of victoria and instead suggested name victoria cross original warrant stated that victoria cross would only be awarded to officers and men who had served in presence of enemy and had performed some act of valour or devotion original warrant clause 5 first ceremony was held on 26 june 1857 at which queen victoria invested 62 of 111 crimean recipients in a ceremony in hyde park london manufacture a single company of jewellers hancocks of london has been responsible for production of every vc awarded since its inception it has long been widely believed that all vcs were cast from cascabels of two cannon that were captured from russians at siege of sevastopol however in 1990 creagh and ashton conducted a metallurgical examination of vcs in custody of australian war memorial and later historian john glanfield wrote that through use of x ray studies of older victoria crosses it was determined that metal used for almost all vcs since december 1914 is taken from antique chinese guns replacing an earlier gun glanfield 2005 pp 24 35 creagh noted existence of chinese inscriptions on cannon which are now barely legible due to corrosion a likely explanation is that these cannon were taken as trophies during first opium war and held in woolwich repository it was also thought that some medals made during first world war were composed of metal captured from different chinese guns during boxer rebellion this is not so however vcs examined by creagh and ashton both in australia 58 and at qe ii army memorial museum in new zealand 14 spanned entire time during which vcs have been issued and no compositional inconsistencies were found it was also believed that another source of metal was used between 1942 and 1945 to create five second world war vcs when sevastopol metal went missing creagh accessed army records at mod donnington in 1991 and did not find any gaps in custodial record composition found in ww2 vcs amongst them those for edwards australia and upham new zealand is similar to that for early ww1 medals this is likely to be due to reuse of material from earlier casting defective medals etc barrels of chinese cannon are on display in artillery hall of royal armouries at fort nelson hampshire remaining portion of only remaining cascabel weighing 358 oz 10 kg is stored in a vault maintained by 15 regiment royal logistic corps at mod donnington it can only be removed under armed guard it is estimated that approximately 80 to 85 more vcs could be cast from this source appearance thumb front and back of edward holland s vc alt

exchange their ribbons for new colour although army warrants state colour as being red it is defined by most commentators as being crimson or wine red since 1917 a miniature of cross has been affixed

approves award with his or her signature victoria cross awards are always promulgated in london gazette with single exception of award to american unknown soldier in 1921 victoria cross warrant makes no specific provision as to who should actually present medals to recipients queen victoria indicated that she would like to present medals in person and she presented 185 medals out of 472 gazetted during her reign including first 62 medals presented at a parade in hyde park on 26 june 1857 by queen victoria nearly 900 awards have been personally presented to recipient by reigning british monarch nearly 300 awards have been presented by a member of royal family or by a civil or military dignitary about 150 awards were either forwarded to recipient or next of kin by registered post or no details of presentations are known pillinger dennis staunton a p 73 original royal warrant did not contain a specific clause regarding posthumous awards although official policy was not to award vc posthumously between indian mutiny in 1857 and beginning of second boer war names of six officers and men were published in london gazette with a memorandum stating they would have been awarded victoria cross had they survived a further three notices were published in london gazette in september 1900 and april 1901 for gallantry in second boer war in an exception to policy for boer war six posthumous victoria crosses three to those mentioned in notices in 1900 and 1901 and a further three were granted on 8 august 1902 first official posthumous awards five years later in 1907 posthumous policy was reversed for earlier wars and medals were sent to next of kin of six officers and men whose names were mentioned in notices in gazette dating back to indian mutiny victoria cross warrant was not amended to explicitly allow posthumous awards until 1920 but one quarter of all awards for world war i were posthumous crook mj chapter 8 pp 68 90 process and motivations of selecting medal s recipients has sometimes been interpreted as inconsistent or overly political most common observation being that victoria cross may be given more often for engagements that senior military personal would like to publicly promote 1920 royal warrant made provision for awards to women serving in armed forces no woman has been awarded a vc in case of a gallant and daring act being performed by a squadron ship s company or a detached body of men such as marines in which all men are deemed equally brave and deserving of victoria cross then a ballot is drawn officers select one officer ncos select one individual and private soldiers or seamen select two individuals original warrant clause 13 in all 46 awards have been awarded by ballot with 29 of awards during indian mutiny four further awards were granted to q battery royal horse artillery at korn on 31 march 1900 during second boer war final ballot awards for army were six awards to lancashire fusiliers at w beach during landing at gallipoli on 25 april 1915 although three of awards were not gazetted until 1917 final seven ballot awards were only naval ballot awards with three awards to two q ships in 1917 and four awards for zeebrugge raid in 1918 provision for awards by ballot is still included in victoria cross warrant but there have been no further such awards since 1918 between 1858 and 1881 victoria cross could be awarded for actions taken under circumstances of extreme danger not in face of enemy warrant amendment dated 10 august 1858 six such awards were made during this period five of them for a single incident during an expedition to andaman islands in 1867 in 1881 criteria were changed again and vc was only awarded for acts of valour in face of enemy due to this it has been suggested by many historians including lord ashcroft that changing nature of warfare will result in fewer vcs being awarded colonial awards victoria cross was extended to colonial troops in 1867 extension was made following a recommendation for gallantry regarding colonial soldier major charles heaphy for action in new zealand wars in 1864 he was operating under british command and vc was gazetted in 1867 later that year government of new zealand assumed full responsibility for operations but no further recommendations for victoria cross were raised for local troops who distinguished themselves in action following gallant actions by three new zealand soldiers in november 1868 and january 1869 during new zealand wars an order in council on 10 march 1869 created a distinctive decoration for members of local forces without seeking permission from secretary of state for colonies although governor was chided for exceeding his authority order in council was ratified by queen title distinctive decoration was later replaced by title new zealand cross abbott pe tamplin jma chapter 34 pp 230 236 question of whether awards could be made to colonial troops not serving with british troops was raised in south africa in 1881 surgeon john mccrea an officer of south african forces was recommended for gallantry during hostilities which had not been approved by british government he was awarded victoria cross and principle was established that gallant conduct could be rewarded independently of any political consideration of military operations more recently four australian soldiers were awarded victoria cross in vietnam although britain was not involved in conflict crook mj chapter 19 pp 242 251 indian troops were not originally eligible for victoria cross since they had been eligible for indian order of merit since 1837 which was oldest british gallantry award for general issue when victoria cross was created indian troops were still controlled by honourable east india company and did not come under crown control until 1860 european officers and men serving with honourable east india company were not eligible for indian order of merit and victoria cross was extended to cover them in october 1857 it was only at end of 19th century that calls for indian troops to be awarded victoria cross intensified indian troops became eligible for award in 1911 first awards to indian troops appeared in london gazette on 7 december 1914 to sing negi and khudadad khan negi was presented with victoria cross by king george v during a visit to troops in france presentation

january 1991 although it is a separate award its appearance is identical to its british counterpart canada followed suit when in 1993 queen elizabeth signed letters patent creating canadian vc which is also similar to british version except that legend has been changed from for valour to latin this language was chosen so as to favour neither french nor english two official languages of canada new zealand was third country to adapt vc into its own honours system while new zealand and australian vcs are technically separate awards decoration is identical to british design including being cast

to be dropped authority and privileges as highest award for valour of united kingdom victoria cross is always first award to be presented at an investiture even before knighthoods as was shown at investiture of private johnson beharry who received his medal before general sir mike jackson received his knighthood beharry johnson p 359 owing to its status vc is always first decoration worn in a row of medals and it is first set of post nominal letters used to indicate any decoration or order similar acts of extreme valour that do not take place in face of enemy are honoured with george cross gc which has equal precedence but is awarded second because gc is newer there is a widespread though erroneous belief that it is statutory for all ranks to salute a bearer of victoria cross there is no official requirement that appears in official warrant of vc nor in queen s regulations and orders but tradition dictates that this occurs and as such senior officers will salute a private awarded a vc or gc as there was no formal order of wear laid down victoria cross was at first worn as recipient fancied it was popular to pin it on left side of chest over heart with other decorations grouped around vc queen s regulations for army of 1881 gave clear instructions on how to wear it vc had to follow badge of order of indian empire in 1900 it was ordained in dress regulations for army that it should be worn after cross of a member of royal victorian order it was only in 1902 that king edward vii gave cross its present position on a bar brooch sir ivan de la bere queen s orders of chivalry

on these matters however lummis was aware of short comings in his own work and encouraged david harvey to continue it result was harvey s seminal book monuments to courage in 2007 royal mail used
