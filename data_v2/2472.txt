propose that names of valkyries themselves contain no individuality but are rather descriptive of traits and nature of war goddesses and are possibly descriptive creations of skalds examples include davidson 1988 96 97 and simek 2007 349 some valkyrie names may be descriptive of roles and abilities of valkyries valkyrie name herja has been theorised as pointing to a connection to name of goddess

loan or loan translation of old norse but cotton cleopatra a iii and corpus glossary instances appear to show an anglo saxon conception of that was independent of contemporary scandinavian influence two old english charms mention figures that are theorised as representing an anglo saxon notion of valkyries or valkyrie like female beings a charm to cure a sudden pain or stitch and for a swarm of bees a charm to keep honey bees from swarming in a sudden pain is attributed to a small shrieking spear thrown with supernatural strength by fierce loudly flying mighty women who have ridden over a

have been proposed that these figures are connected to valkyries greenfield 1996 257 richard north says that though it is not clear what poet takes these women to be their female sex riding in flight and throwing spears suggest that they were imagined in england as a female being analogous to later norse north 1997 105 hilda ellis davidson theorizes that was originally a battle spell that had over

wild and fly to woods be as mindful of my welfare as is each man of eating and of home greenfield 1996 256 term victory women has been theorised as pointing to an association with valkyries this

one of two old high german merseburg incantations call upon female beings idisi to bind and hamper an army incantation reads once idisi sat sat here and there some bound fetters some hampered army some untied fetters escape from fetters flee from enemies simek 2007 171 idisi mentioned in incantation are generally considered to be valkyries rudolf simek says that these idisi are obviously a kind of valkyrie as these also have power to hamper enemies in norse mythology and points to a connection with valkyrie name old norse army fetter hilda r davidson compares incantation to old english charm and theorises a similar role for them both simek says that west germanic term idisi refers to a dignified well respected woman married or unmarried possibly a term for any woman and therefore glosses exactly latin and that a link to north germanic term is reasonable to assume yet not undisputed in addition place name idisiaviso meaning plain of idisi where forces commanded by arminius fought those commanded by germanicus at battle of weser river in 16 ad simek points to a connection between name idisiaviso role of idisi in one of two merseburg incantations and valkyries regarding simek states that old norse appears commonly as simply a term for woman just as old high german old saxon and old english and may have also been used to denote a type of goddess according to simek several of sources might lead us to conclude that were valkyrie like guardians of dead and indeed in i 19 valkyries are even called odin s are explicitly called dead women in 28 and a secondary belief that were souls of dead women see also underlies of icelandic folklore simek 2007 61 62 simek says that as function of matrons was also extremely varied fertility goddess personal guardians but also warrior goddesses belief in like belief in valkyries norns and matrons may be considered to be different manifestations of a belief in a number of female half goddesses jacob grimm states that though norns and valkyries are similar in nature there is a fundamental difference between two grimm states that a can be both norn and a valkyrie but their functions are separate and usually persons norns have to pronounce fate they sit on their chairs or they roam through country among mortals fastening their threads nowhere is it said that they ride ride to war decide issues of fighting and conduct fallen to heaven their riding is like that of heroes and gods grimm 1882 421 origins and development thumb upright norns 1889 by johannes gehrts various theories have been proposed about origins and development of valkyries from germanic paganism to later norse mythology rudolf simek suggests valkyries were probably originally viewed as demons of dead to whom warriors slain on battlefield belonged and that a shift in interpretation of valkyries may have occurred when concept of valhalla changed from a battlefield to a warrior s paradise simek says that this original concept was superseded by shield girls irish female warriors who lived on like einherjar in valhall simek says that valkyries were closely associated with odin and that this connection existed in an earlier role as demons of death simek states that due to shift of concept valkyries became popular figures in heroic poetry and during this transition were stripped of their demonic characteristics and became more human and therefore become capable of falling in love with mortals simek says that majority of names of valkyries point to a warlike function that most of valkyrie names do not appear to be very old and that names mostly come from poetic creativity rather than from real folk belief macleod and mees theorise that role of corpse choosing valkyries became increasingly confused in later norse mythology with that of norns supernatural females responsible for determining human destiny macleod 2006 39 hilda ellis davidson says that regarding valkyries evidently an elaborate literary picture has been built up by generations of poets and storytellers in which several conceptions can be discerned we recognise something akin to norns spirits who decide destinies of men to who could protect men in battle with their spells to powerful female guardian spirits attached to certain families bringing luck to youth under their protection even to certain women who armed themselves and fought like men for whom there is some historical evidence from regions round black sea she adds that there may also be a memory in this of a priestess of god of war women who officiated at sacrificial rites when captives were put to death after battle davidson 1990 61 davidson places emphasis on fact that valkyrie literally means chooser of slain she compares wulfstan s mention of a chooser of slain in his lupi ad sermon which appears among a blacklist of sinners witches and evildoers to all other classes whom he wulfstan mentions and concludes as those are human ones it seems unlikely that he has introduced mythological figures as well davidson points out that arab traveller ibn fadlan s detailed account of a 10th century rus ship funeral on volga river features an old woman massive and grim to look upon who fadlan refers to as angel of death who organises killing of slave girl and has two other women with her that fadlan refers to as her daughters davidson says that it would hardly be surprising if strange legends grew up about such women who must have been kept apart from their kind due to their gruesome duties since it was often decided by lot which prisoners should be killed idea that god chose his victims through instrument of priestesses must have been a familiar one apart from obvious assumption that some were chosen to fall in war davidson says that it appears that from early times germanic peoples believed in fierce female spirits doing command of war god stirring up disorder taking part in battle seizing and perhaps devouring slain davidson 1990 61 62 freyja and folkvangr thumb left freya 1882 by carl emil doepler goddess freyja and her afterlife field folkvangr where she receives half of slain has been theorized as connected to valkyries britt mari nasstrom points out description in gylfaginning where it is said of freyja whenever she rides into battle she takes half of slain and interprets folkvangr as field of warriors nasstrom notes that just like odin freyja receives slain heroes who have died on battlefield and that her house is which she translates as filled with many seats a dwelling that nasstrom posits likely fills same function as valhalla nasstrom comments that still we must ask why there are two heroic in old norse view of afterlife it might possibly be a consequence of different forms of initiation of warriors where one part seemed to have belonged to odinn and other to freyja these examples indicate that freyja was a war goddess and she even appears as a valkyrie literally one who chooses slain nasstrom 1999 61 siegfried andres dobat comments that in her mythological role as chooser of half fallen warriors for her death realm folkvangr goddess freyja however emerges as mythological role model for and disir dobat 2006 186 modern
