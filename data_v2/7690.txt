uss washington bb 56 was second and final member of of fast battleships first vessel of type built for united states navy built under washington treaty system north carolinas design was limited in displacement and armament though united states used a clause in second london naval treaty to increase main battery from original armament of nine guns to nine guns ship was laid down in 1938 and completed in may 1941 while united states was still neutral during world war ii her initial career was spent training along east coast of united states until after japan attacked pearl harbor on 7 december 1941 bringing united states into war washington was initially deployed to britain to reinforce home fleet which was tasked with protecting convoys carrying supplies to soviet union she saw no action during this period as german fleet remained in port and washington was recalled to us in july 1942 to be refitted and transferred to pacific immediately sent to south pacific to reinforce allied units fighting guadalcanal campaign ship became flagship of rear admiral willis lee she saw action at naval battle of guadalcanal on night of 14 15 november in company with battleship and four destroyers after south dakota inadvertently drew heavy japanese fire by sailing too closely to admiral nobutake kondo s squadron washington took advantage of japanese preoccupation with south dakota to inflict fatal damage on japanese battleship and destroyer while avoiding damage herself washingtons attack disrupted kondo s planned bombardment of marine positions on guadalcanal and forced remaining japanese ships to withdraw from 1943 onward she was primarily occupied with screening fast carrier task force though she also occasionally shelled japanese positions in support of various amphibious assaults during this period washington participated in gilbert and marshall islands campaign in late 1943 and early 1944 mariana and palau islands campaign in mid 1944 and philippines campaign in late 1944 and early 1945 operations to capture iwo jima and okinawa followed in 1945 and during later stages of battle of okinawa washington was detached to undergo an overhaul though by time it was completed japan had surrendered ending war washington then moved to east coast of us where she was refitted to serve as a troop transport as part of operation magic carpet and then carrying a group of over 1 600 soldiers home from britain she was thereafter decommissioned in 1947 and assigned to atlantic reserve fleet where she remained until 1960 when she was stricken from naval register and sold for scrap next year design thumb left recognition drawing of north carolina class north carolina class was first new battleship design built under washington naval treaty system her design was bound by terms of second london naval treaty of 1936 which added a restriction on her main battery of guns no larger than general board evaluated a number of designs ranging from traditional battleships akin to standard series or fast battleships and ultimately a fast battleship armed with nine 14 inch guns was selected after ships were authorized however united states invoked escalator clause in treaty that allowed an increase to guns in event that any member nation refused to sign treaty which japan refused to do washington was long overall and had a beam of and a draft of her standard displacement amounted to and increased to at full combat load ship was powered by four general electric steam turbines each driving one propeller shaft using steam provided by eight oil fired babcock wilcox boilers rated at turbines were intended to give a top speed of ship had a cruising range of at a speed of she carried three vought os2u kingfisher floatplanes for aerial reconnaissance which were launched by a pair of aircraft catapults on her fantail her peace time crew numbered 1 800 officers and enlisted men but crew swelled to 99 officers and 2 035 enlisted during war thumb illustration of north carolinas main battery turret and barbette structure ship was armed with a main battery of nine 16 in 45 caliber mark 6 guns guns in three triple gun turrets on centerline two of which were placed in a superfiring pair forward with third aft secondary battery consisted of twenty 38 caliber dual purpose guns mounted in twin turrets clustered amidships five turrets on either side as designed ship was equipped with an anti aircraft battery of sixteen guns and eighteen 50 caliber 12 7 mm m2 browning machine guns but her anti aircraft battery was expanded greatly during her career main armored belt was thick while main armored deck was up to thick main battery gun turrets had thick faces and they were mounted atop barbettes that were protected with same thickness of steel conning tower had thick sides ship s armor layout had been designed with opponents equipped with 14 inch guns in mind but since treaty system broke down just before construction began her design could not be revised to improve scale of protection to defend against heavier guns despite this shortcoming north carolina class proved to be more successful battleships than better armored but very cramped modifications washington received a number of upgrades over course of her career primarily consisting of radar and a new light anti aircraft battery ship received three mark 3 fire control radar sets for main battery four mark 4 radars for secondary guns a cxam air search radar and an sg surface search radar during her early 1944 refit she received an sk air search radar in place of cxam and a second sg radar her mark 3 radars were replaced with more advanced mark 8 sets though she retained one of mark 3s as a backup her mark 4 radars were later replaced with a combination of mark 12 and mark 22 sets in her final refit in august and september 1945 she had an sk radar forward an sr air search set aft and an sg radar in both positions a tdy jammer was installed on her forward fire control tower washingtons 1 1 in battery was replaced with forty bofors guns in ten quadruple mounts in april 1943 and in august number of guns had increased to sixty in fifteen quadruple mounts her original light battery of eighteen 50 cal machine guns was decreased to twelve and twenty oerlikon autocannon in single mounts were installed in early 1942 in june she had her 50 cal battery increased to twenty eight barrels but by september all were replaced in favor of a uniform battery of forty 20 mm cannon during april 1943 refit her anti aircraft armament was increased to a total of sixty four 20 mm cannon a year later in april 1944 she lost one of single mounts in favor of an experimental quadruple 20 mm mount in november 1944 ship was slated to have battery reduced to 48 barrels but this never happened and instead in early 1945 she had eight single mounts replaced with eight twin mounts bringing her final 20 mm battery to seventy five guns

crowds of spectators a huge gantry towers over ship keel for washington was laid down on 14 june 1938 at philadelphia naval shipyard her completed hull was launched on 1 june 1940 and after completing fitting out work she was commissioned into fleet on 15 may 1941 she began builder s sea trials on 3 august but like her sister ship she suffered from excessive vibration while running at high speed from her original three bladed screws tests with north carolina produced a workable solution though problem was never fully corrected two four bladed screws on outer shafts and two five bladed propellers on inboard shafts tests continued during her shakedown cruise and subsequent initial training which were conducted along east coast of united states as far south as gulf of mexico she conducted high speed tests on 2 december during which she reached her designed speed during this period united states was still neutral during world war ii washington frequently trained with north carolina and aircraft carrier with washington serving as flagship of rear admiral john w wilcox jr commander of battleship division batdiv 6 part of atlantic fleet her initial working up training continued into 1942 by which time country had entered war as a result of japanese attack on pearl harbor and germany s subsequent declaration of war atlantic operations with country now at war washington was assigned as flagship of task force tf 39 still under wilcox s command which departed for britain on 26 march unit which included wasp and heavy cruisers and were to reinforce british home fleet based in scapa flow home fleet had been weakened by need to detach units particularly force h to take part in invasion of madagascar and american battle group was needed to help counter german battleship and other heavy surface units based in occupied norway next day while crossing atlantic wilcox was swept overboard tuscaloosa and a pair of destroyers searched for admiral and wasp sent aircraft aloft to assist effort but lookouts on destroyer spotted him face down in water having already drowned search was called off and task force continued on to its destination rear admiral robert c giffen aboard wichita took command of unit which was met at sea by british cruiser on 3 april ships arrived in scapa flow two days later where it came under command of admiral john tovey commander of home fleet thumb washington on 29 may 1941 shortly after commissioning on 15 may for rest of month washington and other american ships were occupied with battle practice and familiarization training with home fleet to prepare different countries ships for joint operations tf 39 was redesignated tf 99 in late april washington still serving as flagship ships embarked on their first operation on 28 april to conduct a sweep for german warships ahead of supply convoy pq 15 to soviet union ships of tf 99 operated with elements of home fleet including battleship and carrier during operation king george v accidentally rammed and sank destroyer washington was following too closely to avoid wreckage and as she passed over sinking destroyer punjabis depth charges exploded shock from blast damaged some of washingtons radars and fire control equipment and caused a small leak in one of her fuel tanks king george v had to return to port for repairs but washington and rest of tf 99 remained at sea until 5 may ships stopped at hvalfjordur iceland where they took on supplies from supply ship ships remained in iceland until 15 may when they got underway to return to scapa flow arriving there on 3 june next day admiral harold rainsford stark commander of naval forces europe visited ship and made her his temporary headquarters on 7 june king george vi came aboard to inspect washington and after stark left she resumed escorting convoys in arctic these included convoys qp 12 pq 16 and pq 17 first two occurred at same time with qp 12 returning from soviet union while pq 16 carrying another load of supplies and weapons washington victorious and battleship provided distant support but was not directly engaged by german u boats and aircraft that raided pq 16 qp 12 largely evaded german attention and passed without significant incident pq 17 operation resulted in disaster when reconnaissance incorrectly reported tirpitz heavy cruisers and and nine destroyers to be approaching to attack convoy when in reality germans were still off coast of norway their progress having been hampered by several of vessels running aground reports of german heavy units at sea prompted convoy commander to order his ships to scatter which left them vulnerable to u boats and luftwaffe attacks that sank twenty four of thirty five transport ships while in hvalfjordur on 14 july giffen moved his flag back to wichita and washington escorted by four destroyers got underway to return to united states she arrived in gravesend bay on 21 july and moved to brooklyn navy yard two days later for an overhaul pacific operations guadalcanal campaign left thumb washington off new york in august 1942 en route to pacific after completing refit washington got underway on 23 august bound for pacific with an escort of three destroyers she passed through panama canal on 28 august and arrived in nuku alofa in tonga on 14 september there she became flagship of rear admiral willis lee then commander of batdiv 6 and task group tg 12 2 on 15 september washington sailed to meet ships of tf 17 centered on carrier ships thereafter operated together and went to noumea in new caledonia to begin operations in support of campaign in solomon islands ships based out of noumea and espiritu santo in new hebrides covered convoys bringing supplies and reinforcements to marines fighting on guadalcanal into early november during one of these convoy operations in mid october washington a pair of cruisers and five destroyers provided distant support but were too far away to take part in battle of cape esperance on night of 11 12 october shortly thereafter washington was transferred to tf 64 surface combatant force assigned to guadalcanal area still under lee s command at this time unit also included one heavy and two light cruisers and six destroyers over course of 21 24 october japanese land based reconnaissance aircraft made repeated contacts with tf 64 as a japanese fleet approached area but in battle of santa cruz islands that began on 25th japanese concentrated their air attacks on american carriers of tf 17 and 61 on 27 october japanese submarine attempted to torpedo washington but missed by early november us fleet had been reduced considerably in offensive power carriers wasp and hornet had been sunk leaving just carrier washington and new battleship as only capital ships available to allied forces fighting in campaign washington joined other two ships in tf 16 which also included heavy cruiser and nine destroyers ships sortied on 11 november to return to fighting off guadalcanal cruiser and two more destroyers joined them following day on 13 november after learning that a major japanese attack was approaching halsey detached south dakota washington and four of destroyers as task group 16 3 again under lee s command enterprise her forward elevator damaged from action at santa cruz was kept to south as a reserve and to prevent sole operational american carrier in pacific from being lost ships of tg 16 3 were to block an anticipated japanese bombardment group in waters off guadalcanal naval battle of guadalcanal thumb japanese battleship washingtons opponent off guadalcanal as lee s task group approached guadalcanal his japanese counterpart admiral nobutake kondo steamed to meet him with his main bombardment force consisting of fast battleship heavy cruisers and and a destroyer screen while en route tg 16 3 was re designated as tf 64 on 14 november ships passed to south of guadalcanal and then rounded western end of island to block kondo s expected route japanese aircraft reported sighting lee s formation but identification of ships ranged from a group of cruisers and destroyers to aircraft carriers causing confusion among japanese commanders that evening american reconnaissance aircraft spotted japanese warships off savo island prompting lee to order his ships to general quarters four destroyers were arrayed ahead of two battleships american task force having been thrown together a day before had not operated together as a unit and both of battleships had very limited experience shooting their main battery particularly at night at around 23 00 on 14 november leading japanese destroyers in a screening force commanded by shintaro hashimoto sent ahead of kondo s main force spotted lee s ships and turned about to warn kondo while washingtons search radar picked up a japanese cruiser and a destroyer at about same time ships fire control radars then began tracking japanese vessels and lee ordered both of his battleships to open fire when ready washington fired first with her main battery at 23 17 at a range of while her secondary guns fired star shells to illuminate targets followed shortly by south dakota one of japanese destroyers revealed her position by opening fire on american destroyer screen allowing washington to target her inflicting serious damage that disabled her propulsion machinery and started a major fire shortly thereafter at about 23 30 an error in electrical switchboard room knocked out power aboard south dakota disabling her radar systems and leaving ship all but blind to japanese vessels approaching force by this time hashimoto s ships had inflicted serious damage on american destroyer screen two of destroyers were torpedoed one of which survived until following morning and a third was destroyed by gunfire washington was now left essentially alone to engage japanese squadron though they had yet to actually detect her presence while washingtons captain kept his ship on disengaged side of flaming wrecks of destroyer screen south dakota was forced to turn in front of one of burning destroyers to avoid a collision which backlit her to japanese ships drawing their fire and allowing washington to engage them undisturbed thumb washington fires on kirishima note low elevation of gun barrels alt two large gun turrets are trained to starboard with superstructure in background flames are shooting out of one or more of guns in both nearer of two turrets and an unseen gun astern at 23 35 washingtons sg radar detected kondo s main force and tracked them for next twenty minutes at 23 58 south dakotas power was restored and her radar picked up japanese ships less than ahead two minutes later leading japanese ship atago illuminated south dakota with her search lights and japanese line promptly opened fire scoring twenty seven hits washington still undetected opened fire allocating two of her 5 inch guns to engage atago and two to fire star shells while rest joined her main battery in battering kirishima at a range of washington scored probably nine 16 inch hits and as many as forty 5 inch hits inflicting grievous damage kirishima was badly holed below waterline her forward two turrets were knocked out and her rudder was jammed forcing her to steer in a circle to port with an increasing starboard list washington then shifted fire to atago and takao and though straddled former failed to score any significant hits barrage nevertheless convinced both cruisers to turn off their search lights and reverse course in an attempt to launch torpedoes at 00 13 two cruisers fired a spread of sixteen long lance torpedoes at washington then about away though they all missed at 00 20 lee turned his sole surviving combatant he had ordered surviving destroyers to disengage earlier in engagement and south dakotas captain having determined that his ship had been damaged sufficiently to prevent her from taking further action decided to break off as well to close with kondo s cruisers atago and takao briefly engaged with their main batteries and former launched three more torpedoes all of which missed kondo then ordered light forces of his reconnaissance screen to make a torpedo attack but hashimoto s ships were far out of position and were unable to comply rear admiral raizo tanaka who was escorting a supply convoy to guadalcanal and had thus far not participated in action detached two destroyers to aid kondo when these ships arrived on scene lee ordered washington to turn to reverse course at 00 33 to avoid a possible torpedo attack from destroyers tanaka s two destroyers closed to launch their torpedoes while washington was disengaging prompting her to take evasive maneuvers while withdrawing to south lee kept washington far west of damaged american warships so that any japanese vessels pursuing him would not be drawn onto damaged vessels an hour later kondo cancelled bombardment and attempted to contact kirishima but after failing to receive a response sent destroyers to investigate crippled battleship she was found burning furiously still turning slowly to port as progressively worsening flooding disabled her boilers at 03 25 she capsized and sank by this time had also been abandoned and sank as a result of damage inflicted by washington by 09 00 washington had formed back up with south dakota and destroyers benham and to withdraw from area in addition to blocking kondo s planned bombardment lee had delayed tanaka s convoy late enough that transports could not unload under cover of darkness and so they were forced to beach themselves on island where they were repeated attacked and badly damaged by aircraft from enterprise and henderson field field artillery and destroyer later that morning later operations thumb washington off hawaii in mid 1943 washington returned to screening carriers of tf 11 and tf 16 enterprise while south dakota departed for repairs by late november lee s command was reinforced by north carolina followed later by battleship these battleships were grouped together as tf 64 still under lee s command and they covered convoys to support fighting in solomons into next year these operations included covering a group of seven transports carrying elements of 25th infantry division to guadalcanal from 1 to 4 january 1943 during another of these convoy operations later that month lee s battleships were too far south to be able to reach american cruiser force during battle of rennell island washington remained in south pacific until 30 april when she departed noumea for pearl harbor on way she joined ships of tf 16 ships arrived on 8 may for next twenty days washington operated as flagship of tf 60 which conducted combat training off coast of hawaii on 28 may she went into dry dock at pearl harbor navy yard for repairs and installation of new equipment once this work was completed she resumed training exercises in area until 27 july when she got underway with a convoy bound for south pacific for voyage she was attached to tg 56 14 and on arriving in area was detached on 5 august to proceed independently to havannah harbor at efate in new hebrides which she reached two days later washington spent next two months conducting tactical training with carrier task forces in efate area in preparation for upcoming campaigns in central pacific now part of tg 53 2 which included three other battleships and six destroyers washington got underway on 31 october ships met tg 53 3 centered on carriers enterprise and next day for extensive training exercises that lasted until 5 november groups then dispersed and washington left with escorting destroyers for viti levu in fiji islands which she reached on 7 november gilberts and marshall islands campaign thumb left a douglas sbd dauntless flying over washington off gilberts washington still lee s flagship sortied on 11 november in company with ships of 8 and 9 and four days later they joined tg 50 1 centered on carrier fleet proceeded on to gilbert islands where marines were preparing to land on tarawa carriers of tf 50 launched their strikes on 19 november continuing into next day as marines went ashore on tarawa and makin attacks continued through 22 november when fleet steamed to north of makin to patrol area on 25 november groups of tf 50 were reorganized and washington was transferred to tg 50 4 along with carriers and and battleships south dakota and from 26 to 28 november carrier groups operated off makin to cover landing of troops and supplies on island japanese aircraft attacked groups on 27 and 28 november but they inflicted little damage on american ships on 6 december with fighting in gilberts over washington was detached to create tg 50 8 along with north carolina south dakota alabama indiana and covered by bunker hill monterey and eleven destroyers battleships were sent to bombard island of nauru two days later thereafter returning to efate on 12 december ships remained there only briefly before departing on 25 december for gunnery training with north carolina and four destroyers ships returned to port on 7 january 1944 at which time washington was assigned to tg 37 2 along with bunker hill and monterey ships got underway on 18 january bound for next target in campaign marshall islands ships stopped briefly in funafuti in ellice islands on 20 january before departing three days later to meet rest of what was now tf 58 unit which comprised fast carrier task force had been created under command of rear admiral marc mitscher on 6 january washingtons unit was accordingly re numbered as tg 58 1 having arrived off main target at kwajalein by late january washington screened carriers while they conducted extensive strikes on island and neighboring taroa on 30 january washington massachusetts and indiana were detached from carriers to bombard kwajalein with an escort of four destroyers after returning to carriers next day battleships resumed guard duty while carriers resumed their air strikes while patrolling off island in early hours of 1 february indiana cut in front of washington to go refuel a group of destroyers causing latter to ram former and significantly damaging both ships washington had some of bow plating torn from her bow causing it to collapse two vessels withdrew to majuro for temporary repairs washingtons crumpled bow was reinforced to allow her to steam to pearl harbor on 11 february for further temporary repairs after arriving there she was fitted with a temporary bow before continuing on to puget sound navy yard in bremerton washington for permanent repairs once work was completed ship joined batdiv 4 and took on a group of 500 passengers before departing for pearl harbor she arrived there on 13 may and disembarked passengers and proceeding back to fleet at majuro on arrival on 7 june she resumed her service as now vice admiral lee s flagship mariana and palau islands campaign thumb washington off coast of california in april 1944 shortly after washington arrived fleet got underway to begin assault on mariana islands carriers struck targets on saipan tinian guam rota and pagan to weaken japanese defenses before ground forces went ashore at time she was assigned to tg 58 7 which consisted of seven fast battleships was distributed between four carrier task groups on 13 june washington and several other battleships were detached to bombard saipan and tinian before being relieved by amphibious force s bombardment group next day on 15 june fast carrier task force steamed north to hit targets in volcano and bonin islands including iwo jima jima and haha jima at same time marines stormed beaches on saipan landing was a breach of japan s inner defensive perimeter that triggered japanese fleet to launch a major counter thrust with 1st mobile fleet main carrier strike force ozawa s departure was observed by american submarine other submarines including and tracked japanese fleet as it approached keeping admiral raymond spruance fifth fleet commander informed of their movements as japanese fleet approached north carolina and rest of tf 58 steamed to meet it on 18 june leading to battle of philippine sea on 19 20 june north carolina and other battleships with four cruisers and thirteen destroyers were deployed some west of carrier groups to screen likely path of approach japanese launched their aircraft first and as they probed american fleet s defenses washington and north carolina were first battleships to open fire on attacking japanese aircraft during action which was fought primarily by carriers us fleet inflicted serious losses on japanese destroying hundreds of their aircraft and sinking three carriers with 1st mobile fleet defeated and withdrawing washington and rest of tf 58 returned to marianas she continued to screen carriers during battle of guam until 25 july when washington steamed with carriers of tg 58 4 to raid palau islands attacks lasted until 6 august when washington indiana alabama light cruiser and escorting destroyers were detached as tg 58 7 to proceed to eniwetok after arriving there on 11 august ships refueled and replenished ammunition and other supplies remaining there for most of month on 30 august task group got underway with rest of fast carrier strike force which by now had been transferred to third fleet command and renumbered tf 38 at this time washington was assigned to tg 38 3 ships sailed first south to admiralty islands and then west back to palaus there carriers began a series of strikes from 6 to 8 september on various targets in palaus washington contributed her heavy guns to bombardment of peleliu and anguar before marines assaulted both islands later that month on 9 and 10 september task groups 38 1 38 2 and 38 3 left palaus to raid japanese airfields on mindanao in southern philippines part of standard practice to neutralize nearby positions that could interfere with upcoming assault on palaus finding few japanese forces on island carriers shifted north to visayas in central philippines from 12 to 14 september carrier groups then withdrew to refuel at sea before returning to philippines to attack airfields on luzon from 21 and 22 september before making further attacks on installations in visayas on 24 september carrier groups then proceeded north to make a series of strikes on airfields in okinawa formosa and luzon in preparation for upcoming invasion of philippines philippines campaign thumb movements of american forces in black and japanese forces in red during battle of leyte gulf tf 38 embarked on raids to isolate philippines and suppress units of 1st air fleet on 6 october washington remained lee s flagship attached to tg 38 3 first operation was a major strike on japanese air bases on island of okinawa on 10 october next day ships of tg 38 3 refueled at sea before joining other three task groups for major raids on formosa that took place from 12 to 14 october as fleet withdrew next day it defended itself against heavy japanese air attacks though ships of tg 38 3 were not directly engaged as japanese attacks concentrated on task groups 38 1 and 38 4 on 16th a submarine reported observing a japanese squadron consisting of three cruisers and eight destroyers to try to locate damaged allied warships and tg 38 3 and tg 38 2 steamed north to catch them but aircraft were only able to locate and sink a torpedo boat on 17 october two task groups withdrew to south to cover invasion of leyte with rest of tf 38 same day that elements of sixth army went ashore raids on luzon continued into 19 october by this time washington had been reassigned to tg 38 4 screening enterprise fleet carrier and light carriers and on 21 october tg 38 4 withdrew to refuel during which time they also covered withdrawal of ships that had been damaged during formosa raid which were still on their way to ulithi tg 38 4 was recalled to leyte next day battle of leyte gulf landing on leyte led to activation of operation sho go 1 japanese navy s planned riposte to an allied landing in philippines plan was a complicated operation with three separate fleets 1st mobile fleet now labeled northern force under jisaburo ozawa center force under takeo kurita and southern force under shoji nishimura ozawa s carriers by now depleted of most of their aircraft were to serve as a decoy for kurita s and nishimura s battleships which were to use distraction to attack invasion fleet directly kurita s ships were detected in san bernardino strait on 24 october and in ensuing battle of sibuyan sea american carrier aircraft sank powerful battleship causing kurita to temporarily reverse course this convinced admiral william f halsey commander of third fleet to send fast carrier task force to destroy 1st mobile fleet which had by then been detected washington steamed north with carriers and on way halsey established tf 34 under lee s command consisting of washington and five other fast battleships seven cruisers and eighteen destroyers on morning of 25 october mitscher began his first attack on northern force initiating battle off cape engano over course of six strikes on japanese fleet americans sank all four carriers and damaged two old battleships that had been converted into hybrid carriers unknown to halsey and mitscher kurita had resumed his approach through san bernardino strait late on 24 october and passed into leyte gulf next morning while mitscher was occupied with decoy northern force kurita moved in to attack invasion fleet in battle off samar he was held off by a group of escort carriers destroyers and destroyer escorts tu 77 4 3 known as taffy 3 frantic calls for help later that morning led halsey to detach lee s battleships to head south and intervene however halsey waited more than an hour after receiving orders from admiral chester w nimitz commander u s pacific fleet to detach tf 34 still steaming north during this interval delay added two hours to battleships voyage south a need to refuel destroyers further slowed tf 34 s progress south heavy resistance from taffy 3 threw kurita s battleships and cruisers into disarray and led him to break off attack before washington and rest of tf 34 could arrive halsey detached battleships and as tg 34 5 to pursue kurita through san bernardino strait while lee took rest of his ships further southwest to try to cut off his escape but both groups arrived too late historian h p wilmott speculated that had halsey detached tf 34 promptly and not delayed battleships by refueling destroyers ships could have easily arrived in strait ahead of center force and owing to marked superiority of their radar directed main guns destroyed kurita s ships later operations left thumb washington anchored at puget sound navy yard in april 1944 after battle units of tf 38 withdrew to ulithi to replenish fuel and ammunition for further operations in philippines carrier task forces got underway again on 2 november for more strikes on airfields on luzon and visayas that continued until 14 november when they withdrew again to ulithi arriving there three days later on 18 november lee exchanged flagships with rear admiral edward hanson commander of batdiv 9 who had used south dakota as his flagship at same time washington was transferred to tg 38 3 in company with south dakota and north carolina ships sortied on 22 november for gunnery training while carriers conducted strikes independently against targets in philippines over next three days she arrived back in ulithi on 2 december where crew made repairs and loaded ammunition and stores for future operations units of tf 38 got underway again on 11 december for more attacks on luzon to suppress japanese aircraft as amphibious force prepared for its next landing on island of mindoro in western philippines raid lasted from 14 to 16 december and while fleet withdrew to refuel on 17 december typhoon cobra swept through area battering fleet and sinking three destroyers damage inflicted on fleet delayed further support of ground troops for two days and continuing bad weather led halsey to break off operations ships arrived back in ulithi on 24 december on 30 december fleet got underway to make preparatory strikes for landing on luzon washington remained with tg 38 3 for operation carriers struck formosa again on 3 and 4 january 1945 after refueling at sea on 5 january carriers struck kamikazes massed at airfields on luzon on 6 and 7 january to neutralize them before invasion of lingayen gulf further attacks on formosa and okinawa followed on 9 january next day carrier groups entered south china sea where it refueled and then struck targets in french indochina on assumption that significant japanese naval forces were present but only merchant ships and a number of minor warships were caught and sunk there during these raids other elements of allied fleet invaded lingayen gulf on luzon iwo jima and okinawa campaigns thumb washington with other ships of task group 38 3 operating off okinawa in may 1945 in february she escorted carriers during attacks on japanese island of honshu to disrupt japanese air forces that might interfere with planned invasion of iwo jima in volcano islands fifth fleet had re assumed command of fast carrier task force by this point and washington was now part of tg 58 4 fleet sortied from ulithi on 10 february and after conducting training exercises off tinian on 12th refueled at sea on 14 february and continued on north to launch strikes on tokyo area two days later raids continued through 17 february and next day fleet withdrew to refuel and tg 58 4 was sent to hit other islands in bonin chain to further isolate iwo jima during preparatory bombardment for that attack washington north carolina and heavy cruiser were detached from task group to reinforce tf 54 assault force for invasion she remained on station during marine assault and provided fire support as they fought their way across island through 22 february next day carrier groups reassembled and refueled on 24 february for further operations against japanese mainland after leaving iwo jima fleet resumed air attacks on home islands to prepare for next amphibious assault on okinawa in ryukus first of these on 25 and 26 february hit targets in tokyo area followed by another attack on iwo jima next day fleet refueled on 28 february and on 1 march raided okinawa thereafter returning to ulithi on 4 march while in ulithi fleet was reorganized and washington was transferred to tg 58 3 fleet sortied on 14 march for additional attacks on japan ships refueled on 16 march on way and they launched their aircraft two days later to hit targets in kyushu attacks continued into next day causing significant damage to japanese facilities on island and sinking or damaging numerous warships task groups withdrew to refuel and reorganize on 22 march as several carriers had been damaged by kamikaze and air attacks carriers and franklin were badly damaged by bombs and north carolina was assigned to group of ships tasked with escorting them back to ulithi for repairs on 24 march washington bombarded japanese positions on okinawa as fleet continued to pummel defenses before invasion by this time washington had been transferred to tg 58 2 carrier raids on home islands and ryukus continued after landing on okinawa on 1 april while operating off island fleet came under heavy and repeated kamikaze attacks one of largest of which took place on 7 april in concert with sortie of battleship washington was not damaged in these attacks however which were largely defeated by carriers combat air patrols on 19 april battleship again closed with okinawa to bombard japanese positions as marines fought their way south washington remained

washington and north carolina in may 1954 which would have provided an anti aircraft battery of twelve guns in twin turrets ships slow speed prevented them from effectively serving with carrier task forces and navy determined that a speed of would be necessary to achieve this power plant would have to provide at current displacement even removing aft turret and using that magazine space for additional boilers would not have produced necessary power by removing all of belt armor ship would have only required to reach desired speed but aft hull would have had to have been significantly rebuilt to accommodate larger screws that would have been required navy considered possibility of removing ships current propulsion system altogether and replacing it with same type as used in iowas which were capable of but there was not enough room to fit larger system to reach same speed washington would have needed to have all side armor and all three turrets removed in addition to a power plant capable of cost of project estimated at around 40 million per ship was deemed to be prohibitively expensive and so project was abandoned ship remained in inventory until 1 june 1960 when ship
