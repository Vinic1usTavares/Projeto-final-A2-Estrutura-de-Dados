stein in 1924 with hemingway s son jack she coined phrase lost generation first book of sun also rises is set in mid 1920s paris americans were drawn to paris in roaring twenties by favorable exchange rate with as many as 200 000 english speaking expatriates living there paris tribune reported in 1925 that paris had an american hospital an american library and an american chamber of commerce reynolds 1990 48 49 many american writers were disenchanted with us where they found less artistic freedom than in europe for example hemingway was in paris during period when ulysses written by his friend james joyce was banned and burned in new york oliver 1999 316 318 themes of sun also rises appear in its two epigraphs first is an allusion to lost generation a term coined by gertrude stein referring to post war generation hemingway may have used term as an early title for novel according to biographer james mellow term originated from a remark in french made to gertrude stein by owner of a garage speaking of those who went to war c est une generation perdue literally they are a lost generation see mellow 1992 1985 191 other epigraph is a long quotation from ecclesiastes one generation passeth away and another generation cometh but earth abideth for ever sun also and sun goeth down and to his place where he arose hemingway told his editor max perkins that book was not so much about a generation being lost but that earth abideth forever he thought characters in sun also rises may have been battered but were not lost baker 1972 82 hemingway scholar wagner martin writes that hemingway wanted book to be about morality which he emphasized by changing working title from fiesta to sun also rises wagner martin argues that book can be read either as a novel about bored expatriates or as a morality tale about a protagonist who searches for integrity in an immoral world wagner martin 1990 6 9 months before hemingway left for pamplona press was depicting parisian latin quarter where he lived as decadent and depraved he began writing story of a matador corrupted by influence of latin quarter crowd he expanded it into a novel about jake barnes at risk of being corrupted by wealthy and inauthentic expatriates reynolds 1990 62 63 left thumb hemingway at home in his apartment on left bank paris 1924 characters form a group sharing similar norms and each greatly affected by war hemingway captures angst of age and transcends love story of brett and jake although they are representative of period brett is starved for reassurance and love and jake is sexually maimed his wound symbolizes disability of age disillusion and frustrations felt by an entire generation hemingway thought he lost touch with american values while living in paris but his biographer michael reynolds claims opposite seeing evidence of author s midwestern american values in novel hemingway admired hard work he portrayed matadors and prostitutes who work for a living in a positive manner but brett who prostitutes herself is emblematic of rotten crowd living on inherited money it is jake working journalist who pays bills again and again when those who can pay do not hemingway shows through jake s actions his disapproval of people who did not pay up reynolds 1990 45 50 reynolds says that hemingway shows tragedy not so much of decadence of montparnasse crowd but of decline in american values of period as such author created an american hero who is impotent and powerless jake becomes moral center of story he never considers himself part of expatriate crowd because he is a working man to jake a working man is genuine and authentic and those who do not work for a living spend their lives posing reynolds 1990 60 63 women and love twice divorced brett ashley represented liberated new woman in 1920s divorces were common and easy to be had in paris reynolds 1990 58 59 james nagel writes that in brett hemingway created one of more fascinating women in 20th century american literature sexually promiscuous she is a denizen of parisian nightlife and cafes in pamplona she sparks chaos in her presence men drink too much and fight she also seduces young bullfighter romero and becomes a circe in festival nagel 1996 94 96 critics describe her variously as complicated elusive and enigmatic donald daiker writes that hemingway treats her with a delicate balance of sympathy and antipathy daiker 2009 74 she is vulnerable forgiving independent qualities that hemingway juxtaposes with other women in book who are either prostitutes or overbearing nags nagel 1996 99 103 nagel considers novel a tragedy jake and brett have a relationship that becomes destructive because their love cannot be consummated conflict over brett destroys jake s friendship with robert cohn and her behavior in pamplona affects jake s hard won reputation among spaniards meyers sees brett as a woman who wants sex without love while jake can only give her love without sex although brett sleeps with many men it is jake she loves meyers 1985 190 dana fore writes that brett is willing to be with jake in spite of his disability in a non traditional erotic relationship fore 2007 80 other critics such as leslie fiedler and nina baym see her as a supreme bitch fiedler sees brett as one of outstanding examples of hemingway s bitch women fiedler 1975 345 1990 112 jake becomes bitter about their relationship as when he says send a girl off with a man now go and bring her back and sign wire with love qtd in reynolds 1990 60 critics interpret jake brett relationship in various ways daiker suggests that brett s behavior in madrid after romero leaves and when jake arrives at her summons reflects her immorality daiker 2009 80 scott donaldson thinks hemingway presents jake brett relationship in such a manner that jake knew that in having brett for a friend he had been getting something for nothing and that sooner or later he would have to pay bill donaldson 2002 82 daiker notes that brett relies on jake to pay for her train fare from madrid to san sebastian where she rejoins her fiance mike daiker 2009 83 in a piece hemingway cut he has jake thinking you learned a lot about a woman by not sleeping with her by end of novel although jake loves brett he appears to undergo a transformation in madrid when he begins to distance himself from her balassi 1990 144 146 reynolds believes that jake represents everyman and that in course of narrative he loses his honor faith and hope he sees novel as a morality play with jake as person who loses most reynolds 1989 323 324 corrida fiesta and nature thumb 260px hemingway in white trousers and dark shirt fighting a bull in amateur corrida at pamplona fiesta july 1925 in sun also rises hemingway contrasts paris with pamplona and frenzy of fiesta with tranquillity of spanish countryside spain was hemingway s favorite european country he considered it a healthy place and only country that hasn t been shot to pieces he was profoundly affected by spectacle of bullfighting writing it isn t just brutal like they always told us it s a great tragedy and most beautiful thing i ve ever seen and takes more guts and skill and guts again than anything possibly could it s just like having a ringside seat at war with nothing going to happen to you qtd in balassi 1990 127 he demonstrated what he considered purity in culture of bullfighting called aficion and presented it as an authentic way of life contrasted against inauthenticity of parisian bohemians muller 2010 31 32 to be accepted as an aficionado was rare for a non spaniard jake goes through a difficult process to gain acceptance by fellowship of aficion kinnamon 2002 128 hemingway scholar allen josephs thinks novel is centered on corrida bullfighting and how each character reacts to it brett seduces young matador cohn fails to understand and expects to be bored jake understands fully because only he moves between world of inauthentic expatriates and authentic spaniards hotel keeper montoya is keeper of faith and romero is artist in ring he is both innocent and perfect and one who bravely faces death josephs 1987 158 corrida is presented as an idealized drama in which matador faces death creating a moment of existentialism or nada nothingness broken when he vanquishes death by killing bull stoltzfus 2005 215 218 thumb 260px left hemingway named his character romero for pedro romero shown here in goya s etching pedro romero killing halted bull 1816 hemingway presents matadors as heroic characters dancing in a bullring he considered bullring as war with precise rules in contrast to messiness of real war that he and by extension jake experienced critic keneth kinnamon notes that young romero is novel s only honorable character hemingway named romero after pedro romero an 18th century bullfighter who killed thousands of bulls in most difficult manner having bull impale itself on his sword as he stood perfectly still reynolds says romero who symbolizes classically pure matador is one idealized figure in novel reynolds 1989 320 josephs says that when hemingway changed romero s name from and imbued him with characteristics of historical romero he also changed scene in which romero kills a bull to one of receiving bull in homage to historical namesake josephs 1987 163 before group arrives in pamplona jake and bill take a fishing trip to irati river as harold bloom points out scene serves as an interlude between paris and pamplona sections an oasis that exists outside linear time on another level it reflects mainstream of american fiction beginning with pilgrims seeking refuge from english oppression prominent theme in american literature of escaping into wilderness as seen in cooper hawthorne melville twain and thoreau bloom 2007 31 fiedler calls theme sacred land he thinks american west is evoked in sun also rises by pyrenees and given a symbolic nod with name of hotel montana in hemingway s writing nature is a place of refuge and rebirth according to stoltzfus where hunter or fisherman gains a moment of transcendence at moment prey is killed nature is place where men act without women men fish men hunt men find redemption in nature jake and bill do not need to discuss war because their war experience paradoxically is ever present nature scenes serve as counterpoint to fiesta scenes all of characters drink heavily during fiesta and generally throughout novel in his essay alcoholism in hemingway s sun also rises djos says main characters exhibit alcoholic tendencies such as depression anxiety and sexual inadequacy he writes that jake s self pity is symptomatic of an alcoholic as is brett s out of control behavior djos 1995 65 68 william balassi thinks that jake gets drunk to avoid his feelings for brett notably in madrid scenes at end where he has three martinis before lunch and drinks three bottles of wine with lunch balassi 1990 145 reynolds however believes drinking is relevant as set against historical context of prohibition in united states atmosphere of fiesta lends itself to drunkenness but degree of revelry among americans also reflects a reaction against prohibition bill visiting from us drinks in paris and in spain jake is rarely drunk in paris where he works but on vacation in pamplona he drinks constantly reynolds says that prohibition split attitudes about morality and in novel hemingway made clear his dislike of prohibition reynolds 1990 56 57 masculinity and gender critics have seen jake as an ambiguous representative of hemingway manliness for example in bar scene in paris jake is angry at some homosexual men critic ira elliot suggests that hemingway viewed homosexuality as an inauthentic way of life and that he aligns jake with homosexual men because like them jake does not have sex with women jake s anger shows his self hatred at his inauthenticity and lack of masculinity elliot 1995 80 82 his sense of masculine identity is lost he is less than a man elliot 1995 86 88 elliot wonders if jake s wound perhaps signifies latent homosexuality rather than only a loss of masculinity emphasis in novel however is on jake s interest in women elliot 1995 87 hemingway s writing has been called homophobic because of language his characters use for example in fishing scenes bill confesses his fondness for jake but then goes on to say i couldn t tell you that in new york it d mean i was a faggot mellow 1992 312 in contrast to jake s troubled masculinity romero represents an ideal masculine identity grounded in self assurance bravery competence and note that brett is attracted to romero for these reasons and they speculate that jake might be trying to undermine romero s masculinity by bringing brett to him and thus diminishing his ideal stature davidson 1990 97 critics have examined issues of gender misidentification that are prevalent in much of hemingway s work he was interested in cross gender themes as shown by his depictions of effeminate men and boyish women fore 2007 75 in his fiction a woman s hair is often symbolically important and used to denote gender brett with her short hair is androgynous and compared to a boy yet ambiguity lies in fact that she is described as a damned fine looking woman while jake is attracted to this ambiguity romero is repulsed by it in keeping with his strict moral code he wants a feminine partner and rejects brett because among other things she will not grow her hair antisemitism mike lay on bed looking like a death mask of himself he opened his eyes and looked at me hello jake he said very slowly i m getting a little sleep i ve wanted a little sleep for a long time you ll sleep mike don t worry boy brett s got a bullfighter mike said but her jew has gone away damned good thing what sun also rises hemingway 2006 ed 214 hemingway has been called antisemitic most notably because of characterization of robert cohn in book other characters often refer to cohn as a jew and once as a kike oliver 1999 270 shunned by other members of group cohn is characterized as different unable or unwilling to understand and participate in fiesta cohn is never really part of group separated by his difference or his jewish faith critic susan beegel goes so far as to claim hemingway never lets reader forget that cohn is a jew not an unattractive character who happens to be a jew but a character who is unattractive because he is a jew beegel 1996 288 hemingway critic josephine knopf speculates that hemingway might have wanted to depict cohn as a shlemiel or fool but she points out that cohn lacks characteristics of a traditional shlemiel knopf 1987 68 69 cohn is based on harold loeb a fellow writer who rivaled hemingway for affections of duff lady twysden real life inspiration for brett biographer michael reynolds writes that in 1925 loeb should have declined hemingway s invitation to join them in pamplona before trip he was duff s lover and hemingway s friend during fiasco of fiesta he lost duff and hemingway s friendship hemingway used loeb as basis of a character remembered chiefly as a rich jew reynolds 1989 297 writing style novel is well known for its style which is variously described as modern hard boiled or understated as a novice writer and journalist in paris hemingway turned to ezra pound who had a reputation as an unofficial minister of culture who acted as mid wife for new literary talent to mark and blue ink his short stories meyers 1985 70 74 from pound hemingway learned to write in modernist style he used understatement pared away sentimentalism and presented images and scenes without explanations of meaning most notably at book s conclusion in which multiple future possibilities are left for brett and jake wagner martin 1990 2 wrote a fragment of an unpublished sequel in which he has jake and brett meeting in dingo bar in paris with brett is mike campbell see daiker 2009 85 scholar anders hallengren writes that because hemingway learned from pound to distrust adjectives he created a style in accordance with esthetics and ethics of raising emotional temperature towards level of universal truth by shutting door on sentiment on subjective hallengren anders a case of identity ernest hemingway nobelprize org retrieved 15 april 2011 f scott fitzgerald told hemingway to let book s action play itself out among its characters hemingway scholar linda wagner martin writes that in taking fitzgerald s advice hemingway produced a novel without a central narrator hemingway s book was a step ahead it was modernist novel wagner martin 2002 7 when fitzgerald advised hemingway to trim at least 2500 words from opening sequence which was 30 pages long hemingway wired publishers telling them to cut opening 30 pages altogether result was a novel without a focused starting point which was seen as a modern perspective and critically well received wagner martin 1990 11 12 each time he let bull pass so close that man and bull and cape that filled and pivoted ahead of bull were all one sharply etched mass it was all so slow and so controlled it was as though he were rocking bull to sleep he made four veronicas like that and came away toward applause his hand on his hip his cape on his arm and bull watching his back going away bullfighting scene from sun also rises hemingway 2006 ed 221 wagner martin speculates that hemingway may have wanted to have a weak or negative hero as defined by edith wharton but he had no experience creating a hero or protagonist at that point his fiction consisted of extremely short stories not one of which featured a hero hero changed during writing of sun also rises first matador was hero then cohn was hero then brett and finally hemingway realized maybe there is not any hero at all maybe a story is better without any hero qtd in balassi 1990 138 balassi believes that in eliminating other characters as protagonist hemingway brought jake indirectly into role of novel s hero balassi 1990 138 as a roman a clef novel based its characters on living people causing scandal in expatriate community hemingway biographer carlos baker writes that word of mouth of book helped sales parisian expatriates gleefully tried to match fictional characters to real identities moreover he writes that hemingway used prototypes easily found in latin quarter on which to base his characters baker 1987 11 early draft identified characters by their living counterparts jake s character was called hem and brett s was called duff mellow 1992 303 although novel is written in a journalistic style frederic svoboda writes that striking thing about work is how quickly it moves away from a simple recounting of events svoboda 1983 9 jackson benson believes that hemingway used autobiographical details as framing devices for life in general for example benson says that hemingway drew out his experiences with what if scenarios what if i were wounded in such a way that i could not sleep at night what if i were wounded and made crazy what would happen if i were sent back to front benson 1989 351 hemingway believed that writer could describe one thing while an entirely different thing occurs below surface an approach he called iceberg theory or theory of omission oliver 1999 321 322 if a writer of prose knows enough of what he is writing about he may omit things that he knows and reader if writer is writing truly enough will have a feeling of those things as strongly as though writer had stated them dignity of movement of an ice berg is due to only one eighth of it being above water a writer who omits things because he does not know them only makes hollow places in his writing hemingway explained iceberg theory in death in afternoon 1932 qtd in oliver 1999 322 balassi says hemingway applied iceberg theory better in sun also rises than in any of his other works by editing extraneous material or purposely leaving gaps in story he made editorial remarks in manuscript that show he wanted to break from stricture of gertrude stein s advice to use clear restrained writing in earliest draft novel begins in pamplona but hemingway moved opening setting to paris because he thought montparnasse life was necessary as a counterpoint to later action in spain he wrote of paris extensively intending not to be limited by literary theories of others but to write in his own way and possibly to fail balassi 1990 136 he added metaphors for each character mike s money problems brett s association with circe myth robert s association with segregated steer balassi 1990 125 136 139 141 it wasn t until revision process that he pared down story taking out unnecessary explanations minimizing descriptive passages and stripping dialogue all of which created a complex but tightly compressed story balassi 1990 150 svoboda 1983 44 hemingway said that he learned what he needed as a foundation for his writing from style sheet for kansas city star where he worked as cub reporter use short sentences use short first paragraphs use vigorous english be positive not negative star style and rules for writing kansas city star com retrieved 15 april 2011 critic john aldridge says that minimalist style resulted from hemingway s belief that to write authentically each word had to be carefully chosen for its simplicity and authenticity and carry a great deal of weight aldridge writes that hemingway s style of a minimum of simple words that seemed to be squeezed onto page against a great compulsion to be silent creates impression that those words if only because there are so few of them are sacramental aldridge 1990 126 in paris hemingway had been experimenting with prosody of king james bible reading aloud with his friend john dos passos from style of biblical text he learned to build his prose incrementally action in novel builds sentence by sentence scene by scene and chapter by chapter thumb 240px paul cezanne l melting snow c 1871 writer ronald berman draws comparison between cezanne s treatment of this landscape and way hemingway imbues irati river with emotional texture in both landscape is a subjective element seen differently by each character berman 2011 59 simplicity of his style is deceptive bloom writes that it is effective use of parataxis that elevates hemingway s prose drawing on bible walt whitman and adventures of huckleberry finn hemingway wrote in deliberate understatement and he heavily incorporated parataxis which in some cases almost becomes cinematic bloom 1987 7 8 his skeletal sentences were crafted in response to henry james s observation that world war i had used up words explains hemingway scholar zoe trodd who writes that his style is similar to a multi focal photographic reality syntax which lacks subordinating conjunctions creates static sentences photographic snapshot style creates a collage of images hemingway omits internal punctuation colons dashes parentheses in favor of short declarative sentences which are meant to build as events build to create a sense of whole he also uses techniques analogous to cinema such as cutting quickly from one scene to next or splicing one scene into another intentional omissions allow reader to fill gap as though responding to instructions from author and create three dimensional prose trodd 2007 8 biographer james mellow writes that bullfighting scenes are presented with a crispness and clarity that evoke sense of a newsreel mellow 1992 311 hemingway also uses color and visual art techniques to convey emotional range in his descriptions of irati river in translating modernism fitzgerald and hemingway ronald berman compares hemingway s treatment of landscape with that of post impressionist painter paul cezanne during a 1949 interview hemingway told lillian ross that he learned from cezanne how to make a landscape in comparing writing to painting he told her this is what we try to do in writing this and this and woods and rocks we have to climb over berman 2011 52 landscape is seen subjectively viewpoint of observer is paramount berman 2011 55 to jake landscape meant a search for a solid form not existentially present in his life in paris reception hemingway s first novel was arguably his best and most important and came to be seen as an iconic modernist novel although reynolds emphasizes that hemingway was not philosophically a modernist wagner martin 1990 1 15 reynolds 1990 46 in book his characters epitomized post war expatriate generation for future generations mellow 1992 302 he had received good reviews for his volume of short stories in our time of which edmund wilson wrote hemingway s prose was of first distinction wilson s comments were enough to bring attention to young writer wagner martin 2002 4 5 no amount of analysis can convey quality of sun also rises it is a truly gripping story told in a lean hard athletic narrative prose that puts more literary english to shame mr hemingway knows how not only to make words be specific but how to arrange a collection of words which shall betray a great deal more than is to be found in individual parts it is magnificent writing new york times review of sun also rises 31 october 1926 sun also rises october 31 1926 new york times retrieved 13 march 2011 good reviews came in from many major publications conrad aiken wrote in new york herald tribune if there is a better dialogue to be written today i do not know where to find it and bruce barton wrote in atlantic that hemingway writes as if he had never read anybody s writing as if he had fashioned art of writing himself and that characters are amazingly real and

with american writing these days few young men of this lost generation will have to look for another way of finding themselves than one indicated here privately he wrote hemingway an apology for review reviewer for chicago daily tribune wrote of novel sun also rises is kind of book that makes this reviewer at least almost plain angry qtd in wagner martin 1990 1 some reviewers disliked characters among them reviewer for dial who thought characters were shallow and vapid and nation and atheneum deemed characters boring and novel unimportant reviewer for cincinnati enquirer wrote of book that it begins nowhere and ends in nothing hemingway s family hated it his mother grace hemingway distressed that she could not face criticism at her local book study class where it was said that her son was prostituting a great ability to lowest uses expressed her displeasure in a letter to him critics seem to be full of praise for your style and ability to draw word pictures but decent ones always regret that you should use such great gifts in perpetuating lives and habits of so degraded a strata of humanity it is a doubtful honor to produce one of filthiest books of year what is matter have you ceased to be interested in nobility honor and fineness in life surely you have other words in your vocabulary than damn and bitch every page fills me with a sick loathing qtd in reynolds 1998 53 still book sold well and young women began to emulate brett while male students at ivy league universities wanted to become hemingway heroes scribner s encouraged publicity and allowed hemingway to become a minor american phenomenon a celebrity to point that his divorce from richardson and marriage to pfieffer attracted media attention leff 1999 63 reynolds believes sun also rises could have been written only circa 1925 it perfectly captured period between world war i and great depression and immortalized a group of characters reynolds 1990 43 in years since its publication novel has been criticized for its antisemitism as expressed in characterization of robert cohn reynolds explains that although publishers complained to hemingway about his description of bulls they allowed his use of jewish epithets which showed degree to which antisemitism was accepted in us after world war i cohn represented jewish establishment and contemporary readers would have understood this from his description hemingway clearly makes cohn unlikeable not only as a character but as a character who is jewish reynolds 1990 53 55 critics of 1970s and 1980s considered hemingway to be misogynistic and homophobic by 1990s his work including sun also rises began to receive critical reconsideration by female scholars bloom 2007 28 beegel 1996 282 legacy and adaptations hemingway s work continued to be popular in latter half of century and after his suicide in 1961 during 1970s sun also rises appealed to what beegel calls lost generation of vietnam era beegel 1996 281 aldridge writes that sun also rises has kept its appeal because novel is about being young characters live in most beautiful city in world spend their days traveling fishing drinking making love and generally reveling in their youth he believes expatriate writers of 1920s appeal for this reason but that hemingway was most successful in capturing time and place in sun also rises aldridge 1990 122 123 bloom says that some of characters have not stood test of time writing that modern readers are uncomfortable with antisemitic treatment of cohn s character and romanticization of a bullfighter moreover brett and mike belong uniquely to jazz age and do not translate to modern era bloom believes novel is in canon of american literature for its formal qualities its prose and style bloom 1987 5 6 novel made hemingway famous inspired young women across america to wear short hair and sweater sets like heroine s and to act like her too and changed writing style in ways that could be seen in any american magazine published

diminished over years nagel 1996 87 success of sun also rises guaranteed interest from broadway and hollywood in 1927 two broadway producers wanted to adapt story for stage but made no immediate
