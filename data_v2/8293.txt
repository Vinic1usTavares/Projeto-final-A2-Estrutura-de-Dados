aphthous stomatitis is a common condition characterized by repeated formation of benign and non contagious mouth ulcers aphthae in otherwise healthy individuals informal term canker sores is also used mainly in north america although this may also refer to any mouth ulcers cause is not completely understood but involves a t cell mediated immune response triggered by a variety of factors different individuals have different triggers which may include nutritional deficiencies local trauma stress hormonal influences allergies or genetic predisposition these ulcers occur periodically and heal completely between attacks in majority of cases individual ulcers last about 7 10 days and ulceration episodes occur 3 6 times per year most appear on non keratinizing epithelial surfaces in mouth i e anywhere except attached gingiva hard palate and dorsum of tongue although more severe forms which are less common may also involve keratinizing epithelial surfaces symptoms range from a minor nuisance to interfering with eating and drinking severe forms may be debilitating even causing weight loss due to malnutrition condition is very common affecting about 20 of general population to some degree onset is often during childhood or adolescence and condition usually lasts for several years before gradually disappearing there is no cure and treatments such as corticosteroids aim to manage pain reduce healing time and reduce frequency of episodes of ulceration term is from meaning mouth ulcer signs and symptoms thumb upright 1 3 aphthous ulcers on labial mucosa lower lip is retracted note erythematous halo surrounding ulcer persons with aphthous stomatitis have no detectable systemic symptoms or signs i e outside mouth generally symptoms may include sensations such as burning itching or stinging which may precede appearance of any lesion by some hours and pain which is often out of proportion to extent of ulceration and is worsened by physical contact especially with certain foods and drinks e g if they are acidic or abrasive pain is worst in days immediately following initial formation of ulcer and then recedes as healing progresses if there are lesions on tongue speaking and chewing can be uncomfortable and ulcers on soft palate back of throat or esophagus can cause painful swallowing signs are limited to lesions themselves ulceration episodes usually occur about 3 6 times per year however severe disease is characterized by virtually constant ulceration new lesions developing before old ones have healed and may cause debilitating chronic pain and interfere with comfortable eating in severe cases this prevents adequate nutrient intake leading to malnutrition and weight loss aphthous ulcers typically begin as erythematous reddened flat area of mucosa which develop into ulcers that are covered with a yellow grey fibrinous membrane that can be scraped away a reddish halo surrounds ulcer size number location healing time and periodicity between episodes of ulcer formation are all dependent upon subtype of aphthous stomatitis causes cause is not entirely clear but is thought to be multifactorial it has been suggested that aphthous stomatitis is not a single entity but rather a group of conditions with different causes multiple research studies have attempted to identify a causative organism but aphthous stomatitis appears to be non contagious non infectious and not sexually transmissible mucosal destruction is thought to be result of a t cell t lymphocyte mediated immune response which involves generation of interleukins and tumor necrosis factor alpha tnf a mast cells and macrophages are also involved secreting tnf a along with t cells when early aphthous ulcers are biopsied histologic appearance shows a dense inflammatory infiltrate 80 of which is made up of t cells persons with aphthous stomatitis also have circulating lymphocytes which react with peptides 91 105 of heat shock protein 65 60 and ratio of cd4 t cells to cd8 t cells in peripheral blood of individuals with aphthous stomatitis is decreased aphthous stomatitis has been associated with other autoimmune diseases namely systemic lupus erythematosus and inflammatory bowel diseases however common autoantibodies are not detected in most patients and condition tends to resolve spontaneously with advancing age rather than worsen evidence for t cell mediated mechanism of mucosal destruction is strong but exact triggers for this process are unknown and are thought to be multiple and varied from one person to next this suggests that there are a number of possible triggers each of which is capable of producing disease in different subgroups in other words different subgroups appear to have different causes for condition these can be considered in three general groups namely primary immuno dysregulation decrease of mucosal barrier and states of heightened antigenic sensitivity see below risk factors in aphthous stomatitis are also sometimes considered as either host related or environmental immunity at least 40 of people with aphthous stomatitis have a positive family history suggesting that some people are genetically predisposed to suffering with oral ulceration hla b12 hla hla hla a2 hla a11 and hla dr2 are examples of human leukocyte antigen types associated with aphthous stomatitis however these hla types are inconsistently associated with condition and also vary according to ethnicity people who have a positive family history of aphthous stomatitis tend to develop a more severe form of condition and at an earlier age than is typical stress has effects on immune system which may explain why some cases directly correlate with stress it is often stated that in studies of sufferers who are students ulceration is exacerbated during examination periods and lessened during periods of vacation alternatively it has been suggested that oral parafunctional activities such as lip or cheek chewing become more pronounced during periods of stress and hence mucosa is subjected to more minor trauma aphthous like ulceration also occurs in conditions involving systemic immuno dysregulation e g cyclic neutropenia and human immunodeficiency virus infection in cyclic neutropenia more severe oral ulceration occurs during periods of severe immuno dysregulation and resolution of underlying neutropenia is associated with healing of ulcers relative increase in percentage of cd8 t cells caused by a reduction in numbers of cd4 t cells may be implicated in ras type ulceration in hiv infection mucosal barrier thickness of mucosa may be an important factor in aphthous stomatitis usually ulcers form on thinner non keratinizing mucosal surfaces in mouth factors which decrease thickness of mucosa increase frequency of occurrence and factors which increase thickness of mucosa correlate with decreased ulceration nutritional deficiencies associated with aphthous stomatitis vitamin b12 folate and iron can all cause a decrease in thickness of oral mucosa atrophy local trauma is also associated with aphthous stomatitis and it is known that trauma can decrease mucosal barrier trauma could occur during injections of local anesthetic in mouth or otherwise during dental treatments frictional trauma from a sharp surface in mouth such as broken tooth or from tooth brushing hormonal factors are capable of altering mucosal barrier in one study a small group of females with aphthous stomatitis had fewer occurrences of aphthous ulcers during luteal phase of menstrual cycle or with use of contraceptive pill this phase is associated with a fall in progestogen levels mucosal proliferation and keratinization this subgroup often experiences remission during pregnancy however other studies report no correlation between aphthous stomatitis and menstrual period pregnancy or menopause aphthous stomatitis is uncommon in people who smoke and there is also a correlation between habit duration and severity of condition tobacco use is associated with an increase in keratinization of oral mucosa in extreme forms this may manifest as or stomatitis smoker s keratosis this increased keratinization may mechanically reinforce mucosa and reduce tendency of ulcers to form after minor trauma or present a more substantial barrier to microbes and antigens but this is unclear nicotine is also known to stimulate production of adrenal steroids and reduce production of tnf a interleukin 1 and interleukin 6 smokeless tobacco products also seem to protect against aphthous stomatitis cessation of smoking is known to sometimes precede onset of aphthous stomatitis in people previously unaffected or exacerbate condition in those who were already experiencing aphthous ulceration despite this correlation starting smoking again does not usually lessen condition antigenic sensitivity various antigenic triggers have been implicated as a trigger including l forms of streptococci herpes simplex virus varicella zoster virus adenovirus and some people with aphthous stomatitis may show herpes virus within epithelium of mucosa but without any productive infection in some persons attacks of ulceration occur at same time as asymptomatic viral shedding and elevated viral titres in some instances recurrent mouth ulcers may be a manifestation of an allergic reaction possible allergens include certain foods e g chocolate coffee strawberries eggs nuts tomatoes cheese citrus fruits and highly acidic foods toothpastes and where dietary allergens are responsible mouth ulcers usually develop within about 12 24 hours of exposure sodium lauryl sulphate sls a detergent present in some brands of toothpaste and other oral healthcare products may produce oral ulceration in some individuals it has been shown that aphthous stomatitis is more common in people using toothpastes containing sls and that some reduction in ulceration occurs when a sls free toothpaste is used some have argued that since sls is almost ubiquitously used in oral hygiene products there is unlikely to be a true predisposition for aphthous stomatitis caused by sls systemic disease systemic disorders associated with aphthous like s disease celiac disease cyclic neutropenia nutritional deficiencies iga deficiency immunocompromised states e g hiv aids inflammatory bowel disease magic syndrome pfapa syndrome reactive arthritis sweet s syndrome vulvae aphthous like ulceration may occur in association with several systemic disorders see table these ulcers are clinically and identical to lesions of aphthous stomatitis but this type of oral ulceration is not considered to be true aphthous stomatitis by some sources some of these conditions may cause ulceration on other mucosal surfaces in addition to mouth such as or genital mucous membranes resolution of systemic condition often leads to decreased frequency and severity of oral ulceration behcet s disease is a triad of mouth ulcers genital ulcers and anterior uveitis main feature of behcet s disease is aphthous like ulceration but this is usually more severe than seen in aphthous stomatitis without a systemic cause and typically resembles major or herpetiforme ulceration or both aphthous like ulceration is first sign of disease in 25 75 of cases behcet s is more common in individuals whose ethnic origin is from regions along silk road between mediterranean and far east it tends to be rare in other countries such as united states and united kingdom magic syndrome is a possible variant of behcet disease and is associated with aphthous like ulceration name stands for mouth and genital ulcers with inflamed cartilage relapsing pfapa syndrome is a rare condition that tends to occur in children name stands for periodic fever aphthae pharyngitis sore throat and cervical inflammation of lymph nodes in neck fevers occur periodically about every 3 5 weeks condition appears to improve with tonsillectomy or immunosuppression suggesting an immunologic cause in cyclic neutropenia there is a reduction in level of circulating neutrophils in blood that occurs about every 21 days opportunistic infections commonly occur and aphthous like ulceration is worst during this time hematinic deficiencies vitamin b12 folic acid and iron occurring singly or in combination and with or without any underlying gastrointestinal disease may be twice as common in people with ras however iron and vitamin supplements only infrequently improve ulceration relationship to vitamin b12 deficiency has been subject of many studies although these studies found that 0 42 of those with recurrent ulcers suffer from vitamin b12 deficiency an association with deficiency is rare even in absence of deficiency vitamin b12 supplementation may be helpful due to unclear mechanisms hematinic deficiencies can cause anemia which is also associated with aphthous like ulceration gastrointestinal disorders are sometimes associated with aphthous like stomatitis e g most commonly celiac disease but also inflammatory bowel disease such as crohn s disease or ulcerative colitis link between gastrointestinal disorders and aphthous stomatitis is probably related to nutritional deficiencies caused by malabsorption less than 5 of people with ras have celiac disease which usually presents with severe malnutrition anemia abdominal pain diarrhea and glossitis inflammation of tongue sometimes aphthous like ulcerations can be only sign of celiac disease despite this association a gluten free diet does not usually improve oral ulceration other examples of systemic conditions associated with aphthous like ulceration include reactive arthritis and recurrent erythema multiforme diagnosis thumb photographic comparison of 1

a patch test is sometimes carried out areas of skin on back are stimulated with various common allergens ones which cause an inflammatory reaction may also be involved in recurrent oral ulceration diagnosis is mostly based on clinical appearance and medical history most important diagnostic feature is a history of recurrent self healing ulcers at fairly regular intervals although there are many causes of oral ulceration recurrent oral ulceration has relatively few causes most commonly aphthous stomatitis but rarely behcet s disease erythema multiforme ulceration associated with gastrointestinal disease and recurrent intra oral herpes simplex infection a systemic cause is more likely in adults who suddenly develop recurrent oral ulceration with no prior history special investigations may be indicated to rule out other causes of oral ulceration these include blood tests to exclude anemia deficiencies of iron folate or vitamin b12 or celiac disease however nutritional deficiencies may be latent and peripheral blood picture may appear relatively normal some suggest that screening for celiac disease should form part of routine work up for individuals complaining of recurrent oral ulceration many of systemic diseases cause other symptoms apart from oral ulceration which is in contrast to aphthous stomatitis where there is isolated oral ulceration patch testing may be indicated if allergies are suspected e g a strong relationship between certain foods and episodes of ulceration several drugs can cause oral ulceration e g and a trial substitution to an alternative drug may highlight a causal relationship tissue biopsy is not usually required unless to rule out other suspected conditions such as oral squamous cell carcinoma appearance is not pathognomonic microscopic appearance is not specific to condition early lesions have a central zone of ulceration covered by a fibrinous membrane in connective tissue deep to ulcer there is increased and a mixed inflammatory infiltrate composed of lymphocytes histiocytes and epithelium on margins of ulcer shows and there are many cells in basal third there are also lymphocytes and histiocytes in connective tissue surrounding deeper blood vessels near to ulcer described histologically as perivascular cuffing classification aphthous stomatitis has been classified as a type of non infectious stomatitis inflammation of mouth one classification distinguishes common simple aphthae accounting for 95 of cases with 3 6 attacks per year rapid healing minimal pain and restriction of ulceration to mouth and complex aphthae accounting for 5 of cases where ulcers may be present on genital mucosa in addition to mouth healing is slower and pain is more severe a more common method of classifying aphthous stomatitis is into three variants distinguished by size number and location of lesions healing time of individual ulcers and whether a scar is left after healing see below minor aphthous ulceration this is most common type of aphthous stomatitis accounting for about 80 85 of all cases this subtype is termed minor aphthous ulceration or minor recurrent aphthous stomatitis lesions themselves may be referred to as minor aphthae or minor aphthous ulcers these lesions are generally less than 10 mm in diameter usually about 2 3 mm and affect non keratinized mucosal surfaces i e labial and buccal mucosa lateral borders of tongue and floor of mouth usually several ulcers appear at same time but single ulcers are possible healing usually takes seven to ten days and leaves no scar between episodes of ulceration there is usually an ulcer free period of variable length major aphthous ulceration this subtype makes up about 10 of all cases of aphthous stomatitis it is termed major aphthous ulceration or major recurrent aphthous stomatitis maras major aphthous ulcers major aphthae are similar to minor aphthous ulcers but are more than 10 mm in diameter and ulceration is deeper because lesions are larger healing takes longer about twenty to thirty days and may leave scars each episode of ulceration usually produces a greater number of ulcers and time between attacks is less than seen in minor aphthous stomatitis major aphthous ulceration usually affects non keratinized mucosal surfaces but less commonly keratinized mucosa may also be involved such as dorsum top surface of tongue or gingiva gums soft palate or back of throat may also be involved latter being part of oropharynx rather than oral cavity compared to minor aphthous ulceration major aphthae tend to have an irregular outline herpetiform ulceration herpetiform ulcers also termed stomatitis or herpes like ulcerations is a subtype of aphthous stomatitis so named because lesions resemble a primary infection with herpes simplex virus primary herpetic however herpetiform ulceration is not caused by herpes viruses as with all types of aphthous stomatitis it is not contagious unlike true herpetic ulcers herpetiforme ulcers are not preceded by vesicles small fluid filled blisters herpetiforme ulcers are less than 1 mm in diameter and occur in variably sized crops up to one hundred at a time adjacent ulcers may merge to form larger continuous areas of ulceration healing occurs within fifteen days without scarring ulceration may affect keratinized mucosal surfaces in addition to non keratinized herpetiform ulceration is often extremely painful and lesions recur more frequently than minor or major aphthous ulcers recurrence may be so frequent that ulceration is virtually continuous it generally occurs in a slightly older age group than other subtypes and females are affected slightly more frequently than males ras type ulceration recurrent oral ulceration associated with systemic conditions is termed ras type ulceration ras like ulceration or aphthous like ulcers aphthous stomatitis occurs in individuals with no associated systemic disease persons with certain systemic diseases may be prone to oral ulceration but this is secondary to underlying medical condition see systemic disease section this kind of ulceration is considered by some to be separate from true aphthous stomatitis however this definition is not strictly applied for example many sources refer to oral ulceration caused by anemia and or nutritional deficiencies as aphthous stomatitis and some also consider behcet s disease to be a variant treatment vast majority of people with aphthous stomatitis have minor symptoms and do not require any specific therapy pain is often tolerable with simple dietary modification during an episode of ulceration such as avoiding spicy and acidic foods and beverages many different topical and systemic medications have been proposed see table sometimes showing little or no evidence of usefulness when formally investigated some of results of interventions for ras may in truth represent a placebo effect no therapy is curative with treatment aiming to relieve pain promote healing and reduce frequency of episodes of ulceration medication first line therapy for aphthous stomatitis is topical agents rather than systemic medication with topical corticosteroids being mainstay treatment systemic treatment is usually reserved for severe disease due to risk of adverse side effects associated with many of these agents a systematic review found that no single systemic intervention was found to be effective good oral hygiene is important to prevent secondary infection of ulcers occasionally in females where ulceration is correlated to menstrual cycle or to birth control pills progestogen or a change in birth control may be beneficial use of nicotine replacement therapy for people who have developed oral ulceration after stopping smoking has also been reported starting smoking again does not usually lessen condition trauma can be reduced by avoiding rough or sharp foodstuffs and by brushing teeth with care if sodium lauryl sulfate is suspected to be cause avoidance of products containing this chemical may be useful and prevent recurrence in some individuals similarly patch testing may indicate that food allergy is responsible and diet modified accordingly if investigations reveal deficiency states correction of deficiency may result in resolution of ulceration for example there is some evidence that vitamin b12 supplementation may prevent recurrence in some individuals medications drug type intended action example s topical covering agents barriers reduce pain often combined with topical analgesics anesthetics anti inflammatory agents reduce pain hydrochloride or spray paste viscous lidocaine diclofenac in topical antiseptics hasten healing prevent secondary infection doxycycline tetracycline minocycline topical mild potency corticosteroids reduce inflammation hydrocortisone sodium topical moderate potency corticosteroids reduce inflammation beclomethasone aerosol sodium phosphate dexamethasone systemic medications various mostly modulating immune response colchicine azathioprine thalidomide dapsone adalimumab vitamin b12 montelukast other surgical excision of aphthous ulcers has been described but it is an ineffective and inappropriate treatment silver nitrate has also been used as a chemical apart from mainstream approaches detailed above there are numerous treatments of unproven effectiveness ranging from herbal remedies to otherwise alternative treatments including aloe vera communis rosa potassium alum zinc sulfate nicotine polio virus vaccine and prostaglandin e2 prognosis by definition there is no serious underlying medical condition and most importantly ulcers do not represent oral cancer nor are they infectious however aphthae are capable of causing significant discomfort there is a spectrum of severity with symptoms ranging from a minor nuisance to disabling due to pain during eating weight loss may develop as a result of not eating in severe cases of aphthous stomatitis usually condition lasts for several years before spontaneously disappearing in later life epidemiology aphthous stomatitis affects between 5 and 66 of people with about 20 of individuals in most populations having condition to some degree this makes it most common disease of oral mucosa aphthous stomatitis occurs worldwide but is more common in developed countries within nations it is more common in higher socioeconomic groups males and females are affected in an equal ratio and peak age of onset between 10 and 19 years about 80 of people with aphthous stomatitis first developed condition before age of 30 there have been reports of ethnic variation for example in united states aphthous stomatitis may be three times more common in white skinned people than black skinned people history society and culture aphthous affectations and aphthous ulcerations of mouth are mentioned several times in treatise of epidemics part of hippocratic corpus in 4th century bc wikisource of epidemics although it seems likely that this was oral ulceration as a manifestation of some infectious disease since they are described as occurring in epidemic like patterns with concurrent symptoms such as fever aphthous stomatitis was once thought to be a form of recurrent herpes simplex virus infection and some clinicians still refer to condition as herpes despite this cause having been disproven informal term canker sore is sometimes used mainly in north america either to describe this condition generally or to refer to individual ulcers of this condition or mouth ulcers of any cause unrelated to this condition origin of word canker is thought to have been influenced by latin old english middle english and old north french in latin cancer translates to malignant tumor or literally crab related to likening of sectioned tumors to limbs of a crab closely related word in middle english and old north french now more usually applied to syphilis is also thought to be involved despite this etymology aphthous stomatitis is not a form of cancer but rather entirely benign an aphtha plural aphthae is a non specific term that refers to an ulcer of mouth word is derived from greek word aphtha meaning eruption or ulcer lesions of several other oral conditions are sometimes described as aphthae including bednar s aphthae infected traumatic ulcers on hard palate in infants oral candidiasis and foot and mouth disease when used without qualification aphthae commonly refers to lesions of recurrent aphthous stomatitis since word aphtha is often taken to be synonymous with ulcer it has been suggested that term aphthous ulcer is redundant but it remains in common use stomatitis is also a non specific term referring to any inflammatory process in mouth with or without oral ulceration it may describe many different conditions apart from aphthous stomatitis such as angular stomatitis current most widely used medical term is recurrent aphthous stomatitis or simply aphthous stomatitis historically many different terms have been used to refer to recurrent aphthous stomatitis or its sub types and some are still in use mikulicz aphthae is a synonym of minor ras named after jan mikulicz synonyms for major ras include sutton s ulcers named after richard lightburn sutton sutton s disease sutton s syndrome and mucosa synonyms for aphthous stomatitis as a whole include recurrent oral aphthae recurrent aphthous ulceration and oral in traditional chinese medicine claimed treatments for aphthae focus on clearing heat and nourishing yin rembrandt gentle white toothpaste did not contain sodium lauryl sulfate and was specifically marketed as being for benefit of canker sore sufferers when manufacturer johnson johnson
