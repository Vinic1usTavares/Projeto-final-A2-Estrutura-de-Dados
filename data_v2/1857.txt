august 1987 wood s solicitor filed an appeal against guilty verdict appeal was rejected on 25 july 1989 aftermath previous confiscations and police dispute after trial a dispute occurred between south yorkshire police and sussex police over which force was responsible for erroneously allowing wood access to firearms wood s ten piece gun collection had been confiscated twice firstly in december 1985 over fears from his wife and doctor of deteriorating mental health and alcoholism and secondly because of an administrative error in renewing his licence guns were returned two weeks after first confiscation south yorkshire police later said that they had to return them because there was no evidence that wood was a threat to himself or others in march 1986 wood bought 50 rounds of ammunition in sheffield for his 38 enfield revolver which he had inherited after his father used it to commit suicide south yorkshire police ascribed these events to an administrative mix up with sussex police who were responsible for executing firearms clause in wood s father s will sussex police said that when wood asked for gun and remaining 11 rounds they tried to dissuade him but he returned a month later with a renewed firearms certificate from south yorkshire police differing interpretations of firearms act by two police forces resulted in home office intervening and seeking a detailed explanation from both forces and holding talks with them over possible amendments to firearms act firearms policy bill michie member of parliament for sheffield heeley campaigned for stricter firearm ownership regulations such as psychiatric assessment of prospective gun owners in response to murders in october 1986 michie asked prime minister margaret thatcher if government would change its
