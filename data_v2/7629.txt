economic history of argentina is one of most studied owing to argentine paradox its unique condition as a country that had achieved advanced development in early 20th century but experienced a reversal which inspired an enormous wealth of literature and diverse analysis on causes of this decline since independence from spain in 1816 country has defaulted on its debt eight times and inflation has often been in double digits even as high as 5000 resulting in several large currency devaluations argentina possesses definite comparative advantages in agriculture as country is endowed with a vast amount of highly fertile land between 1860 and 1930 exploitation of rich land of pampas strongly pushed economic growth during first three decades of 20th century argentina outgrew canada and australia in population total income and per capita income by 1913 argentina was world s 10th wealthiest state per capita beginning in 1930s however argentine economy deteriorated notably single most important factor in this decline has been political instability since 1930 when a military junta took power ending seven decades of civilian constitutional government in macroeconomic terms argentina was one of most stable and conservative countries until great depression after which it turned into one of most unstable despite this up until 1962 argentine per capita gdp was higher than that of austria italy japan and of its former colonial master spain gdp per capita graph 1960 2015 by google public data explorer sources from world bank successive governments from 1930s to 1970s pursued a strategy of import substitution to achieve industrial self sufficiency but government s encouragement of industrial growth diverted investment from agricultural production which fell dramatically era of import substitution ended in 1976 but at same time growing government spending large wage increases and inefficient production created a chronic inflation that rose through 1980s measures enacted during last dictatorship also contributed to huge foreign debt by late 1980s which became equivalent to three fourths of gnp in early 1990s government reined in inflation by making peso equal in value to u s dollar and privatised numerous state run companies using part of proceeds to reduce national debt however a sustained recession at turn of 21st century culminated in a default and government again devalued peso by 2005 economy had recovered but a judicial ruling originating from previous crisis led to a new default in 2014 colonial economy thumb upright an 1868

passengers and goods during colonial period present day argentina offered fewer economic advantages compared to other parts of spanish empire such as mexico or peru which caused it to assume a peripheral position within spanish colonial economy it lacked deposits of gold or other precious metals nor did it have established native civilizations to subject to encomienda sparse population was accompanied by a difficult numeracy development in 17th century nevertheless argentina overtook peru which enjoyed an early rapid development in numeracy through contact with indios in middle of 18th century this numeracy development as a measure of early modern development demonstrates rapid and remarkable development of argentina in period of colonial time only two thirds of its present territory were occupied during colonial period as remaining third consisted of patagonian plateau which remains sparsely populated to this day agricultural and livestock sector s output was principally consumed by producers themselves and by small local market and only became associated with foreign trade towards end of 18th century period between 16th and end of 18th century was characterized by existence of self sufficient regional economies separated by considerable distances a lack of road maritime or river communications and hazards and hardship of land transport by end of 18th century a significant national economy came into being as argentina developed a market in which reciprocal flows of capital labour and goods could take place on a significant scale between its different regions which it had hitherto lacked historians like pena consider this historical period of americas as pre capitalist as most production of coastal cities was destined to overseas markets rodolfo consider it instead a feudalist society based on work relations such as encomienda or slavery norberto galasso and enrique rivera consider that it was neither capitalist nor feudalist but a hybrid system result of interaction of spanish civilization on transition from feudalism to capitalism and natives still living in prehistory argentine territories held back by their closed economies lack of any activity closely linked to foreign trade and scant amounts of labour and capital they consequently received fell far behind those of other areas of colonial world that participated in foreign trade only activities associated with a dynamic exporting centre enjoyed some degree of prosperity as occurred in tucuman where cloth was manufactured and in cordoba and litoral where livestock was raised to supply mines of upper peru this trade was legally limited to spain spanish crown enforced a monopsony which limited supplies and enabled spanish merchants to mark up prices and increase profits british and portuguese merchants broke this monopsony by resorting to contraband trade british desire to trade with south america grew during industrial revolution and loss of their 13 colonies in north america during american revolution to achieve their economic objectives britain initially launched british invasions of rio de la plata to conquer key cities in spanish america

representation of hacendados economic report by mariano moreno but is currently considered result of a general negotiation between britain and spain as reflected in apodaca canning treaty of 1809 actions of baltasar hidalgo de cisneros in buenos aires reflected similar outcomes emanating from other spanish cities of south america compared to other parts of latin america slavery played a much lesser role in development of argentine economy mostly because of absence of gold mines and sugar plantations which would have demanded huge numbers of slave workers colonial brazil for example imported as many as 2 5 million africans in 18th century by contrast an estimated 100 000 african slaves arrived at port of buenos aires in 17th and 18th centuries and many were destined for paraguay chile and bolivia colonial livestock ranches were established toward middle of 18th century pace of growth in region increased dramatically with establishment in 1776 of new viceroyalty of rio de la plata with buenos aires as its capital and increased legal trading allowed by free trade act of 1778 which allowed for free and protected trade between spain and its colonies this trade system disintegrated during napoleonic era and contraband became common again post independence transition during early post independence period an important share of argentina s exports came from cattle and sheep production livestock raising economy was based upon abundance of fertile land in littoral provinces cropping apparently lacked comparative advantage compared to livestock grazing exports rose 4 to 5 annually from 1810 to 1850 and 7 to 8 from 1850 to 1870 this growth was achieved through extension of frontier and greater efficiency in livestock production as a result of diversification in markets and products argentina managed to escape trap of a single staple economy and sustained its economic growth over six decades combined effect of declining prices of textiles and rising prices of livestock products produced dramatic improvements in terms of trade which rose 377 between 1810 and 1825 in local prices several governors waged campaigns against natives to increase available lands

became one of most open economies in world between 1812 and 1816 divisions developed between a unitarist faction centred on buenos aires and a federalist faction in provinces which eventually led to a series of civil wars that ended with conquest of buenos aires by federalist caudillos at battle of cepeda in 1820 each province had its own money and same money had a different value from one province and another and even among cities in same province government of martin rodriguez 1820 1824 and his minister bernardino rivadavia then las heras and finally rivadavia himself as first president of

assumed power as governor of buenos aires but was soon executed by unitarist juan lavalle during a military coup exports of gold allowed by free trade policies soon depleted national reserves this

eager to be on good terms with britain and gain recognition of declaration of independence that most official institutions as bank were under british control and that britain had similar control over argentine economy to that metropole of a colony without financial civil or military costs even lack of an argentine merchant fleet allowed britain to manage maritime trade forbes s testimony should be appraised in perspective of contemporary anglo american commercial rivalry in light of partial nature of account and of his jealousy even antipathy towards english in rio de la plata in mid 1820s when manuel jose garcia was minister of finance government borrowed heavily to finance new projects and to pay off war debts these loans were tendered at rates in one notorious loan government received credit for ps570 000 from baring brothers in exchange for a debt of ps1 000 000 in 1820s peso papel began to lose value rapidly with respect to peso fuerte which was linked to price of gold in 1827

control of buenos aires and refused to call a constituent assembly customs law set trade barriers to products produced in country and imposed high import tariffs on luxury goods together with export quotas and tariffs on gold and silver however law was not completely effective because of control of port which did not allow provinces a steady financial income exclusive control of port was long

buenos aires with decline of and growth of wool production thumb a in rosario 1860s in 1838 there was a new currency crisis and peso papel was devalued by 34 and in 1839 when peso papel lost 66 of its value it was again devalued by 95 in 1845 and by 40 in 1851 alsina years which coincided with secession of buenos aires saw an extremely poor economic performance efforts to fund extraordinary expenditure on conflict between buenos aires and other provinces of confederation caused fiscal deficit to skyrocket similarly confederation faced harsh economic conditions urquiza president of confederation issued law of differential rights benefiting ships trading with ports of confederation and but not with buenos aires end of civil wars provided political and legal stability necessary to assert property rights and cut transaction costs contributing to huge inflows of capital and labour resources that built modern argentina in 1866 an attempt was made to stabilize currency by introducing a system of convertibility which restricted monetary authorities to issue paper currency only if it was fully backed by gold or convertible foreign currency decades of 1860s and 1880s experienced most favourable performance of economy overall setting stage for so called golden age of argentine history nevertheless first years of independence included a difficult economic development in spite of new freedom caused by inauguration of republic country was not economically united expansion in some parts and decline in other parts indeed people experienced different levels of income and welfare therefore it is unclear if this period of time 1820 1870 brought an income or welfare improvement in 60 years after founding of farming colony at esperanza in 1856 base of argentine agriculture gradually shifted from livestock to crops export led boom argentina which had been insignificant during first half of 19th century showed growth from 1860s up until 1930 that was so impressive that it was expected to eventually become united states of south america this impressive and sustained economic performance was driven by export of agricultural goods a 2018 study describes argentina as a super exporter during period 1880 1929 and credits boom to low trade costs and trade liberalisation on one hand and on other hand to fact that argentina offered a diverse basket of products to different european and american countries that consumed them study concludes that argentina took advantage of a multilateral and open economic system during second half of 19th century there was an intense process of colonization of territory in form of latifundia until 1875 wheat was imported as it was not grown in sufficient quantities to supply local demand by 1903 country supplied all its own needs and exported of wheat enough to sustain 16 000 000 people in 1870s real wages in argentina were around 76 relative to britain rising to 96 in first decade of 20th century gdp per capita rose from 35 of united states average in 1880 to about 80 in 1905 similar to that of france germany and canada 1870 1890 thumb left buenos aires docks 1915 british financed

until 1916 would come from this party avellaneda undertook tough actions needed to get debt under control in 1876 convertibility was suspended inflation rate rose to almost 20 in following year but ratio of debt to gdp plummeted avellaneda s administration was first to deliver a balance in fiscal accounts since mid 1850s avellaneda passed on to his successor julio argentino roca a much more manageable economic environment thumb quilmes brewery in 1910 in 1881 a currency reform introduced a bimetallic standard which went into effect in july 1883 unlike many precious metal standards system was very decentralized no national monetary authority existed and all control over convertibility rested with five banks of issue period of convertibility lasted only 17 months from december 1884 banks of issue refused to exchange gold at par for notes suspension of convertibility was soon accommodated by government since having no institutional power over monetary system there was little they could do to prevent it profitability of agricultural sector attracted foreign capital for railways and industries british capital investments went from just over ps20 million in 1880 to ps157 million in 1890 during 1880s investment began to show some diversification as capital began to flow from other countries such as france germany and belgium though british investment still accounted for two thirds of total foreign capital in 1890 argentina was destination of choice for british investment in latin america a position it held until world war i by then argentina had absorbed between 40 and 50 of all british investment outside united kingdom despite its dependence on british market argentina managed a 6 7 annual rate of growth of exports between 1870 and 1890 as a result of successful geographic and commodity diversification first argentine railway a road had been built in 1854 by 1885 a total of of railways were open for traffic new railways brought livestock to buenos aires from vast pampas for slaughter and processing in mainly english meat packing plants and then for shipment around world some contemporary analysts lamented export bias of network configuration while opposing monopoly of private british companies on nationalist grounds others have since argued that initial layout of system was mostly shaped by domestic interests and that it was not in fact strictly focused on port of buenos aires thumb left immigrants disembarking to southern dock port of buenos aires early 20th century scarcity of labour and abundance of land induced a high marginal

but immigrants arrived in massive numbers even with no subsidy baring crisis to world war i thumb threshing scene buenos aires 1910s juarez celman s administration saw a substantial increase in ratio of debt to gdp toward end of his tenure and an increasing weakness in fiscal situation baring brothers merchant bank had developed a close and profitable association with argentina and when celman s government was unable to meet its payments to house of baring a financial crisis ensued argentina defaulted and suffered bank runs as baring brothers faced failure crisis was caused by lack of co ordination between monetary policy and fiscal policy which ultimately led to collapse of banking system financial crisis of 1890 left government with no funds for its immigration subsidies programme and it was abolished in 1891 loans to argentina were severely curtailed and imports had to be cut sharply exports were less affected but value of argentine exports did not surpass 1889 peak until 1898 celman s successor carlos pellegrini laid foundations for a return to stability and growth after restoration of convertibility in 1899 he also reformed banking sector in ways that were to restore stability in medium term rapid growth rates soon returned in period 1903 1913 gdp increased at an annual rate of 7 7 and industry grew even faster jumping by 9 6 by 1906 argentina had cleared last remnants of 1890 default and a year later country re entered international bond markets all same between 1853 and 1930s fiscal instability was a transitory phenomenon depressions of 1873 77 and 1890 91 played a crucial role in fostering rise of industry timidly in 1870s and more decisively in 1890s industry grew with each crisis in response to need of a damaged economy to improve its trade balance through import substitution by 1914 about 15 argentine labour force was involved in manufacturing compared to 20 involved in commercial activities in 1913 country s income per head was on a par with that of france and germany and far ahead of italy s or spain s at end of 1913 argentina had a gold stock of ps59 million or 3 7 of world s monetary gold while representing 1 2 of world s economic output interwar period 1914 1929 thumb a group of ypf workers in 1923 argentina like many other countries entered into a recession following beginning of world war i as international flows of goods capital and labour declined foreign investment in argentina came to a complete standstill from which it never fully recovered great britain had become heavily indebted to united states during war and would never again export capital at a comparable scale and after opening of panama canal in 1914 argentina and other southern cone economies declined as investors turned their attention to asia and caribbean united states which came out of war a political and financial superpower especially perceived argentina and to a lesser extent brazil as a potential rival on world markets neither buenos aires stock exchange nor private domestic banks developed rapidly enough to fully replace british capital as a consequence investable funds became increasingly concentrated in a single institution banco de la nacion argentina bna creating a financial system vulnerable to rent seeking rediscounting and non performing loans grew steadily at bna after 1914 polluting its balance sheet this corrosion of balance sheets was a result of crony loans to other banks and private sector in its rediscounting actions bna was not engaged in pure lender of last resort actions following bagehot s principle of lending freely at a penalty rate instead state bank allowed private banks to shed their risks with bad paper used as security and lent them cash at 4 5 below rate bna offered its customers on time deposits however unlike its neighbors argentina became capable of still having relatively healthy growth rates during 1920s not being as affected by worldwide collapse on commodity prices such as brazil and chile similarly gold standard was still in place at a time almost all european countries had abandoned it automobile ownership in country in 1929 was highest in southern hemisphere for all its success by 1920s argentina was not an industrialized country by standards of britain germany or united states a major hindrance to full industrialisation was lack of energy sources such as coal or hydropower experiments with oil discovered in 1907 had poor results first state owned oil company in latin america was founded in 1922 as a public company responsible for 51 of oil production remaining 49 was in private hands exports of frozen beef especially to great britain proved highly profitable after invention of refrigerated ships in 1870s however britain imposed new restrictions on meat imports in late 1920s which sharply reduced beef imports from argentina ranchers responded by switching from pastoral to arable production but there was lasting damage to argentine economy great depression thumb left unemployed men in villa in retiro 1930 thumb a traffic jam caused by a demonstration buenos aires 1936 photo by horacio coppola great depression had a comparatively mild effect on argentina unemployment rate never went above 10 and country largely recovered by 1935 however depression permanently halted its economic expansion actually much like other developing countries economy was already in a downturn beginning in 1927 a result of declining prices argentina abandoned gold standard in december 1929 earlier than most countries for much of previous period country had operated a currency board in which a body known as caja de conversion was charged with maintaining peso s value in gold devaluation of peso increased competitiveness of its exports and protected domestic production argentina saw value of its exports drop from 1 537 million in 1929 to 561 million in 1932 but this was by no means most severe downturn in region in response to great depression successive governments pursued a strategy designed to transform argentina into a country self sufficient in industry as well as agriculture strategy of growth was based on import substitution in which tariffs and quotas for final goods were raised import substitution process had progressively been adopted since late 19th century but great depression intensified it government s encouragement of industrial growth diverted investment from agriculture and agricultural production fell dramatically in 1930 armed forces forced radicals from power and improved economic conditions but political turbulence intensified in 1932 argentina required immigrants to have a labour contract prior to arrival or proof of financial means of support roca runciman treaty of 1933 gave argentina a quota of british market for exports of its primary products but discriminatory british imperial tariffs and effects of deflation in britain actually led to a small decline of argentine exports to great britain unemployment resulting from great depression caused unrest industrial growth spurt of 1930s gradually slowed economic conditions of 1930s contributed to process of internal migration from countryside and smaller towns to cities especially buenos aires where there were greater opportunities for employment urban working classes led several unsuccessful uprisings prior to 1937

engineered plot became minister of labor campaigning among workers with promises of land higher wages and social security he won a decisive victory in 1946 presidential elections under peron number of unionized workers expanded as he helped to establish powerful general confederation of labor peron turned argentina into a corporatist country in which powerful organized interest groups negotiated for positions and resources during these years argentina developed largest middle class on south american continent early peronism was a period of macroeconomic shocks during which a strategy of import substitution industrialization was put into practice bilateral trade exchange control and multiple exchange rates were its most important characteristics beginning in 1947 peron took a leftward shift after breaking up with catholic nationalism movement which led to gradual state control of economy reflected in increase in state owned property interventionism including control of rents and prices and higher levels of public inversion mainly financed by inflationary tax expansive macroeconomic policy which aimed at redistribution of wealth and increase of spending to finance populist policies led to inflation wartime reserves enabled peronist government to fully pay off external debt in 1952 by end of year argentina became creditor of us 5 000 000 000 between 1946 and 1948 french and british owned railways were nationalized and existing networks were expanded reaching 120 000 kilometers of rails by 1954 government also established iapi to control foreign trade in export commodities peron erected a system of almost complete protection against imports largely cutting off argentina from international market in 1947 he announced his first five year plan based on growth of nationalized industries protectionism also created a domestically oriented industry with high production costs incapable of competing in international markets at same time output of beef and grain country s main export goods stagnated iapi began growers and when world grain prices dropped in late 1940s it stifled agricultural production exports and business sentiment in general despite these shortcomings protectionism and government credits did allow an exponential growth of internal market radio sales increased 600 and fridge sales grew 218 among others during first five year plan various public works and programs were executed with aim to modernize country s infrastructure for example a total of 22 hydroelectric power plants were erected increasing electrical output from 45 000 kva in 1943 to 350 000 kva in 1952 between 1947 and 1949 a network of gas pipelines which linked comodoro rivadavia with buenos aires was built gas distribution reached 15 million m3 reducing costs by a third during this period argentina s economy continued to grow on average but more slowly than world as a whole or than its neighbors brazil and chile a suggested cause is that a multitude of frequently changed regulations at times extended to ridiculous specifics such as a 1947 decree setting prices and menus for restaurants choked economic activity long term effect was to create pervasive disregard for law which argentines came to view as a hindrance to earning a living rather than an aid to enforcing legitimate property rights combination of industrial protectionism redistribution of income from agrarian to industrial sector and growing state intervention in economy sparked an inflationary process by 1950 argentina s gdp per capita accounted just nearly half of united states peron s second five year plan in 1952 favored increased agricultural output over industrialization but industrial growth and high wages in previous years had expanded domestic demand for agrarian goods during 1950s output of beef and grain fell and economy suffered policy shift toward agricultural production created a gap in income distribution as majority of those who worked in agriculture laboured on tiny plots while majority of land was in large estates argentina signed trade agreements with britain soviet union and chile slightly opening market to international trade as

with most latin american countries while most of rest of world enjoyed a golden era stagnation prevailed during this period and economy often found itself contracting mostly result of union strife wage growth beginning in 1950 pushed prices up inflation rate increased faster and soon real wages fell high inflation prompted a stabilization plan that included tighter monetary policy a cut in public expenditures and increases in taxes and utility prices increasing economic wariness as 1950s progressed became one of leading causes for peron s downfall in revolucion libertadora of 1955 as working classes saw their quality of life diminished thus stripping peron from a large part of his popular support arturo frondizi won 1958 presidential election in a landslide in same year he announced beginning of oil battle a new attempt at import substitution which aimed to achieve self sufficiency in oil production by signing several contract with foreign companies for mining and exploitation of oil in 1960 argentina joined latin american free trade association another coup in june 1966 so called argentine revolution brought juan carlos ongania to power ongania appointed adalbert krieger to head economy ministry his strategy implied a very active role for public sector in guiding process of economic growth calling for state control over money supply wages and prices and bank credit to private sector thumb in 1969 worsening economy and onset of dictatorship led to waves of protests strikes and riots krieger s tenure witnessed increased concentration and centralization of capital coupled with privatisation of many important sectors of economy international financial community offered strong support for this program and economic growth continued gdp expanded at an average annual rate of 5 2 between 1966 and 1970 compared to 3 2 during 1950s after 1966 in a radical departure from past policies ministry of economy announced a programme to reduce rising inflation while promoting competition efficiency and foreign investment anti inflation programme focussed on controlling nominal wages and salaries inflation decreased sharply decreasing from an annual rate of about 30 in 1965 67 to 7 6 in 1969 unemployment remained low but real wages fell a gradual reversal in trade policy culminated in military announcing import substitution as a failed experiment lifting protectionist barriers and opening economy to world market this new policy boosted some exports but an overvalued currency meant certain imports were so cheap that local industry declined and many exports were priced out of market ministry of economy put an end to exchange rate policy of previous governments currency underwent a 30 devaluation in 1970 peso moneda nacional one of longest lived currencies in region was replaced by peso ley 100 to 1 in may 1969 discontent with krieger s economic policies led to riots in cities of corrientes rosario and cordoba krieger was removed but ongania administration was unable to agree on an alternative economic policy by 1970 authorities were no longer capable of maintaining wage restraints leading to a wage price spiral as economy started to languish and import substitution industrialization ran out of steam urban migration slowed per capita income fell and with it standard of living peron s third term of office was characterized by an expansive monetary policy which resulted in an uncontrolled rise in level of inflation stagnation 1975 1990 thumb from rodrigazo in 1975 inflation accelerated sharply leading to several of argentine currency between 1975 and 1990 real per capita income fell by more than 20 wiping out almost three decades of economic development manufacturing industry which had experienced a period of uninterrupted growth until mid 1970s began a process of continuous decline extreme dependence on state support of many protected industries exacerbated sharp fall of industrial output degree of industrialization at start of 1990s was similar to its level in 1940s in early 1970s per capita income in argentina was twice as high as in mexico and more than three times as high as in chile and brazil by 1990 difference in income between argentina and other latin american countries was much smaller starting with rodrigazo in 1975 inflation accelerated sharply reaching an average of more than 300 per year from 1975 to 1991 increasing prices 20 billion times when military dictatorship finance minister martinez de hoz assumed power inflation was equivalent to an annual rate of 5000 and output had declined sharply in 1976 era of import substitution was ended and government lowered import barriers liberalized restrictions on foreign borrowing and supported peso against foreign currencies that exposed fact that domestic firms could not compete with foreign imports because of overvalued currency and long term structural problems a financial reform was implemented that aimed both to liberalize capital markets and to link argentina more effectively with world capital market after relatively stable years of 1976 to 1978 fiscal deficits started to climb again and external

to capital flight and a financial collapse thumb left failure of banco de regional in march 1980 led to runs on other banks growing government spending large wage raises and inefficient production created a chronic inflation that rose through 1980s when it briefly exceeded an annual rate of 1000 successive regimes tried to control inflation by wage and price controls cuts in public spending and

september 1984 that an agreement was reached between imf and argentina in 1985 argentine austral replaced discredited peso in 1986 argentina failed to pay debt for several months and debt was renegotiated with creditor banks in 1986 and 1987 austral plan faded away as fiscal policy was undermined by large off budget spending and a loose monetary policy again falling out of compliance with an imf programme a new imf arrangement was reached in july 1987 only to collapse in march 1988 next move by authorities was to launch primavera plan in august 1988 a package of economically heterodox measures that foresaw little fiscal adjustment imf refused to resume lending to argentina six months after its introduction plan collapsed leading to hyperinflation and riots free market reforms 1990 1995 thumb multinational retailers like walmart and carrefour opened in every major argentine city in early 1990s peronist carlos menem was elected president in may 1989 he immediately announced a new shock programme this time with more fiscal adjustment in view of a government deficit of 16 of gdp in november 1989 agreement was reached on yet another standby with imf but again arrangement was ended prematurely followed by another bout of hyper inflation which reached 12 000 per year after collapse of public enterprises during late 1980s privatisation became strongly popular menem privatised almost everything state owned except for a couple of banks in terms of service there were indisputable improvements for example before telephone privatisation to get a new line it was not unusual to wait more than ten years and apartments with telephone lines carried a big premium in market after privatisation wait was reduced to less than a week productivity increased as investment modernised farms factories and ports however in all cases there were large of employees in addition process of privatisation was suspected of corruption in many cases ultimately privatised enterprises became private rather than public monopolies their tariffs on long term contracts were raised in line with american inflation even though prices in argentina were falling in 1991 economy minister domingo cavallo set out to reverse argentina s decline through free market reforms such as open trade on 1 january 1992 a monetary reform replaced austral with peso at a rate of 10 000 for 1 peso cornerstone of reform process was a currency board under which peso was fixed by law at par to dollar and money supply restricted to level of hard currency reserves a risky policy which meant at a later stage argentina could not devalue after a lag inflation was tamed with risk of devaluation apparently removed capital poured in from abroad gdp growth increased significantly and total employment rose steadily until mid 1993 during second half of 1994 economy slowed down and unemployment increased from 10 to 12 2 although economy was already in a mild recession at this point conditions worsened substantially after devaluation of mexican peso during december 1994 economy shrank by 4 and a dozen banks collapsed with labour force continuing to expand and employment falling sharply along with aggregate demand unemployment rose by over 6 in 6 months but government responded effectively it tightened bank regulation and capital requirements and encouraged foreign banks to take over weaker local ones economy soon recovered and between 1996 and 1998 both output and employment grew rapidly and unemployment declined substantially however at beginning of 1999 brazilian currency underwent a strong depreciation argentine economy contracted 4 in 1999 and unemployment increased again exports grew from 12 billion in 1991 to 27 billion in 2001 but many industries could not compete abroad especially after brazil s devaluation strong fixed exchange rate turned trade balance to a cumulative us 22 billion in deficits between 1992 and 1999 unable to devalue argentina could only become more competitive if prices fell deflation came from recession falling wages and rising unemployment interest rates remained high with banks lending dollars at 25 share of public spending in gdp increased from 27 in 1995 to 30 in 2000 some poorer provinces had depended on state enterprises or on inefficient industries such as sugar which could not compete when trade was opened to quell social unrest provincial governors padded their payrolls government had embarked on a pension reform with costs reaching 3 of gdp in 2000 as it still had to pay pensioners but no longer received contributions economic crisis 1998 2002 thumb 190px february 2002 depositors protest against frozen accounts for fear they might lose value or worse argentina fell into a deep recession in second half of 1998 triggered and then compounded by a series of adverse external shocks which included low prices for agricultural commodities appreciation of us dollar to which peso was pegged at par 1998 russian financial crisis ltcm crisis and devaluation of brazilian real in january 1999 argentina did not enjoy a rapid recovery and sluggishness of gdp growth fuelled concerns about sustainability of public debt in december 1999 president fernando de la rua took office seeking assistance from imf shortly thereafter in march 2000 imf agreed to a three year 7 2 billion stand by arrangement with argentina conditioned on a strict fiscal adjustment and assumption of 3 5 gdp growth in 2000 actual growth was 0 5 in late 2000 argentina began to experience severely diminished access to capital markets as reflected in a sharp and sustained rise in spreads on argentine bonds over u s treasuries in december de la rua government announced a 40 billion multilateral assistance package organized by imf uneven implementation of fiscal adjustments and reforms a worsening global macroeconomic environment and political instability led to complete loss of market access and intensified capital flight by second quarter of 2001 argentine debt held mostly in bonds was massively sold short and government found itself unable to borrow or meet debt payments in december 2001 a series of deposit runs began to have a severe impact on health of banking system leading argentine authorities to impose a partial deposit freeze with argentina no longer in compliance with conditions of expanded imf supported program imf decided to suspend disbursements at end of december in a climate of severe political and social unrest country partially defaulted on its international obligations in january 2002 it formally abandoned convertibility regime ensuing economic and political crisis was arguably worst since country s independence by end of 2002 economy had contracted by 20 since 1998 over course of two years output fell by more than 15 argentine peso lost three quarters of its value and registered unemployment exceeded 25 income poverty in argentina grew from an already high 35 4 in october 2001 to a peak of 54 3 in october 2002 critics of policy of economic liberalization pursued during menem presidency argued that argentina s economic woes were caused by neoliberalism which had been actively promoted by u s government and imf under washington consensus others have stressed that main shortcoming of economic policy making during 1990s was that economic reform was not pursued with enough determination a 2004 report by imf s independent evaluation office criticised imf s conduct prior to argentina s economic collapse of 2001 saying imf had supported country s fixed exchange rate for too long and was too lenient towards fiscal deficits return to growth 2003 2015 thumb in mid 2000s soybeans soybean oil and meal generated more than 20 of argentina s export revenue in january 2002 eduardo duhalde was appointed president becoming argentina s fifth president in two weeks roberto lavagna who became minister of economy in april 2002 was credited for ensuing recovery of economy having stabilised prices and exchange rate in a moment when argentina was at risk of hyperinflation since default in 2001 growth has resumed with argentine economy growing by over 6 a year for seven of eight years to 2011 this was achieved in part because of a commodity price boom and also because government managed to keep value of currency low boosting industrial exports kirchner administration nestor kirchner became president in may 2003 in mid 2000s export of unprocessed soybeans and of soybean oil and meal generated more than 20 of argentina s export revenue triple joint share of traditional exports beef and wheat export taxes comprised 8 to 11 of kirchner government s total tax receipts around two thirds of which came from soy exports taxes on imports and exports increased government spending from 14 to 25 of gdp however import and export taxes have discouraged foreign investment while high spending has pushed inflation over 20 an attempt by kirchner administration to impose price controls in 2005 failed as items most in demand went out of stock and mandatory prices were in most cases not observed various sectors of economy were re nationalised including national postal service 2003 san martin railway line 2004 water utility serving province of buenos aires 2006 and argentinas 2009 in december 2005 kirchner decided to liquidate argentine debt to imf in a single payment without refinancing for a total of 9 8 billion payment was partly financed by venezuela who bought argentine bonds for us 1 6 billion as of mid 2008 venezuela hold an estimated us 6 billion in argentine debt in 2006 argentina re entered international debt markets selling us 500 million of its bonar v five year dollar denominated bonds with a yield of 8 36

abandoned official argentine statistics are believed to have significantly underreported inflation since 2007 and independent economists publishing their own estimates of argentine inflation have been threatened with fines and prosecution in october 2008 president fernandez de kirchner nationalised private pension funds for almost 30 billion ostensibly to protect pensions from falling stock prices

exploitation as well as being a bad administrator concerned only in sending profits to spain and forsaking ypf s economic growth rising inflation and capital flight caused a rapid depletion of country

thumb argentina s gdp per capita in 1990 international geary khamis dollars as a percentage of us s 1900 2008 nobel prize winning economist simon is said to have remarked that there were four types of countries developed underdeveloped japan and argentina according to di tella and 1967 main difference between argentina and other settler societies such as australia and canada was its failure to seek adequate alternatives to compensate for end of geographical expansion with definitive closing of frontier solberg 1985 noted differences between land distribution in canada which led to a rising number of small farmers and small number of landowners each with large areas of land in argentina duncan and fogarty 1984 argued that key difference lies in contrast between stable flexible government of australia and poor governance of argentina according to platt and di tella 1985 political tradition and immigration from different regions were key factors while diaz alejandro 1985 suggested that a restrictive immigration policy similar to australia s would have increased productivity encouraged by relative scarcity of labour more recently taylor 1992 pointed that relatively high dependency ratio and slow demographic transition in argentina led to a reliance on foreign capital to offset resulting low savings rate from 1930s onwards accumulation of capital was hampered by relatively high prices of mostly imported capital goods which was caused by industrial policy of import substitution in contrast with export led growth favoured by canada other distorting factors behind high relative prices of capital goods include multiple exchange rates black market for foreign currencies depreciation of national currency and high customs tariffs this resulted in a lower capital intensity which led to lower rates of labour productivity ultimate cause of argentina s historical backwardness appears to be its institutional framework see also british investment in argentina notes references di
