procellariiformes is an order of seabirds that comprises four families albatrosses petrels and shearwaters and 2 families of storm petrels formerly called tubinares and still called tubenoses in english they are often referred to collectively as petrels a term that has been applied to all procellariiformes warham j 1996 behaviour population biology and physiology of petrels london academic press or more commonly all families except albatrosses brooke 2004 they are almost exclusively pelagic feeding in open ocean and have a cosmopolitan distribution across world s oceans with highest diversity being around new zealand procellariiformes are colonial mostly nesting on remote predator free islands larger species nest on surface while most smaller species nest in natural cavities and burrows they exhibit strong philopatry returning to their natal colony to breed and returning to same nesting site over many years procellariiformes are monogamous and form long term pair bonds that are formed over several years and may last for life of pair a single egg is laid per nesting attempt and usually a single nesting attempt is made per year although larger albatrosses may only nest once every two years both parents participate in incubation and chick rearing incubation times are long compared to other birds as are fledging periods once a chick has fledged there is no further parental care procellariiformes have had a long relationship with humans they have been important food sources for many people and continue to be hunted as such in some parts of world albatrosses in particular have been subject of numerous cultural depictions procellariiformes are one of most endangered bird taxa with many species threatened with extinction due to introduced predators in their breeding colonies marine pollution and danger of fisheries by catch scientists conservationists fishermen and governments around world are working to reduce threats posed to them and these efforts have led to signing of agreement on conservation of albatrosses and petrels a legally binding international treaty signed in 2001 biology distribution and movements procellariiformes have a cosmopolitan distribution across world s oceans and seas although at levels of family and genus there are some clear patterns antarctic petrels antarctica have to fly over to get to ocean from their breeding colonies in antarctica and northern fulmars breed on northeastern tip of greenland furthest north piece of land most cosmopolitan family is procellariidae which are found in tropical temperate and polar zones of both northern and southern hemispheres though majority do not breed in tropics and half species are restricted to southern temperate and polar regions gadfly petrels pterodroma have a generally tropical and temperate distribution whereas fulmarine petrels are mostly polar with some temperate species majority of fulmarine petrels along with prions are confined to southern hemisphere storm petrels are almost as widespread as procellariids and fall into two distinct subfamilies oceanitinae have a mostly southern hemisphere distribution and hydrobatinae are found mostly in northern hemisphere amongst albatrosses majority of family is restricted to southern hemisphere feeding and nesting in cool temperate areas although one genus phoebastria ranges across north pacific family is absent from north atlantic although fossil records indicate they bred there once finally diving petrels are restricted to southern hemisphere migration various species within order have a variety of migration strategies some species undertake regular trans equatorial migrations such as sooty shearwater which annually migrates from its breeding grounds in new zealand and chile to north pacific off japan alaska and california an annual round trip of longest measured annual migration of any bird a number of other petrel species undertake trans equatorial migrations including wilson s storm petrel and providence petrel but no albatrosses cross equator as they rely on wind assisted flight there are other long distance migrants within order swinhoe s storm petrels breed in western pacific and migrates to western indian ocean and bonin petrels nesting in hawaii migrate to coast of japan during non breeding season navigation many species in order travel long distances over open water but return to same nest site each year raising question of how they navigate so accurately welsh naturalist ronald lockley carried out early research into animal navigation with manx shearwaters that nested on island of skokholm in release experiments a manx shearwater flew from boston to skokholm a distance of in 12 days cocker 2005 pp 21 24 lockley showed that when released under a clear sky with sun or stars visible shearwaters oriented themselves and then flew off in a direct line for skokholm making journey so rapidly that they must have flown almost in a straight line but if sky was overcast at time of release shearwaters flew around in circles as if lost and returned slowly or not at all implying that they navigated using astronomical cues morphology and flight alt massive white bird with black wings and pink bill sits on surface of water thumb left southern royal albatross is one of largest of procellariiformes procellariiformes range in size from very large wandering albatross at and a wingspan to tiny birds like least storm petrel at with a wingspan and smallest of prions fairy prion with a wingspan of their nostrils are enclosed in one or two tubes on their straight deeply grooved bills with hooked tips beaks are made up of several plates their wings are long and narrow feet are webbed and hind toe is undeveloped or non existent their adult plumage is predominantly black white and grey order has a few unifying characteristics starting with their tubular nasal passage which is used for olfaction this ability to smell helps to locate patchily distributed prey at sea and may also help locate their nests within nesting colonies structure of bill which contains seven to nine distinct horny plates is another unifying feature although there are differences within order petrels have a plate called maxillary that forms a hook on maxilla smaller members of order have a comb like mandible made by plate for plankton feeding most members of order are unable to walk well on land and many species visit their remote breeding islands only at night exceptions are huge albatrosses several of gadfly petrels and shearwaters and fulmar petrels latter can disable even large predatory birds with their obnoxious stomach oil which they can project some distance this stomach oil stored in proventriculus is a digestive residue created in foregut of all tubenoses except diving petrels and is used mainly for storage of energy rich food during their long flights oil is also fed to their young as well as being used for defence thumb alt white bird with grey upperparts and black face mask jumps off water surface with elongated legs white faced storm petrel moves across water s surface in a series of bounding leaps procellariiformes drink seawater so they have to excrete excess salt all birds have an enlarged nasal gland at base of bill above eyes and in procellariiformes gland is active in general terms salt gland removes salt from system and forms a 5 percent saline solution that drips out of nostrils or is forcibly ejected in some petrels processes behind this involve high levels of sodium ion reabsorption into blood plasma within kidneys and secretion of sodium chloride via salt glands using less water than was absorbed which essentially generates salt free water for other physiological uses this high efficiency of sodium ion absorption is attributed to mammalian type most albatrosses and procellariids use two techniques to minimise exertion while flying namely dynamic soaring and slope soaring albatrosses and giant petrels share a morphological adaptation to aid in flight a sheet of tendon which locks wing when fully extended allowing wing to be kept up and out without any muscle effort amongst oceanitinae storm petrels there are two unique flight patterns one being surface pattering in this they move across water surface holding and moving their feet on water s surface while holding steady above water and remaining stationary by hovering with rapid fluttering or by using wind to anchor themselves in place a similar flight method is thought to have been used by extinct petrel family diomedeoididae white faced storm petrel possesses a unique variation on pattering holding its wings motionless and at an angle into wind it pushes itself off water s surface in a succession of bounding jumps diet and feeding procellariiformes are for most part exclusively marine foragers only exception to this rule are two species of giant petrel which regularly feed on carrion or other seabirds while on land while some other species of fulmarine and procellaria petrels also take carrion diet of most species of albatrosses and petrels is dominated by fish squid krill and other marine zooplankton importance of these food sources varies from species to species and family to family for example of two albatross species found in hawaii black footed albatross takes mostly fish while laysan feeds mainly on squid brooke 2004 p 126 albatrosses in general feed on fish squid and krill among procellariids prions concentrate on small crustacea fulmarine petrels take fish and krill but little squid while procellaria petrels consume mainly squid storm petrels take small droplets of oil from surface of water as well as small crustaceans and fish brooke 2004 p 127 petrels obtain food by snatching prey while swimming on surface snatching prey from wing or diving down under water to pursue prey dipping down from flight is most commonly used by gadfly petrels and storm petrels there have been records of wedge tailed shearwaters snatching flying fish from air but as a rule this technique is rare some diving birds may aid diving by beginning with a plunge from air but for most part petrels are active divers and use their wings to move around under water depths achieved by various species were determined in 1990s and came as a surprise to scientists short tailed shearwaters have been recorded diving to and light mantled sooty albatross to brooke 2004 pp 128 131 breeding behaviour breeding colonies thumb 220px christmas shearwaters are one of surface nesting tropical procellariiformes all procellariiformes are colonial predominantly breeding on offshore or oceanic islands few species that nest on continents do so in inhospitable environments such as dry deserts or on antarctica these colonies can vary from widely spaced colonies of giant petrels to dense 3 6 million strong colonies of leach s storm petrels for almost all species need to breed is only reason that procellariiformes return to land at all some of larger petrels have to nest on windswept locations as they require wind to take off and forage for food within colonies pairs defend usually small territories giant petrels and some albatrosses can have very large territories which is small area around either nest or a burrow competition between pairs can be intense as is competition between species particularly for burrows larger species of petrels will even kill chicks and even adults of smaller species in disputes over burrows burrows and natural crevices are most commonly used by smaller species all storm petrels and diving petrels are cavity nesters as are many of procellariids fulmarine petrels and some tropical gadfly petrels and shearwaters are surface nesters as are all albatrosses procellariiformes show high levels of philopatry both site fidelity and natal philopatry natal philopatry is tendency of an individual bird to return to its natal colony to breed often many years after leaving colony as a chick this tendency has been shown through ringing studies and mitochondrial dna studies birds ringed as chicks have been recaptured close to their original nests sometimes extremely close in laysan albatross average distance between hatching site and site where a bird established its own territory was and a study of cory s shearwaters nesting near corsica found that nine out of 61 male chicks that returned to breed at their natal colony actually bred in burrow they were raised in mitochondrial dna provides evidence of restricted gene flow between different colonies strongly suggesting philopatry other type of philopatry exhibited is site fidelity where pairs of birds return to same nesting site for a number of years among most extreme examples known of this tendency was fidelity of a ringed northern fulmar that returned to same nest site for 25 years average number of birds returning to same nest sites is high in all species studied with around 91 percent for bulwer s petrels and 85 percent of males and 76 percent of females for cory s shearwaters after a successful breeding attempt pair bonds and life history thumb alt three massive birds stand on low grasslands closest bird has its long wings outstretched and its head pointing upward left wandering albatrosses performing their mating dances on kerguelen islands procellariiformes are monogamous breeders and form long term pair bonds these pair bonds take several years to develop in some species particularly with albatrosses once formed they last for many breeding seasons in some cases for life of pair petrel courtship can be elaborate it reaches its extreme with albatrosses where pairs spend many years perfecting and elaborating mating dances these dances are composed of synchronised performances of various actions such as preening pointing calling bill clacking staring and combinations of such behaviours like sky call each particular pair will develop their own individual version of dance breeding behaviour of other procellariiformes is less elaborate although similar bonding behaviours are involved particularly for surface nesting species these can involve synchronised flights mutual preening and calling calls are important for helping birds locate potential mates and distinguishing between species and may also help individuals assess quality of potential mates after pairs have been formed calls serve to help them reunite ability of individuals to recognise their own mate has been demonstrated in several species procellariiformes are k selected being long lived and caring extensively for their few offspring breeding is delayed for several years after fledging sometimes for as long as ten years in largest species once they begin breeding they make only a single breeding attempt per nesting season even if egg is lost early in season they seldom re lay much effort is placed into laying a single proportionally large egg and raising a single chick procellariiformes are long lived longest living albatross known survived for 51 years but was probably older and even tiny storm petrels are known to have survived for 30 years

shearwater chick with guarding parent majority of procellariiformes nest once a year and do so seasonally brooke 2004 p 46 some tropical shearwaters like christmas shearwater are able to nest on cycles slightly shorter than a year and large great albatrosses genus diomedea nest in alternate years if successful most temperate and polar species nest over spring summer although some albatrosses and procellariids nest over winter in tropics some species can be found breeding throughout year but most nest in discreet periods procellariiformes return to nesting colonies as much as several months before laying and attend their nest sites regularly before copulation prior to laying females embark on a lengthy pre laying exodus to build up energy reserves in order to lay exceptionally large egg in stormy petrel a very small procellariiform egg can be 29 percent of body weight of female while in grey faced petrel female may spend as much as 80 days feeding out at sea after courtship before laying egg when female returns and lays incubation is shared between sexes with male taking first incubation stint and female returning to sea duration of individual stints varies from just a few days to as much as several weeks during which incubating bird can lose a considerable amount of weight warham j 1990 petrels their ecology and breeding systems london academic press incubation period varies from species to species around 40 days for smallest storm petrels but longer for largest species for albatrosses it can span 70 to 80 days which is longest incubation period of any bird brooke 2004 p 67 thumb left a laysan albatross feeds its chick parent pumps food from a modified foregut proventriculus and chick catches meal in its lower mandible upon hatching chicks are semi precocial having open eyes a dense covering of white or grey down feathers and ability to move around nesting site after hatching incubating adult remains with chick for a number of days a period known as guard phase in case of most burrow nesting species this is only until chick is able to thermoregulate usually two or three days diving petrel chicks take longer to thermoregulate and have a longer guard phase than other burrow nesters however surface nesting species which have to deal with a greater range of weather and to contend with predators like skuas and frigatebirds consequently have a longer guard phase as long as two weeks in procellariids and three weeks in albatrosses brooke 2004 p 75 chick is fed by both parents chicks are fed on fish squid krill and stomach oil stomach oil is oil composed of neutral dietary lipids that are residue created by digestion of prey items as an energy source for chicks it has several advantages over undigested prey its calorific value is around 9 6 kcal per gram which is only slightly lower than value for diesel oil this can be a real advantage for species that range over huge distances to provide food for hungry chicks oil is also used in defence all procellariiformes create stomach oil except diving petrels chick fledges between two and nine months after hatching almost twice as long as a gull of same body mass reasons behind length of time are associated with distance from breeding site to food first there are few predators at nesting colonies therefore there is no pressure to fledge quickly second time between feedings is long due to distance from nest site that adults forage thus a chick that had a higher growth rate would stand a better chance of starving to death duration between feedings vary among species and during stages of development small feeds are frequent during guard phase but afterward become less frequent however each feed can deliver a large amount of energy both sooty shearwater and mottled petrel chicks have been recorded to double their weight in a single night probably when fed by both parents relationship with humans role in culture thumb upright 1 2 albatross about my neck was hung

food sources for humans for as long as people have been able to reach their remote breeding colonies amongst earliest known examples of this is remains of shearwaters and albatrosses along with those of other seabirds in 5 000 year old middens in chile although it is likely that they were exploited prior to this since then many other marine cultures both subsistence and industrial have exploited procellariiformes in some cases almost to extinction some cultures continue to harvest shearwaters a practice known as for example maori of new zealand use a sustainable traditional method known as in alaska residents of kodiak island harpoon short tailed albatrosses diomedea albatrus and until late 1980s residents of tristan island in indian ocean harvested eggs of yellow nosed mollymawks diomedea chlororhynchos and sooty albatrosses phoebetria fusca albatrosses and petrels are also now tourist draws in some locations such as taiaroa head while such exploitation is non consumptive it can have deleterious effects that need careful management to protect both birds and tourism english naturalist william wrote in 1843 that ten or twelve years ago mr gould exhibited twenty four storm petrels in a large dish at one of evening meetings of zoological society engraver thomas bewick wrote in 1804 that pennant speaking of those birds which breed on or inhabit isle of st kilda says no bird is of so

retrieved march 17 2006 before 1991 and ban on drift net fisheries it was estimated that 500 000 seabirds a year died as a result this has caused steep declines in some species as procellariiformes are extremely slow breeders and cannot replace their numbers fast enough losses of albatrosses and petrels in southern ocean were estimated at between 1 percent and 16 percent per year which these species cannot sustain for long exotic species introduced to remote breeding colonies threaten all types of procellariiformes these principally take form of predators most albatross and petrel species are clumsy on land and unable to defend themselves from mammals such as rats feral cats and pigs this phenomenon ecological naivete has resulted in declines in many species and was implicated in extinction of guadalupe storm petrel already in 1910 godman wrote introduced herbivores may unbalance ecology of islands introduced rabbits destroyed forest understory on cabbage tree island off new south wales which increased vulnerability of gould s petrels nesting on island to natural predators and left them vulnerable to sticky fruits of native birdlime tree in natural state these fruits lodge in understory of forest but with understory removed fruits fall to ground where petrels move about sticking to their feathers and making flight impossible thumb this albatross bolus found in hawaiian islands includes flotsam that was ingested but successfully ejected along with other indigestible matter if such flotsam cannot be ejected it may cause sickness or death exploitation has decreased in importance as a threat other threats include ingestion of plastic flotsam once swallowed plastic can cause a general decline in fitness of bird or in some cases lodge in gut and cause a blockage leading to death by starvation it can also be picked up by foraging adults and fed to chicks stunting their development and reducing chances of successfully fledging auman h j ludwig j p

1907 1910 procellariiformes comes from latin word procella which means a violent wind or a storm and for order order was named procellariiformes by german anatomist max furbringer in 1888 until beginning of 20th century family hydrobatidae was named procellariidae and family now called procellariidae was rendered order itself was called tubinares a major early work on this group is frederick godman s monograph of petrels five fascicles 1907 1910 with figures by john gerrard keulemans in sibley ahlquist taxonomy tubenoses were included in a greatly enlarged order ciconiiformes this taxonomic treatment was almost certainly erroneous but its assumption of a close evolutionary relationship with other higher waterbirds such as loons and penguins appears to be correct procellariiformes are 2014 considered to be most closely related to penguins having diverged from them about 60 million years ago there are around 125 living species of procellariiformes worldwide and order is traditionally divided into four extant families with one extinct family diomedeoididae early oligocene early miocene is an extinct group that had narrow beaks and feet with wide flat phalanges especially on fourth toe family procellariidae shearwaters fulmarine petrels gadfly petrels and prions are a varied group of small or medium sized seabirds largest being giant petrels they are heavy for their size with a high wing loading so they need to fly fast most except giant petrels have weak legs and are nearly helpless on land family diomedeidae albatrosses are very large
