battle of towton was fought on 29 march 1461 during english wars of roses near village of towton now in north yorkshire a culminating battle in dynastic struggles between houses of lancaster and york for control of english throne engagement ended in an overwhelming victory for yorkists it brought about a change of monarchs in england with victor yorkist edward iv having displaced lancastrian henry vi on throne since 1422 as king and thus driving head of lancastrians and his key supporters out of country it is described as probably largest and bloodiest battle ever fought on english soil and according to historical sources probably longest according to chroniclers more than 50 000 yorkist and lancastrian soldiers fought for hours amidst a snowstorm on that day which was palm sunday a newsletter circulated a week after battle reported that 28 000 died on battlefield contemporary accounts described henry vi as peaceful and pious not suited for violent dynastic civil wars such as wars of roses he had periods of insanity while his inherent benevolence eventually required his wife margaret of anjou to assume control of his kingdom which contributed to his own downfall his ineffectual rule had encouraged nobles schemes to establish control over him and situation deteriorated into a civil war between supporters of margaret and those of richard duke of york after yorkists captured henry in 1460 english parliament passed an act of accord to let york and his line succeed henry as king margaret refused to accept dispossession of her son s right to throne and along with fellow lancastrian malcontents raised an army richard of york was killed at battle of wakefield and his titles including claim to throne passed to his eldest son edward nobles who were previously hesitant to support richard s claim to throne considered lancastrians to have reneged on act a legal agreement and edward found enough backing to denounce henry and declare himself king battle of towton was to affirm victor s right to rule over england through force of arms on reaching battlefield yorkists found themselves heavily outnumbered part of their force under duke of norfolk had yet to arrive yorkist leader lord fauconberg turned tables by ordering his archers to take advantage of strong wind to outrange their enemies one sided missile exchange with lancastrian arrows falling short of yorkist ranks provoked lancastrians into abandoning their defensive positions ensuing hand to hand combat lasted hours exhausting combatants arrival of norfolk s men reinvigorated yorkists and encouraged by edward they routed their foes many lancastrians were killed while fleeing some trampled each other and others drowned in rivers which are said to have made them run red with blood for several days several who were taken as prisoners were executed power of house of lancaster was severely reduced after this battle henry fled country and many of his most powerful followers were dead or in exile after engagement letting edward rule england uninterrupted for nine years before a brief restoration of henry to throne later generations remembered battle as depicted in william shakespeare s dramatic adaptation of henry s life henry vi part 3 act 2 scene 5 in 1929 towton cross was erected on battlefield to commemorate event various archaeological remains and mass graves related to battle were found in area centuries after engagement setting in 1461 england was in sixth year of wars of roses a series of civil wars between houses of york and lancaster over english throne lancastrians backed reigning king of england henry vi an indecisive man who had bouts of madness leader of yorkists was initially richard duke of york who resented dominance of a small number of aristocrats favoured by king principally his close relatives beaufort family fuelled by rivalries between influential supporters of both factions york s attempts to displace henry s favourites from power led to war after capturing henry at battle of northampton in 1460 duke who was of royal blood issued his claim to throne even york s closest supporters among nobility were reluctant to usurp dynasty nobles passed by a majority vote act of accord which ruled that duke and his heirs would succeed throne upon henry s death queen of england margaret of anjou refused to accept an arrangement that deprived her son edward of westminster of his birthright she had fled to scotland after yorkist victory at northampton there she began raising an army promising her followers freedom to plunder on march south through england her lancastrian supporters also mustered in north of england preparing for her arrival york marched with his army to meet this threat but he was lured into a trap at

army and they marched south plundering settlements in their wake they liberated henry after defeating yorkist army of richard neville earl of warwick in second battle of st albans and continued pillaging on their way to london city of london refused to open its gates to henry and margaret for fear of being looted lancastrian army was short of supplies and had no adequate means to replenish them when margaret learned that richard of york s eldest son edward earl of march and his army had won battle of mortimer s cross in herefordshire and were marching towards london she withdrew lancastrians to york warwick and remnants of his army marched from st albans to join edward s men and yorkists were welcomed into london having lost custody of henry yorkists needed a justification to continue rebellion against king and his lancastrian followers on 4 march warwick proclaimed young yorkist leader as king edward iv proclamation gained greater acceptance than richard of york s earlier claim as several nobles opposed to letting edward s father ascend throne viewed lancastrian actions as a betrayal of legally established accord country now had two kings a situation that could not be allowed to persist especially if edward were to be formally crowned edward offered amnesty to any lancastrian supporter who renounced henry move was intended to win over commoners his offer did not extend to wealthy lancastrians mostly nobles young king summoned and ordered his followers to march towards york to take back his family s city and to formally depose henry through force of arms yorkist army moved along three routes warwick s uncle lord fauconberg led a group to clear way to york for main body which was led by edward duke of norfolk was sent east to raise forces and rejoin edward before battle warwick s group moved to west of main body through midlands gathering men as they went on 28 march leading elements of yorkist army came upon remains of crossing in ferrybridge that spanned river aire they were rebuilding bridge when they were attacked and routed by a band of about 500 lancastrians led by lord clifford learning of encounter edward led main yorkist army to bridge and was forced into a gruelling battle although yorkists were superior in numbers narrow bridge was a bottleneck forcing them to confront clifford s men on equal terms edward sent fauconberg and his horsemen to ford river at castleford which should have been guarded by henry earl of northumberland but he arrived late by which time yorkists had crossed ford and were heading to attack lancastrians at ferrybridge from flank lancastrians retreated but were chased to dale where they were all killed clifford was slain by an arrow to his throat having cleared vicinity of enemy forces yorkists repaired bridge and pressed onwards to camp overnight at sherburn in elmet lancastrian army marched to tadcaster about north of towton and made camp as dawn broke two rival armies struck camp under dark skies and strong winds although it was palm sunday a day of holy significance to christians forces prepared for battle and a few documents named engagement battle of palme felde but name did not gain wide acceptance popular opinion favoured naming battle after village of towton because of its proximity and it being most prominent in area force compositions contemporary sources declare that two armies were huge stating that more than 100 000 men fought in battle an account in william gregory s chronicle of london 15th century by a soldier who had served in wars claimed that yorkists had 200 000 soldiers while lancastrian army had even more later historians believe that these figures were exaggerated and that a combined figure of around 50 000 is more likely nevertheless armies gathered at towton were among largest at time an analysis of skeletons found in a mass grave in 1996 showed that soldiers came from all walks of life they were on average 30 years old and several were veterans of previous engagements many knights and noblemen approximately three quarters of english peers fought in battle eight of them were sworn to yorkist cause whereas lancastrians had at least 19 battle would decide which of two kings would rule over england but while edward fought beside his men henry remained in york with margaret lancastrians regarded their king as a mere puppet of his wife and were wary of his mental instability in comparison edward was inspirational to his followers eighteen years old he was 6ft 3 1 2 inches tall and an imposing sight in armour skilled in combat edward led his men from front motivating them to do their best and uplifting their spirits edward s preference for bold offensive tactics determined yorkist plan of action for this engagement historian nigel h jones nonetheless points out superior number of lancastrian peers over their yorkist counterparts as a testimony to semi religious power of an anointed medieval king however incapable to command

prominent leaders warwick having a flamboyant appeal to his followers edward hall a 16th century chronicler attributed to warwick an inspirational scene before battle of towton hall wrote that warwick wounded at ferrybridge slew his horse and cried let him fly that will for surely i will tarry with him that will tarry with me daring any yorkist to quit fight ahead description is likely apocryphal military historian christopher gravett said that tale demonstrates warwick s loyalty to edward and his fellow men if it is true warwick placed great value on his uncle lord fauconberg whom hall called a man of great policy and of much experience in martial feats small in stature and a veteran of anglo french wars fauconberg was highly esteemed by his peers in matters of military affairs he was quick to adapt to new situations among his previous achievements were administration of french town of calais leading several piracy expeditions of import and command of vanguard at battle of northampton of those appointed to raise men for battle norfolk likely never made it to engagement due to his advanced age and his knights walter blount and robert horne would have taken command of his contingent in any event norfolk was an unpredictable ally he had joined yorkists to establish a power base for himself in eastern england and wavered in his support for their cause on various occasions without their king on battlefield lancastrians relied on henry beaufort duke of somerset to command their army he was fairly experienced in matters of war and is credited with clever manoeuvres that led lancastrians to victory at wakefield and st albans according to several historians however sir andrew trollope and not somerset was lancastrians primary strategist trollope formerly served under warwick in calais before defecting to lancastrians in early stages of wars of roses his change of allegiance was a major blow to yorkists for he was familiar with their men and had played a key role in their victories in france other notable lancastrian leaders included henry holland duke of exeter and northern magnates henry percy earl of northumberland lord de ros and ralph dacre who also accompanied army another leading northern lancastrian was lord clifford who had died earlier in retreat from ferrybridge deployment thumb 300px left alt two forces face each other across a dale a small patch of woods stand to their west a river flows around battlefield from west to north initial deployments yorkists white and lancastrians red at towton very few historical sources give detailed accounts of battle and they do not describe exact deployments of armies paucity of such primary sources led early historians to adopt hall s chronicle as their main resource for engagement despite its authorship 70 years after event and questions over origin of his information burgundian chronicler jean de waurin c 1398 c 1474 was a more contemporary source but his chronicle was made available to public only from 1891 and several mistakes in it discouraged historians at that time from using it later reconstructions of battle were based on hall s version supplemented by minor details from other sources battle took place on a plateau between villages of saxton to south and towton to north region was agricultural land with plenty of wide open areas and small roads on which to manoeuvre armies two roads ran through area old london road which connected towton to english capital and a direct road between saxton and towton steeply banked cock beck flowed in an s shaped course around plateau from north to west plateau was bisected by towton dale which ran from west and extended into north acres in east woodlands were scattered along beck renshaw woods lined river on north western side of plateau and south of towton dale castle hill wood grew on west side of plateau at a bend in beck area to north east of this forest would be known as bloody meadow after battle according to gravett and fellow military enthusiast trevor james halsall somerset s decision to engage yorkist army on this plateau was sound defending ground just before towton would block any enemy advance towards city of york whether they moved along london towton road or an old roman road to west lancastrians deployed on north side of dale using valley as a protective ditch disadvantage of this position was that they could not see beyond southern ridge of dale lancastrian flanks were protected by marshes their right was further secured by steep banks of cock beck width of their deployment area did not allow for a longer front line depriving lancastrians of opportunity to use their numerical superiority waurin s account gave rise to suggestion that somerset ordered a force of mounted spearmen to conceal itself in castle hill wood ready to charge into yorkist left flank at an opportune time in battle yorkists appeared as lancastrians finished deployment line after line of soldiers crested southern ridge of dale and formed up in ranks opposite their enemies as snow began to fall edward s army was outnumbered and norfolk s troops had yet to arrive to join them lancastrian army was organised in three divisions duke of somerset as overall commander of whole force headed main division in center alongside duke of exeter right wing was commanded by earl of northumberland whereas left division was led by earl of devon and lord dacre fighting thumb 300px yorkist leader william neville on horse and his archers took advantage of wind to inflict early damage

ordered all yorkist archers to step forward and unleash a volley of their arrows from what would be standard maximum range of their longbows with wind behind them yorkist missiles travelled farther than usual plunging deep into masses of soldiers on hill slope response from lancastrian archers was ineffective as heavy wind blew snow in their faces they found it difficult to judge range and pick out their targets and their arrows fell short of yorkist ranks fauconberg had ordered his men to retreat after loosing one volley thus avoiding any casualties unable to observe their results

lancastrian army moved from its position to engage yorkists in close combat seeing advancing mass of men yorkist archers shot a few more volleys before retreating behind their ranks of men at arms leaving thousands of arrows in ground to hinder lancastrian attack as yorkists reformed their ranks to receive lancastrian charge their left flank came under attack by horsemen from castle hill wood mentioned by waurin yorkist left wing fell into disarray and several men started to flee edward had to take command of left wing to save situation by engaging in fight and encouraging his followers his example inspired many to stand their ground armies clashed and archers shot into mass of men at short range lancastrians continuously threw fresher men into fray and gradually numerically inferior

such protection they were much more vulnerable to attacks of yorkists norfolk s troops were much fresher and faster fleeing across what would later become known as bloody meadow many lancastrians were cut down from behind or were slain after they had surrendered before battle both sides had issued order to give no quarter and yorkists were in no mood to spare anyone after long gruelling fight a number of lancastrians such as trollope also had substantial bounties on their heads gregory s chronicle stated 42 knights were killed after they were taken prisoner archaeological findings in late 20th century shed light on final moments of battle in 1996 workmen at a construction site in town of towton uncovered a mass grave which archaeologists believed to contain remains of men who were

historians believe was exaggerated number was taken from heralds estimate of dead and appeared in letters from edward and bishop of salisbury richard beauchamp other contemporary sources gave higher numbers ranging from 30 000 to 38 000 hall quoted an exact figure of 36 776 an exception was annales rerum anglicarum which stated lancastrians had 9 000 casualties an estimate ross found to be more

in battle or had refused to submit to him estates of a few of these nobles were confiscated by crown but rest were untouched remaining in care of their families edward also pardoned many of those he attainted after they submitted to his rule although henry was at large in scotland with his son battle put an end for time being to disputes over country s state of leadership since act of accord

deteriorated to such an extent that earl defected to lancastrians and forced edward to flee england restoring henry to throne interruption of yorkist rule was brief as edward regained his throne after

killed his own father in sixteenth century william shakespeare wrote a number of dramatisations of historic figures use of history as a backdrop against which familiar characters act out shakespeare s drama lends a sense of realism to his plays shakespeare wrote a three part play about henry vi relying heavily on hall s chronicle as a source his vision of battle of towton henry vi part 3 act 2 scene 5 touted as bloodiest engagement in wars of roses became a set piece about terror of civil war a national terror that is essentially familial historian bertram wolffe said it was thanks to shakespeare s dramatisation of battle that weak and ineffectual henry was at least remembered by english society albeit for his pining to have been born a shepherd rather than a king shakespeare s version of battle presents a notable scene that comes immediately after henry s soliloquy henry witnesses laments of two soldiers in battle one slays his opponent in hope of plunder only to find victim is his son other kills his enemy who turns out to be his father both killers have acted out of greed and fell into a state of deep grieving after discovering their misdeeds shakespearian scholar arthur percival rossiter names scene as most notable of playwright s written rituals delivery of event follows pattern of an opera after a long speech actors alternate among one another to deliver single line asides to audience in this scene of grief in a reversal of approach adopted in his later historical plays shakespeare uses anonymous fictional characters to illustrate ills of civil war while a historical king reflects on their fates michael hattaway emeritus professor of english literature at university of sheffield comments that shakespeare intended to show henry s sadness over war to elicit same emotion among audience and to expose henry s ineptness as king battle of towton was re examined by geoffrey hill in his poem funeral music 1968 hill presents historical event through voices of its combatants looking at turmoil of era through their eyes common soldiers grouse about their physical and sacrifices that they had made for ideas glorified by their leaders they share their superiors determination to seek destruction of their opponents even at cost of their lives hill depicts participants belief that event was pre destined and of utmost importance as a

battle of bosworth in 1485 and building was never completed it eventually fell into disrepair and collapsed ruins of structure were evident five centuries later in 1929 a stone cross supposedly from chapel was used to create towton cross also known as lord dacre s cross to commemorate those who died in battle several mounds on battlefield were thought to contain casualties of battle although historians believe these to be tumuli of much earlier origin more burial sites related to battle are found on chapel hill and around saxton lord dacre was buried at church of all saints in saxton and his tomb was reported in late 19th century to be well maintained although several of its panels had been weathered away bur tree from which dacre s killer shot his arrow was cut down by late 19th century leaving its stump on battlefield centuries after battle relics that have been found in area include rings arrowheads and coins people of elizabethan era england remembered battle as dramatised by shakespeare and image of engagement as charnel house where many sons of england were cut down endured for centuries however at start of 21st century largest and bloodiest battle ever fought on english soil was no longer prominent in public consciousness british journalists lamented that people were ignorant of battle of towton and of its significance according to english heritage battle was of greatest importance it was one of largest if not largest fought in england and it resulted in replacement of one royal dynasty by another hill expressed a different opinion although impressed with casualty figures touted by chroniclers he believed battle brought no monumental changes to lives of english people battle of towton was associated with a tradition previously upheld in village of tysoe warwickshire for several centuries a local farmer had scoured a hill figure red horse of tysoe each year as part of terms of his land tenancy while origins of tradition have never been conclusively identified it was locally claimed this was done to commemorate earl of warwick s inspirational deed of slaying his horse to show his resolve to stand and fight with common soldiers
