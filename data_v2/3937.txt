severe cyclonic storm agni was a tropical cyclone of 2004 north indian ocean cyclone season notable for its record proximity to equator it was second north indian ocean cyclone to receive a name after onil earlier in year agni formed on november 28 well to southwest of india in arabian sea and steadily intensified as it tracked northwestward joint typhoon warning center jtwc estimated peak 1 minute sustained winds of 120 km h 75 mph while india meteorological department imd estimated peak 3 minute sustained winds of 100 km h 65 mph imd is official warning center for north indian ocean after peaking it weakened due to wind shear dry air and cooler waters and jtwc issued its final advisory on december 3 as it approached coast of somalia remnants of agni moved along somalian coastline until dissipating on december 5 toc meteorological history a tropical disturbance was observed on november 19 about 800 km 500 mi southeast of colombo sri lanka in bay of bengal disturbance tracked westward gradually organizing and prompting jtwc to issue a tropical cyclone formation alert tcfa on november 22 after passing south of sri lanka it became disorganized and was no longer considered likely to develop into a tropical cyclone circulation associated with system continued westward reorganizing on november 26 in arabian sea despite being located unusually close to equator disturbance maintained convection or thunderstorms which was becoming organized around weak low level circulation with low wind shear and diffluence aloft jtwc remarked system had a fair chance of developing while system was organizing center crossed equator to reach about 0 5deg s thus becoming an anticyclonic circulation in southern hemisphere this was unusual as coriolis effect is nonexistent along equator coriolis effect refers to planetary vorticity which provides spin in a cyclone jtwc later assessed system as remaining in northern hemisphere reaching as far south as 0 7deg n or about 80 km 50 mi from equator after circulation organized further beneath convection jtwc issued another tcfa at 0300 utc on november 28 three hours later agency classified system as tropical cyclone 05a about 1300 km 800 mi southwest of southern tip of india in a post season analysis jtwc estimated cyclone became a tropical storm six hours earlier at around same time imd classified it as a low pressure area likely to become well marked upon being classified tropical cyclone was moving northwestward under influence of a ridge over india its outflow to north and south became better defined although its proximity to equator limited its southerly outflow somewhat due to wind shear early on november 29 imd classified system as a depression and throughout day it rapidly intensified to become a cyclonic storm a cyclonic storm is a tropical cyclone with at least 65 km h 40 mph winds sustained for 3 minutes around that time jtwc assessed cyclone as reaching peak winds of 120 km h 75 mph sustained for 1 minute along with gusts to 150 km h 90 mph late on november 29 cyclone weakened slightly only to regain its peak intensity by november 30 at that time it developed a banding eye and was located about 1500 km 900 mi southeast of coast of somalia at 1200 utc on november 30 imd issued its first complete advisory on cyclone naming it severe cyclonic storm agni and estimating peak winds at 100 km h 65 mph agency predicted storm would continue northwestward and strengthen slightly before weakening at its peak cyclone had a barometric pressure of 985 mbar right thumb cyclone agni at its closest approach to equator after reaching peak intensity an increase in wind shear caused eye to disappear and convection decreased significantly on december 1 imd estimated agni weakened to cyclonic storm status around which time center became exposed from convection cyclone continued its steady weakening continued due to wind shear presence of dry air and cooler water temperatures and by december 2 imd downgraded agni to depression status which was its final warning on system as it approached coast of somalia it turned westward due to building of a ridge over saudi arabia despite unfavorable conditions thunderstorms briefly reformed over circulation which allowed storm to maintain its intensity by late on december 3 agni weakened to below tropical storm status and jtwc issued its final warning while storm was about 450 km 275 mi south southeast of cape guardafui easternmost point of horn of africa circulation became difficult to locate by early on december 4 by which time system had little remaining convection it turned southwestward and later to south moving ashore on eastern somalia before dissipating on december 5 near over water records naming and impact according to rsmc new delhi cyclone agni developed into a depression at 1 5deg n which is same latitude as where according to rsmc tokyo tropical storm vamei formed during december 2001 however according to rsmc la reunion precursor low to cyclone agni briefly moved into southern hemisphere and kept its anticyclonic counter clockwise circulation agni was second storm in north indian ocean to receive a name after imd began tropical cyclone naming in middle of 2004 since cyclone was weak when it moved over somalia no casualties or significant damage was reported see also list of near equatorial tropical cyclones
