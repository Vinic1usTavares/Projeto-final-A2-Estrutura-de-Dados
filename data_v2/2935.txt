europa was a seaplane carrier of italian regia marina royal navy originally laid down as merchant ship manila she was renamed salacia in 1898 and then sold to german and then italian shipping companies in 1911 and 1913 respectively she became quarto in 1913 and in february 1915 she was purchased by italian fleet renamed europa and converted into a seaplane carrier with a capacity of eight seaplanes she served as a seaplane base in valona during world war i and supported allied response during battle of strait of otranto in 1917 she was quickly sold for scrap in 1920 after war ended original characteristics and career originally built for spanish company pinillos izquierdo cia as merchant steamer manila she was laid down in 1895 in scotland at charles connell and company shipyard in glasgow built as yard number 222 she was launched on 5 july and completed in august that year in 1898 she was sold to donaldson bros of glasgow scotland and renamed salacia retaining name salacia she was sold to hamburg based german shipping company m in 1912 she was sold to italian company tito campanella in genoa in 1913 and renamed quarto in 1914 manila was long at waterline and long overall she had a beam of she had a gross register tonnage of with a net tonnage of 2 636 her hull was divided into four holds two forward and two aft divided by central superstructure she had a short forecastle and quarterdeck as was common for merchant vessels of day ship was powered by a single vertical triple expansion engine steam was provided by three coal fired boilers trunked into two raked funnels located amidships both engines and boilers were manufactured by jackson of govan scotland her propulsion system was rated for a top speed of from and on speed trials she reached from she carried of coal which gave her a range of at a speed of when originally built she also had four derricks that could be rigged with two square and lug sails but these were quickly replaced with two smaller derricks between each pair of holds background and conversion italian regia marina had previously experimented with seaplane carriers with conversion of protected cruiser in 1914 ship proved that concept was viable for italian fleet though she had significant limitations particularly with regard to conducting sustained operations as she could only carry a maximum of five aircraft and she lacked room for maintenance facilities or magazines for aircraft british raid on cuxhaven launched from seaplane carries in december 1914 impressed upon italians for need for further development of italian naval air arm accordingly navy requested funding to purchase a merchant ship and convert it into a seaplane carrier which was approved in year s naval budget at time italian naval command recognized that relatively confined nature of mediterranean sea and particularly adriatic sea shared by its historic rival austria hungary meant that land based planes would bear bulk of combat responsibilities command envisioned using new seaplane carrier as a semi stationary floating base for aircraft at time most pressing need was for a seaplane base at valona where it would be used to help secure otranto barrage captain alessandro guidoni led a commission to find a suitable vessel for project and among vessels surveyed was steamship quarto then docked in taranto guidoni selected ship in his report that was submitted on 9 january 1915 naval staff concurred and purchased it and in addition to a seaplane carrier ship would also be used as a submarine tender on 6 february 1915 regia marina purchased vessel to convert her into a seaplane tender she arrived in la spezia later that month where work began on 20 february guidoni had drawn up plans for conversion which was completed by early may most of her original fittings were removed and hangars workshops and storage facilities were erected her holds were converted into storage tanks for aircraft fuel and lubricants as well as for compartments to store aircraft components equipment to service submarines including engines to recharge their batteries was also installed high length to beam ratio of ship proved to be a challenge in conversion process since hangars and other structures added to her decks increased her topweight and reduced her stability already a problem from her relatively narrow beam as a result several tons of ballast were added to help stabilize vessel general characteristics after her conversion her overall length increased to and her displacement became normally and up to at full load her draft varied from normally and at full load short forecastle and quarterdeck were extended to make ship flush decked though sides remained open to provide ventilation and light to what had been upper deck since forward hangar blocked old bridge a new one was installed atop hangar composed of a small deckhouse with a gangway that ran across deck a single pole mast was placed directly behind old bridge which was now used as a chart house and in front of first funnel forward visibility was poor so lookouts had to be stationed in crow s nest or on searchlight platform in front of hangar her crew numbered 11 officers and 155 enlisted men in 1915 and by 1918 this had increased to 14 officers and 195 men respectively her crew numbered 11 officers and 155 enlisted men in 1915 and by 1918 this had increased to 14 officers and 195 men respectively she carried a number of small boats including a steam pinnace two motor boats two whaleboats and five smaller boats larger boats were stored amidships and served by two davits on each side while smaller boats were kept inside hangars since she was classified as an auxiliary vessel her only armament consisted of a pair of guns for defense europa was armed with a two 40 caliber anti aircraft guns that were mounted on platforms one at bow and other at stern they were placed high above deck to provide them with widest possible fields of fire despite large hangars aviation facilities and equipment as converted she was equipped with two hangars that could store four seaplanes each forward hangar was long and aft one was long and they covered full beam of ship narrowness of ship prevented aircraft from being stowed sideways in hangars so they were held in line hangars had completely opened sides that could be sealed with waterproof tarps cranes were fitted to lower and raise aircraft into water where they would take off or land a further four to eight aircraft could be kept disassembled below decks fuel storage amounted to which was divided between thirty two separate tanks extensive subdivision of tanks improved stability by dispersing weight of fuel and minimized effect of moving liquid in hull in forward part of hull a large workshop was installed fitted with various lathes milling machines forges and other equipment necessary to repair or fabricate wood and metal parts for both aircraft and submarines below workshop was an ammunition magazine for aircraft and a refrigerated torpedo storage room in 1917 1918 a second workshop was installed in stern of ship in an area that had been used for parts storage two electrical generators and two generators were installed to recharge submarine batteries aircraft thumb an fba type c in french service being hoisted above french carrier similar to aircraft carried by europa europa originally carried a complement of macchi l 1 seaplanes and curtiss model h flying boats l 1 was used as a fighter and a bomber while model h was used for training and limited bombing operations as it was an older design that had been superseded by more modern aircraft these included macchi l 2 and m 3 flying boats beginning in 1916 in 1917 ship received macchi m 5 seaplanes which were dedicated fighters ship also carried fba seaplanes between 1916 and 1918 for bombing and anti submarine patrols from june to november 1918 europa operated a few ansaldo seaplane fighters though these proved to be unreliable and not particularly maneuverable service history after completing conversion in may 1915 ship spent much of rest of year assembling and training crew and conduct sea trials she received her 76 mm guns in september and she was formally commissioned into fleet on 6 october that month she was sent to brindisi where she replaced elba by december she was operating a contingent of two curtiss flying boats and six of l 1 seaplanes along with two more l 1s that were kept ashore ship was transferred to valona bay in albania part of which italy had occupied in october 1914 valona lacked any harbor facilities beyond outer moles and so ability to operate aircraft under such conditions proved to be invaluable a host of other support vessels including depot ships oilers and floating docks were stationed there as well at time italian strategy relied on valona and brindisi to contain austro hungarian squadron based at cattaro europa provided an important aerial reconnaissance force in support of this strategy ship was anchored in center of bay and at that time she operated eight of l 1s which were used to defend bay to patrol for austro hungarian and german u boats operating in adriatic and to attack austro hungarian coastal installations in mid may 1917 europas aircraft took part in battle of strait of otranto she had three aircraft ready morning of battle on 15 may and after reports of austro hungarian attack reached italian command her aircraft fba flying boats sortied to search for hostile vessels at 05 00 once there was enough light to see at 07 00 they returned refueled loaded bombs and departed again destroyer came alongside at 08 00 and took on fuel from europa departing at 09 45 to join search first fba attacked austro hungarian cruiser but scored only a near miss that knocked out some rivets in her rudder fbas shadowed austro hungarians before returning to europa to refuel on 16 july europas aircraft raided durazzo in company with two other units five of her m 5s joined three fbas based in brindisi and seven other aircraft from 257th squadron an italian army unit in valona aircraft scored thirty three hits on austro hungarian naval air station in harbor and significantly degraded its ability to conduct operations for several months over course of war ship s aircrews flew a total of 1 884 missions of which 1 500 were reconnaissance flights and more than 200 were combat sorties during which they dropped some 2 000 bombs toward end of war her aircraft were sent ashore and europa operated primarily as a submarine tender after austria hungary surrendered in november 1918 europa took part in occupation of sebenico and other ports in dalmatia in 1919 she returned to taranto and then to la spezia in postwar period naval aviation fell out of favor particularly as a result of giulio douhet s views on air power namely his preference for strategic bombing over other types of tactical and operational doctrines in addition europa was by then more than twenty years old and her low speed kept her from operating with main fleet and conducting offensive operations as a result she was decommissioned on 10 september 1920 and thereafter broken up for scrap in italy notes references category 1895 ships category ships built on river clyde category merchant ships of spain
