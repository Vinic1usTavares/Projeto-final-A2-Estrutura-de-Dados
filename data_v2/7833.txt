minnesota twins scout edwin rodriguez followed and scrutinized molina starting in high school he observed that molina s skills closely resembled that of both his older brothers both accomplished major league catchers and decided that his defense was polished enough to be considered more advanced than most high schoolers in united states however molina s hitting lagged behind his defense initial report on his skill set was defensive catcher great arm weak bat his closest comparable hitter as catcher was one who cardinals eventually placed at top of their organizational ladder and his future manager mike matheny before he was drafted molina worked out for cincinnati reds he put on a spectacle at riverfront stadium with his arm and bat that grabbed attention of executives scouts and prominent former reds players including johnny bench and bob boone as molina recalled he left session with impression that cincinnati intended to draft him undeterred by universal reservations about his offensive ceiling st louis cardinals instead took molina in fourth round of 2000 mlb draft and signed him for 325 000 cardinals invited molina to major league spring training camp following his draft although described as raw young catcher purposed with fascination to emulate matheny at one point in that extended spring training instructor dave ricketts observed molina from a golf cart during a game as he was still learning how to catch he had been transitioning from third base after allowing a passed ball through his legs with a runner on third base molina raced to backstop to retrieve ball still hoping to prevent runner from scoring he instead found ricketts in golf cart parked on top of home plate ricketts had a reputation for becoming upset when minor league catchers allowed balls to bounce between their legs for this he removed molina from game and drove him to batting cage there ricketts batted 150 to 200 ground balls as molina estimated to improve young catcher s ability to block pitches molina began his professional career with johnson city cardinals of rookie level appalachian league in 2001 playing 44 total games and batting 259 he advanced one level in each of four seasons in minor leagues even without highly developed offensive skills molina proved difficult to strike out mainly a singles hitter who favored hitting ball other way he batted 278 with

had made only partial contact because of broken bat by time cameron charged ball it was too late it fell in for a hit and jim edmonds was able to score three weeks later august 29 cardinals were victorious over pittsburgh pirates 6 4 thanks in part to two separate plays in which molina tagged out runner at home plate including a collision with ty wigginton molina appeared in 51 regular season games and batted 267 with two home runs and 15 rbi in 151 plate appearances he made an immediate impact with his arm throwing out more than 50 percent of would be base stealers nine of 17 in world

cardinals he changed his jersey number from 41 to 4 however regular season presented some of his greatest offensive challenges as he struggled through a career worst 216 batting average in 461 regular season plate appearances it was a culmination of a decline over his first three seasons molina s on base plus slugging percentages ops registered at 684 in 2004 654 in 2005 and 595 in 2006 low batting average was due in part to a deflated batting average on balls in play babip of 226 normal is around 300 a career low in a may 27 game against san diego padres at petco park in san diego with cardinals holding a 4 3 lead in bottom of ninth molina picked brian giles off first to end game first pickoff to end a major league game in nearly four years cardinals faced padres again in national league division series nlds playoff game in playoffs he again picked a padre off at first this time mike piazza while bailing pitcher jeff suppan out of a jam for season he caught 41 of all base

endy chavez had prevented cardinals from taking lead when he leapt to catch scott rolen s near miss home run over left field fence this time however molina hit a two run home run off aaron heilman over left field that was too high for chavez to catch and gave cardinals a 3 1 edge in bottom of ninth rookie pitcher adam wainwright filling in as emergency closer found himself in a two out bases loaded situation against center fielder carlos beltran who had already homered three times in nlcs molina called for a mound conference initially he wanted a sinker from wainwright but changed his mind because he suspected wainwright would overthrow it and give beltran an easy pitch to hit molina made an unconventional choice by calling for a changeup to start sequence against beltran it was called for a strike had beltran successfully got a base hit scheme may have caused tension for third year catcher with la russa and pitching coach dave duncan because throwing a first pitch changeup ran contrary to duncan s teaching molina then called for two curveballs beltran fouled off first but wainwright struck him out looking at a bender that started up and away and bit hard to low inside

on fastballs that sapped his efforts over time with assistance of teammates such as pujols molina found his comfortable stance sounder mechanics and adopted a line drive style of swing that eliminated dip and helped him hit fastballs with more authority thus he became a more consistent hitter as his career progressed defying scouting reports that he would have a weak bat in combination with an

points was subtracted from his score designed to rate a player s overall batting production by assigning different weights to certain outcomes woba takes into account singles doubles triples home runs hit by pitches and unintentional walks woba is based on philosophy tango developed that not all outcomes are proportionally weighted unlike slugging percentage which assigns one base for a single two for a double etc or on base plus slugging which assumes that one base for slugging is equal to one walk woba attempts to measure impact of each event in terms of their run scoring value further woba
