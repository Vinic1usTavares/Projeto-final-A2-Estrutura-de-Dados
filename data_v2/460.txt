treat for their daughter frankie dies after blowing up a balloon leading to arguments between graham wishmakeruk representative sally tamsin greig and frankie s assistant si adam deacon over now valuable balloon containing frankie s last breath story written by pemberton and reece shearsmith was inspired by someone pemberton had seen on television who collected air from different places episode is more comedic than others in series and critiques celebrity culture and human greed last gasp received a fairly negative critical response in retrospect shearsmith claimed that people hated episode several critics including gerard gilbert of independent jack seale of radio times and comedy critic bruce dessau though complimentary of inside no 9 generally considered last gasp to be weaker than previous three episodes but not unwatchable other reviewers gave a more positive response but a particularly scathing review by columnist virginia blackburn was published in daily express on its first showing last gasp drew 872 000 viewers lower than any previous episode pemberton subsequently sold a balloon containing his own breath on ebay with proceeds going to a sport relief charity production last gasp was inspired by someone pemberton had seen on children s programme multi coloured swap shop who collected apparently empty jars which actually contained air taken from different places idea which he considered bizarre but very special had haunted him this gave him idea of collecting breath of celebrities death of michael jackson and death of amy winehouse along with associated collecting of memorabilia also served as inspiration for pemberton family and house in last gasp were very normal episode was filmed on location in what director david kerr called an utterly freezing house finished episode for kerr had a degree of suburban darkness in that though events unfold in a relatively unremarkable setting darker side of human nature is revealed at same time characters arguments lead to humour shearsmith described last gasp as like a my family episode gone wrong as format of inside no 9 requires new characters each week writers were able to attract actors who may have been unwilling to commit to an entire series in addition to pemberton who played graham father last gasp starred sophie thompson as jan mother lucy hutchinson as 9 year old tamsin david bedella as popstar frankie j parsons tamsin greig as sally of wishmakeruk and adam deacon as si parsons s assistant it was first episode of programme not to star shearsmith see for kerr typical difficulty associated with use of child actors was not present in last gasp for him hutchinson was superb she was brilliant she had maturity beyond her years pemberton and shearsmith had been keen to use inside no 9 as a vehicle to work with new people and had been keen to collaborate with greig for some time kerr said that one of real joys of inside no 9 was opportunity to see actors in very different roles to those in which they had previously starred he used greig as his example saying character of sally was somewhat different from roles in which greig had previously performed plot on ninth birthday of severely ill tamsin parents graham and jan struggle with a camcorder and blow up balloons a charity called wishmakeruk has arranged for pop star frankie j parsons to visit tamsin frankie arrives much to excitement of jan accompanied by his personal assistant si and wishmakeruk representative sally frankie visits tamsin in her bedroom and blows up a purple balloon for her he begins to struggle for breath and then collapses from an intracranial aneurysm later graham makes tea for jan and sally jan is upset about frankie s death si says that no one can touch anything or call an ambulance until frankie s manager arrives tamsin sitting in her wheelchair holds balloon and graham and si realise that it may be valuable si takes balloon from tamsin and graham ties it sally takes a call from her boss but does not mention frankie s death she makes excuses to have a colleague cover for her on her next assignment so that she can stay at house graham and si argue over balloon and graham gives it to sally as he considers her a neutral he looks online to work out how much balloon and accompanying footage may be worth later jan starts playing one of frankie s cds but graham turns it off to talk about money with si and sally jan takes tamsin outside tamsin worries that frankie s death is her fault because she asked him to blow up balloon she asks if frankie s soul will go to heaven and jan says that it will inside si sally and graham argue about how to split money they will make from balloon argument gets heated after sally argues that fact tamsin will soon die should preclude her from getting a share as graham threatens to pop balloon jan reappears and chastises him tamsin who is now considered neutral takes balloon graham says they should all settle down and have lunch in kitchen sally and jan talk about sally s work and in tamsin s bedroom graham and si talk about parsons with si revealing that parsons was actually unpleasant to work for there is a loud bang from outside and everyone goes back into lounge erroneously thinking that balloon has burst graham and si take balloon to an upstairs bedroom and tuck it into a bed while jan turns music back on everyone sits in silence waiting for parsons s manager to arrive jan suggests that graham blow up another balloon for tamsin sally si and graham realise that with camera footage they have they can blow up all purple balloons and sell them to multiple bidders jan screams when she sees movement in tamsin s bedroom and it is realised that frankie is still alive jan takes tamsin out of room and remaining three agree after panicked discussion that they should kill frankie si loses a coin toss and smothers frankie with a cushion later out on street frankie s body is put into an ambulance si says to sally and graham that he will be in touch and leaves sally and graham discuss selling camcorder footage and jan runs inside to see that tamsin is not in her chair or room upstairs tamsin crawls onto bed containing balloon carrying a heart shaped helium balloon on street sally graham and jan see tamsin opening upstairs window she releases helium balloon with balloon containing frankie s breath attached two float skyward as graham films themes and analysis comedy critic bruce dessau described episode as containing a nice if not very subtle critique of value of celebrity and noted that there was a flicker of s tale a story from writer geoffrey chaucer s collection canterbury tales rebecca writing in herald felt episode captures sheer of fandom she added that as plot advances venal and vulgar attitudes which are initially hidden behind characters fake grins are revealed for her story takes place around tamsin who looks worldly and disappointed with human race david chater of times identified celebrity worship and greed as episode s themes in south african newspaper star episode was identified as most cynical of first series for reviewer it parades before us depravity to which human animal will stoop and explores how agendas can be furthered under noble cover of altruism david upton writing for popmatters called it easily most acerbic and most overtly comic episode of series he listed three reasons that episode does not seem like something produced by pemberton and shearsmith its avoidance of horrific fact that it does not star shearsmith and its direct focus on celebrity culture which upton considers a modern phenomenon instead he suggested that it feels closer to a story from charlie brooker s anthology programme black mirror focus of last gasp on comedy to exclusion of horror for upton leaves it stranded when compared to other episodes some critics questioned plausibility of premise daily express columnist virginia blackburn felt that there was potential for a comedic critique of celebrity memorabilia market such a story she suggested would be based around selling balloon not breath something she felt may have happened paddy shennan writing for liverpool echo questioned extent to which ending would actually impact characters asking whether they could have nonetheless sold fake balloons for freelance journalist dan owen premise riff s on fact that online auction sites like ebay often sell ludicrous items for huge amounts of money owen argued that episode s plot offers an amusing way that such a sale could come about though not fraudulent sale would nonetheless be highly disrespectful and money grabbing reception gerard gilbert of independent jack seale of radio times dessau and owen all stressed that last gasp was weaker than three previous episodes of inside no 9 seale claimed that there were several sublime moments but no knockout blow while dessau wrote that it doesn t really go anywhere and it resolves itself a little too simplistically and owen felt that episode didn t manage to go anywhere very unexpected and just sort of ended all three suggested however that episode still had its strengths for seale it was as brilliantly acted and constructed as you d expect dessau considered it watchable and owen felt it was enjoyable to watch with a number of funny moments shennan writing for liverpool echo wrote that perhaps there had to be a dud or at least disappointing episode sooner or later noting that you can t win em all acting in episode was praised by michael hogan and rachel ward who wrote in daily telegraph that with their gift for comedy vulnerability and pathos tamsin grieg and sophie thompson deliver excellent performances similarly owen wrote that performances were good especially from thompson as mousy housewife and i liked sour expressions from child star hutchinson nonetheless he thought it regrettable than a real world musician had not been cast especially as he considered it unlikely that tamsin would admire parsons awarding episode three and a half out of five he thought set up sublime central dilemma amusing and execution typically brilliant in review published in star last gasp was described as hilarious title it was suggested is appropriate as i caught myself gasping more than once as its foul contents unfolded upton called episode a clever little piece on day it was shown last gasp was selected as comedy pick of day in daily express but following day an extremely critical review of episode by virginia blackburn was published in newspaper she felt that episode was disappointing and wasted talent of actors and that concept was sort of idea you can imagine two students coming up with after sixth pint and then feeling slightly embarrassed about it when they wake up next morning she summed up episode by saying that it was neither funny nor clever and is so utterly irredeemably silly that it ends up being incredibly irritating and nothing else an interview with shearsmith and pemberton was published on british comedy website chortle co uk after inside no 9 won chortle award for best tv show pair were asked if they would ever consider writing an episode with a happy ending shearsmith responded by saying yes because that would be biggest surprise of all but last year we had last gasp and that had quite a happy ending and people hated that one similarly pemberton suggested that people are disappointed if we don t deliver something horrible viewing figures based on overnight viewing figures last gasp drew a lower viewership than any previous
