to attract interest of corporate raiders although a corporation in top 100 of fortune 500 was in early 1980s thought immune to takeover risk its undoing as an independent company began in 1982 when t boone pickens nndb outline bio an amarillo texas oilman and corporate raider or and owner of mesa petroleum made an offer for comparatively larger but still considered non major oil company cities service company more generally known by name citgo from tulsa oklahoma which was then trading in low 20s pickens first privately offered 45 a share for a friendly takeover and then later made a 50 a share public offer when cities ceo rejected friendly offer texas style takeover time june 21 1982 gulf forestalled mesa s takeover attempt by offering 63 a share in a friendly offer which cities by

5 percent to sec in ten days allowed to prepare sec filing mesa and its investor partners accelerated buying to 11 percent of company s stock larger than founding mellon family s share by october 1983 gulf responded to mesa s interest by calling a shareholders meeting for late november 1983 and subsequently engaged in a proxy war on changing corporation s by laws to minimize arbitrage pickens made loud criticisms of existing gulf management and offered an alternative business plan intended to release shareholder value through a royalty trust that management argued would slim down gulf s market share pickens had acquired reputation of being a corporate raider whose skill lay in making profits out of bidding for companies but without actually acquiring them during early 1980s alone he made failed bids for cities service general american oil gulf phillips petroleum and unocal process of making such bids would promote a frenzy of asset divestiture and debt reduction in target companies this is a standard defensive tactic calculated to boost current share price although possibly at expense of long term strategic advantage target shares would rise sharply in price at which point pickens would dispose of his interest at a substantial profit famous texans outline history of pickens and mesa see para 5 gulf management and directors took view that mesa bid represented an undervaluation of gulf business as a long term going concern and that it was not in interest of gulf shareholders james lee gulf s ceo and chairman even claimed during november 1983 shareholders meeting to address mesa ownership that pickens royalty trust idea was nothing more than a get rich quick scheme that would undermine corporation s profit potential in coming decades gulf therefore sought to resist pickens by various means including as a delaware corporation voiding ability of shareholders to cumulatively vote fearing that pickens would use his shares to gain control of board and listening to offers from ashland oil which would double gulf s price from its pre mesa level general electric two years before it took over media company nbc rko and finally chevron to act as its white knight in late 1984 gulf divested many of its worldwide operating subsidiaries and then merged with chevron by spring of 1985 mesa group of investors was reported to have made a profit of 760 million million today when it assigned its gulf shares to chevron pickens has claimed that after realizing a more than doubling of stock appreciation for gulf shareholders as well as its management that fought him at every turn mesa s shares were last to be paid out by chevron forced merger of gulf and chevron was controversial with u s senate considering legislation to freeze oil industry mergers for a year before reagan administration made it known it opposed government intervention in matter and would veto any bill however pickens and lee gulf s ceo were summoned to testify before
