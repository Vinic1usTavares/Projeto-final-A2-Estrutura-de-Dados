thumb right alt an oil painting depicting a standing partially clothed woman left leaning on a nude man right sitting holding a lyre in fragment 16 sappho uses helen s love for paris depicted here in a painting by jacques louis david as an example of her claim that most beautiful thing in world is whatever one most loves sappho 16 is a fragment of a poem by archaic greek lyric poet sappho it is from book i of alexandrian edition of sappho s poetry and is known from a second century papyrus discovered at oxyrhynchus in egypt at beginning of twentieth century sappho 16 is a love poem genre for which sappho was best known which praises beauty of narrator s beloved anactoria and expresses speaker s desire for her now that she is absent it makes case that most beautiful thing in world is whatever one desires using helen of troy s elopement with paris as a mythological exemplum to support this argument poem is at least 20 lines long though it is uncertain whether poem ends at line 20 or continues for another stanza preservation fragment 16 was preserved on papyrus oxyrhynchus 1231 a second century manuscript of book i of an edition of sappho published by bernard pyne grenfell and arthur surridge hunt in 1914 in 2014 a papyrus discovered by simon burris jeffrey fish and dirk obbink p gc inv 105 added a few words to known text of poem this papyrus dates to late second or early third century and is in same hand as a second papyrus published for first time in 2014 p obbink which preserves five stanzas of sappho s brothers poem poem fragment 16 is along with other poems of book i of sappho s works composed in sapphic stanzas this metre is made up of stanzas of four lines first three of which are sapphic of form v x v v v followed by a five syllable of form v v at least five stanzas survive whether poem ends there or continues into what burris fish and obbink number fragment 16a is disputed poem is one of five surviving poems by sappho which is about power of love it expresses speaker s desire for absent anactoria praising her beauty this encomium follows poet making broader point that most beautiful thing to any person is whatever they love most an argument that sappho supports with mythological example of helen s love for paris some commentators have argued that poem deliberately adopts this position as a rejection of typical greek male values poem follows a structure beginning with a preamble moving through to mythical exemplum of story of paris and helen and returning to subject of preamble for concluding stanza poem begins with a priamel a rhetorical structure where a list of alternatives are contrasted with a final different idea first stanza opens with a list of things which some people believe are most beautiful in world some say an army of horsemen others say foot soldiers still others say a fleet poet goes on to propose a more general rule that in fact superlative beauty is a property of whatever one loves this introductory stanza is followed by a mythological exemplum to demonstrate this idea that of helen of troy who abandoned her husband daughter and parents to be with man she loved this use of helen as a mythological exemplum might be seen as problematic after all helen is most beautiful mortal and yet sappho has her judging paris to be most beautiful harold explains this apparent paradox as an integral part of argument that sappho makes that most beautiful is one that one loves apparent contradiction between helen being most beautiful and helen finding paris most beautiful can be resolved if we agree with sappho s definition of beauty after setting out sappho s definition of what beauty is poem moves into a more personal section recalling narrator s beloved anactoria transition from mythological example of helen and paris to narrator s desire for anactoria is missing so it is not known what exactly reminded narrator of her george koniaris believes that this transition with apparently spontaneous introduction of anactoria makes sappho s praise for her seem fresh by contrast hutchinson sees it as emphasising deliberate artificiality of work helen of troy many commentators have suggested that sappho s use of helen as an example in this poem is intended as a rejection of masculine in favour of feminine values for instance john j winkler argues that poem sets sappho s definition of beauty against a masculine ideal of military power however g o hutchinson notes that though definition of beauty sappho attacks might seem a characteristically male one definition she replaces it with is generally applicable rather than being solely relevant to women page dubois has argued that sappho s portrayal of helen in this poem is a reversal of relationships between men and women in homeric poems where men act upon women helen in sappho s poem is according to dubois an actor who has her own agency and makes her own choices others disagree eric dodson robinson suggests that relationships portrayed by homer between men and women are more complex than dubois suggests and margaret williamson argues that sappho portrays helen not just as one who acts and who is celebrated for her action but also one who is acted upon as well as homer s helen poem has been seen as responding to or being responded to by alcaeus portrayal of helen in fragments 283 and 42 ruby blondell argues that sappho s portrayal of helen is much more concerned with her agency than alcaeus is while in alcaeus paris is deceiver of his host in sappho his role is more of a passive object of desire anactoria anactoria is probably same person as of miletus mentioned in suda as a pupil of sappho she is listed by maximus of tyre along with and as one who sappho loved as socrates loved alcibiades and phaedrus maximus of tyre orations 18 9 t 20 in poem anactoria is absent though it is not evident from surviving lines exactly why one suggestion is that she has left sappho in order to marry christopher brown argues that description of anactoria s radiant sparkle of her face sappho 16 18 is suggestive of grace charm of a nubile girl of marriageable age and that it is likely that anactoria has returned to her native city in order to marry eric dodson robinson suggests that poem could have been performed at a wedding with anactoria bride leaving her family and friends george koniaris disagrees arguing that there is no special reason to believe that anactoria left sappho for a man glen most goes further saying that there is no reason to believe that anactoria s absence was anything more than temporary continuation after line 20 scholars disagree on whether fragment 16 continued after line 20 or ended at this point before discovery of green collection papyri most scholars believed that poem ended at line 20 and when burris fish and obbink published green collection papyri they too ended poem there if poem did end at this point priamel around which poem is based is complete and poem would have had a ring structure however joel lidov argues that stanza which burris fish and obbink consider first of fragment 16a fits better as end of fragment 16 and also believe that lines 21 24 of p gc inv 105 are part of fragment 16 drawing comparisons with line 17 of fragment 31 and ending of tithonus poem two other cases where a poem by sappho ends with narrator reconciling herself to an impossible
