production development in 1989 walt disney feature animation florida had opened with 40 to 50 employees with its original purpose to produce cartoon shorts and featurettes however by late 1993 following several animation duties on beauty and beast aladdin and lion king disney executives were convinced to allow feature animation florida studios to produce their first independent film around that same time disney feature animation developed an interest into asian themed legends beginning with several books by children s book author robert d san souci who had a consulting relationship with disney executive jay dyer around that same time a short straight to video film titled china doll about an oppressed and miserable chinese girl who is whisked away by a british prince charming to happiness in west was in development thomas schumacher asked souci if he had any additional stories in which souci turned in a manuscript of a book based on chinese poem song of fa mu lan ultimately disney decided to combine two separate projects following opening of feature animation florida studios barry cook who had served as a special effects animator since 1982 had directed roger rabbit cartoon trail mix up produced at satellite studio upon a lunch invitation with thomas schumacher cook was offered two projects in development a scottish folk tale with a dragon or mulan knowledgeable about existence of dragons in chinese mythology cook suggested adding a dragon to mulan in which a week later schumacher urged cook to drop scottish project and accept mulan as his next project following this cook was immediately assigned as initial director of project and cited influences from charlie chaplin and david lean during production while working as an animator on gargoyles for hunchback of notre dame tony bancroft was offered to co direct film following a recommendation from rob minkoff co director of lion king to schumacher in which he accepted and joined creative team by early 1995 thumb crew toured various parts of china for inspiration in 1994 production team sent a select group of artistic supervisors to china for three weeks to take photographs and drawings of local landmarks for inspiration and to soak up local culture key members of creative team at time pam coats barry cook ric sluiter robert walker and mark henn were invited to travel to china as a research trip to study landscape people and history of original legend from june 17 to july 2 1994 research trip flew to beijing china which is where pam coats became inspired by placement of flags on great wall they also toured datong luoyang xi an dunhuang and guilin writing in its earliest stages story was originally conceived as a tootsie like romantic comedy film where mulan who was a misfit tomboy that loves her father is betrothed to shang whom she has not met on her betrothal day her father fa zhou carves her destiny on a stone tablet in family temple which she shatters in anger running away to forge her own destiny in november 1993 chris sanders who had just finished storyboard work on lion king was hoping to work on hunchback of notre dame until schumacher appointed him to work on mulan instead acting as head of story sanders grew frustrated with romantic comedy aspect of story and urged producer pam coats to be more faithful to original legend by having mulan leave home because of love for her father this convinced filmmakers to decide to change mulan s character in order to make her more appealing and selfless sequence six in which mulan takes her father s conscription order cuts her long hair and dons her father s armor served as a pivotal moment in evolution of mulan s character director barry cook explained that sequence initially started as a song storyboarded by barry johnson and redrawn by character designer chen yi chang following story changes to have mulan leave to save her father song was dropped storyboard artist and co head of story dean deblois was tasked to revise sequence and decided to board sequence with minimal dialogue assisted with an existing musical selection from another film score courtesy of sanders sequence reel was screened for peter schneider and thomas schumacher both of whom were impressed deblois stated sequence six was first sequence that got put into production and it helped to establish our silent approach additionally general li was not originally going to be related to shang at all but by changing story filmmakers were able to mirror stories of both shang s and mulan s love for their fathers as a christian bancroft declined to explore buddhism within film because there was no dragon in original legend mulan did not have animal companions it was roy e disney who suggested character of mushu veteran story artist joe grant created cricket character cri kee though animator barry temple admitted directors didn t want him in movie story department didn t want him in movie only people who truly wanted him in movie were michael eisner and joe grant and myself because i was assigned character i would sit in meetings and they d say well where s cricket during all this somebody else would say oh to hell cricket they felt cri kee was a character who wasn t necessary to tell story which is true throughout development on film grant would slip sketches of cri kee under directors door casting before production began production team sought out chinese japanese filipino or korean vocal talents tia carrere was an early candidate to voice title character and lea salonga who had been singing voice of princess jasmine in aladdin was also cast as mulan s speaking voice but directors did not find her attempt at a deeper speaking voice when mulan impersonated ping convincing so ming na wen was brought in to speak role salonga returned to provide singing voice wen herself landed role after filmmakers listened to her narration at beginning of joy luck club coats reflected on her decision stating when we heard ming na doing that voice over we knew we had our mulan she has a very likable and lovely voice and those are qualities we were looking for for role of mushu disney was aiming for top hollywood talent in vein of robin williams s performance as genie in aladdin and approached eddie murphy who at first balked when asked to record at disney studios he then asked to record voice in his basement at his bubble hill mansion in englewood new jersey for speaking voice of captain li shang bd wong was hired although his singing voice for song i ll make a man out of you was performed by donny osmond who had previously auditioned to be speaking voice of title character in hercules osmond s casting originated from a suggestion from casting director and throughout recording osmond studied wong s dialogue tapes and aimed to match his inflections and personality osmond commented that his sons decided that he had finally made it in show business when he was in a disney film likewise for role of grandmother fa june foray provided speaking voice and marni nixon supplied singing voice animation and design thumb animation crew was inspired by ancient chinese art for aesthetics of movie to achieve a harmonious visual look producer designer hans bacher and art director ric sluiter along with robert walker and head of backgrounds robert stanton collaborated to establish a proper chronological location for film in chinese history since there was no general consensus on time of mulan s existence they based on visual design on ming and qing dynasties an important element of bacher s design was to turn art style closer to chinese painting with watercolor and simpler design as opposed to details of lion king and hunchback of notre dame bacher further studied more than thirty five film directors ranging from silent era german expressionism british and american epics of 1950s and 60s and spaghetti westerns for inspiration for composition lighting and staging that would establish settings that enhanced characters additional inspiration was found in earlier disney animated films such as bambi pinocchio and dumbo to establish a sense of staging in october 1997 walt disney company announced a major expansion of its florida animation operations constructing a 200 000 square foot four story animation building and addition of 400 animators to workforce to create 2 000 hun soldiers during huns attack sequence production team developed crowd simulation software called attila this software allows thousands of unique characters to move autonomously a variant of program called dynasty was used in final battle sequence to create a crowd of 3 000 in forbidden city pixar s photorealistic open api renderman was used to render crowd another software developed for this movie was faux plane which was used to add depth to flat two dimensional painting although developed late in production progress faux plane was used in five shots including dramatic sequence which features great wall of china and final battle sequence when mulan runs to forbidden city during scene in which chinese are bowing to mulan crowd is a panoramic film of real people bowing it was edited into animated foreground of scene music in march 1994 stephen schwartz was attached to compose lyrics and music for songs for film following research trip to china in june 1994 schwartz was contacted by former disney studio chairman jeffrey katzenberg to compose songs for prince of egypt which he agreed peter schneider then president of walt disney feature animation threatened to have schwartz s name removed from any publicity materials for pocahontas and hunchback of notre dame michael eisner phoned schwartz and urged him to back out of his commitment to dreamworks but he refused and left project after schwartz s departure his three songs written in stone destiny and china doll were dropped amid story and character changes by 1995 shortly after disney music executive chris montan heard matthew wilder s demo for a stage musical adaptation of anne rice s cry to heaven and selected wilder to replace schwartz in july 1997 david zippel joined to write lyrics film featured five songs composed by wilder and zippel with a sixth originally planned for mushu but dropped following eddie murphy s involvement with character although danny elfman and thomas newman were considered to score film english composer rachel portman was selected as film composer however portman became pregnant during production and decided to back out following portman s departure randy edelman whose dragonheart theme was used in trailer and kitaro were considered until jerry goldsmith became available and signed on after dropping out of a project film s soundtrack is credited for starting career of pop singer christina aguilera whose first song to be released in u s was her rendition of reflection first single from mulan soundtrack song and aguilera s vocals were so well received that it landed her a recording contract with rca records in 1999 she would go on to release her self titled debut album on which reflection was also included pop version of reflection

album uses an orchestrated score while movie uses heavy synthesizer music synthesizer version is available on limited edition cd salonga who often sings movie music in her concerts has done a disney medley which climaxes with an expanded version of reflection not same as those in aguilera s version salonga also provided singing voice for mulan in film s sequel mulan ii release because of

keen to promote mulan to chinese hoping to replicate their success with 1994 film lion king which was one of country s highest grossing western films at that time disney also hoped it might smooth over relations with chinese government which had soured after release of kundun a disney funded biography of dalai lama that chinese government considered politically provocative china had threatened to curtail business negotiations with disney over that film and as government only accepted ten foreign films per year at that time to be shown in their country mulans chances of being accepted were low finally after a year s delay chinese government did allow film a limited chinese release but only after chinese new year so as to ensure that local films dominated more lucrative holiday market box office income was low due to both unfavorable release date and rampant piracy chinese people also complained about mulan s depiction as too foreign looking and story as too different from myths
