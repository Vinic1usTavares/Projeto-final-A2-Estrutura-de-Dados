d roosevelt 1933 question of whether lehand and roosevelt s relationship contained a sexual component was widely discussed among their contemporaries and continues to be debated by historians hazel rowley argues that there is no doubt that franklin s relationship with missy was romantic but notes possibility that relationship could not have been consummated due to fdr s disability roosevelt biographer doris kearns goodwin states that beneath complexity it is absolutely clear that franklin was love of missy s life and that he adored her and depended on her for affection and support as well as work doug wead wrote in his work on parents of presidents raising of a president some roosevelt historians insist that their relationship was never consummated eleanor and children accepted relationship which speaks for its innocence sara roosevelt spoke favorably of missy s family and upbringing years later only elliott of all children would declare that it had not been as benign as historians like to believe wead doug raising of a president mothers and fathers of our nation s leaders p 180 simon and schuster 2005 in 1973 fdr s son elliott published an untold story roosevelts of hyde park in which he recalled seeing lehand in his father s lap and alleged that she shared a familiar life in all its aspects with father his eldest brother jimmy disagreed arguing that fdr s illness had made sexual function too difficult for him to have a physical affair i suppose you could say they came to love one another he wrote but it was not a physical love kathryn smith author of only biography of lehand could come to no conclusion but wrote as far as evidence goes there is not a single written account of anyone seeing them in a compromising position despite hundreds of secret service agents staff members political cronies family members and friends who through fdr s bedrooms which he used as an auxiliary office during their twenty one years together she quotes lehand s great niece jane scarbrough who said we have no reason to believe they did have a sexual relationship but we don t know left thumb 200px despite lehand s close relationship with franklin she and his wife eleanor pictured remained on good terms eleanor and lehand remained on good terms eleanor roosevelt biographer blanche cook describes first lady as treating lehand warmly as an elder daughter or in manner of asian matriarchs as junior wife two women went shopping together and eleanor took a solicitous interest in lehand s smoking and general health eleanor also accompanied lehand to her mother s funeral in potsdam during first presidential campaign in 1932 helping family make arrangements elliott later stated that he believed missy alleviated mother s guilt allowing her to travel without worrying that franklin would lack for companionship in one of her later books eleanor wrote that she occasionally failed to meet need of someone whom i dearly love stating you must learn to allow someone else to meet need without bitterness or envy and accept it cook reads these passages as veiled references to lehand s role in franklin s life and eleanor s acceptance of that role other relationships lehand had a brief romance with eleanor s bodyguard and rumored love earl miller in 1931 miller later told biographer joseph lash that he had begun affair out of respect for eleanor feeling that she was hurt by lehand s relationship with franklin in 1933 lehand began to date diplomat william christian bullitt jr who became first u s ambassador to soviet union late that year fdr s son james later described this as one real romance of her life while some historians have stated that lehand broke off engagement after discovering bullitt was having an affair with a bolshoi ballet dancer or that he dumped her correspondence between two makes it clear lehand broke off relationship in september 1940 after bullitt returned to united states from nazi occupied france and began demanding more of her time length and depth of lehand s relationship with william c bullitt raises questions about fdr being true love of her life fdr aide and confidant harry hopkins a widower was close friends with missy especially after he moved into white house himself in 1940 goodwin states while pair were close enough to spark washington gossip nothing appears to have come of it missy had probably cut it short as she had cut short every other relationship in her life that might subordinate her great love for fdr smith does not cite hopkins as a serious contender for lehand s affections illness death and memorials in june 1941 lehand collapsed at a white house dinner party and two weeks later suffered a major stroke that left her partially paralyzed with little speech function goodwin says a factor that may have led to her illness was stress stemming from fears that exiled princess martha of sweden a washington area resident during world war ii had replaced her as fdr s favorite companion occupying seat next to him that had long been lehand s in automobile rides kathryn smith cites stress of world crisis that spring as britain stood alone against nazis and ill health of fdr who had expected her to be at his bedside for weeks on end she had also become critical of fdr s leadership for first time that spring sharing her disappointment with interior secretary harold l ickes a close friend fdr paid lehand s medical bills and later made provisions for her in his will stating that principal would be divided equally among his children while half income of his estate which was eventually probated at more than 3 million would go to eleanor and half to my friend marguerite a lehand for medical attention care and treatment during her lifetime as lehand died before fdr her half reverted to eleanor he also sent her to warm springs where he hoped she could recover with help of physical therapy staff there she was very unhappy in warm springs and may have tried to kill herself by eating chicken bones during 1941 christmas season in early 1942 she spent some weeks in her old room at white house but quickly deteriorated due to her frustrations at not being able to help after an incident in which she set bed on fire probably while smoking it was agreed that lehand would return to her sister s home in somerville massachusetts and she departed from washington

saw fdr again though he did keep in touch with letters phone calls and by sending gifts when lehand died on july 31 1944 president issued a statement memories of more than a score of years of devoted service enhance sense of personal loss which miss lehand s passing brings faithful and painstaking with charm of manner inspired by tact and kindness of heart she was utterly selfless in her devotion to duty hers was a quiet efficiency which made her a real genius in getting things done her memory will ever be held in affectionate remembrance and appreciation not only by all members of our family
