later became vice principal of darul mualimeen college and then principal of prestigious avesina high school and in 1957 left afghanistan for columbia university in new york city where he earned ma in

study group at university of wisconsin amin studied in doctoral programme at columbia university teachers college but started to neglect his studies in favour of politics in 1963 he became head of afghan students association at college when he returned to afghanistan in mid 1960s route flew to afghanistan by way of moscow there amin met afghan ambassador to soviet union his old friend ali ahmad a previous afghan minister of education during his short stay amin became even more radicalised some people nabi for instance do not believe he travelled through moscow but rather west germany and lebanon by time he had returned to afghanistan communist people s democratic party of afghanistan pdpa had already held its founding congress which was in 1965 amin ran as a candidate for pdpa in 1965 parliamentary election and lost by a margin of less than fifty votes in 1966 when pdpa central committee was expanded amin was elected as a non voting member and in spring of 1967 he gained full membership amin s standing in khalq faction of pdpa increased when he was only khalqist elected to parliament in 1969 parliamentary election when pdpa split along factional lines in 1967 between khalqists led by nur and parchamites led by babrak karmal amin joined khalqists as a member of parliament amin tried to win over support from pashtun people in armed forces according to a biography about amin he used his position as member of parliament to fight against imperialism feudalism and reactionary tendencies and fought against rotten regime monarchy amin himself said that he used his membership in parliament to pursue class struggle against bourgeoisie relations between khalqists and parchamites deteriorated during this period amin only khalq member of parliament and babrak karmal only parcham member of parliament did not cooperate with each other amin would later during his short stint in power mention these events with bitterness following arrest of fellow pdpa members dastagir panjsheri and saleh mohammad in 1969 amin became one of party s leading members and was still a pre eminent party member by time of their release in 1973 daoud era from 1973 until pdpa unification in 1977 amin was second only to taraki in khalqist pdpa when pdpa ruled afghanistan their relationship was referred to as a disciple amin following his mentor taraki this official portrayal of situation was misleading their relationship was more work oriented taraki needed amin s tactical and strategic talents amin s motivations are more uncertain but it is commonly believed that he associated with taraki to protect his own position amin had attracted many enemies during his career most notable being karmal according to official version of events taraki protected amin from party members or others who wanted to hurt pdpa and country when mohammed daoud khan ousted monarchy and established republic of afghanistan khalqist pdpa offered its support for new regime if it established a national front which presumably included khalqist pdpa itself parchamite pdpa had already established an alliance with daoud at beginning of his regime and karmal called for dissolution of khalqist pdpa karmal s call for dissolution only worsened relations between khalqist and parchamite pdpa however taraki and amin were lucky karmal s alliance actually hurt parchamites standing in afghan politics some communists in armed forces became disillusioned with government of daoud and turned to khalqist pdpa because of its apparent independence parchamite association with daoud government indirectly led to khalqist led pdpa coup of 1978 popularly referred to as saur revolution from 1973 until 1978 coup amin was responsible for organising party work in afghan armed forces according to official version amin met patriotic liaison officers day or night in desert or mountains in fields or forests enlightening them on basis of principles of working class ideology amin s success in recruiting military officers lay in fact that daoud betrayed left soon after taking power when amin began recruiting military officers for pdpa it was not difficult for him to find disgruntled military officers in meantime relations between parchamite and khalqist pdpa deteriorated in 1973 it was rumoured that major zia a parchamite and head of republican guard planned to assassinate entire khalqist leadership plan if true failed because khalqists found out about it assassination attempt proved to be a further blow to relations between parchamites and khalqists parchamites deny that they ever planned to assassinate khalqist leadership but historian beverley male argues that karmal s subsequent activities give credence to khalqist view of events because of parchamite assassination attempt amin pressed khalqist pdpa to seize power in 1976 by ousting daoud majority of pdpa leadership voted against such a move following year in 1977 parchamites and khalqists officially reconciled and pdpa was unified parchamite and khalqist which had separate general secretaries central committees and other organisational structures were officially unified in summer of 1977 one reason for unification was that international communist movement represented by communist party of india iraqi communist party and communist party of australia called for party unification saur revolution on 18 april 1978 mir akbar khyber chief ideologue of parcham faction was killed he was commonly believed to have been assassinated by daoud government khyber s assassination initiated a chain of events which led to pdpa taking power eleven days later on 27 april assassin was never caught but anahita ratebzad a parchamite believed that amin had ordered assassination khyber s funeral evolved into a large anti government demonstration daoud who did not understand significance of events began a mass arrest of pdpa members seven days after khyber s funeral amin who organised subsequent revolution against daoud was one of last central committee members to be arrested by authorities his late arrest can be considered as proof of regime s lack of information amin was leading revolutionary party organiser government s lack of awareness was proven by arrest of taraki taraki s arrest was pre arranged signal for revolution to commence when amin found out that taraki had been arrested he ordered revolution to begin at 9 am on 27 april amin in contrast to taraki was not imprisoned but instead put under house arrest his son abdur rahman was still allowed freedom of movement revolution was successful thanks to overwhelming support from afghan military for instance it was supported by defence minister ghulam haidar aslam watanjar commander of ground forces and chief of staff of afghan air force abdul qadir pdpa rule khalq parcham break after saur revolution taraki was appointed chairman of presidium of revolutionary council and chairman of council of ministers and retained his post as pdpa general secretary taraki initially formed a government which consisted of both khalqists and parchamites karmal became deputy chairman of revolutionary council while amin became minister of foreign affairs and a deputy prime minister and mohammad aslam watanjar became a deputy prime minister two parchamites abdul qadir and mohammad rafi became minister of national defence and minister of public works respectively according to angel rasanayagam appointment of amin karmal and watanjar as deputy prime ministers led to establishment of three cabinets khalqists were answerable to amin parchamites were answerable to karmal and military officers who were parchamites were answerable to watanjar first conflict between khalqists and parchamites arose when khalqists wanted to give pdpa central committee membership to military officers who participated in saur revolution amin who had previously opposed appointment of military officers to pdpa leadership switched sides he now supported their elevation pdpa politburo voted in favour of giving membership to military officers victors khalqists portrayed parchamites as opportunists implying that parchamites had ridden revolutionary wave but not actually participated in revolution to make matters worse for parchamites term parcham was according to taraki a word synonymous with factionalism on 27 june 1978 three months after revolution amin managed to outmaneuver parchamites at a central committee meeting meeting decided that khalqists had exclusive rights to formulate and decide policy a policy which left parchamites impotent karmal was exiled but was able to establish a network with remaining parchamites in government a coup to overthrow amin was planned for september its leading members in afghanistan were qadir defence minister and army chief of staff general shahpur coup was planned for 4 september on festival of eid because soldiers and officers would be off duty conspiracy failed when afghan ambassador to india told afghan leadership about plan a purge was initiated and parchamite ambassadors were recalled few returned for example karmal and mohammad najibullah both stayed in their assigned countries amin taraki break afghan people revolted against pdpa government when government introduced several socialist reforms including land reforms by early 1979 twenty five out of afghanistan s twenty eight provinces were unsafe because of armed resistance against government on 29 march 1979 herat uprising began uprising turned revolt into an open war between mujahideen and afghan government it was during this period that amin became kabul s strongman shortly after herat uprising had been crushed revolutionary council convened to ratify new five year plan afghan soviet friendship treaty and to vote on whether or not to reorganise cabinet and to enhance power of executive chairman of revolutionary council while official version of events said that all issues were voted on democratically at meeting revolutionary council held another meeting following day to ratify new five year plan and to discuss reorganisation of cabinet alexander puzanov soviet ambassador to afghanistan was able to persuade aslam watanjar sayed mohammad gulabzoy and sherjan mazdoryar to become part of a conspiracy against amin these three men put pressure on taraki who by this time believed that he really was great leader to sack amin from office it is unknown if amin knew anything about conspiracy against him but it was after cabinet reorganisation that he talked about his dissatisfaction on 26 march pdpa politburo and council of ministers approved extension of powers of executive branch and establishment of homeland higher defence council hhdc to handle security matters many analysts of day regarded amin s appointment as prime minister as an increase in his powers at expense of taraki however reorganisation of cabinet and strengthening of taraki s position as chairman of revolutionary council had reduced authority of prime minister prime minister was due to strengthening of executive now appointed by chairman of revolutionary council while amin could appoint and dismiss new ministers he needed taraki s consent to actually do so another problem for amin was that while council of ministers was responsible to revolutionary council and its chairman individual ministers were only responsible to taraki when amin became prime minister he was responsible for planning finance and budgetary matters conduct of foreign policy and for order and security order and security responsibilities had been taken over by hhdc which was chaired by taraki while amin was hhdc deputy chairman majority of hhdc members were members of anti amin faction for instance hhdc membership included watanjar minister of national defence interior minister mazdoryar president of political affairs of armed forces mohammad iqbal mohammad yaqub chief of general staff commander of afghan air force nazar mohammad and assadullah sarwari head of asga afghan secret police amin cabinet 1979 officeincumbenttook officeleft

had been institutionalised whereby taraki was responsible for defence and amin responsible for assisting taraki in defence related matters amin s position was given a further blow by democratisation of decision making process which allowed its members to contribute most of them were against amin another problem for amin was that office of hhdc deputy chairman had no specific functions or powers and appointment of a new defence minister who opposed him drastically weakened his control over ministry of national defence reorganisation of ministers was a further blow to amin s position he had lost control of defence ministry interior ministry and asga amin still had allies at top many of them in strategically important positions for instance yaqub was his brother in law and security chief in ministry of interior was sayed daoud taroon who was also later appointed to hhdc as an ordinary member in april amin succeeded in appointing two more of his allies to important positions mohammad as minister of planning and mohammad as minister of information and culture and faqir mohammad faqir was appointed deputy prime minister in april 1978 amin s political position was not secure when alexei yepishev head of main political directorate of soviet army and navy visited kabul yepishev met personally with taraki on 7 april but never met with amin soviets were becoming increasingly worried about amin s control over afghan military even so during yepishev s visit amin s position was actually strengthened taroon was appointed taraki s aide de camp soon after at two cabinet meetings strengthening of executive powers of chairman of revolutionary council was proven even though amin was prime minister taraki chaired meetings instead of him amin s presence at these two meetings was not mentioned at all and it was made clear that taraki through his office as chairman of revolutionary council also chaired council of ministers another problem facing amin was taraki s policy of autocracy he tried to deprive pdpa politburo of its powers as a party and state decision making organ situation deteriorated when amin personally warned taraki that prestige and popularity of leaders among people has no common aspect with a personality cult factionalism within pdpa made it ill prepared to handle intensified counter revolutionary activities in country amin tried to win support for communist government by depicting himself as a devout muslim taraki and amin blamed different countries for helping counter revolutionaries amin attacked united kingdom and british broadcasting corporation bbc and played down american and chinese involvement while taraki blamed american imperialism and iran and pakistan for supporting uprising amin s criticism of united kingdom and bbc fed on traditional anti british sentiments held by rural afghans in contrast to taraki amin bent over backwards to avoid making hostile reference to china united states or other foreign governments amin s cautious behavior was in deep contrast to soviet union s official stance on situation it seemed according to beverley male that soviet leadership tried to force a confrontation between afghanistan and its enemies amin also tried to appease shia communities by meeting with their leaders despite this a section of shia leadership called for continuation of resistance subsequently a revolt broke out in a shia populated district in kabul this was first sign of unrest in kabul since saur revolution to add to government s problems taraki s ability to lead country was questioned he was a heavy drinker and was not in good health amin on other hand was characterised in this period by portrayals of strong self discipline in summer of 1979 amin began to disassociate himself from taraki on 27 june amin became a member of pdpa politburo leading decision making body in afghanistan rise to power in mid july soviets made their view official when pravda wrote an article about situation in afghanistan soviets did not wish to see amin become leader of afghanistan this triggered a political crisis in afghanistan as amin initiated a policy of extreme repression which became one of main reasons for soviet intervention later that year on 28 july a vote in pdpa politburo approved amin s proposal of creating a collective leadership with collective decision making this was a blow to taraki and many of his supporters were replaced by pro amin pdpa members ivan pavlovsky commander of soviet ground forces visited kabul in mid august to study situation in afghanistan amin in a speech just a few days after pavlovsky s arrival said that he wanted closer relations between afghanistan and people s republic of china in same speech he hinted that he had reservations about soviet meddling in afghanistan he likened soviet assistance to afghanistan with vladimir lenin s assistance to hungarian soviet republic in 1919 taraki a delegate to conference held by non aligned movement in havana met personally with andrei gromyko soviet minister of foreign affairs to discuss afghanistan situation on 9 september shah wali minister of foreign affairs who was a supporter of amin did not participate in meeting this according to beverley male suggested that some plot against amin was in preparation taraki was instructed to stop over in moscow where soviet leaders urged him to remove amin from power as per kgb s decision because amin posed danger amin s trusted aid daoud taroon informed amin of meeting and kgb s plan in kabul taraki s aides gang of four consisting of watanjar mazdoryar and sarwari planned a plot to assassinate amin but it failed as amin was informed of this within hours of taraki s return to kabul on 11 september taraki convened cabinet ostensibly to report on havana summit instead of reporting on summit taraki tried to dismiss amin as prime minister amin aware of murder plot demanded gang of four to be removed from their posts but taraki laughed it off afghanistan a modern history by angelo rasanayagam taraki sought to neutralise amin s power and influence by requesting that he serve overseas as an ambassador amin turned down proposal shouting you are one who should quit because of drink and old age you have taken leave of your senses on 13 september taraki invited amin to presidential palace for lunch with him and gang of four amin turned down offer stating he would prefer their resignation rather than lunching with them soviet ambassador puzanov persuaded amin to make visit to presidential palace along with taroon chief of police and nawab ali an intelligence officer inside palace on 14 september bodyguards within building opened fire on visitors taroon was killed but amin only sustained an injury and escaped amin drove to ministry of defence building put army on high alert and ordered taraki s arrest at 6 30 pm tanks from 4th armoured corps entered city and stood at government buildings shortly afterwards amin returned to palace with a contingent of army officers and placed taraki under arrest gang of four however had disappeared and sought refuge in soviet embassy after taraki s arrest soviets tried to rescue taraki or according to other sources kidnap amin via embassy or bagram air base but strength of amin s officers repelled their decision to make a move amin was told by soviets not to punish taraki and strip him and his comrades of their positions but amin ignored them amin reportedly discussed incident with leonid brezhnev and indirectly asked for permission to kill taraki to which brezhnev replied that it was his choice amin who now believed he had full support of soviets ordered death of taraki it is believed taraki was suffocated with pillows on 8 october 1979 afghan media would report that ailing taraki had died omitting any mention of his murder taraki s murder shocked and upset brezhnev humanitarian invasion global development in cold war afghanistan by timothy presidency domestic policies following taraki s fall from power amin was elected chairman of of revolutionary council and general secretary of pdpa central committee by pdpa politburo election of amin as pdpa general secretary and removal of taraki from all party posts was unanimous only members of cabinet replaced when amin took power were gang of four beverley male saw this as a clear indication that he had their ministers support amin s rise to power was followed by a policy of moderation and attempts to persuade afghan people that regime was not anti islamic amin s government began to invest in reconstruction or reparation of mosques he also promised afghan people freedom of religion religious groups were given copies of quran and amin began to refer to allah in speeches he even claimed that saur revolution was totally based on principles of islam campaign proved to be unsuccessful and many afghans held amin responsible for regime s totalitarian behavior amin s rise to power was officially endorsed by ulama on 20 september 1979 their endorsement led to official announcement that amin was a pious muslim amin thus scored a point against counter revolutionary propaganda which claimed communist regime was atheist amin also tried to increase his popularity with tribal groups a feat taraki had been unable or unwilling to achieve in a speech to tribal elders amin was defensive about western way he dressed an official biography was published which depicted amin in traditional pashtun clothes during his short stay in power amin became committed to establishing a collective leadership when taraki was ousted amin promised from now on there will be no one man government attempting to pacify population amin released a list of 18 000 people who had been executed and blamed executions on taraki total number of arrested during taraki s and amin s combined reign number between 17 000 and 45 000 amin was not liked by afghan people during his rule opposition to communist regime increased and government lost control of countryside state of afghan military deteriorated due to desertions number of military personnel in afghan army decreased from 100 000 in immediate aftermath of saur revolution to somewhere between 50 000 and 70 000 another problem amin faced was kgb s penetration of pdpa military and government bureaucracy while amin s position in afghanistan was becoming more perilous by day his enemies who were exiled in soviet union and eastern bloc were agitating for his removal babrak karmal parchamite leader met several leading eastern bloc figures during this period and mohammad aslam watanjar sayed mohammad gulabzoy and assadullah sarwari wanted to exact revenge upon amin foreign policy when amin became leader he tried to reduce afghanistan s dependence on soviet union to accomplish this he aimed to balance afghanistan s relations with soviet union by strengthening relations with pakistan and iran soviets were concerned when they received reports that amin had met personally with gulbuddin hekmatyar one of leading anti communists in afghanistan his general untrustworthiness and his unpopularity amongst afghans made it more difficult for amin to find new foreign patrons amin s involvement in death of adolph dubs american ambassador to afghanistan strained his relations with united states he tried to improve relations by reestablishing contact met with three different american charge d affaires and was interviewed by an american correspondent but this did not improve afghanistan s standing in eyes of united states government after third meeting with amin j bruce american ambassador to afghanistan from 1979 to 1980 believed wisest thing to do was to maintain a low profile trying to avoid issues and waiting to see what happens in early december 1979 ministry of foreign affairs proposed a joint summit meeting between amin and muhammad zia ul haq president of pakistan pakistani government accepting a modified version of offer agreed to send agha shahi pakistani foreign minister to kabul for talks in meanwhile inter services intelligence isi pakistani s secret police continued to train mujahideen fighters who opposed communist regime afghan soviet relations contrary to popular belief soviet leadership headed by leonid brezhnev alexei kosygin and politburo were not eager to send troops to afghanistan soviet politburo decisions were guided by a special commission on afghanistan which consisted of yuri andropov kgb chairman andrei gromyko minister of foreign affairs defence minister dmitriy ustinov and boris ponomarev head of international department of central committee politburo was opposed to removal of taraki and his subsequent murder according to brezhnev general secretary of central committee of communist party of soviet union events developed so swiftly in afghanistan that essentially there was little opportunity to somehow interfere in them right now our mission is to determine our further actions so as to preserve our position in afghanistan and to secure our influence there although afghan soviet relations deteriorated during amin s short stint in power he was invited on an official visit to moscow by alexander puzanov soviet ambassador to afghanistan because of soviet leadership s satisfaction with his party and state building policy not everything went as planned and andropov talked about undesirable turn of events taking place in afghanistan under amin s rule andropov also brought up ongoing political shift in afghanistan under amin soviets were afraid that amin would move afghanistan s foreign policy from a pro soviet position to a pro united states position by early to mid december 1979 soviet leadership had established an alliance with babrak karmal and assadullah sarwari amin kept a portrait of joseph stalin on his desk when soviet officials criticized him of his brutality amin replied comrade stalin showed us how to build socialism in a backward country as it turned out relationship between puzanov and amin broke down amin started a smear campaign to discredit puzanov this in turn led to an assassination attempt against amin in which puzanov participated situation was worsened by kgb accusing amin of misrepresenting soviet position on afghanistan in pdpa central committee and revolutionary council kgb also noted an increase in anti soviet agitation by government during amin s rule and harassment against soviet citizens increased under amin a group of senior politicians reported to soviet central committee that it was necessary to do everything possible to prevent a change in political orientation in afghanistan however soviet leadership did not advocate intervention at this time and instead called for increasing its influence in amin leadership to expose his true intentions a soviet politburo assessment referred to amin as a power hungry leader who is distinguished by brutality and treachery amongst many sins they alleged were his insincerity and duplicity when dealing with soviet union creating fictitious accusations against pdpa members who opposed him indulging in a policy of nepotism and his tendency to conduct a more balanced policy towards first world countries according to former senior soviet diplomat oleg kgb was becoming increasingly convinced that amin couldn t be counted on to effectively deal with insurgency and preserve survival of afghan marxist state by end of october special commission on afghanistan which consisted of andropov gromyko ustinov and ponomarev wanted to end impression that soviet government supported amin s leadership and policy kgb s first chief directorate was put under orders that something had to be done about afghanistan and several of its personnel were assembled to deal with task andropov fought hard for soviet intervention saying to brezhnev that amin s policies had destroyed military and government s capabilities to handle crisis by use of mass repression plan according to andropov was to assemble a small force to intervene and remove amin from power and replace him with karmal soviet union declared its plan to intervene in afghanistan on 12 december 1979 and soviet leadership initiated operation storm 333 first phase of intervention on 27 december 1979 attempted poisoning by amin s chef leadership of ussr had no need for amin to remain alive andropov s special in afghanistan general boris ivanov recommended for amin to attend a conciliatory dinner with his political mentor who had become an enemy of amin so that amin s chef could poison amin same persons arranged for this dinner as had participated in previous failed attempted assassination by taraki on 14 september however amin miraculously survived poisoning because doctors at soviet embassy who did not know that special reconnaissance officers were trying to kill amin mistakenly saved severely poisoned amin since amin who was very loyal to ussr had survived two attempted assassinations that had been approved by ussr decision was made to eliminate him through a bloody coup at amin s residence taj beck palace death thumb 200px tajbeg palace on 27 december 1979 where amin was killed amin trusted soviet union until very end despite deterioration of official relations and was unaware that tide in moscow had turned against him since he ordered taraki s death when afghan intelligence service handed amin a report that soviet union would invade country and topple him amin claimed that report was a product of imperialism his view can be explained by fact that soviet union after several months finally gave in to amin s demands and sent troops into afghanistan to secure pdpa government contrary to common western belief amin was informed of soviet decision to send troops into afghanistan general commander of 40th army met with afghan major general to talk about soviet troop movements before soviet army s intervention on 25 december dmitry ustinov issued a formal order stating that t he state frontier of democratic republic of afghanistan is to be crossed on ground and in air by forces of 40th army and air force at 1500 hrs on 25 december this was formal beginning of soviet intervention in afghanistan concerned for his safety on 20 december amin moved from presidential palace located in centre of kabul to tajbeg palace which had previously been headquarters of central army corps of afghan military palace was formidable with walls strong enough to withstand artillery fire according to rodric braithwaite its defences had been carefully and intelligently organised all roads to palace had been mined with exception of one which had heavy machine guns and artillery positioned to defend it to make matters worse for soviets afghans had established a second line of defence which consisted of seven posts each manned by four sentries armed with a machine gun a mortar and automatic rifles external defences of palace were handled by presidential guard which consisted of 2 500 troops and three t 54 tanks several soviet commanders involved in assassination of amin thought plan to attack palace was crazy although military had been informed by soviet leadership through their commanders yuri and vasily kolesnik that president was a cia agent who had betrayed saur revolution many soviet soldiers hesitated despite what their commanders had told them it seemed implausible that amin leader of pdpa government was an american double agent despite several objections plan to assassinate amin went ahead before resorting to killing amin by brute force soviets had tried to poison him as early as 13 december but nearly killed his nephew instead and to kill him with a sniper shot on his way to work this proved impossible as afghans had improved their security measures they even tried to poison amin just hours before assault on presidential palace on 27 december amin had organised a lunch for party members to show guests his palace and to celebrate ghulam dastagir panjsheri s return from moscow panjsheri s return improved mood even further he boasted that soviet divisions had already crossed border and that he and gromyko always kept in contact with each other during meal amin and several of his guests lost consciousness as they had been poisoned luckily for amin but unfortunately for soviets he survived his encounter with death because carbonation of coca cola he was drinking diluted toxic agent mikhail a kgb agent was given responsibility for poisonings assault on palace began shortly afterward during attack amin still believed soviet union was on his side and told his adjutant soviets will help us adjutant replied that it was soviets who were attacking them amin initially replied that this was a lie only after he tried but failed to contact chief of general staff he muttered i guessed it it s all true there are various accounts of how amin died but exact details have never been confirmed amin was either killed by a deliberate attack or died by a random burst of fire amin s son was fatally wounded and died shortly after his daughter was wounded but survived it was gulabzoy who had been given orders to kill amin and watanjar who later confirmed his death men of amin s family were all executed while women including his daughter were imprisoned at pul e charkhi prison until being released by president najibullah in early 1992 afgantsy russians in afghanistan 1979 89 by rodric braithwaite after amin s death on 27 december 1979 radio kabul

criminal and recognised spy of u s as reported in kabul new times anahita ratebzad education minister said about amin this cruel and criminal murderer who had made terror and suppression and crushing
