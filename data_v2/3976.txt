domestic sheep ovis aries are quadrupedal ruminant mammals typically kept as livestock like most ruminants sheep are members of order artiodactyla even toed ungulates although name sheep applies to many species in genus ovis in everyday usage it almost always refers to ovis aries numbering a little over one billion domestic sheep are also most numerous species of sheep an adult female sheep is referred to as a ewe an intact male as a ram or occasionally a tup a castrated male as a wether and a younger sheep as a lamb sheep are most likely descended from wild mouflon of europe and asia one of earliest animals to be domesticated for agricultural purposes sheep are raised for fleeces meat lamb or mutton and milk a sheep s wool is most widely used animal fiber and is usually harvested by shearing ovine meat is called lamb when from younger animals and mutton when from older ones in commonwealth countries and lamb in united states including from adults sheep continue to be important for wool and meat today and are also occasionally raised for pelts as dairy animals or as model organisms for science sheep husbandry is practised throughout majority of inhabited world and has been fundamental to many civilizations in modern era australia new zealand southern and central south american nations and british isles are most closely associated with sheep production has a large lexicon of unique terms which vary considerably by region and dialect use of word sheep began in middle english as a derivation of old english word it is both singular and plural name for animal a group of sheep is called a flock herd or mob many other specific terms for various life stages of sheep exist generally related to lambing shearing and age being a key animal in history of farming sheep have a deeply entrenched place in human culture and find representation in much modern language and symbology as livestock sheep are most often associated with pastoral arcadian imagery sheep figure in many mythologies such as golden fleece and major religions especially abrahamic traditions in both ancient and modern religious ritual sheep are used as sacrificial animals history exact line of descent between domestic sheep and their wild ancestors is unclear most common hypothesis states that ovis aries is descended from asiatic o orientalis species of mouflon sheep were among first animals to be domesticated by humankind although domestication of dogs may have taken place more than 20 000 years earlier domestication date is estimated to fall between 11 000 and 9 000 b c in mesopotamia ekarius rearing of sheep for secondary products and resulting breed development began in either southwest asia or western europe initially sheep were kept solely for meat milk and skins archaeological evidence from statuary found at sites in iran suggests that selection for woolly sheep may have begun around 6000 bc and earliest woven wool garments have been dated to two to three thousand years later smith et al sheep husbandry spread quickly in europe excavations show that in about 6000 bc during neolithic period of prehistory people living around chateauneuf les martigues

said to name individual animals ancient romans kept sheep on a wide scale and were an important agent in spread of sheep raising pliny elder in his natural history naturalis historia speaks at length about sheep and wool european colonists spread practice to new world from 1493 onwards characteristics domestic sheep are relatively small ruminants usually with a crimped hair called wool and often with horns forming a lateral spiral domestic sheep differ from their wild relatives and ancestors in several respects having become uniquely neotenic as a result of selective breeding by humans budiansky pp 97 98 pp 100 01 a few primitive breeds of sheep retain some of characteristics of their wild cousins such as short tails depending on breed domestic sheep may have no horns at all i e polled or horns in both sexes or in males only most horned breeds have a single pair but a few breeds may have several another trait unique to domestic sheep as compared to wild ovines is their wide variation in color wild sheep are largely variations of brown hues and variation within species is extremely limited colors of domestic sheep range from pure white to dark chocolate brown and even spotted or piebald selection for easily white fleeces began early in sheep domestication and as white wool is a dominant trait it spread quickly however colored sheep do appear in many modern breeds and may even appear as a recessive trait in white flocks while white wool is desirable for large commercial markets there is a niche market for colored fleeces mostly for nature of fleece varies widely among breeds from dense and highly crimped to long and hairlike there is variation of wool type and quality even among members of same flock so wool classing is a step in commercial processing of fibre thumb left are a medium wool black faced breed of meat sheep that make up 60 of sheep population in u s depending on breed sheep show a range of heights and weights their rate of growth and mature weight is a heritable trait that is often selected for in breeding ewes typically weigh between and rams between when all deciduous teeth have erupted sheep has 20 teeth r d and t l spurgeon 1992 anatomy and physiology of farm animals 5th ed lippincott williams and wilkins mature sheep have 32 teeth as with other ruminants front teeth in lower jaw bite against a hard toothless pad in upper jaw these are used to pick off vegetation then rear teeth grind it before it is swallowed there are eight lower front teeth in ruminants but there is some disagreement as to whether these are eight incisors or six incisors and two incisor shaped canines this means that dental formula for sheep is either or there is a large diastema between incisors and molars in first few years of life one can calculate age of sheep from their front teeth as a pair of milk teeth is replaced by larger adult teeth each year full set of eight adult front teeth being complete at about four years of age front teeth are then gradually lost as sheep age making it harder for them to feed and hindering health and productivity of animal for this reason domestic sheep on normal pasture begin to slowly decline from four years on and life expectancy of a sheep is 10 to 12 years though some sheep may live as long as 20 years thumb have good hearing and are sensitive to noise when being handled smith et al p 5 sheep have horizontal slit shaped pupils with excellent peripheral vision with visual fields of about 270deg to sheep can see behind themselves without turning their heads many breeds have only short hair on face and some have facial wool if any confined to poll and or area of mandibular angle wide angles of peripheral vision apply to these breeds a few breeds tend to have considerable wool on face for some individuals of these breeds peripheral vision may be greatly reduced by wool blindness unless recently shorn about face sheep have poor depth perception shadows and dips in ground may cause sheep to baulk in general sheep have a tendency to move out of dark and into well lit areas and prefer to move uphill when disturbed sheep also have an excellent sense of smell and like all species of their genus have scent glands just in front of eyes and on feet purpose of these glands is uncertain but those on face may be used in breeding behaviors foot glands might also be related to reproduction but alternative reasons such as secretion of a waste product or a scent marker to help lost sheep find their flock have also been proposed smith et al p 4 comparison with goats sheep and goats are closely related both are in subfamily caprinae however they are separate species so hybrids rarely occur and are always infertile a hybrid of a ewe and a buck a male goat is called a sheep goat hybrid only a single such animal has been confirmed and is not to be confused with sheep goat chimera though both are known as geep visual differences between sheep and goats include beard of goats and divided upper lip of sheep sheep tails also hang down even when short or docked while short tails of goats are held upwards also sheep breeds are often naturally polled either in both sexes or just in female while naturally polled goats are rare though many are polled artificially males of two species differ in that buck goats acquire a unique and strong odor during rut whereas rams do not breeds thumb sheep being judged for adherence to their breed standard and being held by most common method of restraint domestic sheep is a multi purpose animal and more than 200 breeds now in existence were created to serve these diverse purposes some sources give a count of a thousand or more breeds but these numbers cannot be verified according to some sources however

definition of a breed is either a subspecific group of domestic livestock with definable and identifiable external characteristics that enable it to be separated by visual appraisal from other similarly defined groups within same species or a group for which geographical and or cultural separation from phenotypically similar groups has led to acceptance of its separate identity almost all sheep are classified as being best suited to furnishing a certain product wool meat milk hides or a combination in a dual purpose breed other features used when classifying sheep include face color generally white or black tail length presence or lack of horns and topography for which breed has been developed this last point is especially stressed in uk where breeds are described as either upland hill or mountain or lowland breeds a sheep may also be of a fat tailed type which is a dual purpose sheep common in africa and asia with larger deposits of fat within and around its tail thumb left upright barbados is a hair sheep breed of caribbean origin breeds are often categorized by type of their wool fine wool breeds are those that have wool of great crimp and density which are

other sheep types for example american columbia breed was developed by crossing lincoln rams a long wool breed with fine wooled rambouillet ewes coarse or carpet wool sheep are those with a medium to long length wool of characteristic coarseness breeds traditionally used for carpet wool show great variability but chief requirement is a wool that will not break down under heavy use as would that of finer breeds as demand for carpet quality wool declines some breeders of this type of sheep are attempting to use a few of these traditional breeds for alternative purposes others have always been primarily meat class sheep wooster a minor class of sheep are dairy breeds dual purpose breeds that may primarily be meat or wool sheep are often used secondarily as milking animals but there are a

wool at all hair sheep are similar to early domesticated sheep kept before woolly breeds were developed and are raised for meat and pelts some modern breeds of hair sheep such as result from crosses between wool and hair breeds for meat and hide producers hair sheep are cheaper to keep as they do not need shearing hair sheep are also more resistant to parasites and hot weather with modern rise of corporate agribusiness and decline of localized family farms many breeds of sheep are in danger of extinction rare breeds survival trust of uk lists 22 native breeds as having only 3 000 registered animals each and livestock conservancy lists 14 as either critical or threatened preferences for breeds with uniform characteristics and fast growth have pushed heritage or heirloom breeds to margins of sheep industry those that remain are maintained through efforts of conservation organizations breed registries and individual farmers dedicated to their preservation diet sheep are herbivorous mammals most breeds prefer to graze on grass and other short roughage avoiding taller woody parts of plants that goats readily consume pugh pp 19 both sheep and goats use their lips and tongues to select parts of plant that are easier to digest or higher in nutrition sheep however graze well in monoculture pastures where most goats fare poorly thumb ruminant system of a sheep like all ruminants sheep have a complex digestive system composed of four chambers allowing them to break down cellulose from stems leaves and seed hulls into simpler carbohydrates when sheep graze vegetation is chewed into a mass called a bolus which is then passed into rumen via reticulum rumen is a 19 to 38 liter 5 to 10 gallon organ in which feed is fermented simmons ekarius p 146 fermenting organisms include bacteria fungi and protozoa van p j 1994 nutritional ecology of ruminant 2nd ed cornell univ press 476 pp other important rumen organisms include some archaea which produce methane from carbon dioxide bolus is periodically regurgitated back to mouth as cud for additional chewing and salivation after fermentation in rumen feed passes into reticulum and omasum special feeds such as grains may bypass rumen altogether after first three chambers food moves into abomasum for final digestion before processing by intestines abomasum is only one of four chambers analogous to human stomach and is sometimes called true stomach simmons ekarius p 171 other than forage other staple feed for sheep is hay often during winter months ability to thrive solely on pasture even without hay varies with breed but all sheep can survive on this diet also included in some sheep s diets are minerals either in a trace mix or in licks feed provided to sheep must be specially formulated as most cattle poultry pig and even some goat feeds contain levels of copper that are lethal to sheep same danger applies to mineral supplements such as salt licks simmons ekarius p 159 grazing behavior sheep follow a diurnal pattern of activity feeding from dawn to dusk stopping sporadically to rest and chew their cud ideal pasture for sheep is not grass but an array of grasses legumes and forbs simmons ekarius p 82 types of land where sheep are raised vary widely from pastures that are seeded and improved intentionally to rough native lands common plants toxic to sheep are present in most of world and include but are not limited to cherry some oaks and acorns tomato yew rhubarb potato and rhododendron simmons ekarius p 160 thumb right sheep grazing on public land utah 2009 effects on pasture sheep are largely grazing herbivores unlike browsing animals such as goats and deer that prefer taller foliage with a much narrower face sheep crop plants very close to ground and can a pasture much faster than cattle for this reason many shepherds use managed intensive rotational grazing where a flock is rotated through multiple pastures giving plants time to recover paradoxically sheep can both cause and solve spread of invasive plant species by disturbing natural state of pasture sheep and other livestock can pave way for invasive plants however sheep also prefer to eat invasives such as cheatgrass leafy spurge kudzu and spotted knapweed over native species such as sagebrush making grazing sheep effective for conservation grazing simmons ekarius p 143 research conducted in imperial county california compared lamb grazing with herbicides for weed control in seedling alfalfa fields three trials demonstrated that grazing lambs were just as effective as herbicides in controlling winter weeds entomologists also compared grazing lambs to insecticides for insect control in winter alfalfa in this trial lambs provided insect control as effectively as insecticides behavior thumb sheep showing flocking behavior during a sheepdog trial thumb flock of sheep in south africa 2015 flock behavior sheep are flock animals and strongly gregarious much sheep behavior can be understood on basis of these tendencies dominance hierarchy of sheep and their natural inclination to follow a leader to new pastures were pivotal factors in sheep being one of first domesticated livestock species budiansky furthermore in contrast to red deer and gazelle two other ungulates of primary importance to meat production in prehistoric times sheep do not defend territories although they do form home ranges clutton brock j 1987 a natural history of domesticated mammals cambridge university press cambridge pp 55 all sheep have a tendency to congregate close to other members of a flock although this behavior varies with breed and sheep can become stressed when separated from their flock members during flocking sheep have a strong tendency to follow and a leader may simply be first individual to move relationships in flocks tend to be closest among related sheep in mixed breed flocks subgroups of same breed tend to form and a ewe and her direct descendants often move as a unit within large flocks sheep can become hefted to one particular local pasture heft so they do not roam freely in unfenced landscapes lambs learn heft from ewes and if whole flocks are culled it must be to replacement animals flock behaviour in sheep is generally only exhibited in groups of four or more sheep fewer sheep may not react as expected when alone or with few other sheep being a prey species primary defense mechanism of sheep is to flee from danger when their flight zone is entered cornered sheep may charge and butt or threaten by hoof stamping and adopting an aggressive posture this is particularly true for ewes with newborn lambs in regions where sheep have no natural predators none of native breeds of sheep exhibit a strong flocking behavior herding thumb right escaped sheep being led back to pasture with enticement of food this method of moving sheep works best with smaller flocks farmers exploit flocking behavior to keep sheep together on unfenced pastures such as hill farming and to move them more easily for this purpose shepherds may use herding dogs in this effort with a highly bred herding ability sheep are food oriented and association of humans with regular feeding often results in sheep soliciting people for food p 100 et al those who are moving sheep may exploit this behavior by leading sheep with buckets of feed budiansky p 10 wooster pp 73 75 dominance hierarchy sheep establish a dominance hierarchy through fighting threats and competitiveness dominant animals are inclined to be more aggressive with other sheep and usually feed first at troughs simmons ekarius p 8 primarily among rams horn size is a factor in flock hierarchy budiansky p 78 rams with different size horns may be less inclined to fight to establish dominance order while rams with similarly sized horns are more so merinos have an almost linear hierarchy whereas there is a less rigid structure in border leicesters when a competitive feeding situation arises in sheep position in a moving flock is highly correlated with social dominance but there is no definitive study to show consistent voluntary leadership by an individual sheep intelligence and learning ability sheep are frequently thought of as unintelligent animals smith et al p 3 their flocking behavior and quickness to flee and panic can make shepherding a difficult endeavor for uninitiated despite these perceptions a university of illinois monograph on sheep reported their intelligence to be just below that of pigs and on par with that of cattle sheep can recognize individual human and ovine faces and remember them for years in addition to long term facial recognition of individuals sheep can also differentiate emotional states through facial characteristics if worked with patiently sheep may learn their names and many sheep are trained to be led by halter for showing and other purposes sheep have also responded well to clicker training sheep have been used as pack animals tibetan nomads
