fight in cuban war of independence and ensuing spanish american war of 1898 in which u s seized control of cuba in 1902 republic of cuba was proclaimed however it remained economically and politically

province angel took a wife in 1911 maria luisa reyes with whom he had five children before separating he then began a relationship with lina ruz gonzalez 1903 1963 a household servant of canarian descent who was twenty seven years his junior she bore him three sons and four daughters legally marrying in 1943 castro was lina s third child born out of wedlock at angel s farm on august 13 1926 because of stigma of illegitimacy he was given his mother s surname of ruz rather than his father s name although angel s business ventures prospered he ensured that fidel grew up alongside children of farm s workforce many of whom were haitian economic migrants of african descent this experience castro later related prevented him from absorbing bourgeois culture at an early age aged six castro along with his elder siblings ramon and angela was sent to live with their teacher in santiago de cuba dwelling in cramped conditions and relative poverty often failing to have enough to eat because of their tutor s poor economic situation aged eight castro was baptized into roman catholic church although later became an atheist being baptized enabled castro to attend la salle boarding school in santiago where he regularly misbehaved and so was sent to privately funded jesuit run dolores school in santiago in 1945 he transferred to more prestigious jesuit run el colegio de belen in havana

gerardo machado fulgencio batista and ramon grau there had been a crackdown on protest with student leaders being killed or terrorized by gangs this led to a form of culture within university dominated by armed student groups who spent much of their time fighting and running criminal enterprises passionate about anti imperialism and opposed to u s intervention in caribbean castro joined university committee for independence of puerto rico and committee for democracy in dominican republic during an unsuccessful campaign for presidency of federation of university students federacion universitaria feu he put forward a platform of honesty decency and justice and emphasized his opposition to corruption which he associated with u s involvement in cuba castro became critical of corruption and violence of grau s regime delivering a public speech on subject in november 1946 that earned him a place on front page of several newspapers in contact with members of student leftist groups including popular socialist party partido socialista popular psp socialist revolutionary movement movimiento socialista revolucionaria msr and revolutionary union union revolucionaria uir he grew close to uir although biographers are unsure whether he became a member in 1947 castro joined a new socialist group party of cuban people partido ortodoxo founded by veteran politician eduardo chibas 1907 1951 a charismatic figure chibas advocated social justice honest government and political freedom while his party exposed corruption and demanded reform though chibas lost election castro remained committed to working on his behalf student violence escalated after grau employed gang leaders as police officers and castro soon received a death threat urging him to leave university he refused and began carrying a gun and surrounding himself with armed friends in later years castro was accused of attempting gang related assassinations during this period including that of uir member lionel gomez msr leader manolo castro and university policeman oscar fernandez but these charges remain unproven latin american rebellions 1947 1948 in june 1947 castro learned of a planned expedition

arrested many of those involved before they set sail but castro escaped arrest by jumping off of his naval frigate and swimming to shore at night botched mission furthered castro s opposition to grau administration and returning to havana he took a leading role in student protests against killing of a high school pupil by government bodyguards protests accompanied by a u s imposed crackdown on those considered communists led to violent clashes between protesters and police in february 1948 in which castro was badly beaten at this point his public speeches took on a distinctively leftist slant condemning social and economic inequalities of cuba something in contrast to his former public criticisms which had centered on condemning corruption and u s imperialism after a quick visit to venezuela and panama in april 1948 castro traveled to city of bogota colombia where pan american conference was taking place fidel s cuban student group along with others attempted to organize 1948

socarras prio faced widespread protests when members of msr now allied to police force assassinated justo fuentes a self educated black cuban who was a prominent uir member and friend of castro s in response prio agreed to quell gangs but found them too powerful to control castro had moved further left in his politics influenced by writings of marxist communists like karl marx friedrich engels and vladimir lenin he came to interpret cuba s problems as an integral part of capitalist society or dictatorship of bourgeoisie rather than failings of corrupt politicians adopting marxist idea that meaningful political change could only be brought about by a proletariat revolution castro visited havana s poorest neighborhoods witnessing nation s social and racial inequalities and became active in university committee for struggle against racial discrimination in september 1949 mirta gave birth to a son fidelito so couple moved to a larger havana flat castro continued to put himself at risk
