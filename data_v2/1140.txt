thomas telford in 19th modern route is based on that designed by telford but with a number of improvements primarily dating from 1920s and 30s these include a diversion across rannoch moor and another around loch leven which was subsequently replaced by ballachulish bridge several travel guides have praised individual parts of road such as section from tyndrum to glencoe across rannoch moor as providing memorable driving experiences tourists find a82 a popular route because of its scenery and it serves as a main artery for commercial and heavy goods traffic transport scotland have publicly

because telford wanted to connect various communities along western shore construction of road started in 1805 but was delayed in 1807 when building contractors abandoned work with seven bridges yet to be completed it was mostly complete by 1809 at an estimated cost of ps5 800 ps as of because a82 is a main through route tourists are suggested to use older military road instead so as to avoid

was described as glasgow clydebank dumbarton alexandria crianlarich ballachulish fort william fort augustus inverness and closely follows route as designed by telford with only a few exceptions basic route has remained unchanged glasgow original starting point of a82 in glasgow was at it proceeded to run westwards along argyle street and dumbarton road to dumbarton via clydebank on 16 may 1934 road was rerouted to run along buchanan street new city road and great western road whose westward extension from anniesland cross had been recently completed route between glasgow and dumbarton has

pictured around 1870 that bridge replaced part of original line of a82 a82 between crianlarich and glencoe over rannoch moor has an extensive history a route through moor was followed by major william caulfeild and a later route was constructed by telford current alignment was constructed because telford s road had continual problems with loch flooding telford himself had proposed a completely alternative route running to spean bridge via loch and glen spean his plans were never implemented though that route eventually formed part of west highland railway current alignment began construction in 1927 and included a general widening of carriageway from tyndrum to glencoe to work was delayed following a disagreement with scottish ministry of transport and local councils over funding it was eventually completed in 1933 and cost ps500 000 ps in 1930s road follows telford s road as far as bridge of then runs to east of loch while old road runs to other side project was

s bridge but there was then no through route around loch however development of aluminium works at kinlochleven and construction of blackwater dam in 1907 resulted in construction of a new road around full extent of loch from glencoe to north ballachulish by 1930s on 16 may 1934 ministry of transport announced they would divert a82 along this road principally because it was an all day route while ferry at that time closed daily between 8 p m and 8 a m and cost up to five shillings to use it continued to follow route via kinlochleven until opening of ballachulish bridge kinlochleven road is now b863 but still remains an important local road since town reinvented itself as a tourist destination following close of smelter works in 2000 ballachulish bridge saves a round trip inverness a82 originally ended on a9 to west of ness bridge near inverness city centre current diversion over friars bridge towards modern a9 opened in 1986 in co ordination with redevelopment and extension of inverness docks in early 1980s and rerouting of a9 onto kessock bridge economic importance thumb alt keith brown scottish politician former scottish transport minister keith brown has described a82 as a vital economic and social lifeline scottish government have said that a82 is a vital artery for communities in western highlands and links fort william highlands and western isles with glasgow and central belt highlands and islands transport partnership hitrans believe economic benefits of a82 extend far beyond its basic route as it connects with several other trunk roads to western highlands and related islands including all of western isles and isle of skye population of area served around a82 corridor is expected to decline from 78 900 in 2001 to 72 300 by 2018 with vast majority of depopulation to occur in western isles hitrans believe investment in a82 is therefore vitally important to improve accessibility of these areas and stop continuing population decline they have said that improvements to a9 in 1970s stimulated economy of inverness without improved access as a result of a9 improvement this would almost certainly not have been possible partnership believe that with comparable improvements to a82 an additional income of ps76 million could be generated in area first minister alex salmond stated that government is committed to improving a82 and he allocated ps500 000 in june 2011 to study key areas where route could be improved scottish transport minister keith brown called a82 a vital economic and social lifeline maintenance and improvements thumb left alt village hall onich a82 at onich has been closed overnight for resurfacing on several occasions resulting in strong protest from local community a82 along with a9 has been frequently regarded as one of

encourage scottish government to continue to make improvements to route in 2002 a82 between tarbet and tyndrum was listed as third most dangerous scottish road in an aa study scottish executive debunked report as misleading a further study listed in 2012 collins big road atlas did not list a82 as one of most at risk to safety in 2017 member of scottish parliament david stewart criticised a82 s safety record in inverness after a man was killed after being hit by a car on road a82 around loch lomond has become increasingly congested as loch has become more popular with tourists for boating particularly since restrictions were put in place in lake district coincident with improvements to routes leading to loch from south on regular occasions road is completely congested from luss to balloch roundabout section from tarbet to crianlarich north of section improved in 1980s and 90s was frequently closed overnight during september 2012 because carriageway had become worn out and needed urgent repair including failed surfacing and potholes because of narrow width of road it was not possible to simply close road in one direction at a time with temporary traffic signals as is general procedure elsewhere on britain s road network transport scotland justified these works by saying that only 5 of traffic used road between 10 pm and 6 am when works were planned official diversion route from tarbet to crianlarich is via a83 and a85 a detour of approximately because most of a82 is single carriageway and local geography means a detour can be a significant distance there is a history of strong protest about closing road in august 2011 john grieve owner of lochleven shellfish company attempted to challenge transport scotland s plans to close a82 overnight five days a week for a period of up to three weeks around village of onich between glencoe and fort william scottish herald reported that if road closed a journey from oban to fort william normally would require diverting via loch tay and a journey of in april 2013 transport scotland announced further plans to close a82 at onich for resurfacing but they postponed work due to an adverse reaction from local business owners in 2015 a section of a82 between invermoriston and drumnadrochit closed following a rockfall requiring an official detour of along with several other roads in highlands a82 between
