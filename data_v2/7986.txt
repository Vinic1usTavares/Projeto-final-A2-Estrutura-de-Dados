sigurd hlodvirsson circa 960 23 april 1014 popularly known as sigurd stout from old norse sigurdr thomson 2008 p 59 was an earl of orkney main sources for his life are norse sagas which were first written down some two centuries or more after his death these engaging stories must therefore be treated with caution rather than as reliable historical documents woolf 2007 pp 277 85 sigurd was son of hlodvir and according to norse sagas a direct descendant of torf einarr sigurd s tenure as earl was apparently free of kin strife that beset some other incumbents of this title and he was able to pursue his military ambitions over a wide area he also held lands in north of mainland scotland and in sudroyar and he may have been instrumental in defeat of gofraid mac arailt king of isles annals of ulster record his death at battle of clontarf in 1014 earliest known reference to earldom of orkney saga tales draw attention to sigurd s conversion to christianity and his use of a raven banner a symbol of norse god odin this ambiguous theme and lack of detailed contemporary records of his life have led to a variety of interpretations of saga material by modern scholars sources sources for sigurd s life are almost exclusively norse sagas none of which were written down at time of events they record orkneyinga saga was first compiled in iceland in early 13th century and much of information it contains is hard to corroborate woolf 2007 p 242 sigurd also appears briefly in st olaf s saga as incorporated into heimskringla and in eyrbyggja saga there are various tales about his exploits in more fanciful njal s saga as well as saga of serpent tongue thorstein s saga saga and in tale of helgi and wolf in flateyjarbok muir 2005 p 2008 p 66 family background orkneyinga saga reports that sigurd was son of hlodvir one of five sons of thorfinn skull splitter and eithne she is said to be a daughter of a king kjarvalr period after earl thorfinn s death was one of dynastic strife three of earl hlodvir s brothers ruled before him although he died in his bed before being succeeded by sigurd orkneyinga saga 1981 chapters 9 11 pp 33 corrain viking ireland afterthoughts probably in 980s woolf 2007 p 307 sigurd s patronymic is an unusual one and there would appear to be a connection with this name and early roots of modern french name louis woolf 2007 p 303 rule sigurd was in fortunate position that on his accession to earldom there seem to have been no other serious contenders in this respect his rule was unlike that of earlier generation of sons of earl thorfinn and of next generation in that it avoided bitter feuding that beset earldom during both of those periods sigurd s great grandfather torf einarr lost udal rights of orkney and shetland farmers as part of a deal he brokered with norwegian crown these rights were restored by sigurd smyth 1984 p 154 burray hoard of silver ring money has been dated to period 997 1010 during earl sigurd s reign

of earldom and also extensive lands on mainland scotland for latter his overlords were kings of scotland rather than of norway clouston 1918 p 15 extent of these mainland dominions is uncertain according to rather dubious source njal s saga they included ross moray sutherland and dales at time moray would have included districts on west coast including lochaber smyth 1984 notes density of dalr placenames on scotland s west coast and it has even been suggested that dales is a reference to dalriada although it is more likely that it means caithness smyth 1984 p 150 during sigurd s tenure earldom approached its high point and his influence was perhaps only exceeded by that of his son thorfinn sigurd s uncle ljot had been killed in war against scots orkneyinga saga 1981 chapter 10 p 36 and sigurd soon faced trouble from his southern neighbours according to orkneyinga saga earl findlaech of moray led an army against him which outnumbered sigurd s forces by seven to one orkneyinga saga 1981 chapter 11 pp 36 37 saga then records sigurd s mother s reply when he went to her for advice raven banner worked as just sigurd s mother said he was victorious but three standard bearers in succession were killed a battle was fought between norwegian forces and malcolm ii of scotland at mortlach c 1005 which may have involved or been led by sigurd although victory went to scots norwegians had clearly spent some considerable time encamped in moray and came equipped with a large fleet however orcadian influence in this part of scotland is likely to have been temporary and on other occasions such as during his uncle ljot s earldom scottish forces had pushed north into caithness orkneyinga saga 1981 chapter 10 p 2008 p 60 hebrides thumb left st martin s cross on iona dates

corrain 1998 p 20 and placed a jarl called gilli in charge njal s saga records an expedition that took place c 980 in which kari sigurd s bodyguard plundered hebrides kintyre and probably strathclyde on another occasion kari sailed through minch in order to collect tribute from gilli whose base may have been either colonsay or coll annals of ulster record a raid by danes on iona on christmas night

celt retrieved 21 january 2014 njal s saga records a victory for sigurd over gofraid mac arailt king of isles with former returning to orkney with spoils contemporary annals of ulster record a similar event in 987 although with reverse outcome here it is claimed that 1 000 norsemen were killed among them danes who had plundered iona thomson 2008 p 61 two years later njal s saga reports a second campaign in southern hebrides anglesey kintyre wales and a more decisive victory in man irish sources report only death of king gofraid in dal riata an event that thomson 2008 ascribes to earl gilli s gall forces eyrbyggja saga records payment of silver tribute from man to sigurd and although this is a rather unreliable source there is corroboration of such an event occurring in 989 in a welsh source with payment being made of a penny each from local population to black host of vikings it has been suggested that much later use of ounceland and pennyland assessments in gaidhealtachd may date from time of earl sigurd and his sons thomson 2008 pp 61 62 by 1004 western isles independence from orkney had been re asserted under ragnal mac gofraid who died in that year it is possible rules

back to norway from dublin king summoned jarl sigurd and said i order you and all your subjects to be baptised if you refuse i ll have you killed on spot and i swear i will ravage every island with fire and steel unsurprisingly sigurd agreed and islands became christian at a stroke thomson 2008 p 69 quoting orkneyinga saga chapter 12 this tale is repeated in st olaf s saga although here olaf lands at south ronaldsay as is a brief mention of sigurd s son hunde or whelp who was taken as a hostage to norway by king olaf hunde was held there for several years before dying there after his

that took place on good friday orkneyinga saga 1981 chapter 12 p 38 chronology is slightly awry in that sigurd s death is known to have taken place 14 years after svolder njal s saga provides a little more detail alleging that gormflaith ingen murchada prompted her son sigtrygg into getting sigurd to fight against her former husband brian boru she sent him to earl sigurd to beg for help then king

events of battle of clontarf in 1014 foreigners and leinstermen were led by brodir of isle of man and sigurd and battle lasted all day though brian was killed in battle irishmen ultimately drove back their enemies into sea and sigurd himself was killed crawford 1987 p 80 his death is corroborated by annals of ulster which record that amongst dead was son of i e of sigurd son of hlodvir earl of

chapter 84 of earl sigurd sigurd is said to have given his sister also called in marriage to earl gilli story of burnt njal 1861 chapter 88 earl fights with njal s sons interpretations sigurd s earldom exerted a magnetic attraction for high born icelanders and inspired many tales of military prowess in their own family sagas thumb left detail from bayeux tapestry showing a norman knight carrying what appears to be a raven banner king kjarvalr sigurd s supposed grandfather appears as kjarvalr in landnamabok and has been identified as mac king of who died in 888 there is clearly a chronological problem with sigurd s mother being daughter of a king who died more than 70 years before death of his own grandfather earl thorfinn furthermore thorstein red olafsson fl late 9th century and hlodvir s great grandfather was apparently married to a granddaughter of kjarvalr woolf 2007 concludes that saga writers may have confused this story about provenance of sigurd hlodvirsson with one about thorstein a close ally of sigurd eysteinsson woolf 2007 pp 283 1987 p 54 drawing on adam of bremen s assertion that orkney was not conquered until time of harald hardrada who ruled norway from 1043 66 woolf 2007 speculates that sigurd may have been first earl of orkney he also offers hypothesis that earldom was a created by danish king harald bluetooth circa 980 rather than in time of harald fairhair one hundred years earlier he concludes that if there were no earls in orkney before sigurd s time it might help to explain islands low profile in annals since these for most part record only deaths of great men woolf 2007 p 308 however absence of comment on this subject by irish sources prior to sigurd s death there is hardly surprising irish sources of period were not well informed about and not much concerned with orkney thomson 2008 p 25 smyth 1984 is more sympathetic to claims of sagas and argues that torf einarr may be regarded as first historical earl of orkney smyth 1984 p 153 thumb scar boat burial plaque found on island of sanday conflict between sigurd and olaf tryggvasson probably predates their chance meeting at kirk hope as latter is known to have been raiding in sudroyar during period 991 94 his motives for a determined pursuit of christian obedience are likely to have been essentially political rather than religious his journey back to norway was in order to bid for kingship there and securing a passive orkney in advance of this was therefore greatly to his advantage although sigurd s marriage to an unnamed daughter of malcolm of scotland is mentioned in orkneyinga saga immediately after death of hunde and earl s consequent break with olaf tryggvasson thomson 2008 views this nuptial arrangement as a joint attempt by orcadians and scots to align themselves against common threat from moray rather than as a slight to norway when sagas were written down orkney had been christian for 200 years or 2008 pp 66 67 and conversion tale itself is blatantly beuermann 2011 pp 143 44 when norse arrived in northern isles they would have found organised christianity already thriving there although there is no mention of this at all in sagas furthermore norse dragon motif of whale bone plaque found at scar boat burial was found in conjunction with grave of an elderly woman who had died by 950 ad at latest and weight of archaeological evidence suggests that christian burial was widespread in orkney by sigurd s time thomson 2008 p 64 intention may have been to disown influence of indigenous elements of orcadian and shetlandic culture and emphasise that positive cultural developments came from scandinavia whilst at same time critiquing unduly blunt method of norwegian interference in this case inclusion of tale of raven banner in saga material may convey idea of a revival of in orcadian society and a reaction to norwegian attempts to control islands however in orkneyinga saga there is a vivid contrast between sigurd s death clutching raven banner and later career of his son thorfinn who is credited with several achievements in bringing orkney into mainstream christendom taken as a whole intention may be to draw
