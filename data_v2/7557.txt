thumb upright 1 35 cattle feedlot in colorado us alt cattle feedlot thumb upright 1 35 raising chickens intensively for meat in a broiler house us alt chickens animal husbandry is branch of agriculture concerned with animals that are raised for meat fibre milk eggs or other products it includes day to day care selective breeding and raising of livestock husbandry has a long history starting with neolithic revolution when animals were first domesticated from around 13 000 bc onwards antedating farming of first crops by time of early civilisations such as ancient egypt cattle sheep goats and pigs were being raised on farms major changes took place in columbian exchange when old world livestock were brought to new world and then in british agricultural revolution of 18th century when livestock breeds like dishley longhorn cattle and lincoln longwool sheep were rapidly improved by agriculturalists such as robert bakewell to yield more meat milk and wool a wide range of other species such as horse water buffalo llama rabbit and guinea pig are used as livestock in some parts of world insect farming as well as aquaculture of fish molluscs and crustaceans is widespread modern animal husbandry relies on production systems adapted to type of land available subsistence farming is being superseded by intensive animal farming in more developed parts of world where for example beef cattle are kept in high density feedlots and thousands of chickens may be raised in broiler houses or batteries on poorer soil such as in uplands animals are often kept more extensively and may be allowed to roam widely foraging for themselves most livestock are herbivores except for pigs and chickens which are omnivores ruminants like cattle and sheep are adapted to feed on grass they can forage outdoors or may be fed entirely or in part on rations richer in energy and protein such as pelleted cereals pigs and poultry cannot digest cellulose in forage and require cereals and other high energy foods etymology verb to husband meaning to manage carefully derives from an older meaning of husband which in 14th century referred to ownership and care of a household or farm but today means control or judicious use of resources and in agriculture cultivation of plants or animals merriam webster s collegiate dictionary farmers and ranchers who raise livestock are considered to practice animal husbandry in modern times large agricultural companies relying on mass production and advanced technology have largely superseded individual farmers as chief food animal producers in developed countries history birth of husbandry thumb left domestication of ruminants like these fat tailed sheep in afghanistan provided nomads across middle east and central asia with a reliable source of food alt fat tailed sheep in afghanistan domestication of livestock was driven by need to have food on hand when hunting was unproductive desirable characteristics of a domestic animal are that it should be useful to should be able to thrive in his or her company should breed freely and be easy to tend domestication was not a single event but a process repeated at various periods in different places sheep and goats were animals that accompanied nomads in middle east while cattle and pigs were associated with more settled communities first wild animal to be domesticated was dog half wild dogs perhaps starting with young individuals may have been tolerated as scavengers and killers of vermin and being naturally pack hunters were predisposed to become part of human pack and join in hunt prey animals sheep goats pigs and cattle were progressively domesticated early in history of agriculture pigs were domesticated in mesopotamia around 13 000 bc and sheep followed some time between 11 000 and 9 000 bc cattle were domesticated from wild aurochs in areas of modern turkey and pakistan around 8 500 bc a cow was a great advantage to a villager as she produced more milk than her calf needed and her strength could be put to use as a working animal pulling a plough to increase production of crops and drawing a sledge and later a cart to bring produce home from field draught animals were first used about 4 000 bc in middle east increasing agricultural production immeasurably in southern asia elephant was domesticated by 6 000 bc gupta anil k in origin of agriculture and domestication of plants and animals linked to early holocene climate amelioration current science vol 87 no 1 10 july 2004 59 indian academy of sciences fossilised chicken bones dated to bc have been found in northeastern china far from where their wild ancestors lived in jungles of tropical asia but archaeologists believe that original purpose of domestication was for sport of cockfighting meanwhile in south america llama and alpaca had been domesticated probably before 3 000 bc as beasts of burden and for their wool neither was strong enough to pull a plough which limited development of agriculture in new world horses occur naturally on steppes of central asia and their domestication around 3 000 bc in black sea and caspian sea region was originally as a source of meat use as pack animals and for riding followed around same time wild ass was being tamed in egypt camels were domesticated soon after this with bactrian camel in mongolia and arabian camel becoming beasts of burden by 1000 bc caravans of arabian camels were linking india with mesopotamia and mediterranean ancient civilisations thumb milking cattle in ancient egypt alt egyptian hieroglyphic of cattle in ancient egypt cattle were most important livestock and sheep goats and pigs were also kept poultry including ducks geese and pigeons were captured in nets and bred on farms where they were force fed with dough to fatten them nile provided a plentiful source of fish honey bees were domesticated from at least old kingdom providing both honey and wax in ancient rome all livestock known in ancient egypt were available in addition rabbits were domesticated for food by first century bc to help flush them out from their burrows polecat was domesticated as ferret its use described by pliny elder medieval husbandry thumb left shepherd with sheep in woven hurdle pen medieval france 15th century ms douce 195 alt painting of shepherd with sheep in northern europe agriculture including animal husbandry went into decline when roman empire collapsed some aspects such as herding of animals continued throughout period by 11th century economy had recovered and countryside was again productive domesday book recorded every parcel of land and every animal in england there was not one single hide nor a yard of land nay moreover not even an ox nor a cow nor a swine was there left that was not set down in king s writ for example royal manor of earley in berkshire one of thousands of villages recorded in book had in 1086 2 fisheries worth paying tax of 7s and 6d each year and 20 acres of meadow for livestock woodland for feeding 70 pigs improvements of animal husbandry in medieval period in europe went hand in hand with other developments improvements to plough allowed soil to be tilled to a greater depth horses took over from oxen as main providers of traction new ideas on crop rotation were developed and growing of crops for winter fodder gained ground peas beans and vetches became common they increased soil fertility through nitrogen fixation allowing more livestock to be kept columbian exchange exploration and colonisation of north and south america resulted in introduction into europe of such crops as maize potatoes sweet potatoes and manioc while principal old world livestock cattle horses sheep and goats were introduced into new world for first time along with wheat barley rice and turnips agricultural revolution thumb lincoln longwool breed was improved by robert bakewell in 18th century alt lincoln longwool sheep selective breeding for desired traits was established as a scientific practice by robert bakewell during british agricultural revolution in 18th century one of his most important breeding programs was with sheep using native stock he was able to quickly select for large yet fine boned sheep with long lustrous wool lincoln longwool was improved by bakewell and in turn lincoln was used to develop subsequent breed named new or dishley leicester it was hornless and had a square meaty body with straight top lines these sheep were exported widely and have contributed to numerous modern breeds under his influence english farmers began to breed cattle for use primarily as beef long horned were crossed with westmoreland bull to create dishley longhorn semi natural unfertilised pastures formed by traditional agricultural methods in europe were managed by grazing and mowing as ecological impact of this land management strategy is similar to impact of such natural disturbances as a wildfire this agricultural system shares many beneficial characteristics with a natural habitat including promotion of biodiversity this strategy is declining in europe today due to intensification of agriculture mechanized and chemical methods used are causing biodiversity to decline husbandry systems thumb left herdwick sheep in an extensive hill farming system lake district england alt herdwick sheep traditionally animal husbandry was part of subsistence farmer s way of life producing not only food needed by family but also fuel fertiliser clothing transport and draught power killing animal for food was a secondary consideration and wherever possible its products such as wool eggs milk and blood by maasai were harvested while animal was still alive in traditional system of transhumance people and livestock moved seasonally between fixed summer and winter pastures in montane regions summer pasture was up in mountains winter pasture in valleys animals can be kept extensively or intensively extensive systems involve animals roaming at will or under supervision of a herdsman often for their protection from predators ranching in western united states involves large herds of cattle grazing widely over public and private lands similar cattle stations are found in south america australia and other places with large areas of land and low rainfall similar ranching systems have been used for sheep deer ostrich emu llama and alpaca in uplands of united kingdom sheep are turned out on fells in spring and graze abundant mountain grasses untended being brought to lower altitudes late in year with supplementary feeding being provided in winter in rural locations pigs and poultry can obtain much of their nutrition from scavenging and in african communities hens may live for months without being fed and still produce one or two eggs a week thumb pigs confined to a barn in an intensive system midwestern united states alt pigs in a barn at other extreme in more developed parts of world animals are often intensively managed dairy cows may be kept in zero grazing conditions with all their forage brought to them beef cattle may be kept in high density feedlots pigs may be housed in climate controlled buildings and never go outdoors poultry may be reared in barns and kept in cages as laying birds under lighting controlled conditions in between these two extremes are semi intensive often family run farms where livestock graze outside for much of year silage or hay is made to cover times of year when grass stops growing and fertiliser feed and other inputs are brought onto farm from outside feeding thumb left cattle around an outdoor feeder alt cattle around an outdoor feeder animals used as livestock are predominantly herbivorous main exceptions being pig and chicken which are omnivorous herbivores can be divided into concentrate selectors which selectively feed on seeds fruits and highly nutritious young foliage grazers which mainly feed on grass and intermediate feeders which choose their diet from whole range of available plant material cattle sheep goats deer and antelopes are ruminants they digest food in two steps chewing and swallowing in normal way and then regurgitating cud to chew it again and thus extract maximum possible food value dietary needs of these animals is mostly met by eating grass grasses grow from base of leaf blade enabling it to thrive even when heavily grazed or cut in many climates grass growth is seasonal for example in temperate summer or tropical rainy season so some areas of crop are set aside to be cut and preserved either as hay dried grass or as silage fermented grass other forage crops are also grown and many of these as well as crop residues can be to fill gap in nutritional needs of livestock in lean season thumb cattle feed pellets of pressed linseed alt cattle feed pellets extensively reared animals may subsist entirely on forage but more intensively kept livestock will require energy and protein rich foods in addition energy is mainly derived from cereals and cereal by products fats and oils and sugar rich foods while protein may come from fish or meat meal milk products legumes and other plant foods often by products of vegetable oil extraction pigs and poultry are non ruminants and unable to digest cellulose in grass and other forages so they are fed entirely on cereals and other high energy foodstuffs ingredients for animals rations can be grown on farm or can be bought in form of pelleted or cubed compound foodstuffs specially formulated for different classes of livestock their growth stages and their specific nutritional requirements vitamins and minerals are added to balance diet farmed fish are usually fed pelleted food breeding breeding of farm animals seldom occurs spontaneously but is managed by farmers with a view to encouraging traits seen as desirable these include hardiness fertility docility mothering abilities fast growth rates low feed consumption per unit of growth better body proportions higher yields and better fibre qualities undesirable traits such as health defects and aggressiveness are selected against selective breeding has been responsible for large increases in productivity for example in 2007 a typical broiler chicken at eight weeks old was 4 8 times as heavy as a bird of similar age in 1957 while in thirty years to 2007 average milk yield of a dairy cow in united states nearly doubled animal health thumb left vaccinating a goat niger alt vaccination of a goat good husbandry proper feeding and hygiene are main contributors to animal health on farm bringing economic benefits through maximised production when despite these precautions animals still become sick they are treated with veterinary medicines by farmer and veterinarian in european union when farmers treat their own animals they are required to follow guidelines for treatment and to record treatments given animals are susceptible to a number of diseases and conditions that may affect their health some like classical swine fever and scrapie are specific to one type of stock while others like foot and mouth disease affect all cloven hoofed animals where condition is serious governments impose regulations on import and export on movement of stock quarantine restrictions and reporting of suspected cases vaccines are available against certain diseases and antibiotics are widely used where appropriate at one time antibiotics were routinely added to certain compound foodstuffs to promote growth but this practice is now frowned on in many countries because of risk that it may lead to antibiotic resistance animals living under intensive conditions are particularly prone to internal and external parasites increasing numbers of sea lice are affecting farmed salmon in scotland reducing parasite burdens of livestock results in increased productivity and profitability thumb familiar livestock ink and watercolour drawing of a farmyard with cow horse pigs and chickens 1869 alt watercolor drawing of farmyard with cow horse pigs and chickens governments are particularly concerned with zoonoses diseases that humans may acquire from animals wild animal populations may harbour diseases that can affect domestic animals which may acquire them as a result of insufficient biosecurity an outbreak of nipah virus in malaysia in 1999 was traced back to pigs becoming ill after contact with fruit eating flying foxes their faeces and urine pigs in turn passed infection to humans avian flu h5n1 is present in wild bird populations and can be carried large distances by migrating birds this virus is easily transmissible to domestic poultry and to humans living in close proximity with them other infectious diseases affecting wild animals farm animals and humans include rabies leptospirosis brucellosis tuberculosis and trichinosis range of species there is no single universally agreed definition of which species are livestock widely agreed types of livestock include cattle for beef and dairy sheep goats pigs and poultry various other species are sometimes considered livestock such as horses while poultry birds are sometimes excluded in some parts of world livestock includes species such as buffalo and south american alpaca and llama some authorities use much broader definitions to include fish in aquaculture micro livestock such as rabbits and rodents like guinea pigs as well as insects from honey bees to crickets raised for human consumption thumb shearing a merino sheep for its wool alt merino sheep products animals are raised for a wide variety of products principally meat wool milk and eggs but also including tallow isinglass and rennet animals are also kept for more specialised purposes such as to produce vaccines and containing antibodies for medical use where fodder or other crops are grown alongside animals manure can serve as a fertiliser returning minerals and organic matter to soil in a semi closed organic system branches dairy thumb left a modern rotary milking parlour germany alt rotary milking parlour although all mammals produce milk to nourish their young cow is predominantly used throughout world to produce milk and milk products for human consumption other animals used to a lesser extent for this purpose include sheep goats camels buffaloes reindeer horses and donkeys all these animals have been domesticated over centuries being bred for such desirable characteristics as fecundity productivity docility and ability to thrive under prevailing conditions whereas in past cattle had multiple functions modern dairy cow breeding has resulted in specialised holstein friesian type animals that produce large quantities of milk economically artificial insemination is widely available to allow farmers to select for particular traits that suit their circumstances whereas in past cows were kept in small herds on family farms grazing pastures and being fed hay in winter nowadays there is a trend towards larger herds more intensive systems feeding of silage and zero grazing a system where grass is cut and brought to cow which is housed year round in many communities milk production is only part of purpose of keeping an animal which may also be used as a beast of burden or to draw a plough or for production of fibre meat and leather with dung being used for fuel or for improvement of soil fertility sheep and goats may be favoured for dairy production in climates and conditions that do not suit dairy cows meat thumb hereford is a hardy breed of beef cattle now raised in many countries around world alt hereford cow meat mainly from farmed animals is a major source of dietary protein around world averaging about 8 of man s energy intake actual types eaten depend on local preferences availability cost and other factors with cattle sheep pigs and goats being main species involved cattle generally produce a single offspring annually which takes more than a year to mature sheep and goats often have twins and these are ready for slaughter in less than a year pigs are more prolific producing more than one litter of up to about 11 piglets each year horses donkeys deer buffalo llamas alpacas and vicunas are farmed for meat in various regions some desirable traits of animals raised for meat include fecundity hardiness fast growth rate ease of management and high food conversion efficiency about half of world s meat is produced from animals grazing on open ranges or on enclosed pastures other half being produced intensively in various factory farming systems these are mostly cows pigs or poultry and often reared indoors typically at high densities poultry thumb upright battery hens brazil alt battery hens poultry kept for their eggs and for their meat include chickens turkeys geese and ducks great majority of laying birds used for egg production are chickens methods for keeping layers range from free range systems where birds can roam as they will but are housed at night for their own protection through semi intensive systems where they are housed in barns and have perches litter and some freedom of movement to intensive systems where they are kept in cages battery cages are arranged in long rows in multiple tiers with external feeders drinkers and egg collection facilities this is most labour saving and economical method of egg production but has been criticised on animal welfare grounds as birds are unable to exhibit their normal behaviours in developed world majority of poultry reared for meat is raised indoors in big sheds with automated equipment under environmentally controlled conditions chickens raised in this way are known as broilers and genetic improvements have meant that they can be grown to slaughter weight within six or seven weeks of hatching newly hatched chicks are restricted to a small area and given supplementary heating litter on floor absorbs droppings and area occupied is expanded as they grow feed and water is supplied automatically and lighting is controlled birds may be harvested on several occasions or whole shed may be cleared at one time a similar rearing system is usually used for turkeys which are less hardy than chickens but they take longer to grow and are often moved on to separate fattening units to finish sherwin c m 2010 turkeys behavior management and well being in encyclopaedia of animal science wilson g pond and alan w bell eds marcel dekker pp 847 49 ducks are particularly popular in asia and australia and can be killed at seven weeks under commercial conditions aquaculture thumb left freshwater fish farming france alt freshwater fish farm aquaculture has been defined as farming of aquatic organisms including fish molluscs crustaceans and aquatic plants and implies some form of intervention in rearing process to enhance production such as regular stocking feeding protection from predators etc farming also implies individual or corporate ownership of stock being cultivated in practice it can take place in sea or in freshwater and be extensive or intensive whole bays lakes or ponds may be devoted to aquaculture or farmed animal may be retained in cages fish artificial reefs racks or strings shellfish fish and prawns can be cultivated in rice paddies either arriving naturally or being introduced and both crops can be harvested together fish hatcheries provide larval and juvenile fish crustaceans and shellfish for use in aquaculture systems when large enough these are transferred to growing on tanks and sold to fish farms to reach harvest size some species that are commonly raised in hatcheries include shrimps prawns salmon tilapia oysters and scallops similar facilities can be used to raise species with conservation needs to be released into wild or game fish for restocking waterways important aspects of husbandry at these early stages include selection of breeding stock control of water quality and nutrition in wild there is a massive amount of mortality at nursery stage farmers seek to minimise this while at same time maximising growth rates insects thumb crickets being raised for human consumption thailand alt crickets bees have been kept in hives since at least first dynasty of egypt five thousand years ago and man had been harvesting honey from wild long before that fixed comb hives are used in many parts of world and are made from any locally available material in more advanced economies where modern strains of domestic bee have been selected for docility and various designs of hive are used which enable combs to be removed for processing and extraction of honey quite apart from honey and wax they produce honey bees are important pollinators of crops and wild plants and in many places hives are transported around countryside to assist in pollination sericulture rearing of silkworms was first adopted by chinese during shang dynasty only species farmed commercially is domesticated when it spins its cocoon each larva produces an exceedingly long slender thread of silk larvae feed on mulberry leaves and in europe only one generation is normally raised each year as this is a deciduous tree in china korea and japan however two generations are normal and in tropics multiple generations are expected most production of silk occurs in far east with a synthetic diet being used to rear silkworms in japan insects form part of human diet in many cultures in thailand crickets are farmed for this purpose in north of country and palm weevil larvae in south crickets are kept in pens boxes or drawers and fed on commercial pelleted poultry food while palm weevil larvae live on cabbage palm and sago palm trees which limits their production to areas where these trees grow another delicacy of this region is bamboo caterpillar and best rearing and harvesting techniques in semi natural habitats are being studied effects environmental impact thumb livestock production requires large areas of land alt cattle animal husbandry has a significant impact on world environment it is responsible for somewhere between 20 and 33 of fresh water usage in world and livestock and production of feed for them occupy about a third of earth s ice free land livestock production is a contributing factor in species extinction desertification and habitat destruction animal agriculture contributes to species extinction in various ways habitat is destroyed by clearing forests and converting land to grow feed crops and for animal grazing while predators and herbivores are frequently targeted and hunted because of a perceived threat to livestock profits for example animal husbandry is responsible for up to 91 of deforestation in amazon region in addition livestock produce greenhouse gases cows produce some 570 million cubic metres of methane per day that accounts for from 35 to 40 of overall methane emissions of planet livestock is responsible for 65 of all human related emissions of powerful and long lived greenhouse gas nitrous oxide as a result ways of mitigating animal husbandry s environmental impact are being studied strategies include using biogas from manure genetic selection bovine genomics project at genome is using genetics to make cows less gassy immunization rumen defaunation of methanogenic archaea with introduction of bacteria into rumen use of direct fed for mitigation of ruminant methane emissions a review diet modification and grazing management among others martin c et al 2010 methane mitigation in ruminants from microbe to farm scale animal 4 pp 351 365 certain diet changes such as with allow for a reduction of up to 99 in ruminant greenhouse gas emissions animal welfare since 18th century people have become increasingly concerned about welfare of farm animals possible measures of welfare include longevity behavior physiology reproduction freedom from disease and freedom from immunosuppression standards and laws for animal welfare have been created worldwide broadly in line with most widely held position in western world a form of utilitarianism that it is morally acceptable for humans to use non human animals provided that no unnecessary suffering is caused and that benefits to humans outweigh costs to livestock an opposing view is that animals have rights should not be regarded as property are not necessary to use and should never be used by humans live export of animals has risen to meet increased global demand for livestock such as in middle east animal rights activists have objected to long distance transport of animals one result was banning of live exports from new zealand in 2003 in culture thumb left opening of budget or john bull giving

first in john arbuthnot s political satires and soon afterwards in cartoons by james gillray and others including john tenniel he likes food beer dogs horses and country sports he is practical and down to earth and anti intellectual thumb upright dressed pigs in beatrix potter s 1913 tale of pigling bland alt illustration of dressed pigs farm animals are widespread in books and songs for children reality of animal husbandry is often distorted softened or idealized giving children an almost entirely fictitious account of farm life books often depict happy animals free to roam in attractive countryside a picture completely at odds with realities of impersonal mechanized activities involved in modern intensive farming pigs for example appear in several of beatrix potter s little books as piglet in a a milne s winnie pooh stories and somewhat more darkly with a hint of animals going to slaughter as babe in dick king smith s sheep pig and as wilbur in e b white s charlotte s web pigs tend to be bearers of cheerfulness good humour and innocence many of these books are completely anthropomorphic dressing farm animals in clothes and having them walk on two legs
