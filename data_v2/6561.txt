fredericks susan richards as nurse production robert wise was in post production on west side story when he read a review in time magazine of author shirley jackson s novel haunting of hill house wise read book and found it frightening he passed it to screenwriter friend nelson gidding with whom he had worked on film i want to live 1958 marriott 2012 p 1959 gidding did a full story treatment for wise before proceeding to work on adaptation as gidding crafted screenplay he came to believe that novel was not a ghost story at all but rather a compilation of insane thoughts of lead character eleanor vance he theorised that vance was having a nervous breakdown envisaging a scenario in which hill house is hospital where she is held markway is her psychiatrist cold banging and violence are results of shock treatment and opening and closing of doors reflected opening and closing of hospital doors gidding and weaver 2001 p 64 wise and gidding traveled to bennington vermont to meet jackson who told them that it was a good idea but that novel was definitely about supernatural gidding and weaver 2001 pp 64 65 nonetheless elements of insanity concept remained in script so that audience was left wondering whether supernatural events in film were in eleanor s mind or whether they were real gidding and weaver 2001 p 65 it was also during their visit to speak with jackson that wise and gidding chose title for film as they did not want to keep book title they asked jackson if she had considered an alternative title she suggested haunting which wise and gidding immediately adopted sloane 1995 p 22 script writing screenplay took about six months during this period gidding worked alone and although he passed some of his work to wise to show him that work on screenplay was progressing well he and wise did not otherwise collaborate on screenplay screenplay made other changes to story number of characters was cut down backstory was significantly shortened most of supernatural events depicted in novel were kept off screen and greater part of action was set inside house to heighten audience s feeling of claustrophobia eleanor s role as an outcast was also emphasized character of theodora was given a sharper slightly more cruel sense of humor in order to make her a foil for eleanor but also to heighten eleanor s outsider status role of luke became more flippant and dr markway montague in novel was made a more confident character screenplay was finished just after wise completed work on west side story wise approached united artists with project but after much delay they turned him down wise s agent then suggested that since wise owed metro goldwyn mayer mgm a film under an old contract wise should take project there mgm agreed but would only give wise a 1 million budget wise knew he could not do film at mgm s culver city studios now sony pictures studios so took it to england as eady levy gave tax breaks and financing to films made there as a way of subsidizing and promoting british film industry someone suggested to wise that he approach mgm s borehamwood studios subsidiary wise had been asked to come to united kingdom for a royal command performance of west side story and during trip made financing pitch to mgm borehamwood they offered a budget of 1 050 million with eady levy support this allowed film to go forward with production in united kingdom casting although susan hayward was reported to be in running for one of two female leads julie harris was chosen for role of eleanor vance gidding and weaver 2001 p 66 wise had seen harris on stage and felt she was right for part of psychologically fragile eleanor harris agreed to do film in part because role was complex and idea of house taking over eleanor s mind was interesting but she also chose it because she had a long standing interest in parapsychology english actress claire bloom was cast as theo in part however decision to cast bloom and johnson was because of eady levy requirements that cast be partly british to make bloom s character appear more bohemian beatnik clothing designer mary quant was hired to design mod clothing specifically for theodora character richard johnson under contract to mgm was cast as dr markway wise saw johnson in a royal shakespeare company production of devils impressed with his acting he offered him role johnson later said he received invaluable film acting advice from wise wise told him to keep his eyes steady to blink less and to try not to time his acting wise said he would take care of that in editing room johnson also credited wise with helping him to craft a much more natural acting performance russ tamblyn also under contract to mgm initially turned down role as luke because he felt that character was a jerk although he thought that script was very good studio forced him to reconsider threatening him with suspension tamblyn told british cinema magazine film review in 1995 that while reading script a second time he realised character was much more interesting this is ironic part he said it turned out to be one of my favourite films that i ve been in stunt performer connie tilton appears twice in film she portrays death of second mrs crain by flinging herself backward down a flight of stairs uncredited actress freda knorr is seen in shots before and after fall it is her face audiences associate with second mrs crain tilton also appears when abigail crain s nurse companion hangs herself at top of spiral staircase in library although uncredited actress rosemary dorken is seen climbing stairs and going past camera it is tilton s body that suddenly appears in shot again as nurse companion hangs herself filming thumb right 300px ettington park shown here in 2009 was used for exteriors of haunted hill house wise called haunting one of his top ten or twelve favourites among films he made commenting that it was his favourite filmmaking experience ettington park now ettington park hotel with its grounds near village of ettington warwickshire was used for exterior shots of hill house according to actor russ tamblyn wise approached a society that kept track of british haunted houses and they gave him a list of such places production designer elliot scott was sent around country to look at each house and wise personally selected ettington park sloane 1995 p 22 23 some of cast and crew were housed in ettington park during exterior shooting however location did not sit well with harris and bloom who upon arriving at ettington park thought it was scary looking outside and wise had to reassure them interior sets were constructed and shot at mgm british studios in borehamwood hertfordshire interior sets were designed by elliot scott credited by wise as a major contributor to haunting wise and leemann 1995 p 175 szebin frederick c sound of screaming cinefantastique 29 4 5 october 1997 p 141 sets were designed to be brightly lit with no dark corners or recesses and decorated in a rococo style all rooms had ceilings to create a claustrophobic effect on film this was unusual as most film sets forgo ceilings to add in lighting and filming actor richard johnson said that sets eeriness created a subdued atmosphere among cast and crew wise says that his contract with mgm specified that picture could only be shot in black and white which wise preferred for this genre of film he attempted to make ettington park look more sinister through various lighting effects and camera settings but this failed wise and boulton then hit on idea of using infrared film for establishing shots of house infrared film stocks were quickly rushed to location shoot from belgium new film worked wise felt infrared film brought out striations of stone and made mansion look like more of a monster house silver and wise 2002 p 133 wise very much wanted to make haunting a tribute to val lewton producer and writer under whom wise had directed his first film supernatural horror picture curse of cat people wise says that lewton s theory of horror was that people were more afraid of unknown than things they could see decision to show little that was supernatural was made very early in picture s pre production wise and cinematographer davis boulton also wanted to make distances in film such as hallways look longer and darker than audience would anticipate wise approached panavision company and wanted an anamorphic wide angle lens only lens panavision had was a 40mm wise learned that company was working on a 30mm lens but it contained distortions and was not ready wise kept pressing and eventually panavision turned over 30mm lens on condition that wise signed a memorandum in which he acknowledged it was imperfect wise and leemann 1995 p 177 wise and boulton also planned shots that kept camera moving utilised low angle shots and incorporated unusual pans and tracking shots this led to some of most active camera movements in wise s film career to accentuate feeling that house was alive exterior shots were filmed so that windows appeared to be eyes sloane 1995 p 23 during shoot harris suffered from depression and believed that her co stars did not take film as seriously as she did in review haunting cinefantastique 35 4 2003 p 68 at times she would cry in her makeup chair prior to day s shoot other actors remember her as being distant not a part of their socializing and joking and harris did not speak to bloom during filming which puzzled bloom afterward harris told bloom that lack of interaction had helped her build her own performance and two women reconciled harris incorporated her own depression into her performance wise heightened sense of character conflict by having characters step on one another s lines allowing one character to begin talking before other had finished on occasion characters simply talk at same time to enhance actors performances during scenes in which they react to off stage voices or sounds wise and his sound editors created a pre scored soundtrack of voices and noises these were played back during filming and wise says they greatly enhanced acting performances although some sounds were replaced during post production pre scored sounds were left on soundtrack just as actors heard them sound editors collected and created sounds in an empty manor house for a week to create pre score some of sounds are very low in bass range which can cause physical sensations at high volume effects and editing film contains a number of special effects many of which were achieved in ways not immediately obvious to viewer in one scene a supernatural force pushes against a large parlor door bending it inward repeatedly though door appears to some viewers to have been made of latex it was in fact made of laminated wood strange buckling was simply result of a strong crew member pushing a piece of timber hard against it two physical effects were used to make spiral staircase in library appear frightening in one scene camera appears to ascend staircase at a rapid rate wise achieved this effect by using staircase s handrail as a make shift dolly track a camera was attached to rail and then slowly allowed to slide down all while being controlled by a wire so that its fall could be controlled sequence was then reversed and run at high speed which gave final cut an unworldly feel in another scene staircase appears to become unstable and give way as luke sanderson ascends it later eleanor goes up staircase in a trance like state and is rescued by dr markway even as staircase seems ready to collapse collapsing staircase effect was designed by a metalworker at borehamwood studios sloane 1995 p 24 effect was created by tying portions of steps and railing to a cable that ran inside staircase s central support column when cable was slackened elements of stairway loosened up and moved freely conversely when cable was tightened staircase appeared solid and stable effect disturbed cast so much that robert wise had to ascend staircase while it was shaking in order to prove that it was safe other effects also relied on simple cinema tricks early in film audience sees abigail crain lying in bed aging from a young child to an old woman a camera was fixed over bed and four different actresses each a different age posed in bed beneath camera dissolves were then used to illustrate aging process in another scene characters come across a cold spot in haunted mansion wise had initially wanted actors to simply play up quality of being cold in sequence but he quickly recognized that an additional visual effect was needed to more clearly emphasize temperature drop to overcome unique issue of having to photograph nothing wise instructed makeup department to apply a special makeup onto actors this makeup contained a compound that was usually invisible to naked eye but that appeared under certain filters when it came time to film actors walked onto portion of set that was supposed to represent cold spot and these filters were gradually drawn over set s lights this gave visual impression that characters had turned pale due to a drop in temperature camera work and editing work together to further heighten frightening qualities of film eleanor is often viewed from above and in one scene camera closes in so tightly on her that she is forced backward over a railing eleanor s viewpoint is often juxtaposed with eerie views of house as if both viewpoints were same many of editing choices in film were also used to heighten audience s discomfort there are a number of rapid cuts in film that throw off viewer s sense of spatial orientation and dutch angles are used to imply that reality is off kilter likewise cutting on action showing characters exiting a room to right only to show them entering next room from left is often violated so that viewer cannot get a clear sense of which rooms and hallways are connected to one another film also lacks temporal clues and there are few shots in which audience can see out a window to determine whether it is night or day in other instances windows are visible but do little to establish temporality for instance when eleanor is rescued by dr markway on unstable spiral staircase some of windows nearby show strong sunlight streaming in while others show darkness outside haunting is notable for its lesbian character theodora although character s lesbianism is subtly mentioned in novel film makes it explicit film is also one of few hollywood motion pictures to depict a lesbian as feminine and not predatory white 1999 p 78 91 theodora s lesbianism helps to create conflict in picture had theodora been heterosexual eleanor s growing attraction to markway would not have threatened her but with theodora a clear lesbian markway becomes a threat that causes conflict between psychic and investigator originally gidding s script had contained a scene early in film in which theodora is shown in her apartment in city it is clear from context that she has just broken off with her female lover i hate you is written on mirror in lipstick theodora is yelling curses at her out window and more however wise decided to cut scene believing it to be too explicit for a film that worked hard to make things implicit szebin frederick c sound of screaming cinefantastique 29 4 5 october 1997 p 140 according to harris film censors demanded that theo never be shown to touch eleanor in order to keep lesbianism less obvious reception haunting was released on 18 september 1963 audiences were frightened by it film critic dora jane hamblin related how four of her female friends expecting a ho hum film took out make up during film s first few minutes with intention of fixing their faces film proved so frightening she said that women were jumping out of their seats and losing their items hamblin dora jane great new scary film life 30 august 1963 accessed 8 october 2012 in houston texas a local cinema promoted film as so chilling that it held a contest to see which of four patrons could sit all way through a midnight screening prize was 100 welling 2007 p 281 despite these stunts haunting was only an average success at box office haunting opened to mixed reception consensus generally being that it was a stylish film but had major flaws in plot and lacked excitement variety called acting effective davis boulton s cinematography extraordinarily dexterous and visually exciting and elliott scott s production design of monstrous house most decidedly star of film however unnamed reviewer felt gidding s screenplay had major shortcomings in that plot was incomprehensible at points and motivation for characters was poor film reviews haunting variety 31 december 1962 bosley crowther of new york times cited haunting as one of most highly regarded haunted house films ever produced but surmised that there is really no point to it writing in atlantic magazine critic pauline kael called film moderately elegant and literate and expensive but criticised russ tamblyn for being feeble and cowardly comic she considered film to be superior to alfred hitchcock s birds also released in 1963 yet didn t consider it to be a great film kael said of it it wasn t a great movie but i certainly wouldn t have thought that it could offend anyone yet part of audience at haunting wasn t merely bored it was hostile as if movie by assuming interests they didn t have made them feel resentful or inferior i ve never felt this in an audience toward crude bad movies but few scattered people at haunting were restless and talkative couple sitting near me arguing man threatening to leave woman assuring him that something would happen in their terms they were cheated nothing happened and of course they missed what was happening all along perhaps because of nervous impatience or a primitive notion that real things are physical film s stature and following has grown steadily since its original release director martin scorsese placed haunting first on his list of 11 scariest horror films of all time richard johnson says that steven spielberg considers haunting one of seminal films of his youth and robert wise says that spielberg told him haunting was scariest film ever made richard armstrong in rough guide to film 2007 called it one of most frightening films ever made and said julie harris performance is played with an intensity that is frightening in itself in 2010 guardian newspaper ranked it as 13th best horror film of all time however not all critics think so highly of film yoram allon and neil labute have stated that they believe film is frankly overrated and professional filmmaker russell evans has argued that few people truly find film shocking or disturbing review aggregator website rotten tomatoes scores film with an 87 rating based on 39 reviews with an average rating of 7 95 10 critical consensus reads both
