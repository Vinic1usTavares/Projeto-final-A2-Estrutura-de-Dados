episodes like a focus that does not stray too far from simpson family and a b plot that works despite this she felt that jokes are so low key and mild that episode zooms by without raising a single chuckle or smirk similarly jason hughes of aol tv commented that w hile it was a charming enough episode there were no stand out moments of clever satire or unexpected twists ology s josh harrison was slightly more negative and thought episode was charming but a bit of a comic flop he concluded that episode was nothing special and gave episode a rating of six out of ten on mad men parody childs found comedic potential in homer s transformation into don draper but concluded that this was where episode could have gotten very funny very fast but it doesn t bring any of these jokes home she further elaborated that don draper is a sad character true but there is some real comic potential in his pretensions and vanity writers are tapping into this aspect of his characterization to a small degree but they aren t really satirizing it hughes was not impressed with mad men parody and sarcastically stated that spoof was so sharp you ll swear it s 2008 references external links man in blue
