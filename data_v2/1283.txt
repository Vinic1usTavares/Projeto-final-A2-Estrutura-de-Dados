system which divides planet into a 3d grid winds heat transfer solar radiation relative humidity phase changes of water and surface hydrology are calculated within each grid cell and interactions with neighboring cells are used to calculate atmospheric properties in future alt a grid for a numerical weather model is shown grid divides surface of earth along meridians and parallels and simulates thickness of atmosphere by stacking grid cells away from earth s center an inset shows different physical processes analyzed in each grid cell such as advection precipitation solar radiation and terrestrial radiative cooling numerical weather prediction nwp uses mathematical models of atmosphere and oceans to predict weather based on current weather conditions though first attempted in 1920s it was not until advent of computer simulation in 1950s that numerical weather predictions produced realistic results a number of global and regional forecast models are run in different countries worldwide using current weather observations relayed from radiosondes weather satellites and other observing systems as inputs mathematical models based on same physical principles can be used to generate either short term weather forecasts or longer term climate predictions latter are widely applied for understanding and projecting climate change improvements made to regional models have allowed for significant improvements in tropical cyclone track and air quality forecasts however atmospheric models perform poorly at handling processes that occur in a relatively constricted area such as wildfires manipulating vast datasets and performing complex calculations necessary to modern numerical weather prediction requires some of most powerful supercomputers in world even with increasing power of supercomputers forecast skill of numerical weather models extends to only about six days factors affecting accuracy of numerical predictions include density and quality of observations used as input to forecasts along with deficiencies in numerical models themselves post processing techniques such as model output statistics mos have been developed to improve handling of errors in numerical predictions a more fundamental problem lies in chaotic nature of partial differential equations that govern atmosphere it is impossible to solve these equations exactly and small errors grow with time doubling about every five days present understanding is that this chaotic behavior limits accurate forecasts to about 14 days even with accurate input data and a flawless model in addition partial differential equations used in model need to be supplemented with parameterizations for solar radiation moist processes clouds and precipitation heat exchange soil vegetation surface water and effects of terrain in an effort to quantify large amount of inherent uncertainty remaining in numerical predictions ensemble forecasts have been used since 1990s to help gauge confidence in forecast and to obtain useful results farther into future than otherwise possible this approach analyzes multiple forecasts created with an individual forecast model or multiple models history thumb 280px eniac main control panel at moore school of electrical engineering operated by betty jennings and frances bilas history of numerical weather prediction began in 1920s through efforts of lewis fry richardson who used procedures originally developed by vilhelm bjerknes to produce by hand a six hour forecast for state of atmosphere over two points in central europe taking at least six weeks to do so it was not until advent of computer and computer simulations that computation time was reduced to less than forecast period itself eniac was used to create first weather forecasts via computer in 1950 based on a highly simplified approximation to atmospheric governing equations in 1954 carl gustav rossby s group at swedish meteorological and hydrological institute used same model to produce first operational forecast i e a routine prediction for practical use operational numerical weather prediction in united states began in 1955 under joint numerical weather prediction unit jnwpu a joint project by u s air force navy and weather bureau in 1956 norman phillips developed a mathematical model which could realistically depict monthly and seasonal patterns in troposphere this became first successful climate model following phillips work several groups began working to create general circulation models first general circulation climate model that combined both oceanic and atmospheric processes was developed in late 1960s at noaa geophysical fluid dynamics laboratory as computers have become more powerful size of initial data sets has increased and newer atmospheric models have been developed to take advantage of added available computing power these newer models include more physical processes in simplifications of equations of motion in numerical simulations of atmosphere in 1966 west germany and united states began producing operational forecasts based on primitive equation models followed by united kingdom in 1972 and australia in 1977 development of limited area regional models facilitated advances in forecasting tracks of tropical cyclones as well as air quality in 1970s and 1980s by early 1980s models began to include interactions of soil and vegetation with atmosphere which led to more realistic forecasts output of forecast models based on atmospheric dynamics is unable to resolve some details of weather near earth s surface as such a statistical relationship between output of a numerical weather model and ensuing conditions at ground was developed in 1970s and 1980s known as model output statistics mos starting in 1990s model ensemble forecasts have been used to help define forecast uncertainty and to extend window in which numerical weather forecasting is viable farther into future than otherwise possible initialization 280px thumb right weather reconnaissance aircraft such as this wp 3d orion provide data that is then used in numerical weather forecasts alt a wp 3d orion weather reconnaissance aircraft in flight atmosphere is a fluid as such idea of numerical weather prediction is to sample state of fluid at a given time and use equations of fluid dynamics and thermodynamics to estimate state of fluid at some time in future process of entering observation data into model to generate initial conditions is called initialization on land terrain maps available at resolutions down to globally are used to help model atmospheric circulations within regions of rugged topography in order to better depict features such as downslope winds mountain waves and related cloudiness that affects incoming solar radiation main inputs from country based weather services are observations from devices called radiosondes in weather balloons that measure various atmospheric parameters and transmits them to a fixed receiver as well as from weather satellites world meteorological organization acts to standardize instrumentation observing practices and timing of these observations worldwide stations either report hourly in metar reports or every six hours in reports these observations are irregularly spaced so they are processed by data assimilation and objective analysis methods which perform quality control and obtain values at locations usable by model s mathematical algorithms data are then used in model as starting point for a forecast a variety of methods are used to gather observational data for use in numerical models sites launch radiosondes in weather balloons which rise through troposphere and well into stratosphere information from weather satellites is used where traditional data sources are not available commerce provides pilot reports along aircraft routes and ship reports along shipping routes research projects use reconnaissance aircraft to fly in and around weather systems of interest such as tropical cyclones reconnaissance aircraft are also flown over open oceans during cold season into systems which cause significant uncertainty in forecast guidance or are expected to be of high impact from three to seven days into future over downstream continent sea ice began to be initialized in forecast models in 1971 efforts to involve sea surface temperature in model initialization began in 1972 due to its role in modulating weather in higher latitudes of pacific computation right 280px thumb a prognostic chart of 96 hour forecast of 850 mbar geopotential height and temperature from global forecast system alt a prognostic chart of north american continent provides geopotential heights temperatures and wind velocities at regular intervals values are taken at altitude corresponding to 850 millibar pressure surface an atmospheric model is a computer program that produces meteorological information for future times at given locations and altitudes within any modern model is a set of equations known as primitive equations used to predict future state of atmosphere these equations along with ideal gas law are used to evolve density pressure and potential temperature scalar fields and air velocity wind vector field of atmosphere through time additional transport equations for pollutants and other aerosols are included in some primitive equation high resolution models as well equations used are nonlinear partial differential equations which are impossible to solve exactly through analytical methods with exception of a few idealized cases therefore numerical methods obtain approximate solutions different models use different solution methods some global models and almost all regional models use finite difference methods for all three spatial dimensions while other global models and a few regional models use spectral methods for horizontal dimensions and finite difference methods in vertical these equations are initialized from analysis data and rates of change are determined these rates of change predict state of atmosphere a short time into future time increment for this prediction is called a time step this future atmospheric state is then used as starting point for another application of predictive equations to find new rates of change and these new rates of change predict atmosphere at a yet further time step into future this time stepping is repeated until solution reaches desired forecast time length of time step chosen within model is related to distance between points on computational grid and is chosen to maintain numerical stability time steps for global models are on order of tens of minutes while time steps for regional models are between one and four minutes global models are run at varying times into future unified model is run six days into future while european centre for medium range weather forecasts integrated forecast system and environment canada s global environmental multiscale model both run out to ten days into future and global forecast system model run by environmental modeling center is run sixteen days into future visual output produced by a model solution is known as a prognostic chart or prog parameterization thumb right field of cumulus clouds which are parameterized since they are too small to be explicitly included within numerical weather prediction some meteorological processes are too small scale or too complex to be explicitly included in numerical weather prediction models parameterization is a procedure for representing these processes by relating them to variables on scales that model resolves for example gridboxes in weather and climate models have sides that are between and in length a typical cumulus cloud has a scale of less than and would require a grid even finer than this to be represented physically by equations of fluid motion therefore processes that such clouds represent are parameterized by processes of various sophistication in earliest models if a column of air within a model was conditionally unstable essentially bottom was warmer and moister than top and water vapor content at any point within column became saturated then it would be overturned warm moist air would begin rising and air in that vertical column mixed more sophisticated schemes recognize that only some portions of box might and that entrainment and other processes occur weather models that have gridboxes with sizes between can explicitly represent convective clouds although they need to parameterize cloud microphysics which occur at a smaller scale formation of large scale stratus type clouds is more physically based they form when relative humidity reaches some prescribed value sub grid scale processes need to be taken into account rather than assuming that clouds form at 100 relative humidity cloud fraction can be related to a critical value of relative humidity less than 100 reflecting sub grid scale variation that occurs in real world amount of solar radiation reaching ground as well as formation of cloud droplets occur on molecular scale and so they must be parameterized before they can be included in model atmospheric drag produced by mountains must also be parameterized as limitations in resolution of elevation contours produce significant underestimates of drag this method of parameterization is also done for surface flux of energy between ocean and atmosphere in order to determine realistic sea surface temperatures and type of sea ice found near ocean s surface sun angle as well as impact of multiple cloud layers is taken into account soil type vegetation type and soil moisture all determine how much radiation goes into warming and how much moisture is drawn up into adjacent atmosphere and thus it is important to parameterize their contribution to these processes within air quality models parameterizations take into account atmospheric emissions from multiple relatively tiny sources e g roads fields factories within specific grid boxes domains thumb 280px a cross section of atmosphere over terrain with a sigma coordinate representation shown mesoscale models divide atmosphere vertically using representations similar to one shown here alt a sigma coordinate system is shown lines of equal sigma values follow terrain at bottom and gradually smoothen towards top of atmosphere horizontal domain of a model is either global covering entire earth or regional covering only part of earth regional models also known as limited area models or lams allow for use of finer grid spacing than global models because available computational resources are focused on a specific area instead of being spread over globe this allows regional models to resolve explicitly smaller scale meteorological phenomena that cannot be represented on coarser grid of a global model regional models use a global model to specify conditions at edge of their domain boundary conditions in order to allow systems from outside regional model domain to move into its area uncertainty and errors within regional models are introduced by global model used for boundary conditions of edge of regional model as well as errors attributable to regional model itself coordinate systems horizontal coordinates horizontal position may be expressed directly in geographic coordinates latitude and longitude for global models or in a map projection planar coordinates for regional models german weather service is using for its global icon model icosahedral non hydrostatic global circulation model a grid based on a regular icosahedron basic cells in this grid are triangles instead of four corner cells in a traditional latitude longitude grid advantage is that different from a latitude longitude cells are everywhere on globe same size disadvantage is that equations in this non rectangular grid are more complicated vertical coordinates vertical coordinate is handled in various ways lewis fry richardson s 1922 model used geometric height as vertical coordinate later models substituted geometric coordinate with a pressure coordinate system in which geopotential heights of constant pressure surfaces become dependent variables greatly simplifying primitive equations this correlation between coordinate systems can be made since pressure decreases with height through earth s atmosphere first model used for operational forecasts single layer barotropic model used a single pressure coordinate at 500 millibar about level and thus was essentially two dimensional high resolution models also called mesoscale models such as weather research and forecasting model tend to use normalized pressure coordinates referred to as sigma coordinates this coordinate system receives its name from independent variable used to scale atmospheric pressures with respect to pressure at surface and in some cases also with pressure at top of domain model output statistics because forecast models based upon equations for atmospheric dynamics do not perfectly determine weather conditions statistical methods have been developed to attempt to correct forecasts statistical models were created based upon three dimensional fields produced by numerical weather models surface observations and climatological conditions for specific locations these statistical models are collectively referred to as model output statistics mos and were developed by national weather service for their suite of weather forecasting models in late 1960s model output statistics differ from perfect prog technique which assumes that output of numerical weather prediction guidance is perfect mos can correct for local effects that cannot be resolved by model due to insufficient grid resolution as well as model biases because mos is run after its respective global or regional model its production is known as post processing forecast parameters within mos include maximum and minimum temperatures percentage chance of rain within a several hour period precipitation amount expected chance that precipitation will be frozen in nature chance for thunderstorms cloudiness and surface winds ensembles thumb 280px top weather research and forecasting model wrf simulation of hurricane rita 2005 tracks bottom spread of nhc multi model ensemble forecast alt two images are shown top image provides three potential tracks that could have been taken by hurricane rita contours over coast of texas correspond to sea level air pressure predicted as storm passed bottom image shows an ensemble of track forecasts produced by different weather models for same hurricane in 1963 edward lorenz discovered chaotic nature of fluid dynamics equations involved in weather forecasting extremely small errors in temperature winds or other initial inputs given to numerical models will amplify and double every five days making it impossible for long range forecasts those made more than two weeks in advance to predict state of atmosphere with any degree of forecast skill furthermore existing observation networks have poor coverage in some regions for example over large bodies of water such as pacific ocean which introduces uncertainty into true initial state of atmosphere while a set of equations known as liouville equations exists to determine initial uncertainty in model initialization equations are too complex to run in real time even with use of supercomputers these uncertainties limit forecast model accuracy to about five or six days into future edward epstein recognized in 1969 that atmosphere could not be completely described with a single forecast run due to inherent uncertainty and proposed using an ensemble of stochastic monte carlo simulations to produce means and variances for state of atmosphere although this early example of an ensemble showed skill in 1974 cecil leith showed that they produced adequate forecasts only when ensemble probability distribution was a representative sample of probability distribution in atmosphere since 1990s ensemble forecasts have been used operationally as routine forecasts to account for stochastic nature of weather processes that is to resolve their inherent uncertainty this method involves analyzing multiple forecasts created with an individual forecast model by using different physical or varying initial conditions starting in 1992 with ensemble forecasts prepared by european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf and national centers for environmental prediction model ensemble forecasts have been used to help define forecast uncertainty and to extend window in which numerical weather forecasting is viable farther into future than otherwise possible ecmwf model ensemble prediction system uses singular vectors to simulate initial probability density while ncep ensemble global ensemble forecasting system uses a technique known as vector breeding uk met office runs global and regional ensemble forecasts where perturbations to initial conditions are produced using a kalman filter there are 24 ensemble members in met office global and regional ensemble prediction system in a single model based approach ensemble forecast is usually evaluated in terms of an average of individual forecasts concerning one forecast variable as well as degree of agreement between various forecasts within ensemble system as represented by their overall spread ensemble spread is diagnosed through tools such as spaghetti diagrams which show dispersion of one quantity on prognostic charts for specific time steps in future another tool where ensemble spread is used is a which shows dispersion in forecast of one quantity for one specific location it is common for ensemble spread to be too small to include weather that actually occurs which can lead to forecasters model uncertainty this problem becomes particularly severe for forecasts of weather about ten days in advance when ensemble spread is small and forecast solutions are consistent within multiple model runs forecasters perceive more confidence in ensemble mean and forecast in general despite this perception a spread skill relationship is often weak or not found as spread error correlations are normally less than 0 6 and only under special circumstances range between 0 6 0 7 relationship between ensemble spread and forecast skill varies substantially depending on such factors as forecast model and region for which forecast is made in same way that many forecasts from a single model can be used to form an ensemble multiple models may also be combined to produce an ensemble forecast this approach is called multi model ensemble forecasting and it has been shown to improve forecasts when compared to a single model based approach models within a multi model ensemble can be adjusted for their various biases which is a process known as forecasting this type of forecast significantly reduces errors in model output applications air quality modeling air quality forecasting attempts to predict when concentrations of pollutants will attain levels that are hazardous to public health concentration of pollutants in atmosphere is determined by their transport or mean velocity of movement through atmosphere their diffusion chemical transformation and ground deposition in addition to pollutant source and terrain information these models require data about state of fluid flow in atmosphere to determine its transport and diffusion meteorological conditions such as thermal inversions can prevent surface air from rising trapping pollutants near surface which makes accurate forecasts of such events crucial for air quality modeling urban air quality models require a very fine computational mesh requiring use of high resolution mesoscale weather models in spite of this quality of numerical weather guidance is main uncertainty in air quality forecasts climate modeling a general circulation model is a mathematical model that can be used in computer simulations of global circulation of a planetary atmosphere or ocean an atmospheric general circulation model is essentially same as a global numerical weather prediction model and some such as one used in uk unified model can be configured for both short term weather forecasts and longer term climate predictions along with sea ice and land surface components and oceanic are key components of global climate models and are widely applied for understanding climate and projecting climate change for aspects of climate change a range of man made chemical emission scenarios can be fed into climate models to see how an enhanced greenhouse effect would modify earth s climate versions designed for climate applications with time scales of decades to centuries were originally created in 1969 by manabe and kirk bryan at geophysical fluid dynamics laboratory in princeton new jersey when run for multiple decades computational limitations mean that models must use a coarse grid that leaves smaller scale interactions unresolved ocean surface modeling right thumb 280px noaa iii 120

of an ocean and ocean s upper layer is an important element in wave dynamics spectral wave transport equation is used to describe change in wave spectrum over changing topography it simulates wave generation wave movement propagation within a fluid wave shoaling refraction energy transfer between waves and wave dissipation since surface winds are primary forcing mechanism in spectral wave transport equation ocean wave models use information produced by numerical weather prediction models as inputs to determine how much energy is transferred from atmosphere into layer at surface of ocean along with dissipation of energy through whitecaps and resonance between waves surface winds from numerical weather models allow for more accurate predictions of state of sea surface tropical cyclone forecasting tropical cyclone forecasting also relies on data provided by numerical weather models three main classes of tropical cyclone guidance models exist statistical models are based on an analysis of storm behavior using climatology and correlate a storm s position and date to produce a forecast that is not based on physics of atmosphere at time dynamical models are numerical models that solve governing equations of fluid flow in atmosphere they are based on same principles as other limited area numerical weather prediction models but may include special computational techniques such as refined spatial domains that move along with cyclone models that use elements of both approaches are called statistical dynamical models in 1978 first hurricane tracking model based on atmospheric dynamics movable fine mesh mfm model began operating within field of tropical cyclone track forecasting despite ever improving dynamical model guidance which occurred with increased computational power it was not until 1980s when numerical weather prediction showed skill and until 1990s when it consistently outperformed statistical or simple dynamical models predictions of intensity of a tropical cyclone based on numerical weather prediction continue to be a challenge since statistical methods continue to show higher skill over dynamical guidance wildfire modeling thumb 280px right a simple wildfire propagation model on a molecular scale there are two main competing reaction processes involved in degradation of cellulose or wood fuels in wildfires when there is a low amount of moisture in a cellulose fiber of fuel occurs this process will generate intermediate gaseous products that will ultimately be source of combustion when moisture is present or when enough heat is being carried away from fiber charring occurs chemical kinetics of both reactions indicate that there is a point at which level of moisture is low enough and or heating rates high enough for combustion processes become self sufficient consequently changes in wind speed direction moisture temperature or lapse rate at different levels of atmosphere can have a significant impact on behavior and growth of a wildfire since wildfire acts as a heat source to atmospheric flow wildfire can modify local advection patterns introducing a feedback loop between fire and atmosphere a simplified two dimensional model for spread of wildfires that used convection to represent effects of wind and terrain as well as radiative heat transfer as dominant method of heat transport led to reaction diffusion systems of partial differential equations more complex models join numerical weather models or computational fluid dynamics models with a wildfire component which allow feedback effects between fire and atmosphere to be estimated additional complexity in latter class of models translates to a corresponding increase in their computer power requirements in fact a full three dimensional treatment of combustion via direct numerical simulation at scales relevant for atmospheric modeling is not currently practical because of excessive computational cost such a simulation would require numerical weather models have limited forecast skill at spatial resolutions under forcing complex wildfire models to parameterize fire in order to calculate how winds will be modified locally by wildfire and to use those modified winds to determine rate at which fire will spread locally although models such as los alamos solve for concentrations of fuel and oxygen computational grid cannot be fine enough to resolve combustion reaction so approximations must be made for temperature distribution within each grid cell as well as for combustion reaction rates themselves see also atmospheric
