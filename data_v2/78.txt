iowa class was a class of six fast battleships ordered by united states navy in 1939 and 1940 they were initially intended to intercept fast capital ships such as japanese while also being capable of serving in a traditional battle line alongside slower battleships and act as its fast wing hough pp 214 216 sumrall p 41 iowa class was designed to meet second london naval treaty s escalator clause limit of standard displacement four vessels and were completed two more and were laid down but canceled in 1945 and 1958 respectively before completion and both hulls were scrapped in 1958 1959 four iowa class ships were last battleships commissioned in us navy all older us battleships were decommissioned by 1947 and stricken from naval vessel registry nvr by 1963 between mid 1940s and early 1990s iowa class battleships fought in four major us wars in pacific theater of world war ii they served primarily as fast escorts for s of fast carrier task force and also shelled japanese positions during korean war battleships provided naval gunfire support ngfs for united nations forces and in 1968 new jersey shelled viet cong and vietnam people s army forces in vietnam war all four were reactivated and modernized at direction of congress in 1981 and armed with missiles during 1980s as part of 600 ship navy initiative during operation desert storm in 1991 missouri and wisconsin fired missiles and guns at iraqi targets costly to maintain battleships were decommissioned during post cold war draw down in early 1990s all four were initially removed from naval vessel register but united states congress compelled navy to reinstate two of them on grounds that existing ngfs would be inadequate for amphibious operations this resulted in a lengthy debate over whether battleships should have a role in modern navy ultimately all four ships were stricken from naval vessel register and released for donation to non profit organizations with transfer of iowa in 2012 all four are part of non profit maritime museums across us background vessels that eventually became iowa class battleships were born from us navy s war plan orange a pacific war plan against japan war planners anticipated that us fleet would engage and advance in central pacific with a long line of communication and logistics that would be vulnerable to high speed japanese cruisers chief concern was that us navy s traditional 21 knot battle line would be too slow to force these japanese task forces into battle while faster carriers and their cruiser escorts would be outmatched by japanese battlecruisers which had been upgraded in 1930s to fast battleships as a result us navy envisioned a fast detachment of battle line that could bring japanese fleet into battle even during development process of preceding and battleships designs that could achieve over 30 knots in order to counter threat of fast big gun ships were seriously considered garzke and dulin p p 307 at same time a special strike force consisting of fast battleships operating alongside carriers and destroyers was being envisaged such a force could operate independently in advance areas and act as scouts this concept eventually evolved into fast carrier task force though initially carriers were believed to be subordinate to battleship another factor was escalator clause of second london naval treaty which reverted gun caliber limit from to japan had refused to sign treaty and in particular refused to accept 14 inch gun caliber limit or 5 5 3 ratio of warship tonnage limits for britain united states and japan respectively this resulted in three treaty powers united states britain and france invoking escalator clause after april 1937 circulation of intelligence evidence in november 1937 of japanese capital ships violating naval treaties caused treaty powers to expand escalator clause in june 1938 which amended standard displacement limit of battleships from to friedman pp 307 09 design early studies work on what would eventually become iowa class battleship began on first studies in early 1938 at direction of admiral thomas c hart head of general board following planned invocation of escalator clause that would permit maximum standard capital ship displacement of using additional over previous designs studies included schemes for slow battleships that increased armament and protection as well as fast battleships capable of or more one of slow designs was an expanded south dakota class carrying either twelve 16 inch 45 caliber mark 6 guns or nine 48 guns and with more armor and a power plant large enough to drive larger ship through water at same 27 knot maximum speed as south dakotas while fast studies would result in iowa class slow design studies would eventually settle on twelve 16 inch guns and evolve into design for after all treaty restrictions were removed following start of world war ii friedman pp 309 311 priority was given to fast design in order to counter japan s 30 knot s whose higher speed advantage over existing u s battleships might let them penetrate u s cruisers thereby making it open season on u s supply ships for fast battleships one such design pursued by design division section of bureau of construction and repair was a cruiser killer beginning on 17 january 1938 under captain a j chantry group drew up plans for ships with twelve 16 inch and twenty guns panamax capability but otherwise unlimited displacement a top speed of and a range of when traveling at more economical speed of their plan fulfilled these requirements with a ship of standard displacement but chantry believed that more could be done if ship were to be this large with a displacement greater than that of most battleships its armor would have protected it only against weapons carried by heavy cruisers friedman p 309 three improved plans a b and c were designed at end of january an increase in draft vast additions to armor and substitution of twelve guns in secondary battery was common between three designs a was largest at standard and was only one to still carry twelve 16 inch guns in four triple turrets 3 gun turrets according to us navy it required to make b was smallest at standard like a it had a top speed of 32 5 knots but b only required to make this speed it also carried only nine 16 inch guns in three triple turrets c was similar but it added for a total of to make original requirement of 35 knots weight required for this and a longer belt compared with for b meant that ship was standard friedman p 310 design history in march 1938 general board followed recommendations of battleship design advisory board which was composed of naval architect william francis gibbs william hovgaard then president of new york shipbuilding john joseph w powell and long retired admiral and former chief of bureau of ordnance joseph strauss board requested an entirely new design study again focusing on increasing size of south dakota class first plans made for this indicated that was possible on a standard displacement of about could be bought with and a standard displacement of around which was well below london treaty s escalator clause maximum limit of friedman pp 271 309 these designs were able to convince general board that a reasonably well designed and balanced 33 knot fast battleship was possible within terms of escalator clause however further studies revealed major problems with estimates speed of ships meant that more freeboard would be needed both fore and amidships latter requiring an additional foot of armored freeboard along with this came associated weight in supporting these new strains structure of ship had to be reinforced and power plant enlarged to avoid a drop in speed in all about had to be added and large margin navy designers had previously thought they had roughly was suddenly vanishing friedman pp 309 10 draft of ships was also allowed to increase which enabled beam to narrow and thus reduced required power since lower beam to draft ratio reduces wave making resistance this also allowed ships to be shortened which reduced weight friedman pp 310 11 with additional displacement general board was incredulous that a tonnage increase of would allow only addition of over south dakotas rather than retaining 16 inch 45 caliber mark 6 guns used in south dakotas they ordered that preliminary design would have to include more powerful but significantly heavier 16 inch 50 caliber mark 2 guns left over from canceled s and battleships of early 1920s friedman pp 310 11 50 caliber gun weighed some more than 45 caliber did due to greater outside diameter of barrel barbette diameter also had to be increased from to so total weight gain was about putting ship at a total of well over 45 000 long ton limit an apparent savior appeared in a bureau of ordnance preliminary design for a turret that could carry 50 caliber guns while also fit in smaller barbette of 45 caliber gun turret other weight savings were achieved through thinning some armor elements and substituting construction steel with armor grade special treatment steel sts in certain areas net savings reduced preliminary design displacement to standard though margin remained tight this breakthrough was shown to general board as part of a series of designs on 2 june 1938 friedman p 311 however bureau of ordnance continued working on turret with larger barbette while bureau of construction and repair utilized smaller barbettes in contract design of new battleships as bureaus were independent of one another they did not realize that two plans could not go together until november 1938 when contract design was in final stages of refinement by this time ships could not use larger barbette as it would require extensive alterations to design and would result in substantial weight penalties general board was astounded one member asked head of bureau of ordnance if it had occurred to him that construction and repair would have wanted to know what turret his subordinates were working on as a matter of common sense a complete scrapping of plans was avoided only when designers within bureau of ordnance were able to design a new 50 caliber gun mark 7 that was both lighter and smaller in outside diameter this allowed it to be placed in a turret that would fit in smaller barbette redesigned 3 gun turret equipped as it was with mark 7 naval gun provided an overall weight saving of nearly to overall design of iowa class contract design displacement subsequently stood at standard and full load sumrall p p 240 in may 1938 united states congress passed second vinson act which mandated a 20 increase in strength of united states navy rogers fastest battleships act was sponsored by carl vinson a democratic congressman from georgia who was chairman of house naval affairs and armed services committee vinson congressional biography second vinson act updated provisions of vinson trammell act of 1934 and naval act of 1936 which had authorized construction of first american battleships in 17 years based on provisions of london naval treaty of 1930 this act was quickly signed by president franklin d roosevelt and provided funding to build iowa class each ship cost approximately us 100 million newhart p 92 as 1938 drew to a close contract design of iowas was nearly complete but it would continuously evolve as new york navy yard lead shipyard conducted final detail design these revisions included changing design of foremast replacing original 75 caliber guns that were to be used for anti aircraft aa work with 70 caliber oerlikon cannons and 56 caliber bofors guns and moving combat information center into armored hull stillwell p 16 additionally in november 1939 new york navy yard greatly modified internal subdivision of machinery rooms as tests had shown underwater protection in these rooms to be inadequate longitudinal subdivision of these rooms was doubled and result of this was clearly beneficial prospective effect of flooding was roughly halved and number of uptakes and hence of openings in third deck greatly reduced although changes meant extra weight and increasing beam by to this was no longer a major issue britain and france had renounced second london naval treaty soon after beginning of second world war friedman pp 313 14 design displacement was standard approximately 2 overweight when iowa and new jersey were laid down in june and september 1940 by time iowas were completed and commissioned in 1943 44 considerable increase in anti aircraft armament

48 dimensions of iowas was strongly influenced by speed when second vinson act was passed by united states congress in 1938 us navy moved quickly to develop a 45 000 ton standard battleship that would pass through wide panama canal drawing on a 1935 empirical formula for predicting a ship s maximum speed based on scale model studies in flumes of various hull forms and propellers and a newly developed empirical theorem that related waterline length to maximum beam navy drafted plans for a battleship class with a maximum beam of which when multiplied by 7 96 produced a waterline length of

combat displacement ships gm metacentric height was they also have excellent maneuverability in open water for their size while seakeeping is described as good but not outstanding in particular long fine bow and sudden widening of hull just in front of foremost turret contributed to ships being rather wet for their size this hull form also resulted in very intense spray formations which lead to

deform to absorb energy and several compartments were liquid loaded in order to disrupt gas bubble outer hull was intended to detonate a torpedo with outer two compartments absorbing shock and with any splinters or debris being stopped by lower armored belt and empty compartment behind it however navy discovered in caisson tests in 1939 that initial design for this torpedo defense system was actually less effective than previous design used on north carolinas due to rigidity of lower armor belt causing leakage into adjacent compartments to mitigate effects welded joint between lower armor belt and triple bottom was reinforced with and liquid loading system was altered so that two outermost compartments were filled while two inboard compartments were void spaces friedman p 285 garzke

pp 132 based on costly lessons in pacific theater concerns were raised about ability of armor on these battleships to withstand aerial bombing particularly high altitude bombing using armor piercing bombs developments such as norden bombsight further fueled these concerns while design of iowas was too far along to adequately address this issue experience in pacific theater eventually demonstrated that high altitude unguided bombing was ineffective against maneuvering warships garzke and dulin pp 141 aircraft 1943 69 when they were commissioned during world war ii iowa class battleships came

aircraft carrier task forces friedman p 390 there were a number of proposals in early cold war to convert class to take into account changes in technology and doctrine these included plans to equip class with nuclear missiles add aircraft capability and in case of illinois and kentucky a proposal to rebuild both as aircraft carriers instead of battleships initially iowa class was to consist of only four battleships with hull numbers bb 61 to bb 64 iowa new jersey missouri and wisconsin however changing priorities during world war ii resulted in battleship hull numbers bb 65 and bb 66 being reordered as illinois and kentucky respectively montana and ohio were reassigned to hull numbers bb 67 and bb 68 at time these two battleships were to be built a proposal was put forth to have them constructed as aircraft carriers rather than fast battleships plan called for ships to be rebuilt to include a flight deck and an armament suite similar to that placed aboard s that were at time under construction in united states ultimately nothing came of design proposal to rebuild these two ships as aircraft carriers and they were cleared for construction as fast battleships to conform to iowa

systems for talos and tartar missiles in addition to these upgrades of additional fuel oil was also suggested to serve in part as ballast for battleships and for use in refueling destroyers and cruisers due to estimated cost of overhaul 178 193 million this proposal was rejected as too expensive instead scb suggested a design with one talos one tartar one asroc and two regulus launchers and changes to superstructure at a cost of up to 85 million this design was later revised to accommodate polaris fleet ballistic missile which in turn resulted in a study of two schemes by scb in end none of these proposed conversions for battleships were ever authorized garzke p 210 interest in converting iowas into guided missile battleships began to deteriorate in 1960 because hulls were considered too old and conversion costs too high garzke p 212 nonetheless additional conversion proposals including one to install an spy 1 aegis combat system radar on battleships were suggested in 1962 1974

of reagan s 600 ship navy policy and as a counter to kirov class u s navy began reactivating four iowa class units and modernizing them for service thumb alt a large collection of ships sailing on sea

battleships carried tlam a also cited incorrectly as tlam n a tomahawk missile with a variable yield w80 nuclear warhead during their 1980s service with united states navy but owing to united states navy s policy of refusing to confirm or deny presence of nuclear weaponry aboard its ships these claims can not be conclusively proved between 2010 and 2013 u s withdrew bgm 109a leaving only conventional munitions packages for its tomahawk missile inventory owing to original 1938 design of battleships tomahawk missiles could not be fitted to iowa class unless battleships were rebuilt in such a way as to accommodate missile mounts that would be needed to store and launch tomahawks this realization prompted removal of anti aircraft guns previously installed on iowas and removal of four of each of battleships ten 5 inch 38 dp mounts mid and aft end of battleships were then rebuilt to accommodate missile magazines at one point nato sea sparrow was to be installed on reactivated
