thumb gregorian tower with dome of saint peter s basilica in background gregorian tower or tower of winds is a square tower and early modern observatory located above gallery of maps which connects villa belvedere with apostolic palace in vatican city tower was built between 1578 and 1580 to a design by bolognese architect ottaviano who was credited with building apostolic palace mainly to promote study of astronomy for gregorian calendar reform which was commissioned by pope gregory xiii and promulgated in 1582 it was then also known as tower of winds tower was also called specola astronomica vaticana a reference to vatican observatory four stages of progressive development have occurred since it was first established tower was an edifice of great value for astronomical observations made using a sundial as they provided essential confirmation of need to reform julian calendar early history thumb left 150px pope gregory xiii pope from 1572 to 1585 who established gregorian calendar and gregorian tower first stage of building of tower as recorded by leo xiii in his motu proprio ut mysticam of 1891 is credited to pope gregory xiii pope from 1572 to 1585 directive was to build a tower at a suitable location in vatican and equip it with greatest and best instruments of time design was effected after a series of meetings of experts who had been appointed to reform julian calendar in use since 45 bc to verify their proposed reforms fr christoph clavius a jesuit mathematician from roman college was expert on committee who suggested new system for observations tower was then built above museum and library flanked by belvedere and della pigna courtyards instrumentation for observation of sun rays falling over it consisted of a meridian line designed by ignazio danti of perugia it was in form of a circular marble plate in centre embellished with scientific designs tower still remains today but has undergone improvements over centuries second stage second stage of construction in 17th and 18th centuries when tower was under charge of vatican librarian involved mgr filippo luigi gilii a clergyman of st peter s basilica earlier in 1797 pius vi gave approval to placing a latin inscription specula vaticana at entrance to upper part of tower which was implemented by cardinal with plans to enhance instrumentation system in tower s observatory original observatory was then set up above second level of tower with agreement of pope pius vi its instrumentation apart from many normal devices such as meteorological and magnetic equipment with a seismograph and a small transit and pendulum clock was noted for telescope instrumentation facilitated recording of occurrences of eclipse appearance of comets satellites of jupiter and mercury s transit as an addition under patronage of pope pius x four rotary observatory domes were also added at strategic locations on long fortification walls more than a thousand years old mgr gilii highly respected as a polyglot with a knowledge of physics biology archeology and hebrew language was in charge of observatory from 1800 to 1821 he carried out continuous meteorological observations twice a day at 6 am and 2 pm conforming to programme of mannheim meteorological society while observation records for seven years were published balance data in a manuscript form was preserved in vatican library subsequent to gilii s death in 1821 observatory on tower was discontinued and instruments were moved to observatory at roman college established in 1787 it was considered more suitable for making observations than vatican third stage revival of observatory on gregorian tower was initiated by francesco denza with approval of pope leo xiii high quality instruments were procured partly with generous donations from hicks of london and automatic recording instruments were procured from richard in paris a four inch equatorial a three inch transit instrument and four pendulum clocks with two chronometers were also procured from observatory at modena in 1888 gift of a 16 inch long telescope to pope leo xiii became a part of observatory father denza joined observatory in 1889 after it was upgraded with more modern instruments same year a second tower was built some away from main gregorian tower overlooking vatican gardens behind st peter s basilica on south west border it was built to a diameter of with a lower wall thickness of which could bear load of a 13 inch photographic refractor newly procured from paris augustinian father rodriguez was expert meteorologist who held post of director from 1898 to 1905 in 1891 pope leo xiii promulgating motu proprio ut mysticam designated second tower as seat of newly established vatican observatory a decision which required altering roof to provide a flat terrace for astronomical observations fourth stage fourth stage involved remedying problem of communicating between two towers during time of pope pius x his plans were to make gregorian tower into a historical tower and to record and carry out observations at second tower by linking two towers along fortified wall with a iron bridge spanning gap at west end of this bridge a four inch equatorial was installed on semicircular bastion east end of bridge above barracks of gendarmes had a heliograph with a camera attached used to photograph sun a new 16 inch visual telescope called torre pio x was erected in second tower as a result of these modifications original library was moved to pontifical academy lincei and old meteorological and seismic instruments were shifted to valle di pompei observatory new astronomical library was housed in two rooms of building two new machines were used for recording on plates recorded observations were published along with explanatory notes together with last two series of atlas of stars charts were printed on silver bromide paper features tower had two floors and a mezzanine on first floor was famous sundial room or meridian room which was initially an open loggia pope urban viii had it enclosed and it was subsequently decorated with long sequences of frescoes painted between 1580 and 1582 by simon lagi and two flemish artists paul and matthijs today tower has paintings by niccolo and da siena sundial room also called meridian hall was once residence of queen christina of sweden then newly converted to catholicism room was further modified by two additions which gave it its current name a sundial and a delicate but sophisticated anemoscope which was fixed to ceiling of meridian hall these were created by ignazio danti papal cosmographer in association with gregorian calendar reform sundial consisted of a straight line in white marble running across floor in a north south direction intended to measure height of sun at noon according to seasons of year observations made with sundial provided essential confirmation of need to reform julian calendar anemoscope in contrast was a complex mechanism attached to ceiling which was used to measure strength and direction of wind but soon stopped functioning instrument may have led to other name of tower tower of winds however an ancient observatory at athens was also called tower of winds and might have been source for inspiration interior walls and ceiling of hall were richly decorated in some cases with gaudy frescoes of hills and roman countryside pantheons religious themes buildings surrounding area and naval shipwrecks with jesus calming storm and so forth see also vatican
