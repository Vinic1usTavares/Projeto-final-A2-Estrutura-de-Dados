thomas percy 8 november 1605 was a member of group of provincial english catholics who planned failed gunpowder plot of 1605 a tall physically impressive man little is known of his early life beyond his matriculation in 1579 at university of cambridge and his marriage in 1591 to martha wright in 1596 his second cousin once removed burke s peerage baronetage 106th ed burke s peerage ltd 1999 p 2120 henry percy 9th earl of northumberland appointed him constable of alnwick castle and made him responsible for percy family s northern estates he served earl in low countries in about 1600 1601 and in years before 1603 was his intermediary in a series of confidential communications with king james vi of scotland following james s accession to english throne in 1603 percy became disenchanted with new king who he supposed had reneged on his promises of toleration for english catholics his meeting in june 1603 with robert catesby a religious zealot similarly unimpressed with new royal dynasty led following year to his joining catesby s conspiracy to kill king and his ministers by blowing up house of lords with gunpowder percy helped fund group and secured leases to certain properties in london one of which was undercroft directly beneath house of lords in which gunpowder was finally placed conspirators also planned to instigate an uprising in midlands and to simultaneously kidnap james s daughter princess elizabeth percy was to remain in london and secure capture of her brother prince henry when plot was exposed early on 5 november 1605 percy immediately fled to midlands catching up with some of other conspirators en route to dunchurch in warwickshire their flight ended on border of staffordshire at holbeche house where they were besieged early on 8 november by pursuing sheriff of worcester and his men percy was reportedly killed by same musketball as catesby and was buried nearby his body was later exhumed and his head exhibited outside parliament in his youth percy was reportedly very wild more than ordinary and much given to fighting although his excesses were tempered somewhat by his conversion to catholicism he may have abandoned his first wife for another woman and was for a time imprisoned for killing a man during a border skirmish his membership of plot proved extremely damaging to his patron earl of northumberland who although uninvolved was imprisoned in tower of london until 1621 life before 1604 thomas percy was younger of two sons born to edward percy of beverley and his wife elizabeth nee waterton his father was a son of jocelyn josceline percy died 1532 whose father was henry percy 4th earl of northumberland he was born around 1560 and matriculated at university of cambridge as a member of peterhouse in 1579 little is known of his early life he may have been a papist before he was at some point received into catholic church and he may have sailed with george clifford 3rd earl of cumberland in 1589 in 1591 he married martha wright daughter of ursula wright a convicted recusant and sister to christopher and john wright both later involved in gunpowder plot claims by several authors that percy may have left martha mean and poor for an unidentified woman in warwickshire are disputed but two were at least estranged in 1605 martha and her daughter were living on an annuity funded by catholic william parker 4th baron monteagle thomas and martha s son robert married emma mead at wiveliscombe in somerset on 22 october 1615 percy was a tall physically impressive man of serious expression but with an attractive manner although by his forties he was prematurely greying he appears to have had some complaint with his clothing author alan haynes describes this as a skin disorder so acute that he could not endure any shirt but of finest holland or cambric although author and historian antonia fraser has written of his propensity to sweat so much that he changed his shirt twice a day thomas was great grandson of henry percy 4th earl of northumberland and second cousin once removed of 4th earl s descendant henry percy 9th earl of northumberland despite not being a close relative in 1595 9th earl made him responsible for collecting rents from his northern estates and following year appointed him constable of alnwick castle thomas exercised his authority in a manner which gave some cause for complaint not least from an officer he replaced and contemporary reports of his dealings with earl s tenants include claims of mismanagement and bribery during a border skirmish he killed james burne a scot for which he was imprisoned at a london gaol but his release was secured by intervention of robert devereux 2nd earl of essex thomas subsequently aided essex in a conspiracy against scottish warden of middle marches although unlike several others who later joined gunpowder plot he was not a member of earl s failed rebellion of 1601 percy has been variously described as a belligerent and eccentric man with surges of wild energy subsiding into sloth jesuit priest father john gerard wrote that in his youth percy had been very wild more than ordinary and much given to fighting while jesuit oswald tesimond thought he had been rather wild and given to gay life a man who relied much on his sword and personal courage according to both men percy s conversion to catholicism was a calming influence but biographer mark nicholls who calls percy a pugnacious character says that this was only true to a point his excesses did not prevent him from joining northumberland during his command in low countries held from 1600 1601 for which he was rewarded with ps200 earl also appointed percy his receiver of rents in cumberland and northumberland in 1603 henry percy was considered a supporter of catholic cause and on several occasions before 1603 suspecting that queen elizabeth i did not have long to live he entrusted thomas with delivery of secret correspondence to and from her probable successor king james vi of scotland northumberland s uncle had been executed for his involvement in rising of north a plot to replace elizabeth with james s mother mary queen of scots he planned to make up for his family s disgrace by building a strong relationship with james but also wished to counter influence of robert cecil 1st earl of salisbury whose father it was rumoured james believed had been responsible for mary s death exactly what assurances james gave percy are unknown tesimond wrote that he made very generous promises to favour catholics actively and he would admit them to every kind of honour and office but consensus among historians is that what promises james did make were oral rather than written fraser posits that scottish king probably intended to allow catholics to worship privately which if true was a much more reserved view than that subsequently announced by percy who told his fellow catholics that king had promised to protect their religion considering quaintness of james s spoken english there may have been some misunderstanding on both sides in his surviving correspondence with northumberland king writes only that neither would quiet catholics be disturbed nor would those that deserved recognition through their good service be overlooked this mixing of signals was to have lasting consequences plot thumb right alnwick castle by canaletto c 1760 percy became fifth member of gunpowder plot on sunday 20 may 1604 almost a year earlier he had called at robert catesby s home at ashby st ledgers and complained bitterly about james who since succeeding elizabeth had done little to fulfil his expectations he had threatened to kill new king with his own hands but was asked by catesby to restrain himself and told i am thinking of a most sure way and i will soon let thee know what it is thus percy found himself at duck and drake inn near strand in london along with catesby and his cousin thomas wintour john wright and guy fawkes his first words at meeting were shall we always gentlemen talk and never do anything all five later swore an oath of secrecy on a prayer book and then celebrated mass in another room with father gerard who was ignorant of their pact while plotters did not then have a detailed plan percy s appointment on 9 june as a gentleman pensioner gave him a reason to establish a london base through northumberland s agents dudley carleton and john he subleased a house in westminster from henry ferrers a tenant of john whynniard and installed fawkes there as his servant john johnson on 25 march 1605 percy also obtained lease for undercroft directly underneath first floor house of lords it was into this room that plotters moved 36 barrels of gunpowder from catesby s lodgings on opposite side of river thames plan was that during state opening of parliament at which king and his ministers would be present plotters would blow up house of lords killing all those within it james s daughter princess elizabeth would be captured during a midlands uprising and installed as a titular queen percy spent that autumn collecting northumberland s rents while catesby continued to enlist support by october 1605 he had 12 catholic men assigned to his cause and was at work on remaining details several conspirators expressed disquiet over safety of fellow catholics who might be caught in planned explosion percy s concern was for his patron northumberland who it seems might have been made lord protector if plot had succeeded lord monteagle s name was also mentioned by a worried francis tresham fate of elizabeth s brother prince henry was uncertain although plotters presumed that he would die with his father they decided that if he did not attend parliament percy should kidnap him monteagle letter on saturday 26 october at his house in hoxton monteagle received an anonymous letter that warned him to stay away from parliament uncertain of its meaning he delivered it to robert cecil 1st earl of salisbury cecil was already aware of certain stirrings although he did not then know exact nature of plot or who exactly was involved instead of informing king immediately he decided to wait and watch what happened catesby s reaction to news of letter s existence was somewhat different he and wintour suspected francis tresham was its author and two went to confront him tresham managed to convince them of his innocence all while urging them to abandon plot percy reacted to news by declaring that he was ready to abide uttermost trial he may have visited infant prince charles on 1 november indicating perhaps that some rearrangement of plan was being considered deposition of a servant claimed that percy visited prince s lodgings and made many enquiries as to way into his chamber although statement came too late for percy to comment on it percy visited northumberland at syon house west of london on 4 november fraser suggests that his visit was a fishing expedition to find out what if anything northumberland had heard about letter this expedition later proved disastrous for earl who claimed that there was nothing treasonable about their conversation and that percy had merely asked him whether he would command any service before leaving percy then went to another of northumberland s properties essex house in london and spoke with his nephew josceline later that evening he met with wintour john wright and robert keyes and assured them that all was well he then travelled to his lodgings along gray s inn road where he left orders for his horses to be made ready for an early departure next morning failure and death right thumb 300px alt a monochrome engraving of eight men in 17th century dress all have beards and

hinted at some strategem of fire and powder perhaps an explosion exceeding in violence one that killed his father lord darnley in 1567 following day privy council told him that they had decided to undertake a search of parliament both above and below first headed by thomas howard 1st earl of suffolk was made on 4 november in undercroft beneath house of lords he noticed a tall man who appeared to be a servant and a large pile of faggots far too large to serve small house percy had subleased from henry ferrers house s owner john whynniard told search party that its tenancy was held by percy monteagle present during search immediately told suffolk that he suspected percy was letter s author king ordered a second more thorough search to be made and at about midnight fawkes was discovered guarding gunpowder and was immediately arrested as fawkes identified himself as john johnson servant to thomas percy it was percy s name which appeared on government s first arrest warrant it described him as a tall florid man with a broad beard head more white then beard and stooping shoulders being also long footed small legged celebrated astrologer simon forman was employed to divine his whereabouts a rider was sent to look for him in northern england and a search was made of essex house all of this was in vain however as percy had been warned of fawkes s capture and had fled for midlands with christopher wright telling a servant as he went i am undone two men met catesby and others who had left for midlands uprising and continued on to dunchurch at one point throwing their cloaks off to increase their speed a relative of lieutenant of tower of london william waad encountered percy leaving london which led to waad writing following letter to salisbury on 5 november accompanied by some of his fellow conspirators percy s flight ended at about 10 00 pm on 7 november at holbeche house on staffordshire county boundary he was unharmed by a gunpowder accident that injured catesby and a few of others but those who remained resolved to wait for arrival of government forces who were only hours behind thus at 11 00 am following morning house was besieged by sheriff of worcester richard walsh and his company of 200 men in ensuing firefight percy and catesby were reportedly killed by same musket ball fired by a john streete of worcester news of battle soon reached london rendering superfluous a government proclamation made on same day and which offered a rich reward for his capture survivors were taken into custody and dead buried near holbeche but on orders of earl of northampton bodies of percy and catesby were exhumed and their heads displayed on spikes at side of parliament house with thomas dead there was nobody who could either implicate or clear henry percy of any involvement in plot his failure to ensure that thomas took oath of supremacy upon his appointment as a gentleman pensioner and their meeting on 4 november constituted damning evidence and privy council also suspected that had plot succeeded he would have been princess elizabeth s protector with insufficient evidence to convict him he was charged with contempt fined ps30 000 and
