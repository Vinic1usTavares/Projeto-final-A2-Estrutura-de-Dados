thumb upright 1 3 ba congress was called by draza mihailovic ba congress also known as saint sava congress or great people s congress was a meeting of representatives of draza mihailovic s chetnik movement between 25 and 28 january 1944 in village of ba in german occupied territory of serbia during world war ii congress aimed to advance a political alternative to november 1943 second session of communist led anti fascist council for national liberation of yugoslavia avnoj of yugoslav partisans second session of avnoj had resolved that post war yugoslavia would be a federal republic based on six constituent republics bosnia and herzegovina croatia macedonia montenegro serbia and slovenia with equal rights along with this resolution avnoj had asserted that it was sole legitimate government of yugoslavia and denied right of king peter ii to return from exile before a popular referendum to determine future of his rule in december major allied powers met at tehran and decided to provide their exclusive support to partisans and withdraw support from chetniks congress was held in circumstances where large parts of chetnik movement had been drawn into collaboration with occupying forces and it has been argued that congress was held with tacit approval of germans at congress a new political party was formed yugoslav democratic national union jdnz and pre war leader of small socialist party zivko topalovic was appointed as its chairman congress denounced decisions of avnoj as work of ustasha communist minority a continuation of existing chetnik propaganda that partisans and ustashas had united to exterminate serbs it also provided its full support to yugoslav government in exile chetniks and mihailovic s military leadership and re asserted chetnik movement s opposition to germans and all its allies it further resolved to mobilise all anti communist serbs to fight for survival of serbdom lastly it proposed its own vision for political and socio economic future of yugoslavia this political framework included a serb sovereign and a tripartite federal state with entities for serbs croats and slovenes only with serb unit being dominant this was reminiscent of homogenous serbia a document produced several years earlier by chetnik ideologue stevan moljevic principal outcome of congress was creation of jdnz a political party formed to unite all elements of chetnik movement it also resulted in a short period of reduced collaboration with germans and forces of puppet government of national salvation in german occupied territory of serbia however at this stage of war and with change in allied policy towards chetniks there was nothing that could be done to improve position of movement and mihailovic was dropped as a minister of government in exile soon after background thumb 300px map showing occupation and partition of yugoslavia 1941 43 dark and light grey areas on eastern border show extent of german occupied territory of serbia alt a coloured map showing partition of yugoslavia in april 1941 kingdom of yugoslavia was drawn into world war ii when germany and its allies invaded and occupied country which was then partitioned some yugoslav territory was annexed by its axis neighbors hungary bulgaria and italy germans engineered and supported creation of ustasha puppet state independent state of croatia ndh which roughly comprised most of pre war banovina croatia along with rest of present day bosnia and herzegovina and some adjacent territory before defeat king peter and his government went into exile reforming as western allied recognised yugoslav government in exile in london in june two resistance movements soon emerged in occupied yugoslavia almost exclusively ethnic serb and monarchist chetniks led by draza mihailovic and multi ethnic and communist led partisans under josip broz tito approaches of two resistance movements differed in important respects from beginning chetniks under mihailovic advocated a wait and see strategy of building up an organisation for a struggle which was to commence when western allies arrived in yugoslavia thereby limiting losses in military and civilian personnel alike until final phase of war on other hand partisans were implacably opposed to axis occupation and resisted consistently from beginning chetnik political agenda was a return to serb dominated yugoslavia of interwar period whereas partisans strove to create a social revolution in a multi ethnic but communist dominated yugoslavia during early years of war chetniks failed to articulate or promote a strong political agenda it is possible that mihailovic believed that he did not need to do so as he had been a representative of government in exile since january 1942 over a period of time and in different parts of country chetnik movement was progressively drawn into collaboration agreements first with forces of puppet government of national salvation in german occupied territory of serbia then with italians in occupied dalmatia and montenegro with some of ustasha forces in northern bosnia region of ndh and after italian capitulation in september 1943 with germans directly on 29 october 1943 adolf hitler had authorised german headquarters to utilise national anti communist forces to fight insurgencies in southeastern europe by end of year due to a drift towards collaboration government of national salvation and germans were at least as influential over chetnik movement in german occupied territory of serbia as mihailovic who was becoming increasingly isolated prelude thumb upright 1 3 left draza mihailovic centre with glasses confers with his political adviser dragisa vasic second from right and others by mid 1943 mihailovic had realised that he needed to broaden political appeal of chetnik movement reverses in montenegro and herzegovina had shown that chetnik political program was producing unsatisfactory results and western allies were concerned that chetnik movement was anti democratic or possibly even fascist veneer of democracy advanced by partisans was appealing to western allies and mihailovic was concerned about support he was receiving shifting to them in order to widen base of chetnik movement mihailovic contacted representatives of pre war political parties living in belgrade assuring them that former illiberal approach of movement as advocated by his close political advisers former republican and black hand adherent dragisa vasic and chetnik ideologue stevan moljevic had been replaced with a commitment to democracy politicians responded to mihailovic s approach positively as they were concerned about outcome of war and neither a communist nor chetnik military dictatorship appealed to them politician that appears to have taken lead in these negotiations was leader of small pre war socialist party zivko topalovic topalovic contacted members of pre war united opposition such as leader of independent democratic party adam pribicevic and leader of people s radical party aca stanojevic both pribicevic and stanojevic were only nominal leaders of their respective parties as real decision makers in their parties were with government in exile in london political parties agreed that they would negotiate with mihailovic as a group each party nominated two delegates to a coordinating council and council selected four negotiators led by topalovic who were to work out details of an agreement with chetnik leader these negotiations dragged on and there was one break of two months between discussions on chetnik side moljevic and his supporters suggested that politicians join chetnik movement which they considered apolitical but politicians refused to be absorbed in this way instead they demanded a new political grouping be formed of which chetnik movement would be just one part and that this new grouping would lay out a new program for future further demands were for a reaffirmation of yugoslav idea a parliamentary system and social reforms a federally organised country improved relationships with british and a new attempt at reconciliation with partisans preferably with help of allies despite fact that some amongst mihailovic s followers were against agreeing to politicians demands chetnik leader accepted them with proviso that politicians make a firm commitment to such an agreement politicians were loath to do this as if they signed any document it could be used against them by germans forcing them to leave belgrade and join mihailovic in field next step was calling of a congress to ratify new political structure and announce new program mihailovic advanced date of 1 december which was anniversary of founding of kingdom of serbs croats and slovenes kingdom of yugoslavia since 1929 in 1918 but politicians delayed preparations as they continued to negotiate and hesitate thumb second session of avnoj posed a serious political threat to chetniks pictured at jajce seated from left josip broz tito josip vidmar edvard josip rus and when it was finally held ba congress also known as saint sava congress or great people s congress was conducted in shadow of two threats which affected both chetniks and leaders of political parties in pre war yugoslavia who now supported them first of these was that partisans had widened their appeal by advancing idea of unity among yugoslav peoples as free and equal members of country this had attracted many people to their cause this approach was formalised by resolution of second session of anti fascist council for national liberation of yugoslavia avnoj in bosnian town of jajce in november 1943 which decided to create a federal yugoslavia based on six constituent republics with equal rights bosnia and herzegovina croatia macedonia montenegro serbia and slovenia along with this resolution avnoj asserted that it was sole legitimate government of yugoslavia and denied right of king peter to return from exile before a popular referendum to determine future of his rule western allies expressed no opposition to resolutions of avnoj and at tehran conference of 28 november to 1 december allies had agreed to throw their support behind partisans second threat was fact that from mid 1943 british who had primacy regarding allied policy in yugoslavia had began to doubt their decision to support mihailovic by december they had concluded that mihailovic s chetniks were more interested in collaborating with axis against partisans than in fighting axis in late 1943 partisans who had enjoyed considerable success in rest of yugoslavia in wake of september capitulation of italians had been stymied in an attempt to break into german occupied territory of serbia from neighboring occupied territories of montenegro sandzak and eastern bosnia german led operation that stopped partisan incursion operation included bulgarian and collaborating chetnik units while unsuccessful in destroying targeted partisan formations it did delay their entry into serbian territory chetniks took advantage of this delay which combined with relative protection afforded by armistice agreements they had made with germans in november gave them an opportunity to convoke ba congress as a striking political gesture aimed at addressing resolutions of avnoj and providing an alternative political vision for post war yugoslavia it was also conceived as a means of changing minds of allies but particularly us about decisions of tehran conference that withdrew support for chetnik movement another aim was to broaden political support for movement through a program that while remaining fiercely anti communist had enough democratic elements to have widespread support among population participants congress was organized by mihailovic and occurred between 25 and 28 january 1944 in village of ba near valjevo in german occupied territory of serbia approximately 300 civilians participated almost all of whom were serbs from serbia montenegro and bosnia together with two or three croats one slovene and one bosnian muslim non serb representation was effectively delegates from herzegovina and dalmatia were unable to attend in time delegates included principal chetnik commanders politicians who had joined chetnik cause at beginning such as vasic and moljevic representatives of old serb political parties who had decided to join with chetniks later on and others politicians included topalovic also in attendance were pribicevic a few croats one slovene and one bosnian muslim virtually all of pre war political parties were represented in some way excluding communists and fascist aligned groups this was first and only time during war that main chetnik commanders and closely aligned politicians met with chetnik supporters among pre war political parties chetnik old guard were originally opposed to involvement of recently aligned pre war politicians and according to mihailovic they were only included at his insistence mihailovic was also opposed to vasic have a significant role in congress because he and vasic were now regularly on opposing sides in discussions vasic was only included at topalovic s urging a significant number of younger chetnik leaders considered pre war politicians to be of poor quality and character and obstacles to political social and economic reforms after war given that germans could easily have prevented it from occurring or disrupted it once underway it has been argued that congress was held with tacit approval of germans thumb right american lieutenant george musulin who attended congress congress was also attended by lieutenant george musulin one of american office of strategic services oss officers attached to british mission to mihailovic largely at his own initiative he was only allied representative who attended on 8 december 1943 in wake of tehran conference decision british commander in chief of middle east general henry maitland wilson had sent a message to mihailovic asking him to attack two specific bridges on belgrade to salonika railway line this message was a test formulated by british to test mihailovic s intentions regarding resisting germans and was done with expectation that he would continue his inactivity against germans and not comply chief of british special operations executive soe mission to chetniks brigadier charles armstrong followed this up with written orders on 16 december directing mihailovic to carry out sabotage on two bridges by 29 december attacks were never carried out armstrong refused to participate in congress because of chetnik failure to carry out sabotage operations british prime minister winston churchill used mihailovic s refusal as an opportunity to tell king peter about tehran conference decision that allies would be backing tito exclusively and that mihailovic might have to be dismissed as a minister in government in exile discussions night before congress moljevic and long term chetnik supporters clashed with topalovic and politicians but mihailovic decided in favour of latter mihailovic made a personal address to congress pledging his loyalty to king to rule of law and to yugoslavia and repeatedly denied he had any tendencies towards dictatorship he also rejected idea of taking collective revenge against any nationality or political faction for crimes committed during war he forcefully refused to join drift into collaboration affecting much of chetnik movement at time of congress but his repeated denials about plans for a military dictatorship indicate an understandable lack of confidence from politicians in this regard mihailovic was not overtly involved in following discussions in common with political practice under period of royal dictatorship from 1929 congress formed a new political party yugoslav democratic national union jdnz and topalovic was appointed as its chairman despite very small size of socialist party before war topalovic was apparently chosen due to his links with two labour party members of churchill war ministry clement attlee and ernest bevin committee established for new party included a large number of serbs and montenegrins as well as three croats vladimir and niko bartulovic it also included a slovenian refugee anton krejci and a bosnian muslim mustafa mulalic among non serbs only mulalic was a pre war politician from yugoslav national party topalovic s election was a victory for moderates among delegates and constituted a setback for extremist greater serbia elements represented by vasic and moljevic which had dominated chetnik political program up to this point views on character of congress have varied between those with long standing ties to chetnik movement and those pre war politicians that had only recently come to support it both groups felt they had an equal stake in future of yugoslavia chetniks saw jdnz as expanded political wing of mihailovic s movement with mihailovic retaining all military and political power whereas topalovic saw chetniks as military arm under primacy of new party it quickly became clear that two sides could not easily agree on even procedural matters let alone on final resolutions topalovic proposed that bosnia should be a fourth federal unit but this was opposed by vasic and moljevic moljevic was also opposed to creation of jdnz and only wanted an expansion of existing chetnik central committee of which he was a long standing member during congress assembled representatives sent a message of solidarity to soviet union and joseph stalin resolutions after three days of debate congress made resolutions regarding both military and political matters firstly it denounced decisions of avnoj as work of ustasha communist minority in accordance with existing chetnik propaganda that partisans and ustashas had united to exterminate serbs it also provided its full support to yugoslav government in exile chetniks and mihailovic s military leadership claiming that mihailovic s chetniks were a truly national army it re asserted chetnik movement s opposition to germany and its allies and resolved to mobilise all anti communist serbs to fight for survival of serbdom lastly it proposed its own vision for political and socio economic future of yugoslavia congress denounced avnoj s change to constitutional organization of yugoslavia called on partisans to abandon political actions until end of war and adopted a high minded but somewhat imprecise resolution known as ba resolution principal document was called goals of ravna gora movement and came in two parts first part yugoslav goals of ravna gora movement stated that a restored and enlarged yugoslavia would be a national state of serbs croats and slovenes national minorities who were enemies of yugoslavia and serbs croats and slovenes would be expelled from yugoslav territory yugoslavia would be organised on a democratic basis as a federation consisting of three units serbia croatia and slovenia and all three peoples of yugoslavia would organise their own internal affairs as their representatives chose second part serbian goals of ravna gora movement stated that all serbian provinces would be united in serbian unit within federal arrangement based on solidarity between all serb regions of yugoslavia under a unicameral parliament congress also resolved that yugoslavia should be a constitutional monarchy headed by a serb sovereign congress also resolved that it would not form a government as avnoj had done and called upon partisans to follow democratic process according to historians radovan and milan main principle of programme of ba congress was social democratic yugoslavism they claim resolutions of ba congress were better founded culturally and historically than framework proposed by avnoj congress marked a change in chetnik main political objective instead of their earlier aim to restore centralised pre war kingdom they changed their approach towards a federal state structure with a dominant serb federal unit thumb left upright 1 5 a map showing extent of greater serbia in blue as envisaged by moljevic in homogeneous serbia by agreeing to resolutions of congress chetnik leadership sought to undermine partisan accusations that they were dedicated to a return to pre war serb hegemony and a greater serbia historian jozo tomasevich observes that in asserting need to gather all serbs into a single entity serbian goals of ravna gora movement was reminiscent of homogeneous serbia written by moljevic several years earlier which advocated a greater serbia he also notes that congress did not recognise macedonia and montenegro as separate nations and also implied that croatia and slovenia would effectively be appendages to serbian entity net effect of this according to tomasevich was that country would not only return to same serb dominated state it had been in during interwar period but would be worse than that particularly for croats he concludes that this outcome was to be expected given overwhelmingly serb makeup of congress historian marko attila hoare agrees that despite its superficial yugoslavism congress had clear greater serbia inclinations and historian lucien concludes that usage of term saint sava congress reinforced impression that it was focussed on aspirations of serbs rather than yugoslavs in general in terms of socio economic future of yugoslavia congress expressed an interest in reforming economic social and cultural position of country particularly regarding democratic ideals this was a significant departure from previous chetnik goals expressed earlier in war especially in terms of promoting democratic principles with some socialist features tomasevich observes that these new goals were probably more related to achieving propaganda objectives than reflecting actual intentions given that there was no real interest in considering needs of non serb peoples of yugoslavia it seems unlikely that chetnik movement was fully aware of radicalised mood amongst general population most important practical outcome of congress was creation of jdnz because all of representatives present agreed to avoid independent political action until conditions in yugoslavia were normalised existing chetnik central national committee was to be expanded to include representatives of all those that participated in congress selection of new central national committee members was delegated to an organisational committee of three comprising topalovic vasic and moljevic who were to consult with various leaders outcomes of congress meant that mihailovic now had endorsement of people s radical party democratic party independent democratic party agrarian party socialist party and republican party claims by chetnik adherents that this aspect of ba congress demonstrated overwhelming popular support for mihailovic are seriously flawed as they fail to recognise that pre war yugoslav political parties were not mass membership organisations and support from leaders in no way assured support from those that voted for various parties in most recent election in 1938 participants also hoped that resolutions would restore chetnik relationship with western allies particularly churchill government and british public aftermath thumb ss gruppenfuhrer and generalleutnant der polizei august meyszner received detailed reports on congress having not attended congress british had no first hand intelligence about discussions only in april did soe contact musulin and ask for a report having received it british were hesitant to accept new political program on its face value assessing that mihailovic s situation was increasingly desperate they were not keen to enable a late attempt to save what they already thought was a lost cause topalovic later acknowledged that congress was not as imposing nor as grand as its own propaganda and publicity given to it by its friends made it appear to be in may british mission to mihailovic was withdrawn following month mihailovic was dropped as a minister in yugoslav government in exile removing legitimacy he had enjoyed from this point he treated government in exile as his enemy and had to go on alone germans were very interested in congress and german agents provided a detailed account of it to higher ss and police leader in german occupied territory of serbia ss gruppenfuhrer and generalleutnant der polizei august meyszner these reports mentioned frequent anti german outbursts that had occurred germans were concerned about outcomes of congress and they may have had some limited consequences in military terms as formal armistice agreements between germans and chetniks ended soon after congress in practical terms despite mihailovic s opposition to slide towards collaboration co operation still continued forced by deteriorating situation for germans and their collaborators in occupied territory congress was followed by a significant deterioration in relationships between chetnik movement and collaborationist formations of government of national salvation in occupied serbia led by milan nedic yugoslav government in exile reported at beginning of march 1944 that in response to congress gestapo and serbian puppet government arrested 798 people in belgrade and held them in prison as hostages threatening to shoot 100 of them for each german soldier killed in serbia sasa ilic veliki kongres u selu ba 26 28 januar 1944 srbije i crne gore 1 2 2003 page 168 a number of mihailovic supporters including some of politicians were rounded up by germans as part of this sweep and at least one politician was executed a number of politicians who had accepted positions on new central national committee were forced to flee and seek mihailovic s protection during congress mihailovic mentioned to musulin that chetniks had picked up some american aircrew who had crashed near nis in southeastern serbia musulin saw this as an opportunity to extend his stay with chetniks and once they arrived at chetnik headquarters musulin contacted oss cairo to obtain approval to enlist chetnik assistance to evacuate them from occupied territory on 6 march he received approval to take this action musulin was supposed to depart on flight that extracted aircrew but delayed his departure due to illness but also because he wished to stay with chetniks and gather intelligence on 20 may he asked approval from oss cairo to remain but this was denied and he was extracted to italy on 28 may with rest of british mission to chetniks a new oss mission operation halyard arrived in august to utilise chetnik assistance in evacuating downed fliers from occupied serbia musulin was initially leader of operation halyard team when he departed in may musulin was accompanied by topalovic who led a diplomatic mission on behalf of mihailovic to try to reverse allied decision to abandon chetniks this effort was still born as british did not allow him to leave italy and would not reconsider their policy of supporting tito and partisans topalovic was replaced as chairman of central national committee by mihailo kujundzic who had a heart attack and died soon after he was replaced by moljevic new chairman had never reconciled himself with new political structure and railed against it especially as it failed to garner results for chetnik movement there remained a significant gap between those who had embraced new political structure and those that adhered to original chetnik ideology and this divide was carried over into post war emigre diaspora regardless of return of moljevic to fold pre war politicians remained in evidence and came into field to join mihailovic thumb left upright 1 3 king peter left in uniform and ivan subasic in italy in june 1944 central committee of jdnz had been selected by june consisting of six members one each for foreign affairs legislative affairs economic and fiscal affairs nationality questions and propaganda social affairs and economic construction central committee condemned new government in exile led by ivan subasic calling its members communist sympathisers and croat separatists it also appointed special representatives for chetnik movement overseas including konstantin in united states jovan in algiers bogoljub in uk general petar zivkovic in italy and mladen in egypt within german occupied territory of serbia at least chetnik movement took action to implement resolutions of congress corps commanders were ordered to modify administrative arrangements in their areas of responsibility and new ravna gora committees were established in each district and village to replace existing administration new district commanders were appointed assisted by treasurers and quartermasters decrees of expanded central national committee were made binding on all ravna gora committees and chetnik district commanders and they were only to take orders from executive committee of central national committee which was also responsible for all propaganda chetniks took over large parts of occupied serbia outside towns pushing administration of nedic government into margins central committee met again over period 20 23 july stating that it considered subasic government incapable of protecting interests of yugoslavia and king and reserving right to take whatever actions it considered necessary to look after yugoslavia s interests it was clear that mihailovic did not accept his removal from his position as minister in government in june when he was dismissed as chief of staff of supreme command in august he also did not accept this and continued to refer to chetniks as yugoslav army in homeland with himself as its chief central committee only met twice more between july 1944 and march 1945 in august several members of central committee including pribicevic vladimir and ivan kovac along with a senior chetnik commander major zvonimir were sent to join topalovic in italy their pleas for a change of policy towards chetniks were in vain mihailovic disestablished central committee just before he was forced to withdraw from serbia to northeast bosnia in mid september 1944 as he considered that he could only take fighting men with him regardless most of members of central committee accompanied him eventually mihailovic and moljevic fell out over relationship of chetnik movement with germans and moljevic resigned and was not replaced this was end of chetnik political organisation given form at ba despite being planned well before second session of avnoj was held ba congress was widely seen as a response to it congress was by far most important political event for mihailovic s chetniks during war regardless of internal changes wrought by congress it did not prevent western allies from breaking off contact with chetnik movement and there was no rapprochement with partisans given situation in yugoslavia in early 1944 combined with split between british and chetniks over latter s failure to resist germans congress did nothing to improve position of chetnik movement notes footnotes references category 1944 conferences category chetniks category political movements in yugoslavia
