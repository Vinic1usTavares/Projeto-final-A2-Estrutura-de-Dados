spinner shark carcharhinus brevipinna is a species of requiem shark in family carcharhinidae named for spinning leaps it makes as a part of its feeding strategy this species occurs in tropical and warm temperate waters worldwide except for in eastern pacific ocean it is found from coastal to offshore habitats to a depth of though it prefers shallow water spinner shark resembles a larger version of blacktip shark c limbatus with a slender body long snout and black marked fins this species can be distinguished from blacktip shark by first dorsal fin which has a different shape and is placed further back and by black tip on anal fin in adults only it attains a maximum length of spinner sharks are swift and gregarious predators that feed on a wide variety of small bony fishes and cephalopods when feeding on schools of forage fish they speed vertically through school while spinning on their axis erupting from water at end like other members of its family spinner shark is viviparous with females bearing litters of three to 20 young every other year young are born in shallow nursery areas near coast and are relatively fast growing this species is not usually dangerous to humans but may become belligerent when excited by food spinner sharks are valued by commercial fisheries across their range for their meat fins liver oil and skin they are also esteemed as strong fighters by recreational fishers international union for conservation of nature has assessed this species as near threatened worldwide and vulnerable off southeastern united states taxonomy and phylogeny spinner shark was originally described as carcharias aprion brevipinna by johannes peter muller and friedrich gustav jakob henle in their 1839 systematische beschreibung der plagiostomen based on mounted skin of a 79 cm long specimen collected off java this species was subsequently moved to genera aprion squalus and before being placed within genus carcharhinus bester c biological profiles spinner shark florida museum of natural history ichthyology department retrieved on may 7 2009 tooth shape and coloration of this species varies significantly with age and between geographical regions which caused much taxonomic confusion other common names include black tipped shark great blacktip shark shark large blacktip shark long nose grey shark longnose grey whaler and shark based on similarities in morphology tooth shape and behavior closest relatives of spinner shark were originally believed to be blacktip shark and graceful shark c amblyrhynchoides garrick j a f 1982 sharks of genus carcharhinus noaa technical report nmfs circ 445 however this interpretation was not supported by gavin naylor s 1992 allozyme analysis which suggested that these similarities are product of convergent evolution and that closest relative of spinner shark is copper shark c brachyurus in a 2007 ribosomal dna study spinner shark was found to be most genetically divergent of all requiem shark species examined save for tiger shark galeocerdo cuvier being less related to other carcharhinus species than lemon shark negaprion brevirostris distribution and habitat some uncertainty exists in distribution data for spinner shark due to confusion with blacktip shark in western atlantic ocean it occurs from north carolina to northern gulf of mexico including bahamas and cuba and from southern brazil to argentina in eastern atlantic it occurs from off north africa to namibia in indian ocean it is found from south africa and madagascar to red sea and gulf of aden to india and nearby islands to java and sumatra in pacific ocean it occurs off japan vietnam australia and possibly philippines evidence suggests that indian ocean spinner sharks have passed through suez canal into mediterranean sea becoming lessepsian migrants spinner shark has been reported from ocean surface to a depth of though it prefers water less than deep and occupies all levels of water column this species may be found from coastal waters to well offshore over continental and insular shelves juveniles have been known to enter bays but avoid brackish conditions northwest atlantic subpopulation is known to be migratory in spring and summer they are found in warm inshore waters and in winter they move south into deeper water description average spinner shark is long and weighs this species attains a maximum known length and weight of and indo pacific sharks are generally larger than those from northwest atlantic this species has a slim streamlined body with a distinctive long pointed snout eyes are small and circular prominent forward pointing furrows occur at corners of mouth tooth rows number 15 18 in each half of upper jaw and 14 17 in each half of lower jaw with two and one tiny symphysial central teeth respectively teeth have long narrow central cusps and are finely serrated in upper jaw and smooth in lower jaw five pairs of gill slits are long first dorsal fin is relatively small and usually originates behind free rear tip of pectoral fins no ridge exists between first and second dorsal fins pectoral fins are moderately short narrow and falcate sickle shaped body is densely covered with diamond shaped dermal denticles with seven rarely five shallow horizontal ridges coloration is gray above sometimes with a bronze sheen and white below with a faint white band on sides young individuals have unmarked fins tips of second dorsal fin pectoral fins anal fin and lower caudal fin lobe and sometimes other fins as well are black in larger individuals spinner shark differs from blacktip shark in that its first dorsal fin is slightly more triangular in shape and is placed further back on body adults can also be distinguished by black tip on anal fin biology and ecology spinner shark is a fast active swimmer that sometimes forms large schools segregated by age and sex young individuals prefer cooler water temperatures than adults off south africa females are found close to shore year round while males only appear during summer smaller spinner sharks may be preyed upon by larger sharks known parasites of spinner shark include copepods kroyeria nemesis and n atlantica which infest shark s gills which infests skin orientalis which infests mouth and gill arches and dentatus which infests nares and rear margins of fins feeding spinner sharks feed primarily on small bony fish including sardines herring anchovies sea catfish mullets bluefish tunas bonito croakers jacks mojarras and tongue soles they have also been known to eat stingrays cuttlefish squid and octopus groups of spinner sharks are often found pursuing schools of prey at high speed individual prey are seized and swallowed whole as this shark lacks cutting dentition this species employs an unusual tactic when feeding on schools of small fish shark charges vertically through school spinning on its axis with its mouth open and snapping all around it shark s momentum at end of these spiraling runs often carries it into air giving it its common name blacktip shark also performs this behavior though not as often off madagascar spinner sharks follow migrating schools of mackerel tunas and jacks like blacktip sharks they congregate around shrimp trawlers to feed on discarded bycatch and may be incited into feeding frenzies life history thumb left claspers external male copulatory parts of a young carcharhinus brevipinna like other requiem sharks spinner shark is viviparous adult females have a single functional ovary and two functional uteri each uterus is divided into compartments one for each embryo embryos are initially sustained by a yolk sac when embryo grows to around long supply of yolk has been exhausted and empty yolk sac develops into a placental connection through which mother provides nutrients for remainder of gestation this species has smallest ova relative to fully developed embryo of any viviparous shark known females give birth to three to 20 usually seven to 11 pups every other year after a gestation period of 11 15 months mating occurs from early spring to summer and parturition in august off north africa from april to may off south africa and from march to april in northwestern atlantic young are birthed in coastal nursery areas such as bays beaches and high salinity estuaries in water deeper than length at birth is in northwestern atlantic off tunisia and off south africa spinner sharks are relatively fast growing sharks per year for newborns per year for one year olds per year for adolescents and per year for adults in northwestern atlantic males mature at long and females at long corresponding to ages of 4 5 years and 7 8 years respectively off south africa males mature at and females at spinner sharks generally do not reproduce until they are 12 14 years old maximum lifespan has been estimated at 15 20 years or more human interactions thumb 240px spinner shark is valued by both commercial and recreational fisheries ordinarily spinner sharks do not pose a substantial danger to humans they do not perceive large mammals as prey as their small narrow teeth are adapted for grasping rather than cutting however they can become excited by presence of food so caution is warranted if this species is encountered while spearfishing as of 2008 international shark attack file listed 16 unprovoked attacks and one provoked attack attributable to spinner shark none of them fatal isaf statistics on attacking species of shark international shark attack file florida museum of natural history university of florida retrieved on may 7 2009 meat of spinner shark is of high quality and sold fresh or dried and salted in addition fins are used for shark fin soup in east asia liver oil is processed for vitamins and skin is made into leather products spinner sharks are an important catch of us commercial shark fisheries operating in northwestern atlantic and gulf of mexico meat is marketed under name blacktip shark in united states due to that species being considered superior in quality by consumers it is likely also caught by other fisheries across its range going unreported owing to confusion with blacktip shark spinner shark is also highly regarded by recreational fishers being described as a spectacular fighter that often leaps out of water iucn has assessed spinner shark as near threatened worldwide and vulnerable in northwest atlantic its frequent use of coastal habitats renders it vulnerable to human exploitation and habitat degradation northwest atlantic fishery for this species is managed under us national marine fisheries service 1999 fishery management plan for atlantic tunas swordfish and sharks for purposes of commercial quotas and recreational bag limits spinner shark is categorized as a large coastal shark references external links spinner shark carcharhinus brevipinna at fishbase spinner shark carcharhinus brevipinna at iucn red list
