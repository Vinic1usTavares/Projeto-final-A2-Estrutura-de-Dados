groups and journals procter never married she became unhealthy possibly due to her charity work and died of tuberculosis at age of 38 procter s literary career began when she was a teenager her poems were primarily published in charles dickens s periodicals household words and all year round and later published in book form her charity work and her conversion to roman catholicism appear to have strongly influenced her poetry which deals most commonly with such subjects as homelessness poverty and fallen women procter was favourite poet of queen victoria her poetry went through numerous editions in 19th century coventry patmore called her most popular poet of day after alfred lord tennyson her poems were set to music and made into hymns and were published in united states and germany as well as in england nonetheless by early 20th century her reputation had diminished and few modern critics have given her work attention those who have however argue that procter s work is significant in part for what it reveals about how victorian women expressed otherwise repressed feelings life adelaide anne procter was born at 25 bedford square in bloomsbury district of london on 30 october 1825 to poet bryan waller procter and his wife anne nee gregory 2004 family had strong literary ties novelist elizabeth gaskell enjoyed her visits to procter household gregory 1998 5 and procter s father was friends with poet leigh hunt essayist charles lamb and novelist charles dickens o gorman 2004 314 as well as being acquainted with poet william 2004 128 and critic william hazlitt hickok and woodall 1998 519 family friend bessie rayner belloc wrote in 1895 that everybody of any literary pretension whatever seemed to flow in and out of house dickens never seemed to be exactly visitors but to belong to place quoted in gregory 1999 5 author and actress fanny kemble wrote that young procter looks like a poet s child and a poet with a naturally thoughtful mournful expression for such a little child dickens spoke highly of procter s quick intelligence by his account young procter mastered without difficulty subjects to which she turned her attention when she was quite a young child she learnt with facility several of problems of euclid as she grew older she acquired french italian and german languages piano forte and drawing but as soon as she had completely vanquished difficulties of any one branch of study it was her way to lose interest in it and pass to another dickens 1866 3 a voracious reader procter was largely self taught though she studied at queen s college in harley street in 1850 college had been founded in 1848 by frederick maurice a christian socialist faculty included novelist charles kingsley composer john and writer henry morley

which her favourite passages were copied for her by her mother s hand before she herself could write as another little girl might have carried a doll procter published her first poem while still a teenager poem ministering angels appeared in heath s book of beauty in 1843 in 1853 she submitted work to dickens s household words under name mary berwick wishing that her work be judged on its own merits rather than in relation to dickens s friendship with her father dickens 1866 2 dickens did not learn berwick s identity till following year dickens 1866 1 poem s publication began procter s long association with dickens s periodicals in all procter published 73 poems in household words and 7 poems in all year round most of which were collected into her first two volumes of poetry both entitled legends and lyrics she was also published in good words and cornhill as well as writing poetry procter was editor of journal victoria regia which became showpiece of victoria press an explicitly feminist publishing venture chapman 2003 31 in 1851 bessie rayner parkes belloc gives date as 1849 dickens as 1851 in his introduction to 1866 edition of legends and lyrics introduction was read and approved by procter s mother gill gregory therefore argues that dickens s date is correct one gregory 1998 8 procter converted to roman catholicism following her conversion procter became extremely active in several charitable and feminist causes she became a member of langham place group which set out to improve conditions for women and was friends with feminists bessie rayner parkes later bessie rayner belloc and barbara leigh smith later barbara procter helped found english woman s journal in 1858 and in 1859 society for promotion of employment of women both of which focused on expanding women s economic and employment opportunities though on paper procter was merely one member among many fellow member jessie considered her to be animating spirit of society quoted in gregory 1998 27 her third volume of poetry a chaplet of verses 1861 was published for benefit of a catholic night refuge for women and children that had been founded in 1860 at providence row in east london gregory 1998 3 procter became engaged in 1858 according to a letter that her friend william makepeace thackeray wrote to his daughters that year identity of procter s fiance remains unknown and proposed marriage never took place gregory 1998 21 according to her german biographer ferdinand engagement seems to have lasted several years before being broken off by procter s fiance quoted in gregory 1998 24 critic gill gregory suggests that procter may have been a lesbian and in love with matilda hays a fellow member of society for promotion of employment of women gregory 1998 25 other critics have called procter s relationship with hays emotionally intense hoeckley 2007 123 procter s first volume of poetry legends and lyrics 1858 was dedicated to hays and that same year procter wrote a poem titled to m m h later published in legends and lyrics as a retrospect in which procter expresses love for hays hays was a novelist and translator of george sand and a controversial figure who dressed in men s clothes and had lived with sculptor harriet hosmer in rome earlier in 1850s while several men showed interest in her procter never married gregory 1998 24 procter fell ill in 1862 dickens and others have suggested that her illness was due to her extensive charity work which appears to have unduly taxed her strength dickens 1866 9 lennox 1911 an attempt to improve her health by taking a cure at malvern failed on 3 february 1864 procter died of tuberculosis having been bed ridden for almost a year gregory 1998 1 her death was described in press as a national calamity quoted in gray 1999 682 procter was buried in kensal green cemetery literary career procter s poetry was strongly influenced by her religious beliefs and charity work homelessness poverty and fallen women are frequent themes procter s prefaces to her volumes of poetry stress misery of conditions under which poor lived as do poems such as homeless poor in that very street at that same hour in bitter air and drifting sleet crouching in a doorway was a mother with her children shuddering at her feet she was silent who would hear her pleading men and beasts were housed but she must stay in great and pitiless city till dawning of winter day 51 58 quoted in gregory 1998 12 procter s catholicism also influenced her choice of images and symbols hoeckley 2007 127 procter often uses references to virgin mary for example to introduce secular and protestant readers to possibility that a heavenly order critiques victorian gender ideology s power structure procter wrote several poems about war majority of poems published on this topic in household words were by 2005 472 although she rarely deals directly with topic preferring to leave war in background something to be inferred rather than stated markovits 2005 473 generally these poems portray conflict as something that might unite a nation that had been divided by class distinctions according to critic gill gregory procter does not overtly ponder vexed question of poet particularly woman poet and her accession to fame gregory 1998 56 unlike many other women poets of time such as felicia hemans and letitia elizabeth landon procter is instead primarily concerned with working classes particularly working class women and with emotions of women antagonists which have not fully found expression gregory 1998 57 procter s work often embodies a victorian aesthetic of sentimentality mason 2006 82 86 but according to francis o gorman does so with peculiar strength procter employs emotional affect without simplification holding emotional energy in tension against complications and nuances procter s language is simple she expressed to a friend a morbid terror of being misunderstood and misinterpreted quoted in gregory 1998 66 and her poetry is marked by simplicity directness and clarity of expression gregory 1998 66 reputation procter was fabulously popular gray 1999 682 in mid 19th century she was queen victoria s favourite poet and coventry patmore stated that demand for her work was greater than that for any other poet excepting alfred lord tennyson readers valued procter s poems for their plainness of expression belloc 1895 173 although they were considered not so very original in thought their merit is that they are indeed utterances of a believing heart pouring out its fulness taylor 1868 163 procter herself expressed little ambition about her work her friend bessie raynor belloc thought that procter was pained that her reputation as a poet had outstripped her father s and quoted procter as saying that papa is a poet i only write verses belloc 1895 170 procter s popularity continued after her death first volume of legends and lyrics went through 19 editions by 1881 and second through 14 editions by same year many of her poems were made into 1911 or otherwise set to music among these was lost chord which arthur sullivan set to music in 1877 this song was most commercially successful of 1870s and 1880s in both britain and united states scott 2004 her work was also published in united states and translated into german by 1938 procter s reputation had fallen so far that a textbook could mention her poems only to pronounce them stupid trivial and not worthy of subject understanding poetry 1938 quoted in psomiades 2000 37 critics such as cheri larsen hoeckley kathleen hickok and natalie joy woodall argue that demise of procter s reputation is due at least in part to way charles dickens characterized her as a model middle class domestic angel hoeckley 2007 125 and a fragile and modest saint hickok and woodall 1998 520 rather than as an active feminist and strong poet emma mason argues that although dickens s portrayal of procter extinguished modern interest in her it also has helped rescue procter from kind of endless conjecture about her private life that has confused studies of women like letitia landon mason 2006 81 modern critics have given procter s work little attention few critics who have examined procter s poetry generally find it important for way that she overtly expresses conventional sentiments while covertly undermining them according to isobel armstrong procter s poetry like that of many 19th century women poets employs conventional ideas and modes of expression without necessarily espousing them in entirety armstrong 1996 251 265 francis o gorman cites a legend of provence as an example of a poem with this kind of double relationship with structures of gender politics it seems to affirm o gorman 2004 320 other critics since armstrong agree that procter s poetry while ladylike on surface shows signs of repressed emotions and desires hoeckley 2007 130 mason 2006 88 kirstie blair states that suppression of emotion in procter s work makes narrative poems all more powerful blair 2004 135 and gill gregory argues that procter s poetry often explores female sexuality in an unconventional way while as often voicing anxiety about sexual desires gregory 1996 89 elizabeth gray criticizes fact that few discussions of procter s poetry that do exist focus primarily on gender arguing that range and formal inventiveness
