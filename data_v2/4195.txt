budapest gambit or budapest defence is a chess opening that begins with moves 1 d4 nf6 2 c4 e5 despite an early debut in 1896 budapest gambit received attention from leading players only after a win as black by grandmaster milan vidmar over akiba rubinstein in 1918 it enjoyed a rise in popularity in early 1920s but nowadays is rarely played at top level it experiences a lower percentage of draws than other main lines but also a lower overall performance for black after 3 dxe5 black can try fajarowicz variation 3 ne4 which concentrates on rapid development of pieces but most common move is 3 ng4 with three main possibilities for white adler variation 4 nf3 sees white seeking a in with his pieces notably important d5 square alekhine variation 4 e4 gives white an important spatial advantage and a strong rubinstein variation 4 bf4 leads to an important choice for white after 4 nc6 5 nf3 bb4 between 6 nbd2 and 6 nc3 reply 6 nbd2 brings a positional game in which white enjoys and tries to break through on while 6 nc3 keeps advantage of a pawn at cost of a weakening of white black usually looks to have an aggressive game many lines can shock opponents that do not know theory or cripple white s pawn structure budapest gambit contains several specific strategic themes after 3 dxe5 ng4 there is a battle over white s extra pawn on e5 which black typically attacks with nc6 and after bc5 or bb4 qe7 while white often defends it with bf4 nf3 and sometimes qd5 in 4 nf3 variation game can evolve either with black attacking white s with manoeuvres of or with white attacking black s kingside with push f2 f4 in which case black reacts in centre against e3 pawn in numerous variations move c4 c5 allows white to gain space and to open prospects for his for black check bf8 b4 often allows rapid development history in a chess notes feature article edward winter showed that origins of this opening are not yet entirely elucidated edward winter budapest defence chess notes first known game with budapest gambit is adler maroczy played in budapest in 1896 this game already featured some key aspects of gambit such as active play for black pieces and white making typical mistake of moving queen too early as player of white pieces was not a strong player new opening went unnoticed apart from local experts who had witnessed game hungarians istvan abonyi zsigmond and gyula breyer further developed opening breyer played it in 1916 against dutch surgeon johannes esser in a small tournament in budapest austrian player josef emil played it against helmer in vienna in 1917 carl schlechter published an optimistic analysis of gambit in deutsche schachzeitung tseitlin 1992 p 2005 chapter 3 thumb 175px tartakower a practitioner of budapest gambit first use of opening against a world class player was at berlin in april 1918 a double round robin tournament with four players akiba rubinstein carl schlechter jacques mieses and milan vidmar vidmar had to play black in first round against rubinstein then ranked fourth best player in world with a very style at a loss for what to play he sought advice from his friend abonyi who showed him budapest gambit and main ideas hungarian players had found vidmar followed abonyi s advice and beat rubinstein convincingly in just 24 moves tseitlin 1992 p 7 this victory so heartened vidmar that he went on to win tournament while rubinstein was so demoralised by this defeat that he lost another game against mieses and drew a third one against schlechter in same opening moskalenko 2007 p 9 after this tournament gambit finally began to be taken seriously top players like savielly tartakower and siegbert tarrasch started to play it schlechter published in 1918 monograph die des which can be considered first book on this opening gambit reached its peak of popularity around five budapest gambits for every thousand games played around 1920 so much so that many white players adopted move order 1 d4 nf6 2 nf3 to avoid it oleinikov 2005 chapter 2007 p 28 leading exponents of 1 d4 started to look for reliable antidotes alexander alekhine showed how white could get a strong attack with 4 e4 in his games against ilya rabinovich baden baden 1925 and adolf seitz hastings 1925 26 but a few weeks later a on budapest gambit was held in budapest and result was 14 1 2 21 1 2 in black s favour another tournament in semmering same year saw alekhine losing to karl in his pet line with white against gambit so that e4 line had a mixed reputation meanwhile more positional plans were also developed for white rubinstein showed how white could get a small positional advantage with 4 bf4 nc6 5 nf3 bb4 6 nbd2 an assessment still valid today possibility 6 nc3 was also considered attractive as structural weaknesses were not valued as much as a material advantage of one pawn in those days by end of 1920s despite invention of highly original fajarowicz variation 3 ne4 in 1928 budapest gambit was considered theoretically dubious tseitlin 1992 p 9 this assessment was left unchanged for decades as few players at highest level used budapest gambit and information about games from lesser players could not easily be found during that time various responses were developed against 4 bf4 line these included 4 g5 invented by istvan abonyi further developed by masters and dolfi drimer master kaposztas showed that even when white succeeded in his positional plan it only meant for black a worse endgame with drawish tendencies white s plan involves pawn advances on queenside resulting in creation of a weak pawn for black then winning this weak pawn in this process all minor pieces and queenside pawns are likely to disappear so that white ends up in a better ending with four pawns on kingside against three for black and only major pieces this type of ending has drawish tendencies as kaposztas demonstrated in his games against budapest 1981 budapest 1974 or farago budapest 1975 all of them drawn two pawn sacrifices were also introduced in variation with 6 nbd2 still in 4 bf4 line based on pawn pushes d7 d6 or f7 f6 and a quick attack against b2 oleinikov 2005 chapter 6 budapest gambit saw a short lived revival in 1984 85 when chess informant included three games as many as in previous fifteen years all played at a high level of competition and all won by black oleinikov 2005 chapter 7 but white players found reinforcements and even invented a line with 4 e3 and 5 nh3 oleinikov 2005 chapter 8 in 21st century despite shakhriyar mamedyarov s successful efforts to rehabilitate line 4 bf4 g5 budapest gambit almost never appears at highest level oleinikov 2005 chapter 2007 p 10 its most recent appearance was when richard rapport defeated boris gelfand with black using opening in round 2 of 2014 tata steel chess competition for game score see this link performance in database of website chessgames com budapest gambit scores 28 9 black wins 44 1 white wins and 27 1 draws percentage of draws is especially low compared to mainstream alternatives such as 2 e6 43 7 draws or 2 g6 37 draws this opening gives more chance to win for both opponents although percentage of black wins is still lower than alternative 2 c5 in main line 3 dxe5 ng4 4 bf4 percentage of black wins already falls to 21 1 lower than main lines after 2 e6 or 2 g6 budapest gambit has never been widely used as black by top ten chessplayers richard reti used it five times in period 1919 26 when he was among ten best players in world but he scored only 1 1 2 points savielly tartakower used it four times in 1928 when he was eighth best player in world including thrice in one tournament bad kissingen 1928 but he scored only 1 2 point against world class opposition bogoljubov then ranked number four in world capablanca ranked number two and rubinstein ranked number seven rudolf spielmann used it thrice in 1922 23 when he was about number 9 12 in world with a win against euwe but defeats against yates and samisch nigel short played gambit twice in years 1992 93 when he was number 7 11 scoring only 1 2 points against karpov then ranked number two and ivanchuk then ranked number three recently mamedyarov used it twice in 2004 scoring 1 1 2 with a win against van wely when he was not already among top players and six times in 2008 when he was about number 6 14 he scored five points with wins against former world champion kramnik then ranked number three and grandmasters and eljanov but all six games took place in rapid or blitz events nicolas giffard summarises modern assessment of budapest gambit it is an old opening seldom used by champions without having fallen in disgrace while white has several methods to get a small advantage this defence is strategically sound black gets a good pawn structure and possibilities of attack on kingside his problems generally come from white pressure on d column and a lack of space to manoeuvre his pieces boris writes budapest gambit is almost a respectable opening i doubt there is a refutation even in lines where white manages to keep an extra pawn black always has a lot of play for it strategic and tactical themes white builds up an imposing pawn centre in alekhine variation white does not try to defend his e5 pawn and keep his material advantage but instead he concentrates on building an imposing pawn centre this brings him good prospects of a space advantage that may serve as a basis for a future attack on kingside however extended pawn centre has its drawbacks as lalic explains white must invest some valuable tempi in protecting his pawn structure which allows black to seize best squares for his minor pieces with excellent prospects for counterplay against white centre lalic 1998 p 9 hence in this variation black lets white build his pawn centre only to undermine it later a playing philosophy espoused in teachings of hypermodern school strategic themes are similar to ones that can be found in other openings like four pawns attack alekhine defence or grunfeld defence budapest rook budapest rook is a manoeuvre introduced by im dolfi drimer in 1968 moskalenko 2008 p 159 with which black develops a8 rook aggressively along sixth rank using moves a7 a5 and ra8 a6 h6 lalic 1998 p 12 for example this can happen in adler variation after move sequence 1 d4 nf6 2 c4 e5 3 dxe5 ng4 4 nf3 bc5 5 e3 nc6 6 be2 ngxe5 7 nxe5 nxe5 8 a3 a5 9 0 0 0 0 10 nc3 ra6 11 b3 rh6 rook is then used to support a piece attack against white s castled king lalic 1998 p 13 black can easily get several pieces around white king notably a rook to h6 a queen to h4 and a knight on g4 queen s arrival on h4 square is facilitated by absence of a white knight on f3 square that would otherwise cover h4 square and of a black knight on f6 square that would block way for black queen if white tries to defend with h2 h3 this may allow bc8 to be sacrificed at h3 in order to open h file bc5 may not seem particularly useful in this attack but by eyeing e3 it makes it difficult for white to play f4 to chase away black knight moskalenko 2008 p 162 furthermore attack on e3 is sometimes intensified with major pieces doubling on e file besides bc5 can sometimes be recycled to b8 h2 via bc5 a7 b8 to apply still more pressure on h2 it can also stay on a7 g1 diagonal to put pressure on f2 if white pushes e3 e4 at some stage budapest rook was an invigorating innovation of 1980s and gave gambit new life however inconveniences arise from delaying d7 d6 in order to allow lift light square bishop has to wait a long time to develop and any attack on bc5 is potentially annoying for black since it means either closing sixth rank with d6 b6 abandoning active a7 g1 diagonal or blocking rook when deployed to a7 this in addition to risk of awkwardness in king side a knight on f5 will fork rh6 and qh4 and single mindedness of black s plan with nothing to fall back on if direct attack is repelled has made some revisit old lines where it is instead king s rook that is developed to h6 queen s rook can then be retained on queenside and will be well placed if b file opens as a result of black s bc5 being exchanged and recaptured with a b6 pawn advantages of bb4 in most variations black has opportunity to play bb4 a move whose advisability depends on white s possible answers if white blocks check with nb1 c3 then black should capture knight only if white is forced to take back with pawn after which isolated doubled pawns are a positional advantage for black that fully compensates loss of bishop pair and even gambitted pawn due to its immunity to pawn attacks c5 square may be used by black as a stronghold for his pieces piece exchanges can be good for black even if he is a pawn down as he can hope to exploit crippled pawn structure in ending lalic 1998 p 10 on other hand if white can recapture with a piece trade on c3 typically concedes bishop pair for insufficient compensation if white is compelled to play nb1 d2 it is sometimes a minuscule positional concession as it makes it harder for this knight to reach its ideal square d5 moskalenko 2008 p 51 52 however if black is later compelled to exchange bxd2 that is advantageous to white who thereby gains bishop pair besides in some situations bb4 could be as misplaced as nd2 finally if white has to play bd2 then black should exchange bishops only if white is forced to recapture with nb1 as a recapture by qd1 would still allow nb1 to reach d5 square through nb1 c3 d5 for example in alekhine variation after 1 d4 nf6 2 c4 e5 3 dxe5 ng4 4 e4 nxe5 5 f4 ng6 6 nf3 move 6 bb4 see diagram is good because white has no good reply apart from 7 nc3 indeed 7 nbd2 just loses a pawn after 7 nxf4 whereas 7 bd2 qe7 causes white great problems both pawn f4 and e4 pawns are attacked and 8 results in a double attack against b2 and f4 tseitlin 1992 p 37 after 7 nc3 black can either answer with 7 bxc3 8 bxc3 or with 7 qf6 simultaneously attacking c3 and f4 another example is in game dory tartakower vienna 1928 when after initial opening sequence 1 d4 nf6 2 c4 e5 3 dxe5 ng4 4 e3 nxe5 5 nf3 answer 5 bb4 is bad because white can play 6 nbd2 to avoid exchange of bishops and gain a tempo later with a2 a3 with a small plus see tseitlin 1992 p 13 a third example is in adler variation after 1 d4 nf6 2 c4 e5 3 dxe5 ng4 4 nf3 when black should not play 4 bb4 because white can answer 5 nbd2 nc6 6 e3 ngxe5 7 nxe5 nxe5 8 a3 bxd2 9 qxd2 and white has better prospects he has bishop pair and he can develop his bc1 on influential a1 h8 diagonal see tseitlin 1992 p 69 pressure against e4 square and e3 pawn frame right pressure against e3 pawn in adler variation 3 ng4 4 nf3 after white has moved f2 f4 e3 pawn becomes a backward pawn on an open file black can then apply pressure on e file in general against e3 pawn and e4 square in particular typical moves in this plan would include manoeuvre ne5 d7 f6 followed by putting heavy pieces on e file with rf8 e8 and qd8 e7 see diagram lalic 1998 p 81 bc5 is already well placed to pressure e3 pawn depending on circumstances bc8 may be involved either on b7 or on f5 in both cases to assert control over central e4 square this plan is viable only if certain conditions are met d7 square must be available for ne5 so that it can later transfer to f6 white should also not be able to easily advance e3 pawn to e4 where it would be adequately defended by nc3 and a possible bf3 finally white should not have time to launch a quick attack on black s castled position with pawn thrust f4 f5 f6 breakthrough with c4 c5 push in main lines pawn push c4 c5 often brings positional gains to white in rubinstein variation 3 ng4 4 bf4 with 4 nc6 5 nf3 bb4 6 nbd2 qe7 7 a3 after 7 ngxe5 8 nxe5 nxe5 9 e3 bxd2 10 qxd2 see diagram white gets bishop pair and a space advantage in order to build up on these potential advantages most common plan is to perform a on queenside with goal of performing pawn advance c4 c5 in favourable conditions moskalenko 2008 p 54 this push can yield several advantages to white it enhances prospects of it creates a half open file to attack with rooks and it creates an isolated backward pawn on d6 after exchange for example in adjacent diagram after natural but mistaken 10 0 0 white can immediately realise his strategic goal with 11 c5 lalic 1998 p 32 then if black accepts temporary sacrifice after 11 qxc5 12 rc1 qd6 13 qxd6 cxd6 14 rd1 white gets his pawn back and has created a weak pawn in d7 while if black declines pawn he has difficulties in developing his queenside for example 11 d6 might be followed by 12 cxd6 qxd6 13 qxd6 cxd6 and pawn on d6 is weak therefore black generally tries to hinder c4 c5 push with moves like d7 d6 b7 b6 or rf8 d8 if this creates a hidden vis a vis between rd8 and qd2 similarly in rubinstein variation 3 ng4 4 bf4 with 4 nc6 5 nf3 bb4 6 nc3 after 6 bxc3 7 bxc3 white is saddled with doubled pawns in c3 and c4 that limit scope of his bishop pair hence push c4 c5 can be used to free light squared bishop and disrupt black s position lalic 1998 p 10 in adler variation 3 ng4 4 nf3 after 4 bc5 5 e3 nc6 6 be2 0 0 7 0 0 re8 8 nc3 ngxe5 9 b3 a5 10 bb2 nxf3 bxf3 ne5 12 be2 ra6 13 qd5 qe7 14 ne4 ba7 white has good reasons to push 15 c5 borik 1986 p tagnon berlin open 1984 this move would close diagonal of ba7 it would make it harder for black to develop bc8 as pawn pushes like b7 b6 or d7 d6 may be answered respectively by or cxd6 creating a weak pawn for black also prospects of be2 would be enhanced kieninger trap 1 d4 nf6 2 c4 e5 3 dxe5 ng4 4 bf4 nc6 5 nf3 bb4 6 nbd2 qe7 7 a3 ngxe5 8 axb4 nd3 kieninger trap is named after georg kieninger who used it in an offhand game against godai at vienna in 1925 borik 1986 p 24 it occurs in rubinstein variation 3 ng4 4 bf4 with 4 nc6 5 nf3 bb4 6 nbd2 qe7 7 a3 bb4 is attacked but black does not have to move it for moment and instead both regains gambit pawn and sets a with 7 ngxe5 see diagram superficially white seems to win a piece with 8 axb4 but that would be falling into kieninger trap because it would allow 8 nd3 mate chessbase contains 76 games where white has lost this way even after exchange 8 nxe5 nxe5 threat of nd3 mate remains and indirectly defends bb4 from capture a rare variant has also occurred in a in fajarowicz variation after moves 1 d4 nf6 2 c4 e5 3 dxe5 ne4 4 qc2 bb4 5 nd2 d5 6 exd6 bf5 7 qa4 nc6 8 a3 nc5 9 dxc7 qe7 when white trying to save his queen fell into 10 qd1 nd3 mate borik 1986 p leipzig olympiad 1960 adler variation 3 ng4 4 nf3 1 d4 nf6 2 c4 e5 3 dxe5 ng4 4 nf3 adler variation is named after game adler maroczy played at 1896 budapest tournament oleinikov chapter 5 white is ready to return e5 pawn in order to develop his pieces on their best squares i e d5 square for nb1 f3 square for ng1 and a1 h8 diagonal for bc1 black can try minor line 4 nc6 that delays development of its to develop it along a1 h8 diagonal instead of a3 f8 diagonal depending on circumstances but main line is 4 bc5 to attack f2 pawn forcing 5 e3 blocking in white s bishop on c1 so that after 5 nc6 white will not have enough pieces to protect his e5 pawn in long run placing bishop on c5 square also has subtler points as tseitlin explains tseitlin 1992 p first sight bishop on c5 lacks prospects being held at bay by pawn on e3 and is insecure in view of threat to exchange it by nc3 a4 e4 in reality posting bishop here has a deep strategic significance it holds up advance of e and f pawns assuming white bishop will go to b2 and thereby secures e5 as a future knight outpost which in turn restricts activity of both white s bishops as to exchanging threat bishop may conveniently retreat on a7 or f8 or even in some cases remain on c5 with support from a pawn on b6 an important theoretical decision for white is to choose whether to play a2 a3 while this move protects b4 square and threatens pawn advance b2 b4 it encourages black s rook lift ra8 a6 h6 as lalic puts it it was not so long ago that 8 a3 with obvious intention of expanding with b2 b4 was standard move however after black responds with logical a7 a5 it became apparent in tournament practice that inclusion of these moves is in fact in black s favour as it gives his queen s rook access into play via a6 square line 4 bc5 with a2 a3 1 d4 nf6 2 c4 e5 3 dxe5 ng4 4 nf3 bc5 5 e3 nc6 6 a3 opinion of move 6 a3 has gradually shifted from being main continuation to being a possible continuation then down to its present status of being considered a mistake threat to push b2 b4 must be taken seriously by black who typically answers 6 a5 but in 1980s it was discovered that push a7 a5 was actually a very useful one for black as it allows ra8 to be developed along sixth rank meanwhile push a2 a3 is less useful for white as he will not be able to easily push b2 b4 as tseitlin puts it point is that 6 a5 fits into plan of attacking white s kingside whereas 6 a3 does little in way of defending it tseitlin 1992 p 83 thus if white does not find a clear way to make good use of his move a2 a3 it may turn out to be a critical waste of tempo tseitlin 1992 p 2002 after topical moves 7 b3 0 0 8 bb2 re8 9 nc3 ngxe5 10 nxe5 nxe5 11 be2 black has regained invested pawn white has a space advantage in centre and can initiate pressure here or on queenside by pawn pushes like b3 b4 and c4 c5 possibly supported by a knight on d5 square meanwhile white king lacks defenders so black can start a pieces driven attack with 11 ra6 see section budapest rook stem game continued with 12 nd5 rh6 13 bd4 d6 14 ra2 bf5 15 bxc5 dxc5 and black won in 26 moves tseitlin 1992 p 87 to avoid such an unfavourable development white players have changed move order to keep bc1 on its original square as long as possible so that it can help defence thus typical move order became 7 b3 0 0 8 nc3 re8 9 be2 ngxe5 10 nxe5 nxe5 11 0 0 when 11 ra6 would be met with 12 nd5 rh6 13 e4 immediately attacking rook so black usually opts for 11 d6 forgetting about ra8 a6 h6 manoeuvre after 12 bb2 eco considers situation as favourable to white but tseitlin thinks black still has a lot of possibilities e g other rook lift re8 e6 h6 so that struggle still lies ahead tseitlin 1992 p 88 line 4 bc5 without a2 a3 1 d4 nf6 2 c4 e5 3 dxe5 ng4 4 nf3 bc5 5 e3 nc6 by refraining from advance a2 a3 white tries to gain a tempo on lines of previous section making it more difficult for black to initiate re8 e6 h6 or ra8 a6 h6 lifts after moves 6 be2 0 0 7 0 0 re8 8 nc3 ngxe5 9 nxe5 nxe5 white has tried two different plans older one sees white attack in centre with moves like b2 b3 bc1 b2 qd1 d5 nc3 e4 and c4 c5 white gets an important space advantage in centre but black can attack kingside with rook lifts after 10 b3 a5 white can try to capture bc5 with 11 na4 or 11 ne4 one point being that retreat 11 ba7 would lock ra8 because black has not played ra8 a6 already lalic still thinks 11 ba7 is right move after 11 ne4 due to importance of a7 g1 diagonal but black can also reroute bishop with 11 bf8 and white has no obvious path to even a minute advantage lalic 1998 p 79 after 11 na4 black can also simply react by 11 b6 when loss of bishop pair is compensated by semi open b file and improved control of central squares borik 1986 p 19 tseitlin considers that after exchange on c5 black has better position tseitlin 1992 p 78 hence main continuation is 11 bb2 keeping knight jumps for later then most common plan for black is a rook lift plan ra8 a6 h6 was tried in much commented game akesson tagnon berlin open 1984 black duly won but after game continuation 11 ra6 12 qd5 qe7 13 ne4 ba7 14 c5 rg6 15 bb8 16 f4 authors do not agree on which side had advantage borik and tseitlin both consider white to have a positional advantage with tseitlin recommending instead 15 nc6 with dangerous threats borik 1986 p 1992 p 80 however lalic writes of 15 bb8 it is true that bishop pair looks a bit pathetic lined up on back rank just now but there is no way to stop them breaking out later lalic 1998 p 76 second plan for white unveiled by spassky in 1990 aims at a kingside blitzkrieg with moves like kg1 h1 f2 f4 be2 d3 and qd1 h5 in original game black did not fathom white s idea so that after 10 kh1 a5 11 f4 nc6 12 bd3 d6 13 qh5 h6 14 black s pieces were ill placed to counter white s attack tseitlin 1992 p 132 a more principled plan for black is to react in centre specifically targeting backward e3 pawn and e4 square after 10 kh1 d6 11 f4 nd7 12 bd3 nf6 13 qf3 ng4 14 f5 and black has succeeded in inhibiting white s e3 e4 expansion lalic 1998 p minsk 1993 as black was doing fine with 11 f4 move order white has been searching for a new path with 10 kh1 d6 11 na4 b6 12 bd2 a5 13 nxc5 bxc5 14 f4 nd7 15 bf3 when jeremy silman prefers white silman 2002 white has even dared immediate 10 f4 nc6 11 bd3 when it is extremely dangerous for black to take offered e3 pawn as white gets a fierce kingside attack for free rubinstein variation 3 ng4 4 bf4 1 d4 nf6 2 c4 e5 3 dxe5 ng4 4 bf4 this move sequence is called rubinstein variation in reference to famous game rubinstein vidmar berlin 1918 when 4 bf4 was first employed moskalenko 2007 p 15 various authors consider this move to be most dangerous for black it aims to answer 4 bc5 with 5 e3 without blocking bc1 contrary to what happens in adler variation 4 nf3 another point is that in adler variation white faces risk of a strong attack against his kingside see section budapest rook while in 4 bf4 variation this is seldom case because bf4 is well placed to protect white s kingside on other hand early development of bishop means that white is more vulnerable to check bf8 b4 b2 pawn is not defended and in some rare cases bf4 can become subject to attack apart from sideline 4 g5 main line continues with both players developing their pieces around e5 pawn with 4 nc6 5 nf3 bb4 when white has an important choice between moves 6 nc3 and 6 nbd2 each leading to extremely different play with 6 nc3 white acquiesces to breakup of his queenside pawns in return for a material advantage of one pawn bishop pair and active play in centre with 6 nbd2 white gives back pawn to keep a healthy pawn structure and acquire bishop pair after 6 nbd2 qe7 white generally plays 7 a3 to force immediate exchange of bishop for knight gaining bishop pair a spatial advantage and chances for a minority attack on queenside white can also try 6 nbd2 qe7 7 e3 to win a tempo over 7 a3 variation though he may end up with exchange at d2 made in less favourable circumstances or not at all maverick gambit 6 f6 also exists tseitlin 1992 p 126 sideline 4 g5 1 d4 nf6 2 c4 e5 3 dxe5 ng4 4 bf4 g5 sideline 4 g5 was not well regarded at end of 20th century borik wrote that move 4 g5 creates irreparable weaknesses in black s camp see borik 1986 p 22 while tseitlin decided this extravagant tactical stroke weakens kingside and on general grounds alone cannot be good see tseitlin 1992 p 41 lalic warned that black should be aware of risks he is taking by playing such a line see lalic 1998 p 65 it weakens several squares particularly f5 and h5 as they cannot be covered by g pawn any more white can try to exploit these weaknesses with manoeuvres bf4 d2 c3 pressure along diagonal a1 h8 ng1 e2 g3 h5 pressure against squares f6 and g7 and h2 h4 to open h file nonetheless 4 g5 line has found new supporters in recent years thanks to black wins against both 5 bg3 and 5 bd2 for years reaction 5 bg3 was not well considered because retreat does not make most out of black s provocative fourth move as tseitlin points out bishop is in danger of staying out of play for a long time tseitlin 1992 p 41 but later lalic found that 5 bg3 was just as effective as 5 bd2 lalic 1998 p 65 black concentrates on capturing e5 pawn while white tries to get an advantage from weakening of black kingside after typical moves 5 bg7 6 nf3 nc6 7 nc3 ngxe5 8 nxe5 nxe5 9 e3 d6 lalic considers best try to be 10 c5 sacrificing a pawn to weaken black s control on e5 square and expose black king further white has also tried to quickly open h file with 7 h4 ngxe5 8 nxe5 nxe5 9 e3 but after 9 g4 black succeeds in keeping file closed lalic 1998 p buenos aires open 1995 alternative to 5 bg3 is 5 bd2 to place bishop on wide open diagonal a1 h8 after which white can expect a safe advantage then according to lalic delaying recapture with 5 bg7 6 bc3 nc6 7 e3 ngxe5 is not correct as white can gain an advantage by 8 h4 or 8 qh5 lalic 1998 p bartsch germany 1996 so immediate 5 nxe5 is better for some time 6 bc3 was well considered because black had problems dealing with various positional threats but correct way for black was found in 5 nxe5 6 bc3 qe7 7 e3 8 nf3 nbc6 9 be2 d6 10 nd4 bd7 11 b4 g4 with good counterplay for black on kingside lalic 1998 p bartsch cannes open 1995 white s efforts then switched to 6 nf3 to open e file something that black cannot really avoid as 6 bg7 7 nxe5 bxe5 8 bc3 would leave an advantage to white for example 8 qe7 9 bxe5 qxe5 10 nc3 d6 11 e3 and black is at a loss for an equalising line tseitlin 1992 p 47 white s advantage consisting in his ability to install his knight on strong d5 square and to attack weakened black s kingside with advance h2 h4 it is better for black to continue with 6 nxf3 7 when both 7 h5 and 7 bg7 would fail to 8 qe2 so black must try 7 d6 8 qe2 be6 instead line 6 nc3 1 d4 nf6 2 c4 e5 3 dxe5 ng4 4 bf4 nc6 5 nf3 bb4 6 nc3 this is only important line in budapest where black is not ensured of regaining his sacrificed pawn black does best to immediately exchange nc3 with 6 bxc3 7 bxc3 as otherwise white gets a small positional advantage simply by avoiding doubled pawns see section advantages of bb4 lalic 1998 p 1992 p 49 then black can put pressure on e5 pawn with 7 qe7 when white s only possibility to keep pawn is 8 qd5 white threatens to ease pressure with move h2 h3 that would force ng4 to unfavourable square h6 so black s only possibilities to sustain initiative are 8 qa3 and 8 f6 line 8 qa3 puts pressure on white queenside pawns pressure that may later be intensified with nf6 e4 black queen also gains access to a5 square from where it puts pressure on e1 a5 diagonal aimed towards white king after 9 rc1 f6 10 exf6 nxf6 11 qd2 d6 12 nd4 0 0 we reach position of famous game between rubinstein and vidmar when rubinstein erred with 13 e3 and later lost tseitlin 1992 p 7 after better 13 f3 correct method for black is to target c4 pawn with regrouping ne5 tseitlin 1992 p 55 hence lalic thinks 11 qd2 is inappropriate and gives black excellent counterplay and prefers 11 qd3 or even 11 qd1 after 11 qd3 0 0 12 g3 d6 13 bg2 black should switch to a materialistic mode with 13 lalic 1998 p seville 1992 in other line 8 f6 black does not want to decentralise his queen and prefers to concentrate on active piece play in centre after 9 exf6 nxf6 10 qd1 10 qd2 and 10 qd3 are all possible but each has its drawbacks on d1 queen is not developed on d3 it is exposed to bc8 f5 and on d2 it is exposed to nf6 e4 lalic considers 10 qd3 to be main move qualifies 10 qd1 as a respectable option but considers 10 qd2 as inaccurate meanwhile black will try to create counterplay by attacking either weak c4 pawn or kingside with g7 g5 and h7 h5 in both cases a key possibility is move nf6 e4 that knight attacks weak c3 pawn controls c5 square and supports g7 g5 thrust line 6 nbd2 qe7 7 a3 on way till 10 d6 1 d4 nf6 2 c4 e5 3 dxe5 ng4 4 bf4 nc6 5 nf3 bb4 6 nbd2 qe7 7 a3 bb4 is attacked but black can play 7 ngxe5 to get gambitted pawn back as 8 axb4 would allow kieninger trap 8 nd3 mate see section kieninger trap now white is more or less forced to exchange a pair of knights with 8 nxe5 nxe5 black threatens both c4 pawn and nf3 and 8 e3 nxf3 forces either 9 gxf3 with doubled pawns or 9 qxf3 bxd2 10 when white cannot castle any more white does not want to play 8 bxe5 either because it would cede bishop pair which is main source of white s hopes for an advantage in this line white still cannot win a piece with 9 axb4 nd3 or 9 bxe5 bxd2 10 qxd2 qxe5 so he usually plays 9 e3 in order to protect c4 pawn and defuse mating threat so that now black is obliged to move his bb4 as 9 bd6 would bishop and 9 would lose bishop to 10 b4 bb6 11 c5 black usually plays 9 bxd2 10 qxd2 note that for black sequence 7 ngxe5 8 nxe5 9 bxd2 is not only cunning but also best move order as another sequence would give white an early opportunity to realise advantageous c4 c5 push whose advantages are explained in section breakthrough with c4 c5 push for example after 7 bxd2 8 qxd2 ngxe5 9 nxe5 nxe5 white should not play usual 10 e3 but should strive for more with immediate 10 c5 as black cannot take in c5 without losing c7 pawn because of possibilities c1 and qd2 c3 see lalic 1998 p 33 after 10 qxd2 tseitlin explains that opening manuals assess this position as favourable to white on basis of bishop pair however considering closed nature of position white faces substantial difficulties in realisation of this nominal advantage tseitlin 1992 p 63 black has not a lot of things to be proud of as there are no targets in white s camp but can put up a lot of resistance thanks to small assets black s ne5 is strongly centralised attacks c4 pawn and restricts bf1 from moving to natural squares d3 and f3 moreover exchanging knight with bxe5 is not appealing for white since that would mean losing advantage of bishop pair also bc8 can sometimes become better than its counterpart bf1 if it makes it to good squares b7 or c6 while bf1 remains restricted by ne5 this explains most natural plans for both sides white will try a on queenside in order to increase its space advantage and to create some weaknesses in black pawns e g an isolated pawn or a backward pawn so white will try to use advances b2 b4 or c4 c5 in good conditions supported by queen and rooks on c file and d file on other hand black will try to keep position closed most importantly by keeping c4 pawn where it is in order to keep bf1 at bay this can be achieved by moves like b7 b6 and d7 d6 and sometimes manoeuvre ne5 d7 f8 e6 first move by black has to be 10 d6 because otherwise white plays 11 c5 and gets a clear advantage immediately for example 10 b6 loses a pawn to 11 qd5 nc6 12 bxc7 and 10 0 0 is bad because of 11 c5 qxc5 12 rc1 qe7 13 and white is winning already international master timothy taylor has suggested an alternative for black on move 9 he regards 9 bxd2 as inferior arguing that strong black bishop is traded for inoffensive knight and white gets long term advantage of two bishops in a semi open game taylor 2009 p 161 taylor instead advocates 9 bc5 when black stands well after 10 b4 bd4 11 exd4 nd3 11 rb1 d6 12 be2 bf5 13 rb3 ng6 14 bg3 14 exd4 nxf4 15 re3 wins 14 bxd6 cxd6 15 exd4 nf4 16 g3 wins

d6 white can try and has tried about any move that supports aforementioned plan in particular white has to choose if he wants to start active operations on queenside immediately e g rc1 qc3 c5 or if he wants to finish his development first with be2 and 0 0 immediate 11 c5 is a possible pawn sacrifice in order to open some diagonals for bishops as lalic points out after 11 dxc5 black s knight on e5 has lost its support and therefore all tactical motifs based on qd5 and bb5 must be carefully checked lalic 1998 p 36 white gets a powerful attack for his pawn but nothing decisive same idea can be tried with preparatory 11 rc1 and after 11 0 0 12 c5 dxc5 13 qd5 ng6 14 bg3 white should be reminded that he has not finished his development with 14 qf6 and a counter attack on b2 pawn tseitlin 1992 p 1998 p 37 playing black chose a different path with 11 b6 but his opponent nevertheless sacrificed pawn with 12 c5 bxc5 13 b4 0 0 14 bxc5 bb7 15 f3 and chose to destroy his own pawn structure with 15 dxc5 to activate his pieces and make use of d file lalic 1998 p 38 most popular move is 11 be2 where white delays his queenside play until he has achieved castling lalic 1998 p 38 it also gives black more time to organise a defence on queenside with b7 b6 either now or after 11 0 0 line 6 nbd2 qe7 7 e3 1 d4 nf6 2 c4 e5 3 dxe5 ng4 4 bf4 nc6 5 nf3 bb4 6 nbd2 qe7 7 e3 in this variation white tries to avoid move a2 a3 in order to gain a tempo over 7 a3 variation after standard moves 7 ngxe5 8 nxe5 nxe5 9 be2 followed by 10 0 0 it is black s last chance to exchange bb4 for nd2 game will take an entirely different structure depending on whether black gives up bishop pair or tries to keep it lalic thinks strategies in which black gives up bishop pair by exchanging its bb4 for nd2 for nothing are a mistake he does not like strategy to retreat bb4 in d6 either because they are too drawish he recommends strategy to retreat bishop in c5 and maintain its position there with help of a7 a5 pawn advance lalic 1998 p 30 black gives up bishop pair when black opts for 10 bxd2 he runs risk to end up a tempo down over 7 a3 variation and to be soon unable to meet white s positional threats on queenside white can avoid push a2 a3 and continue with standard plans of 7 a3 variation borik 1986 p 24 however everything is not that bad for black first to implement his plan white has to concentrate on development 9 be2 10 0 0 before he turns his attention to queenside that means black has more time to organise his play than in 7 a3 variation notably to attempt a blockade of c5 square moreover as white does not put immediate pressure on black s position black is not compelled to castle rapidly and he can keep his king in centre for a longer time or even castle queenside hence lalic note that white has not wasted time with a2 a3 but in fact it is not so easy to capitalise on this extra tempo lalic 1998 p 17 a possibility for black is to develop his light square bishop rapidly by prioritising moves b7 b6 and bc8 b7 over castling and d7 d6 game leningrad 1990 continued with 9 b6 10 0 0 bxd2 11 qxd2 bb7 12 c5 bxc5 13 qa5 d6 14 bxe5 dxe5 15 and moskalenko assesses this position as better for white moskalenko 2007 p 69 lalic suggests that 13 ng6 is an improvement lalic 1998 p 18 in game norwegian team championship 1991 after same 9 be2 b6 10 0 0 bxd2 11 qxd2 bb7 black introduced a highly original plan by avoiding natural advance d7 d6 and instead blocked a white c5 push by playing c5 himself game continued 12 qc3 f6 13 b4 c5 and lalic was deeply impressed by this plan which really spoils all of white s fun c4 pawn is never allowed to advance so that be2 is restricted bf4 is obstructed by ne5 that cannot be easily removed weakness of d7 pawn is not a worry as it can be protected by bb7 c6 if necessary black keeps bishop pair after 9 be2 0 0 10 0 0 black can avoid immediate exchange of his bb4 against nd2 in several ways first one resurrected and elaborated by grandmaster pavel is to exchange bb4 for bf4 this can be achieved via 10 ng6 11 bg3 11 bxc7 d6 loses a piece 11 bd6 12 bxd6 qxd6 white still has possibilities to play for an advantage due to his more advanced development his space advantage on queenside and possibility to install his knight on good square d5 taylor considers this black s best line stating that black has not given white bishop pair nor weakened his pawn structure and should be able to gradually equalize taylor 2009 p 154 other possibility for black is to keep his bb4 as long as possible exchanging it against white knight only in favourable circumstances a couple of attempts have been done with this in mind with subtle variations along moves a7 a5 b7 b6 and d7 d6 against mundane 10 d6 white can continue with 11 nb3 see diagram to play on queenside against exposed bb4 or 11 nb1 to recycle knight on ideal d5 square another idea is immediate 10 a5 to have d6 square for bishop inhibit b2 b4 push and have possible a5 a4 pawn advance if white knight moves to b3 in game bad 1995 black kept bishop with 11 nb3 a4 12 a3 bd6 13 nd4 bc5 14 nb5 d6 15 nc3 ng6 16 bg3 f5 and had dynamic play lalic 1998 p 27 gambits 5 nbd2 d6 and 6 nbd2 f6 with 4 bb4 5 nbd2 d6 see diagram black wants to open diagonal a1 h8 for his queen after 6 exd6 qf6 white can react to attack on his bf4 in several ways best one being 7 nh3 to develop a piece and protect both bf4 and f2 pawn it also helps that bf4 is still guarding nd2 so that after 7 qxb2 there is not threat of winning exchange 8 bxd2 would be answered by 9 bxd2 and white can repel black s attack with 8 rb1 qa3 9 rb3 qa5 10 dxc7 nc6 11 a3 be7 12 e3 lalic 1998 p berlin 1996 instead black must play energetically with 7 nxf2 8 kxf2 bxh3 9 g3 10 dxc7 nc6 11 and here lalic recommends 11 0 0 12 kg2 lalic 1998 p mohr ljubljana biti zagreb 1997 other gambit 4 nc6 5 nf3 bb4 6 nbd2 f6 7 exf6 is much riskier as black weakens his kingside and does not open a diagonal for his bc8 black tries to take advantage of fact white has moved his dark squared bishop away from queenside leaving b2 pawn without protection correct plan for white was shown by who played 8 e3 qxb2 9 be2 d6 10 0 0 0 0 11 nb3 qf6 12 c5 to open a2 g8 diagonal that was weakened precisely by gambit move 6 f6 move 11 nb3 is not only useful to support c4 c5 push but also to exchange knight against black s dark squared bishop after a possible a2 a3 forcing retreat bb4 c5 lalic 1998 p bosch la grande open 1996 as lalic puts it i doubt if black has a satisfactory answer to white s play in this game lalic 1998 p 49 alekhine variation 3 ng4 4 e4 1 d4 nf6 2 c4 e5 3 dxe5 ng4 4 e4 this variation is named after alekhine thanks to his wins in games alekhine baden baden 1925 and alekhine seitz hastings 1926 oleinikov chapter 4as cited by tseitlin p 21 alekhine himself stated this is considered with good reason to be white s best system against budapest gambit white hands pawn back but in return gains control of d5 over next few moves however he has to play with extreme precision since otherwise his central pawn position may become object of a successful attack by black white does not try to keep its material advantage e5 pawn and concentrates on establishing a strong pawn centre and space advantage a controversial point is whether typical black manoeuvre bf8 b4 is advantageous for black as it saddles white with doubled pawns or for white as it reinforces his centre lalic thinks both considering 6 bb4 to be a bad move after 4 nxe5 5 f4 nec6 6 nf3 lalic 1998 p 105 but a good one after 4 nxe5 5 f4 nec6 6 be3 lalic 1998 p 111 after 4 e4 main line is 4 nxe5 5 f4 when black has an important choice to make about where to move ne5 retreat to queenside with 5 nec6 is considered best borik 1986 p 47 citing ims harry and tom while retreat to kingside with 5 ng6 is probably playable borik 1986 p 46 taylor considers 4 nxe5 inferior recommending instead a rarely played idea of richard reti 4 h5 taylor s exclamation point then 5 nf3 would allow 5 bc5 while taylor suggests meeting 5 be2 with 5 nc6 and 5 f4 with 5 bc5 with quick development compensating for lost pawn he considers main line to be 4 h5 5 h3 nxe5 6 be3 bb4 with good play for black taylor 2009 p line 5 nec6 1 d4 nf6 2 c4 e5 3 dxe5 ng4 4 e4 nxe5 5 f4 nec6 knight on c6 is safer than on g6 and is well placed as part of a general strategy to control central dark squares it can go to d4 while other knight can go to c5 via a6 or d7 after 6 nf3 bc5 white has difficulties castling short because plan to exchange dark squared bishops with bd3 qe2 be3 can be met by bg4 nd4 to muddy waters borik 1986 p 47 as lalic points out lalic 1998 p can no longer castle kingside and will usually have to go other way however this is rather slow and gives black time to try to undermine white centre to this end bc8 g4 often comes in handy in order to pin white knight on f3 against white queen note that black should wait until his opponent has wasted a tempo with qe2 main continuation 6 be3 controls a7 g1 diagonal and is considered to be best reply lalic 1998 p 110 if black wants to contest c5 square for his bf8 he can try 6 na6 tseitlin 1992 p 118 but most games continue with 6 bb4 here best reply for white is controversial while borik does not express a preference alekhine considers 7 nc3 is much stronger than 7 nd2 for with knight threatening to jump to d5 black will sooner or later be forced to exchange his important dark squared bishop for it doubling of c pawns in these circumstances is not something white should fear tseitlin agrees stating that after 7 nd2 black has no difficulty at all see tseitlin 1992 pp 31 119 on other hand lalic thinks 7 nd2 is more accurate as white avoids doubled c pawns that are likely to occur after 7 nc3 and this knight can later be deployed via b3 square see lalic 1998 p 111 after 7 nc3 black has 7 qh4 8 g3 bxc3 9 bxc3 qe7 so that diagonal a8 h1 is weakened before black develops bc8 to b7 square queen on e7 square is well placed to pressure e4 pawn however as most of black s pieces are on queenside continuing with pawn pushes like f7 f5 is probably too weakening as alekhine demonstrated in his game against seitz in 1925 borik 1986 p 51 tseitlin 1992 p 119 so black does best to attack with pieces possibly with setup b6 nc5 bb7 0 0 0 borik 1986 p 53 in that case tseitlin considers that with a knight on c5 move d7 d6 should be avoided if black has to respond to capture bxc5 by dxc5 because white pawns in e4 and f4 would have too much leeway tseitlin 1992 p 33 after 7 nd2 qe7 8 a3 lalic considers 8 qxe4 should be avoided e g continuation 9 kf2 bxd2 10 qxd2 0 0 11 nf3 d6 12 re1 gives white several tempi against black queen lalic 1998 p g hofmann bled 1996 after better 8 bc5 9 bxc5 qxc5 10 qf3 lalic recommends 10 a5 lalic 1998 p 112 introduction of intermediate 7 qh4 8 g3 qe7 does not change lalic s opinion as after 9 bg2 na6 10 a3 bc5 11 bxc5 nxc5 12 b4 bishop was well placed on g2 and black experienced difficulties developing bc8 lalic 1998 p haas 1992 but lalic does not mention game pomar heidenfeld cited by borik in which black played advance a7 a5 to restrict white advance b2 b4 and achieved equality after 9 bg2 a5 10 na6 borik 1986 p 2008 p heidenfeld 1963 instead he recommends 7 d6 8 nf3 0 0 9 bd3 and now same development as in pomar s game lalic 1998 p 113 9 a5 and 10 na6 deserves attention when white s movements on queenside are more restricted and black knight will be able to settle on c5 square without being kicked by thematic b2 b4 it may appear that we have reached same position elaborated in previous games a tempo down for black since he has committed his bishop to b4 and will later drop back to c5 square instead of heading there at once however white knight is less actively placed on d2 and in fact this fully compensates black for slight loss of time line 5 ng6 1 d4 nf6 2 c4 e5 3 dxe5 ng4 4 e4 nxe5 5 f4 ng6 knight on g6 puts f4 pawn under pressure but may be embarrassed later by pawn thrust f4 f5 now 6 a3 an attempt to deny squares from bf8 by continuing with b2 b4 or bc1 e3 does not achieve its goal after 6 bc5 7 b4 8 0 0 9 qf3 d6 10 g4 a5 11 b5 nd7 12 ra2 nc5 when black s superior pawn structure and well positioned nc5 gives him advantage lalic 1998 p correspondence 1955 that leaves white with choice between 6 nf3 and 6 be3 move 6 nf3 controls e5 square in order to prepare push f4 f5 unlike after 5 nec6 white does not have to fear 6 bc5 which encounters difficulties after 7 f5 nh4 8 ng5 when black knight is already in danger of being lost to qd1 g4 or qd1 h5 borik 1986 p 43 tseitlin 1992 p wrongly attributes black pieces to seitz in his book while tseitlin and lalic rightly note black player was actually rabinovich instead black must react quickly with 6 bb4 7 nc3 when he can adopt a normal setup with d6 0 0 nc6 b6 or act boldly with 7 qf6 threatening both nc3 and f4 pawn borik 1986 p isayev ussr 1948 one point in favour of 7 qf6 is that after 8 e5 black queen prevents white from castling short and is well placed if white castles long tseitlin 1992 p 39 move 6 be3 takes a7 g1 diagonal from black s bf8 and may in some lines prepare long castle after mandatory 6 bb4 white can opt for 7 nd2 to avoid having doubled pawns but he must be prepared to sacrifice a pawn after 7 qe7 8 kf2 bxd2 9 qxd2 qxe4 10 bd3 with piece activity for pawn deficit lalic 1998 p 120 because normal defence 8 bd3 runs into 8 qd6 and both bd3 and f4 pawn are attacked lalic 1998 p dunnington white does not need however bother too much about doubled pawns and after 7 nc3 bxc3 8 bxc3 a peaceful black player might choose quiet 8 b6 followed by a normal development with d6 0 0 bb7 nd7 re8 nc5 instead of 8 b6 a more adventurous black player could choose 8 qe7 9 bd3 f5 as indicated by borik tseitlin and lalic tseitlin 1992 p 1998 p 122 but in his more recent book moskalenko thinks this move complicates game too much moskalenko 2008 p kiev 2007 if black player is neither peaceful nor aggressive lalic proposes an alternative with 8 qe7 9 bd3 0 0 10 qd2 and only now that black has his king safe shall he unleash 10 f5 when it is not so easy for white to meet 10 f5 as two main responses 11 e5 and 11 allow black promising chances with 11 d6 and 11 nxf4 respectively fajarowicz variation 3 ne4 1 d4 nf6 2 c4 e5 3 dxe5 ne4 fajarowicz variation is said to have its origins in chess circles from leipzig with first important game being h steiner fajarowicz at 1928 wiesbaden tournament borik 1986 p 1992 p 89 in this variation black makes no immediate effort to regain gambit pawn preferring to concentrate on active piece play and tactical tricks these tactical pitfalls include notably a bb4 at an annoying moment a qf6 with a double attack on b2 and f2 after 1 d6 2 exd6 bxd6 pseudo sacrifice 3 nxf2 4 kxf2 bg3 and 5 qxd1 winning white s queen for two minor pieces and a concerted attack on d3 square with setup nc5 bf5 once white has played e3 move 4 a3 allows white to avoid annoying bishop check on b4 also annoying knight jump to b4 and prepares qc2 to undermine black s knight both lalic and de firmian consider it to be white s best move lalic calls it undoubtedly most critical line lalic 1998 p 132 with de firmian assessing it as leading to a large advantage for white lalic considers 4 b6 to be best answer one point being that qd1 c2 so effective in most of other lines can be met by bc8 b7 after 5 nd2 bb7 6 qc2 lalic gives 6 nxd2 7 bxd2 a5 when black bishops will be excellently placed on b7 and c5 squares lalic 1998 p 139 lalic recommends 6 nf3 instead lalic 1998 p perez olivos 1993 while de firmian continues by 5 nf3 bb7 6 nbd2 qe7 7 qc2 with a large advantage for white move 4 nf3 develops a piece and covers sensitive d2 square after 4 bb4 5 nbd2 nc6 6 a3 black can easily get confused by move order natural 6 nxd2 7 bxd2 bxd2 8 qxd2 qe7 9 qc3 transposes in same position as after 5 bd2 but white can also try 6 nxd2 7 axb4 nxf3 8 gxf3 nxe5 9 qe7 10 with a strong initiative lalic 1998 p starke correspondence 1991 white can even retain his bishop with 6 nxd2 7 nxd2 and now borik recommends 7 bf8 with difficult play for black as he is not certain to gain his pawn back borik 1986 p 91 to avoid these possibilities lalic advises move order 6 bxd2 7 bxd2 nxd2 8 qxd2 qe7 but does not mention possibility of white answering 6 bxd2 with 7 nxd2 a possible improvement for black after 4 bb4 5 nbd2 would be 5 d5 with compensation for pawn in all lines tseitlin 1992 p 96 line 4 qc2 immediately attacks ne4 as a retreat by black would effectively surrender his temporary lead in development which is compensation for sacrificed pawn black must continue to develop while trying to keep ne4 on its square but that is by no means easy borik thinks 4 qc2 is move that gives black most problems to solve borik 1986 p 68 but lalic does not agree at all stating that reply 4 bb4 followed by d7 d5 ensures black a rapid development and plenty of counterplay it is for this reason that 4 qc2 is not on danger list lalic 1998 p 152 reply 4 bb4 see diagram pins white pieces before deciding what to do with ne4 white cannot reply 5 bd2 as he would lose bishop pair and black would easily regain e5 pawn with nc6 qe7 0 0 re8 after 5 nd2 this knight would be misplaced and would block bc1 so black could open game with 5 d5 in favourable circumstances best for white is 5 nc3 d5 6 exd6 bf5 7 bd2 8 e4 bxc3 9 bxc3 when black has regained his pawn but white has bishop pair and possibilities of an attack on kingside borik 1986 p 84 other possibilities line 3 ng4 4 e3 1 d4 nf6 2 c4 e5 3 dxe5 ng4 4 e3 apart from main lines 4 bf4 4 nf3 and 4 e4 only significant other fourth move is 4 e3 to continue by 4 nxe5 5 nh3 or other move order 4 nh3 and 5 e3 so that white knight starts journey ng1 h3 f4 d5 reach its ideal d5 square according to tseitlin this idea first occurred in game vilnius 1986 idea with 4 e3 and 5 nh3 was favourite of a leading soviet coach and writer mikhail who wrote in his 1994 book soviet chess conveyor that line was first shown to him by a strong correspondence player donatas black has tried to prevent white s idea by suitably strange looking move 5 ng6 taking f4 square from nh3 then white can develop along various setups most active being 6 qh5 with possibility nh3 g5 in store to recycle knight towards a more central position lalic 1998 p de la villa 1987 black can also ignore white s intentions and concentrate on his own play by placing on c5 in order to put pressure on d3 square after 5 g6 6 nf4 bg7 7 be2 0 0 8 0 0 d6 9 nc3 nbd7 10 qd2 a5 11 b3 nc5 position of black s knights is secured and black s position is similar to leningrad variation of dutch defence once he has played f7 f5 lalic 1998 p 98 gurieli highlands minsk 1988 white has no reason however to abandon a1 h8 diagonal to black and he can try 5 g6 6 bd2 d6 7 nf4 bg7 8 bc3 0 0 9 be2 nbd7 10 nd2 b6 and in one game white gained a minimal edge lalic 1998 p pavlenko ashkhabad 1990 other fourth moves after 3 ng4 a few other lines have been tried with outcome varying from an immediate equality to a clear advantage for black cooling 4 e6 avoids complications and heads for an equal endgame with 4 dxe6 5 qxd8 kxd8 black s loss of right to castle being of no great importance since queens have been traded if black wants to avoid this early endgame he can try 4 bb4 5 nc3 bxc3 6 bxc3 dxe6 and now exchange of queens would give a plus to black as white queenside pawns are isolated and doubled lalic 1998 p helsingborg 1991 greedy 4 f4 is weak because white neglects his development and weakens a7 g1 diagonal lalic 1998 p simonenko ashkhabad 1986 p 1992 p 111 black can immediately exploit this with 4 bc5 which threatens a fork on f2 and forbids white s castling black may later push d7 d6 to open centre e g 5 nh3 0 0 6 nc3 d6 7 exd6 cxd6 when black has good squares for its pieces while white s castling is delayed another reasonable looking move is 4 qd4 as it protects e5 pawn and attacks ng4 however problem for white in budapest is that natural moves often lead to disaster lalic 1998 p 129 best for black is gambit 4 d6 5 exd6 nc6 6 qd1 bxd6 when natural 7 nf3 is an error because of 7 nxf2 8 kxf2 bg3 winning queen tseitlin 1992 p 18 white must develop quietly with moves like nc3 nf3 e3 be2 allowing black to find active positions for his pieces with 0 0 be6 qe7 and preparing several sacrificial ideas on e3
