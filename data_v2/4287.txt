historian h vinson synan basic premise of pentecostalism that one may receive later of spirit after initiation conversion can be clearly traced in christian history to beginnings of rite of confirmation in western churches reformation era and puritanism 16th and 17th centuries huldrych zwingli a leading protestant reformer in switzerland taught three distinct baptisms water baptism teaching baptism having been educated about christian religion and spirit baptism while full baptism included all three zwingli emphasized that external baptisms of water and teaching could not provide salvation inner baptism of spirit alone could save because it conferred faith according to zwingli three baptisms could be given separately spirit baptism could occur first or last in sequence many puritans believed that conversion experience was followed by a later and distinct experience of holy spirit this experience was characterized by receiving assurance of one s salvation english puritan thomas goodwin equated this experience with baptism in holy spirit and seal of spirit referenced in ephesians 1 early methodism and holiness movement 18th and 19th centuries thumb 300px methodist preachers are known for promulgating doctrines of new birth and entire sanctification to public at events such as tent revivals and camp meetings which they believe is reason that god raised them up into existence synan traces influence of catholic and anglican mystical traditions on john wesley s doctrine of christian perfection or entire sanctification from which pentecostal beliefs on spirit baptism developed furthermore theologian james dunn notes early methodist beliefs can be directly linked to puritan teaching on holy spirit wesley taught that while new birth was start of christian life but inbred sin remained and must be removed through christian perfection which he stated had instantaneous and gradual aspects john fletcher wesley s designated successor called christian perfection a baptism in holy spirit on subject fletcher wrote in mid 19th century america wesleyan holiness movement that had adherents both within and outside mainline methodism began to teach that entire sanctification was less a process and emphasized instantaneous aspect of wesley s doctrine which one entered into by faith at a definite moment in time this second blessing or second work of grace as it was commonly called allowed christians to be freed from power of sin among adherents of holiness movement baptism in holy spirit was synonymous with second blessing sanctification john wesley s checks to antinomianism later became a standard for inclined holiness teachers keswick higher life movement 19th century after his conversion in 1821 presbyterian minister and revivalist charles grandison finney experienced what he called baptism in holy spirit accompanied by unutterable of praise finney and other reformed writers known as oberlin perfectionists agreed that there was a life altering experience after conversion but unlike their wesleyan holiness counterparts they conceived of it as an ongoing process enabling believers to devote themselves wholly to christ s service similarly english higher life movement taught that second blessing was an enduement of power according to this view spirit baptism gave christians ability to be witnesses for gospel and to perform christian service wesleyan teachers emphasized purity while oberlin and higher life advocates stressed power as defining outcome of spirit baptism 20th century in early 1890s r c horner a canadian holiness evangelist introduced a theological distinction that would be important for development of pentecostalism he argued in his books pentecost 1891 and bible doctrines 1909 that baptism in holy spirit was not synonymous with second blessing but was actually a third work of grace subsequent to salvation and sanctification that empowered believer for service charles fox parham would build on this doctrinal foundation when he identified speaking in tongues as bible evidence of spirit baptism views right thumb 200px russian orthodox depiction of pentecost c 1497 diverse views on

christian initiation lay foundations of christian life catechism of catholic church paragraph 1212 christian life is based on baptism it is gateway to life in spirit and signifies and actually brings about birth of water and spirit catechism of catholic church paragraphs 1213 1215 post baptismal anointing chrismation in eastern churches signifies gift of holy spirit and announces a second anointing to be conferred later in confirmation that completes baptismal anointing catechism of catholic church paragraphs 1241 1242 confirmation then is necessary for completion of baptismal grace

though which believer through laying on of hands and prayer of an apostle receives gift of holy spirit death out of water and spirit which was begun in holy baptism with water is completed through holy sealing regeneration main position on spirit baptism among reformed churches and many baptists is that baptism with holy spirit occurs simultaneously with regeneration when those who have faith in jesus christ receive holy spirit and are incorporated into body of christ sanctification methodist and holiness christianity thumb 350px methodists often seek new birth and entire sanctification at

receives and is strengthened by holy spirit respectively at same time united methodist confession of faith affirms wesley s doctrine of christian perfection also known as entire sanctification second work of grace in holiness movement within mainline methodism and outside of it entire sanctification is emphasized as a definite experience linked to baptism with holy spirit according to articles of faith of church of nazarene sanctification is a work of god after regeneration which transforms believers into likeness of christ and is made possible by initial sanctification which occurs simultaneously with regeneration and justification entire sanctification and continued perfecting work of holy spirit culminating in glorification entire sanctification as opposed to initial sanctification is an act of god in which a believer is made free from original sin and able to devote him or herself entirely to god empowerment classical pentecostalism in classical pentecostalism baptism with holy spirit is understood to be a separate and distinct experience occurring sometime after regeneration influenced by holiness movement baptism with holy spirit was regarded by first pentecostals as being third work of grace following new birth first work of grace and entire sanctification second work of grace baptism with holy spirit is an empowering experience equipping spirit filled believers for witness and ministry extending from this is belief that all spiritual gifts mentioned in new testament are to be sought and exercised to build up church pentecostals believe that spirit baptism will be accompanied by physical evidence of speaking in tongues glossolalia introduction new international dictionary of pentecostal and charismatic movements according to pentecostal biblical interpretation gospel of john 20 22 shows that disciples of jesus were already born again before holy spirit fell at pentecost they then cite biblical examples in book of acts 2 8 10 and 19 to show that it was common in new testament for spirit baptism to occur after conversion in following biblical pattern they argue christians today should also pray for this baptism which results in greater power for ministry and witness on subject of spirit baptism donald gee wrote of christians on day of pentecost in pentecostal experience spirit baptism can be quite dramatic as shown by william durham s account of his spirit baptism thumb right 300px apostolic faith mission on azusa street now considered to be birthplace of pentecostalism in some accounts of spirit baptism pentecostals report receiving visions such as account of lucy leatherman an azusa street participant charismatics charismatics trace their historical origins to charismatic movement of 1960s and 1970s they are distinguished from pentecostals because they tend to allow for differing viewpoints on whether spirit baptism is subsequent to conversion and whether tongues is always a sign of receiving baptism catholic charismatic renewal believes that there is a further experience of empowerment with holy spirit new international dictionary of pentecostal and charismatic movements 2001 p 465 as

confirmation during 1980s another renewal movement emerged called third wave of holy spirit first wave was pentecostalism and second wave was charismatic movement third wave charismatics stress that preaching of gospel following new testament pattern should be accompanied by signs wonders and miracles they believe that all christians are baptized with holy spirit at conversion and prefer to call subsequent experiences as filling with holy spirit john and vineyard churches are most prominently associated with this label mormonism in latter day saint movement baptism of fire and of holy ghost
