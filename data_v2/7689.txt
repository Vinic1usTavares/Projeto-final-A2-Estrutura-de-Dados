taking his first serious steps in political activism through involvement in a group of magnates planning a never realized confederacy he became a foreign member of societe des amis des noirs through his freemason contacts with pierre maurice piattoli won confidence of poland s king stanislaw august poniatowski becoming his agent in paris and by end of 1789 his private secretary and librarian although without any official title acting as a sort of cultural aide piattoli who had strong ties to reformist and often anti royal opposition became an important link between reformers ignacy potocki in particular and king in words of a swedish diplomat l engstrom he was like a tireless spring constantly mediating between two factions due to his association with reformers in conservative rome he became infamous as a staunch supporter of revolutionary ideals and was accused of vatican diplomats criticized king for hiring such a revolutionary but king defended piattoli quite vividly in any case many such claims were exaggerations or rumours spread by his political enemies according to one such rumour piattoli was alleged to incite crowds in france to kill king in reality piattoli supported of french revolution s early stages but more in direction of peaceful transformation into a constitutional republic than excesses between 1790 and 1792 piattoli was sent on several sensitive

s work in sejm legislature of polish lithuanian commonwealth he was also an active supporter of poniatowski s plan for a hereditary succession piattoli as poniatowski s secretary and a resident of royal castle in warsaw has been credited with winning king over to idea of social reforms and with playing a part in drafting of constitution of may 3 1791 exact nature of piattoli s role in regard to constitution remains uncertain modern historians disagree to what degree he was an executor a mediator or an initiator he played a role in convincing king to collaborate with leaders of patriotic party on drafting a constitution he might have prepared or expanded drafts of document based on discussions among principal authors including king hugo kollataj another politically active roman catholic priest and ignacy potocki at a minimum he seems to have helped catalyze process historian emanuel rostworowski describes him as a vital secretary editor who certainly participated in related discussions and influenced both potocki and king and calls piattoli s quarters in royal palace a creche of constitution piattoli was finally involved in final preparations for vote that took place during sejm session on may 3 later that month he became a founder of friends of constitution he was active in various political causes and worked closely with other key figures in poland such as hugo

alliance with france promising to turn poland into a second republic in europe at same time he was involved in much more conservative negotiations with russians in july 1794 he and several other activists were exiled from leipzig and piattoli was soon arrested by austrian authorities after failure of kosciuszko insurrection later in 1794 many prisoners were set free but piattoli was kept imprisoned together with kollataj as russian authorities insisted that two were extremely dangerous hence even after final partitions of polish lithuanian commonwealth in 1795 piattoli was kept interned in prague by austrian empire authorities until 1800 despite requests for his release from poniatowski and even napoleon bonaparte his release in 1800 seems to have been result of efforts of
