pulp magazines considered starting a competitive title in 1928 according to harold hersey one of his editors at time hersey had discussed plans with clayton to launch a pseudo science fantasy sheet ashley 2000 p 69 quote is from hersey 1937 p 188 cited by ashley clayton was unconvinced but following year decided to launch a new magazine mainly because sheet on which color covers of his magazines were printed had a space for one more cover he suggested to harry bates a newly hired editor that they start a magazine of historical adventure stories bates proposed instead a science fiction pulp to be titled astounding stories of super science and clayton agreed ashley 2000 p 69 issue data for 1930 to 1980 jan feb mar apr may jun jul aug sep oct nov 1 1 2 1 3 2 1 2 2 2 3 3 1 3 2 3 3 4 1 4 2 4 1

in fact correct colors identify editors for each issue ashley 2000 p 239 ashley 2007 p 425 astounding was initially published by publisher s fiscal corporation a subsidiary of clayton magazines see individual issues for convenience an online index is available at and publishers fiscal corp manhattan to clayton magazines first issue appeared in january 1930 with bates as editor bates aimed for straightforward action adventure stories with scientific elements only present to provide minimal plausibility clayton paid much better rates than amazing and wonder stories two cents a word on acceptance rather than half a cent a word on publication or sometimes later and consequently astounding attracted some of better known pulp writers such as murray leinster victor rousseau and jack williamson in february 1931 original name astounding stories of super science was shortened to astounding stories ashley 2000 p 72 magazine was profitable but great depression caused clayton problems normally a publisher would pay a printer three months in arrears but when a credit squeeze began in may 1931 it led to pressure to reduce this delay financial difficulties led clayton to start alternating publication of his magazines and he switched astounding to a bimonthly schedule with june 1932 issue some printers bought magazines which were indebted to them clayton decided to buy his printer to prevent this from happening this proved a disastrous move clayton did not have money to complete transaction and in october 1932 clayton decided to cease publication of astounding with expectation that january 1933 issue would be last one as it turned out enough stories were in inventory and enough paper was available to publish one further issue so last clayton astounding was dated march 1933 ashley 2000 pp 76 77 in april clayton went bankrupt and sold his magazine titles to t r foley for 100 foley resold them in august to street smith a well established publisher ashley 2000 p 82 ashley 2004 p 204 joshi schultz derleth lovecraft 2008 pp 599 601 street and smith science fiction was not entirely a departure for street smith they already had two pulp titles that occasionally ventured into field shadow which had begun in 1931 and was tremendously successful with a circulation over 300 000 and doc savage which had been launched in march 1933 ashley 2000 pp 82 83 they gave post of editor of astounding to f orlin tremaine an experienced editor who had been working for clayton as editor of clues and who had come to street smith as part of transfer of titles after clayton s bankruptcy desmond hall who had also come from clayton was made assistant editor because tremaine was editor of clues and top notch as well as astounding hall did much of editorial work though tremaine retained final control over contents first street smith issue was dated october 1933 until third issue in december 1933 editorial team was not named on masthead ashley 2000 p 84 street smith had an excellent distribution network and they were able to get astounding s circulation up to an estimated 50 000 by middle of 1934 ashley 2000 p 85 estimate is ashley s two main rival science fiction magazines of day wonder stories and amazing stories each had a circulation about half that astounding was leading science fiction magazine by end of 1934 and it was also largest at 160 pages and cheapest at 20 cents street smith s rates of one cent per word sometimes more on acceptance were not as high as rates paid by bates for clayton astounding but they were still better than those of other magazines ashley 2000 pp 85 87 hall left astounding in 1934 to become editor of street smith s new slick magazine mademoiselle and was replaced by r v happel tremaine remained in control of story selection ashley 2000 p 105 writer frank gruber described tremaine s editorial selection process in his book pulp jungle quoted in ashley 2000 p 105 gruber pointed out that stories in middle might go many months before tremaine read them result was erratic response times that sometimes stretched to over 18 months ashley 2000 pp 105 106 in 1936 magazine switched from untrimmed to trimmed edges brian stableford comments that this was an important symbolic step as other sf pulps were still untrimmed making astounding smarter looking than its competitors tremaine was promoted to assistant editorial director in 1937 his replacement as editor of astounding was 27 year old john w campbell jr campbell had made his name in early 1930s as a writer publishing space opera under his own name and more thoughtful stories under pseudonym don a stuart he started working for street smith in october 1937 so his initial editorial influence appeared in issue dated december 1937 march 1938 issue was first that was fully his responsibility ashley 2000 pp 86 87 ashley 2000 p 107 in early 1938 street smith abandoned its policy of having editors in chief with result that tremaine was made redundant his departure on may 1 1938 gave campbell a freer rein with magazine ashley 2000 p 108 one of campbell s first acts was to change title from astounding stories to astounding science fiction starting with march 1938 issue campbell s editorial policy was targeted at more mature readers of science fiction and he felt that astounding stories did not convey right image he intended to subsequently drop astounding part of title as well leaving magazine titled science fiction but in 1939 a new magazine with that title appeared although astounding was retained in title thereafter it was often printed in a color that made it much less visible than science fiction at start of 1942 price was increased for first time to 25 cents magazine simultaneously switched to larger bedsheet format but this did not last astounding returned to pulp size in mid 1943 for six issues and then became first science fiction magazine to switch to digest size in november 1943 increasing number of pages to maintain same total price remained at 25 cents through these changes in format ashley 2000 p 158 alt four clips of title layout from 1960 thumb changes in layout during 1960 showing january february september and october title layouts price increased again to 35 cents in august 1951 in late 1950s it became apparent to street smith that they were going to have to raise prices again during 1959 astounding was priced at 50 cents in some areas to find out what impact would be on circulation results were apparently satisfactory and price was raised with november 1959 issue ashley 2005 pp 201 202 following year campbell finally achieved his goal of getting rid of word astounding in magazine s title changing it to analog science fact science fiction in title was often replaced by a symbol of campbell s devising resembling an inverted u pierced by a horizontal arrow and meaning analogous to change began with february 1960 issue and was complete by october for several issues both analog and astounding could be seen on cover with analog becoming bolder and astounding fading with each issue ashley 2005 p 202 conde nast street smith was acquired by samuel newhouse owner of conde nast in august 1959 though street smith was not merged into conde nast until end of 1961 ashley 2016 p 448 analog was only digest sized magazine in conde nast s inventory all others were slicks such as vogue and vanity fair all advertisers in these magazines had plates made up to take advantage of this size and conde nast changed analog to larger size from march 1963 issue to conform front and back signatures were changed to glossy paper to carry both advertisements and scientific features change did not attract advertising support however and from april 1965 issue analog reverted to digest size once again circulation which had been increasing before change was not harmed and continued to increase while analog was in slick format ashley 2005 p 213 from april 1965 issue title switched fiction and fact elements so that it became analog science fiction science fact campbell died suddenly in july 1971 but there was enough material in analogs inventory to allow remaining staff to put together issues for rest of year ashley 2007 p 6 conde nast had given magazine very little attention since it was both profitable and cheap to produce but they were proud that it was leading science fiction magazine they asked kay tarrant who had been campbell s assistant to help them find a replacement she contacted regular contributors to ask for suggestions several well known writers turned down job poul anderson did not want to leave california and neither did jerry pournelle who also felt salary was too small before he died campbell had talked to harry harrison about taking over as editor but harrison did not want to live in new york lester del rey and clifford d simak were also rumored to have been offered job though simak denied it frederik pohl was interested but suspected his desire to change direction of magazine lessened his chances with conde nast ashley 2007 pp 17 18 conde nast vice president in charge of selecting new editor decided to read both fiction and nonfiction writing samples from applicants since analogs title included both science fiction and science fact he chose ben bova afterwards telling bova that his stories and articles were only ones i could understand january 1972 was first issue to credit bova on masthead bova planned to stay for five years to ensure a smooth transition after campbell s sudden death salary was too low for him to consider remaining indefinitely in 1975 he proposed a new magazine to conde nast management to be titled tomorrow magazine he wanted to publish articles about science and technology leavened with some science fiction stories conde nast was not interested and refused to assist analog with marketing or promotions bova resigned in june 1978 having stayed for a little longer than he had planned and recommended stanley schmidt to succeed him schmidt s first issue was december 1978 though material purchased by bova continued to appear for several months ashley 2007 pp 341 346 davis publications dell magazines and penny publications issue data for 1981 to 1983 issue dates numberof weekly intervals from january december 7 101 1 to 101 13 weekly intervals from january march 29 no april issue to december with an september issue 102 1 to 102 13 issues january to december with an additional mid september issue 103 1 to 103 13 data for 1981 to 1983 stanley schmidt was editor throughout in 1977 davis publications launched isaac asimov s science fiction magazine and after bova s departure joel davis owner of davis publications contacted conde nast with a view to acquiring analog analog had always been something of a misfit in conde nast s line up which included mademoiselle and vogue and by february 1980 deal was agreed first issue published by davis was dated september 1980 davis was willing to put some effort into marketing analog so schmidt regarded change as likely to be beneficial and in fact circulation quickly grew reversing a gradual decline over bova years from just over 92 000 in 1981 to almost 110 000 two years later starting with first 1981 issue davis switched analog to a four weekly schedule rather than monthly to align production schedule with a weekly calendar instead of being dated january 1981 first issue under new regime was dated january 5 1981 but this approach led to newsstands removing magazine much more quickly since date gave impression that it was a weekly magazine cover date was changed back to current month starting with april 1982 issue but new schedule remained in place with a mid september issue in 1982 and 1983 and mid december issues for more than a decade thereafter ashley 2016 pp 58 59 circulation trended slowly down over 1980s to 83 000 for year ending in 1990 by this time great majority of readers were subscribers as newsstand

in 1992 analog was sold to dell magazines and dell was in turn acquired by crosstown publications in 1996 that year mid december issues stopped appearing and following year july and august issues were combined into a single bimonthly issue an ebook edition became available in 2000 and has become increasingly popular with ebook numbers not reflected in published annual circulation numbers which by 2011 were down to under 27 000 in 2004 january and february issues were combined so that only ten issues a year appeared having just surpassed john w campbell s tenure of 34 years schmidt retired in august 2012 his place was taken by trevor quachri who continues to edit analog as of 2018 from editor at analog s official website retrieved 28 december 2018 from january 2017 publication frequency became bimonthly six issues per year contents and reception bates thumb cover of march 1933 astounding by wesso originally painted to illustrate e e smith s triplanetary first incarnation of astounding was an adventure oriented magazine unlike gernsback bates had no interest in educating his readership through science covers were all painted by wesso and similarly action filled first issue showed a giant beetle attacking a man bates would not accept any experimental stories relying mostly on formulaic plots in eyes of mike ashley a science fiction historian bates was destroying ideals of science fiction ashley 2000 pp 69 70 72 one historically important story that almost appeared in astounding was e e smith s triplanetary which bates would have published had astounding not folded in early 1933 cover wesso had painted for story appeared on march 1933 issue last to be published by clayton ashley 2000 p 77 tremaine when street smith acquired astounding they also planned to relaunch another clayton pulp strange tales and acquired material for it before deciding not to proceed these stories appeared in first street smith astounding dated october 1933 this issue and next were unremarkable in quality but with december issue tremaine published a statement of editorial policy calling for thought variant stories containing original ideas and not simply reproducing adventure themes in a science fiction context policy was probably worked out between tremaine and desmond hall his assistant editor in an attempt to give astounding a clear identity in market that would distinguish it from both existing science fiction magazines and hero pulps such as shadow that frequently used sf ideas ashley 2000 pp 84 87 thought variant policy may have been introduced for publicity rather than as a real attempt to define sort of fiction tremaine was looking for early thought variant stories were not always very original or well executed ashley describes first nat schachner s ancestral voices as not amongst schachner s best second colossus by donald was not a new idea but was energetically written over succeeding issues it became apparent that tremaine was genuinely willing to publish material that would have fallen foul of editorial taboos elsewhere he serialized charles fort s lo a nonfiction work about strange and inexplicable phenomena in eight parts between april and november 1934 in an attempt to stimulate new ideas for stories best remembered story of 1934 is probably jack williamson s legion of space which began serialization in april but other notable stories include murray leinster s in time which was first genre science fiction story to use idea of alternate history bright illusion by c l moore and twilight by john w campbell writing as don a stuart twilight which was written in a more literary and poetic style than campbell s earlier space opera stories was particularly influential and tremaine encouraged other writers to produce similar stories one such was raymond z gallun s old faithful which appeared in december 1934 issue and was sufficiently popular that gallun wrote a sequel son of old faithful published following july space opera continued to be popular though and two overlapping space opera novels were running in astounding late in year skylark of by e e smith and mightiest machine by campbell by end of year astounding was clear leader of small field of sf magazines astoundings readership was more knowledgeable and more mature than readers of other magazines and this was reflected in cover artwork almost entirely by howard v brown which was less garish than at wonder stories or amazing stories ashley describes interior artwork as entrancing giving hints of higher technology without ignoring human element and singles out work of elliot dold as particularly impressive tremaine s policy of printing material that he liked without staying too strictly within bounds of genre led him to serialize h p lovecraft s novel at mountains of madness in early 1936 he followed this with lovecraft s shadow out of time in june 1936 though protests from science fiction purists occurred generally however tremaine was unable to maintain high standard he had set in first few years perhaps because his workload was high tremaine s slow responses to submissions discouraged new authors although he could rely on regular contributors such as jack williamson murray leinster raymond gallun nat schachner and frank belknap long new writers who did appear during latter half of tremaine s tenure included ross rocklynne nelson s bond and l sprague de camp whose first appearance was in september 1937 with ashley 2000 pp 106 111 tremaine printed some nonfiction articles during his tenure with campbell providing an 18 part series on solar system between june 1936 and december 1937 campbell left thumb a sketch of john w campbell from 1932 street smith hired campbell in october 1937 although he did not gain full editorial control of astounding until march 1938 issue campbell was able to introduce some new features before then in january 1938 he began to include a short description of stories in next issue titled in times to come and in march he began analytical laboratory which compiled votes from readers and ranked stories in order payment rate at time was one cent a word and street smith agreed to let campbell pay a bonus of an extra quarter cent a word to writer whose story was voted top of list unlike other editors campbell paid authors when he accepted not published their work publication usually occurred several months after acceptance campbell wanted his writers to provide action and excitement but he also wanted stories to appeal to a readership that had matured over first decade of science fiction genre he asked his writers to write stories that felt as though they could have been published as non science fiction stories in a magazine of future a reader of future would not need long explanations for gadgets in their lives so campbell asked his writers to find ways of naturally introducing technology to their stories he also instituted regular nonfiction pieces with goal of stimulating story ideas main contributors of these were r s richardson l sprague de camp and willy ley campbell changed approach to magazine s cover art hoping that more mature artwork would attract more adult readers and enable them to carry magazine without embarrassment howard v brown had done almost every cover for street smith version of astounding and campbell asked him to do an astronomically accurate picture of sun as seen from mercury for february 1938 issue he also introduced charles schneeman as a cover artist starting with may 1938 issue and hubert rogers in february 1939 rogers quickly became a regular painting all but four of covers between september 1939 and august 1942 they differentiated magazine from rivals algis budrys recalled that astounding was last magazine i picked up as a child because without covers showing men with ray guns and women with large breasts it didn t look like an sf magazine golden age period beginning with campbell s editorship of astounding is usually referred to as golden age of science fiction because of immense influence he had on genre within two years of becoming editor he had published stories by many of writers who would become central figures in science fiction list of names included established authors like l ron hubbard clifford simak jack williamson l sprague de camp henry kuttner and c l moore who became regulars in either astounding or its sister magazine unknown and new writers who published some of their first stories in astounding such as lester del rey theodore sturgeon isaac asimov a e van vogt and robert heinlein april 1938 issue included first story by del rey faithful and de camp s second sale jack williamson s legion of time described by author and editor lin carter as possibly greatest single adventure story in science fiction history williamson 1977 back cover began serialization in following issue de camp contributed a nonfiction article language for time travelers in july issue which also contained hubbard s first science fiction sale dangerous dimension hubbard had been selling genre fiction to pulps for several years by that time same issue contained clifford simak s rule 18 simak had more or less abandoned science fiction within a year after breaking into field in 1931 but he was drawn back by campbell s editorial approach next issue featured one of campbell s best known stories who goes there and included kuttner s disinherited kuttner had been selling successfully to other pulps for a few years but this was his first story in astounding in october de camp began a popular series about an intelligent bear named johnny black with command market for science fiction expanded dramatically following year several new magazines were launched including startling stories in january 1939 unknown in march a fantasy companion to astounding also edited by campbell fantastic adventures in may and planet stories in december all of competing magazines including two main extant titles wonder stories and amazing stories were publishing space opera stories of interplanetary adventure or other well worn ideas from early days of genre campbell s attempts to make science fiction more mature led to a natural division of writers those who were unable to write to his standards continued to sell to other magazines and those who could sell to campbell quickly focused their attention on astounding and sold relatively little to other magazines expansion of market also benefited campbell because writers knew that if he rejected their submissions they could resubmit those stories elsewhere this freed them to try to write to his standards ashley 2000 pp 153 158 in july 1939 lead story was black destroyer first sale by van vogt issue also included trends asimov s first sale to campbell and his second story to see print later fans identified issue as start of golden age other first sales that year included heinlein s lifeline in august and sturgeon s ether breather following month one of most popular authors of space opera e e smith reappeared in october with first installment of gray lensman this was a sequel to galactic patrol which had appeared in astounding two years before heinlein rapidly became one of most prolific contributors to astounding publishing three novels in next two years if this goes on sixth column and methuselah s children and half a dozen short stories in september 1940 van vogt s first novel slan began serialization book was partly inspired by a challenge campbell laid down to van vogt that it was impossible to tell a superman story from point of view of superman it proved to be one of most popular stories campbell published and is an example of way campbell worked with his writers to feed them ideas and generate material he wanted to buy isaac asimov s robot series began to take shape in 1941 with reason and liar appearing in april and may issues as with slan these stories were partly inspired by conversations with campbell september 1941 issue included asimov s short story nightfall probably most famous u s science fiction story ever written and in november second stage lensman next novel in smith s lensman series began serialization following year brought first installment of asimov s foundation stories foundation appeared in may and bridle and saddle in june van vogt s recruiting station in march issue was first story in his weapon shop series described by critic john clute as most compelling of all van vogt s work henry kuttner and c l moore began to appear regularly in astounding often under pseudonym lewis padgett and more new writers appeared hal clement raymond f jones and george o smith all of whom became regular contributors september 1942 issue contained del rey s nerves which was one of few stories to be ranked top by every single reader who voted in monthly analytical laboratory poll it dealt with aftermath of an explosion at a nuclear plant campbell emphasized scientific accuracy over literary style asimov heinlein and de camp were trained scientists and engineers after 1942 several of regular contributors such as heinlein asimov and hubbard who had joined war effort appeared less frequently among those who remained key figures were van vogt simak kuttner moore and fritz leiber all of whom were less oriented towards technology in their fiction than writers like asimov or heinlein this led to appearance of more psychologically oriented fiction such as van vogt s world of null a which was serialized in 1945 kuttner and moore contributed a humorous series about an inventor galloway who could only invent while drunk but they were also capable of serious fiction ashley 2000 pp 169 174 campbell had asked them to write science fiction with same freedom from constraints that he had allowed them in fantasy works they were writing for unknown street smith s fantasy title result was mimsy were which appeared in february 1943 and is now regarded as a classic leiber s gather darkness serialized in 1943 was set in a world where scientific knowledge is hidden from masses and presented as magic as with kuttner and moore he was simultaneously publishing fantasies in unknown campbell continued to publish technological sf alongside soft science fiction one example was cleve cartmill s deadline a story about development of atomic bomb it appeared in 1944 when manhattan project was still not known to public cartmill used his background in atomic physics to assemble a plausible story that had strong similarities to real world secret research program military intelligence agents called on campbell to investigate and were satisfied when he explained how cartmill had been able to make so many accurate guesses aldiss wingrove 1986 p 224 in words of science fiction critic john clute cartmill s prediction made sf fans enormously proud as some considered story proof that science fiction could be predictive of future post war years in late 1940s both thrilling wonder and startling stories began to publish much more mature fiction than they had during war and although astounding was still leading magazine in field it was no longer only market for writers who had been regularly selling to campbell many of best new writers still broke into print in astounding rather than elsewhere arthur c clarke s first story loophole appeared in april 1946 astounding and another british writer christopher youd began his career with christmas tree in february 1949 youd would become much better known under his pseudonym john christopher william tenn s first sale alexander bait appeared in may 1946 and h beam piper s time and time again in april 1947 issue was his first story along with these newer writers campbell was still publishing strong material by authors who had become established during war among better known stories of this era are vintage season by c l moore under pseudonym lawrence o donnell jack williamson s story with folded hands players of null a van vogt s sequel to world of null a and final book in e e smith s lensman series children of lens ashley 2000 pp 190 193 in november 1948 issue campbell published a letter to editor by a reader named richard a hoen that contained a detailed ranking of contents of an issue one year in future campbell went along with joke and contracted stories from most of authors mentioned in letter that would follow hoen s imaginary story titles one of best known stories from that issue is gulf by heinlein other stories and articles were written by some of most famous authors of time asimov sturgeon del rey van vogt de camp and astronomer r s richardson rogers 1970 pp 176 180 1950s and 1960s by 1950 campbell s strong personality had led him into conflict with some of his leading writers some of whom abandoned astounding as a result launch of both magazine of fantasy science fiction and galaxy science fiction in 1949 and 1950 respectively marked end of astoundings dominance of science fiction with many now regarding galaxy as leading magazine campbell s growing interest in pseudoscience also damaged his reputation in field mike ashley analog science fiction science fact in gunn encyclopedia of science fiction pp 17 18 campbell was deeply involved with launch of dianetics publishing hubbard s first article on it in astounding in may 1950 and promoting it heavily in months beforehand ashley 2000 pp 226 227 later in decade he championed psionics and antigravity devices although these enthusiasms diminished campbell s reputation astounding continued to publish some popular and influential science fiction berger 1985 pp 80 81 in 1953 campbell serialized hal clement s mission of gravity described by john clute and david langford as one of best loved novels in sf and in 1954 tom godwin s cold equations appeared story about a girl who stows away on a spaceship generated much reader debate and has been described as capturing ethos of campbell s astounding berger 1985 p 82 ashley 2005 pp 128 129 spaceship is carrying urgently needed medical supplies to a planet in distress and has a single pilot ship does not have enough fuel to reach planet if girl stays on ship so cold equations of physics force pilot to jettison girl killing her later in 1950s and early 1960s writers like gordon r dickson poul anderson and harry harrison appeared regularly in magazine frank herbert s dune was serialized in analog in two separate sequences in 1963 and 1965 and soon became one of most famous of all sf novels according to malcolm edwards and john clute 1965 marked year campbell received his eighth hugo award for best professional magazine this was last one he would win bova bova like campbell was a with a scientific background and he declared early in his tenure that he wanted analog to continue to focus on stories with a scientific foundation though he also made it clear that change was inevitable ashley 1985 pp 89 90 over his first few months some long time readers sent in letters of complaint when they judged that bova was not living up to campbell s standards particularly when sex scenes began to appear on one occasion jack story foundling fathers and its accompanying illustration by kelly freas it turned out that campbell had bought story in question as 1970s went on bova continued to publish authors such as anderson dickson and christopher anvil who had appeared regularly during campbell s tenure but he also attracted authors who had not been able to sell to campbell such as gene wolfe roger zelazny and harlan ellison frederik pohl who later commented in his autobiography about his difficulties in selling to campbell appeared in march 1972 issue with gold at starbow s end which was nominated for both hugo and nebula awards and that summer joe haldeman s hero appeared this was first story in haldeman s forever war sequence campbell had rejected it listing multiple reasons including frequent use of profanity and implausibility of men and women serving in combat together bova asked to see it again and ran it without asking for changes ashley 2007 pp 18 20 other new writers included spider robinson whose first sale was guy with eyes in february 1973 issue george r r martin with a song for lya in june 1974 and orson scott card with ender s game in august 1977

professional editor for five consecutive years 1973 through 1977 ashley 2007 pp 33 34 schmidt stanley schmidt was an assistant professor of physics when he became editor of analog and his scientific background was well suited to magazine s readership he avoided making drastic changes and continued long standing tradition of writing provocative editorials though he rarely discussed science fiction in 1979 he resurrected probability zero a feature that campbell had run in early 1940s that published tall tales humorous stories with ludicrous or impossible scientific premises also in 1979 schmidt began a series of columns titled alternate view an opinion column that was written in alternate issues by g harry stine and jerry pournelle and which is still a feature of magazine as of 2016 though now with different contributors ashley 2016 pp 56 58 stable of fiction contributors remained largely unchanged from bova s day and included many names such as poul anderson gordon r dickson and george o smith familiar to readers from campbell era this continuity led to criticisms within field bruce sterling writing in 1984 that magazine has become old dull and it is a situation screaming for reform analog no longer permits itself to be read magazine thrived nevertheless and though part of increase in circulation during early 1980s may have been due to davis publications energetic efforts to increase subscriptions schmidt knew what his readership wanted and made sure they got it commenting in 1985 i reserve analog for kind of science fiction i ve described here good stories about people with problems in which some piece of plausible or at least not demonstrably implausible speculative science plays an indispensable role ashley 2016 pp 56 60 over decades of schmidt s editorship many writers became regular contributors including catherine asaro maya michael flynn geoffrey a landis paul levinson robert j sawyer charles sheffield and harry turtledove schmidt never won an editing
