spirit and soul become confused 35 is a church cantata by johann sebastian bach he composed solo cantata for alto voice in leipzig for twelfth sunday after trinity and first performed it on 8 september 1726 bach composed cantata in his fourth year as thomaskantor musical director in leipzig text is based on day s prescribed reading from gospel of mark healing of a deaf mute man librettist is georg christian lehms whose poetry bach had used already in weimar as basis for solo cantatas text quotes ideas from gospel and derives from these analogy that as tongue of deaf mute man was opened believer should be open to admire god s miraculous deeds cantatas for this sunday have a positive character which bach stressed in earlier works for occasion by including trumpets in score in this work he uses instead an obbligato solo organ in several movements cantata is structured in seven movements in two parts to be performed before and after sermon both parts are opened by an instrumental sinfonia with solo organ probably derived from concerto music composed earlier in weimar or kothen alto singer performs a sequence of alternating arias and recitatives accompanied in all three arias by organ as an equal partner baroque instrumental ensemble is formed by two oboes taille strings and basso continuo alto part is demanding and was probably written with a specific singer in mind as with two other solo cantatas composed in same period history and words bach composed cantata in his fourth year as in leipzig for twelfth sunday after trinity it is regarded as part of his third cantata cycle thumb upright 1 2 topic of gospel christ healing deaf mute man by bartholomeus 1635 prescribed readings for sunday were from second epistle to corinthians ministry of spirit and from gospel of mark healing of a deaf mute man cantata text was written by georg christian lehms and published in 1711 text connects healing of deaf man to thoughts of believer who is left deaf and mute in awe looking at healing of jesus and god s creation text of second aria is almost a quote of gospel s last verse because of requirements that new music be composed as often as possible bach seldom chose older poems for his cantatas consequently conductor craig smith has suggested that parts of this work may have been composed earlier than first recorded leipzig performance bach had already composed his first solo cantata on a text by lehms composed during his tenure in weimar also for an alto soloist cantata is one of three bach cantatas written in leipzig in 1726 in which an alto is only vocal soloist others being and it seems likely that bach had a capable alto singer at his disposal during this period bach had earlier composed two other cantatas for twelfth sunday after trinity in his first year in leipzig lobe den herrn meine seele bwv first performed on 15 august 1723 and in his third year lobe den herren den konig der bwv 137 first performed on 19 august 1725 as an added part of his cycle of chorale cantatas both works focus on praise lob and use an orchestra including festive trumpets furthermore work has two large concerto movements for organ and orchestra probably from a lost concerto for keyboard oboe or violin perhaps indicating that cantata was composed for a seasonal choral absentia at thomaskirche first nine bars of opening sinfonia are practically identical to fragment bwv 1059 bach led first performance on 8 september 1726 and probably played organ part himself structure and scoring bach structured cantata in two parts four movements to be performed before sermon three after sermon both parts begin with a sinfonia bach scored cantata for an alto soloist and a baroque instrumental ensemble of two oboes ob taille ot obbligato solo organ org two violins vl viola va and basso continuo bc in following table of movements scoring follows neue bach ausgabe keys and time signatures are taken from alfred durr using symbol for common time 4 4 instruments are shown separately for winds strings and organ and continuo music thumb upright alt conductor john eliot gardiner with his baton facing to left john eliot gardiner who conducted bach cantata pilgrimage john eliot gardiner who conducted this work on twelfth sunday after trinity in st jakob kothen as part of bach cantata pilgrimage with monteverdi choir in 2000 calls occasion one of most cheerful programmes of whole trinity season leading bach to compose celebratory pieces two with trumpets and timpani and finally this one with an obbligato organ in an expanded two part structure organ is both an instrumental soloist in two sinfonias and a partner for singer in all three arias musicologist laurence dreyfus distinguished bach s use of organ as sacred icon versus galant conversationalist writing on bach s assimilation of secular solo concerto into his church cantatas and his adjustment of normal concerto principle that of soloist versus orchestra through subtle shifts in role playing instrument now posing as a soloist now retreating into background 1 opening allegro sinfonia incorporates concerto techniques suggesting an origin in a pre existing concerto organ performs both solo melody and continuo line punctuated by quasi passages and interspersed ten measure ritornellos musicologist klaus hofmann notes that in movement in italian style theme is subjected to intensive thematic working out in dialogue between solo instrument and orchestra 2 first aria in da capo form spirit and soul become confused is characterized by a broken ritornello and a sense of confusion and uncertainty rhythm is siciliano a frequent feature in slow concerto movements by bach and others hofmann concludes from many corrections in bach s autograph that aria is a new composition he sees agility of organ part which does not follow siciliano pattern as an image of confusion mentioned in text 3 a secco recitative i am amazed expresses awe at creation rendered in first person which according to mincham underlines cantata s personal and individual emphasis beginning in a major mode which contrasts with preceding aria it turns to solemnity of minor mode 4 an aria with obbligato organ god has made everything well is first movement in a major mode expressing pleasure with god s creation it has a dominating two part ritornello hofmann observes that organ this time only partner of voice is rich in coloratura and has a theme heard throughout movement sometimes in manner of an ostinato sometimes freely developed in its figuration and motoric drive it is stylized just like bach s writing for violoncello piccolo gardiner notes that not only tessitura but also characteristic string crossing patterns are reminiscent of violoncello piccolo use 5 part 2 begins with another sinfonia this time in binary form hofmann describes it as an engaging mobile introduced by keyboard it may be based on final movement of a concerto organ interacts with orchestra without a prelude which is unusual in bach s concertos but not without precedent such as harpsichord concerto in f major bwv 1057 6 another secco recitative ah powerful god let me think upon this continually is a prayer for ability to always reflect on miracle of creation it quotes jesus saying be opened to deaf mute man and turns it to believer s heart would open up and his tongue would be loosened so that he might perceive and praise divine miracles 7 cantata concludes with an aria with complete orchestra i wish to live with god alone it expresses wish to dwell with god forever in a minuet of positive character movement again uses a two part ritornello when contrasting aspects of life on earth are mentioned such as sorrowful yoke of pain and leben tormented life music darkens to minor keys organ supplies triplet figures which voice also uses to express ein halleluja a joyful hallelujah recordings table is based on listing on bach cantatas website ensembles playing period
