calibre means that lengths of guns were 50 times their bore or 300 inches eight guns and eight submerged torpedo tubes her six inch naval guns could fire five to six rounds per minute with a barrel lifetime of about 500 rounds 6 inch 50 calibre gun was capable of firing both antiaircraft and antiship shells though positioning of these guns on kongo made antiaircraft firing mostly impractical during her second reconstruction older three inch guns were removed and then replaced with eight 5 inch 40 calibre dual purpose guns these guns could fire from eight to 14 rounds per minute with a barrel lifetime of about 800 to 1 500 rounds of kongos guns 5 inch guns had widest variety of shell types antiaircraft antiship and illumination shells kongo was also armed with many antiaircraft
