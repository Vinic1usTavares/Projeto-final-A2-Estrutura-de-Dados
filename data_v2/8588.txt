duke of edinburgh was in 1982 offered appointment to order as an honorary companion however he refused on grounds that as consort of queen he was a canadian and thus entitled to a substantive appointment in 1993 advisory council proposed an amendment to constitution of order of canada making sovereign s spouse automatically a companion but prince philip again refused stating that if he was to be appointed it should be on his merits congruent with these arguments he in 1988 accepted without issue a substantive induction as a companion of order of australia in 2013 constitution of order

advisory board attempts to remain apolitical and pragmatic in its approach to selecting new members of order of canada generally operating without input from ministers of crown political interference has occurred only once when in 1978 paul desmarais s investiture was delayed for six months by prime minister pierre trudeau however some of committee s selections have caused controversy for instance

governor one former police detective frank chauvin along with a catholic anti abortion activist filed suit against order of canada advisory council demanding that minutes of meeting relating to morgentaler be made public appointment of morgentaler prompted former liberal member of parliament clifford lincoln to write that workings of advisory council were mysterious citing what he theorized to be inbuilt partiality and conflict of interest as reasons why margaret somerville whom lincoln had twice nominated to advisory council was turned down for appointment yet morgentaler was accepted journalist henry aubin in montreal gazette opined that council s rejection of somerville her personal opposition to same sex marriage and acceptance of brent hawkes jane rule and jean chretien all regarded as supporting same sex unions as well as appointment of a controversial figure such as morgentaler were all signs that advisory council operated with partisan bias aubin also pointed to presence on council of members of royal society of canada an organization into which somerville was received proposed amendments at a 2006 conference on commonwealth honours christopher mccreery an expert on canada s honours raised concern that three grades of order of canada were insufficient to recognize nation s very best one suggestion was to add two more levels to order equivalent to knighthoods in british orders order of precedence also came under scrutiny particularly anomaly that all three grades of order of canada supersede top levels of each of other orders except order of merit contrary to international practice in june 2010 mccreery suggested reforms to order of canada that would avert awkwardness around appointing members of canadian royal family as full members of order he theorized that queen as order s sovereign could simply appoint on ministerial advice anyone as an extra member or monarch could issue an ordinance allowing for her relations to be made regular members when approved similarly mccreery proposed that a new division of order could be established specifically for governors general their spouses and members of royal family a version of
