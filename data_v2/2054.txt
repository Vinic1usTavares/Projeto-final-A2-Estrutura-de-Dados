museum pieces designed for use by navy seals and used by nasa in outer space emerson s knives have been featured in films and novels due to their association with military units this has furthered their popularity with collectors emerson is an accomplished martial artist who has developed a combatives system emerson combat systems which has been taught to police officers military units and civilians background ernest emerson was born on march 7 1955 in northern wisconsin while attending high school he displayed athletic ability as a wrestler and baseball player being drafted by st louis cardinals to play professional baseball at age of 17 in midwest league emerson began his training in martial arts at age of 16 with korean version of judo known as traveling from wisconsin to minnesota twice a week to attend school he continued his study of martial arts while attending university of wisconsin la crosse where he earned a brown belt in karate and a black belt in shotokan karate while competing on university s karate team after graduating with degrees in physical education and world history emerson moved to southern california for sole purpose of continuing his martial arts training at filipino kali academy there he studied jun fan gung fu jeet kune do and eskrima under tutelage of dan and richard bustillo both proteges of late bruce lee emerson subsequently trained in gracie jiu jitsu for three years at original gracie academy in torrance california under founders of gracie jiu jitsu system and royce gracie eventually emerson became an instructor in his own right and combined principles of all these systems it was in southern california where he met his wife mary who at time was one of world s top female practitioners of jujutsu during this time emerson worked as a technician a machine operator and eventually a design engineer for hughes aircraft in el segundo early knifemaking thumb alt a butterfly knife with steel handles and lightening holes emerson s first handmade balisong knife although emerson credits his grandfather s gift of a barlow knife to him at age of eight years with starting his interest in knives it was not until later in life that he turned to making them summer of 1978 found emerson in need of a balisong knife for his study of a filipino martial art and unable to afford one on his salary emerson decided he would attempt to make his own instead he milled and drilled handles from aluminum stock knife s blade was a simple steel blank that he hand cut with a hacksaw shaped with files and heat treated at his dining room table with a butane torch when he started classes with this homemade knife his instructors and fellow students were impressed with his handiwork and asked him to make knives for them emerson did so and sold these early butterfly knives for just cost of materials but he soon raised price to 50 each as demand for his knives increased emerson went on to make fixed blade knives on a part time basis but upon seeing a michael walker handmade folding knife at a gun show he was so impressed by quality and design that he decided he was going to make folding from that point on emerson contacted walker and obtained his permission to use walker linerlock mechanism on his own knives according to a 1990 article by paul basch emerson said of walker here was a guy who put everything i was looking for into a knife it was then i decided to start making knives seriously and locking liners in particular pre tactical models thumb left alt an assortment of knives with anodized titanium bolsters in bright colors pre tac folders emerson s early folding knives were of linerlock variety ground by stock removal method and utilized rare materials from aerospace industry including titanium carbon fiber micarta and meteorite he incorporated exotic materials common to knifemakers of time including mother of pearl abalone shell shell staghorn and rare hardwoods writer paul basch reported in 1990 that emerson refused to use parts of any animal or plant which was an endangered species noting emerson as being an environmentally conscious knifemaker steel used in these blades was typically graded ats 34 l or and blades were either highly polished or hand rubbed emerson made knives with damascus steel blades among custom knife collectors and purveyors today these knives are known as pre tac pre tactical models they can be identified by their bright anodized titanium bolsters and liners and predominant use of clip point blades knives were noted for their close tolerances and precise locking mechanisms emerson credits following knifemakers for helping him along during his early years as a knifemaker michael walker clint bob and jim ferguson emerson s first logo or stamp on these knives was emerson knives surrounding outline of a bowie knife accordingly this is referred to as rare bowie logo appearing on only a very small number of knives when a knife collector asked emerson if he made bowie knives emerson informed him that he did not collector then advised him to change his logo or he might confuse knife buying public as they would ask for bowie knives instead of linerlock folders emerson agreed with this assessment dropping knife outline and word knives from his stamp using just his name in a half circle on blade as a logo this marking is known among collectors as half moon logo and would appear again as a transitional mark between viper and specwar lines of knives these early knives sold for between 800 and 2 000 each that combined with his appearances at knife shows and write ups in knife magazines helped emerson gain status and credibility as a custom knifemaker once established as a serious and reputable maker emerson was soon able to concentrate on making knives he wanted to make knives designed for use as opposed to show specifically folding knives designed for combat viper knives thumb alt 3 folding fighting knives with micarta handles and titanium bolsters viper knives mv 5 mv 3 and mv 1 as a direct result of watching his fellow martial artists train with a fixed blade fighting knife in class yet carry some type of a folding knife when they left training area emerson decided there was a need for a sturdy folding knife designed primarily for combat although emerson had always maintained that knives he made were built as fighting knives first and foremost in october 1985 he stripped down five of these designs to simpler materials he continued his use of linen or canvas micarta because of its high tensile strength and superior gripping surface when wet he decided on black or dark grey for color instead of brighter colors used previously he retained titanium for liners and bolsters but chose to bead blast them a flat grey matte color as opposed to colorful which used to appear on his knives reasons for using titanium were its exceptional strength to weight ratio and corrosion resistance emerson ground blades of these knives from ats 34 steel with a rockwell hardness of 57 59 and made them thicker toward tip creating a stronger tipped blade than he had made previously he bead blasted blades as he did liners and bolsters instead of rubbing or polishing them giving them a matte finish as opposed to mirror polished finish common on his earlier knives and other knives at time emerson designed each one of these knives for a specific purpose slender viper 1 and smaller viper 2 were designed for use as a police officer s backup weapon viper 5 was designed to be used by naval boat crews as handle was contoured with a rear brake so as to not slip from user s hand when wet and viper 3 was designed as a pure fighting knife with its 4 inch blade emerson s goal for this viper line was to produce a working knife which would be more resistant to elements and more durable than art knives for which he had become known these knives were created to satisfy demand for a practical field grade combat knife which could be carried discreetly and accessed quickly he sold these five models under name viper knives and changed logo on blades to read same emerson makes these models on a custom basis under names 5 mv standing for model viper specwar knives thumb alt five tanto bladed folding knives showing subtle differences in blade geometry five variants of cqc 6 top knife is a super sized version and with knife below features wave in 1986 individual navy seals from a west coast team had been using personally purchased custom fixed blade knives made by southern california knifemaker phill hartsfield hartsfield s knives were hard ground from differentially heat treated a2 tool steel and are known for their distinctive chisel ground blades more accurately they are zero ground that is edge has no secondary bevel minimizing drag when used for cutting purposes emerson had long been impressed by cutting ability of chisel ground edge and had asked hartsfield s permission to incorporate it into his own folding knives which hartsfield granted when seals asked hartsfield to make them a folding knife he informed them that he did not make folding knives and referred them to emerson according to seals requirements knife had to be corrosion resistant designed for easy cleaning in field durable enough to be used on a daily basis as a tool and capable as a weapon should need arise emerson s folding chisel ground tanto became sixth model in his viper series and while a handful of prototypes were referred to as viper 6 model was soon named cqc 6 cqc refers to close quarters combat and was chosen by seals for use ownership of a cqc 6 soon became something of a status symbol among members of various elite military units including navy seals army special forces german gsg 9 and british sas because of this connection to special warfare community emerson changed name of his custom knife line to specwar knives and in 1990 this new designation began appearing in logo on his blades other models followed in specwar line bearing cqc series moniker including cqc 7 which is another chisel ground tanto bladed folder similar to cqc 6 but with a saber type handle shape cqc 8 banana knife was a folder inspired by bob taylor s warrior knife and william f moran s st 23 is used by british sas troops knife has distinction of being first folding knife that was

made individually by hand popularizing tactical knife thumb alt a black tanto bladed fighting knife emerson neeley timberline specwar while not first knifemaker to build what is known as a tactical folding knife emerson was one of several makers who popularized concept of handmade tactical folder in 1980s emerson s knives began appearing in rogue warrior series of novels written by founder of us navy s seal team six richard marcinko at this time which helped fuel interest among collectors this surge in interest for emerson s knives soon became overwhelming although he had been making knives full time since 1994 emerson was still manufacturing these knives in his home garage workshop three years later as emerson watched his customers wait time expand from two years to seven he realized that demand for his handmade blades was far outpacing his ability to produce them first method to bridge this gap between supply and demand would be through factory collaborations with established cutlery companies emerson s first collaboration with a knife manufacturer was with timberline knives in 1993 for his specwar model according to stephen dick editor of tactical knives this collaboration was a result of navy deciding that only commercial designs would be considered due to failure of a previous custom knifemaker to deliver enough models to satisfy need this model featured a one side chisel ground tanto blade almost 1 4 inch 6 35 mm thick its handle was made from fiberglass reinforced nylon molded around a near full tang vaughn neeley of timberline designed sheath knife was originally a custom piece designed for naval special warfare group one and this factory version was soon entered in trials for navy seals knife in 1995 although it was not chosen by navy stephen dick reported that a number of members of seal team one privately purchased knife and were disappointed it was not made official blade emerson neeley specwar knife won blade magazines 1995 american made knife of year award at magazine s blade show in atlanta georgia and that same year and was displayed as an exhibit at metropolitan museum of modern art in new york city from may 24 to august 15 1995 thumb left alt two similar tanto bladed fighting knives one a custom other a factory piece emerson s custom cqc 6 alongside benchmade s 970 cqc 7 in 1994 president of benchmade knives les deasis approached emerson to manufacture cqc 6 on a larger scale as a factory production model preferring to keep cqc 6 as a custom only knife emerson instead licensed a similar design of his cqc 7 benchmade factory version was sold under model name or depending on blade length other designations followed which denoted blade finish manual or automatic opening or partially serrated blade knife retained profile of emerson s custom piece in addition to ats 34 steel and titanium liners however on benchmade s offering titanium bolsters and micarta scales were replaced with g10 fiberglass scales slotted screws were replaced by head screws and pocket clip was repositioned so that knife could be carried in pocket in a tip down position despite these changes knife was true to emerson s original design and even though it did not have craftsmanship of a handmade piece of cutlery it satisfied customers with their own version of emerson s work at a lower price point and without five year wait emerson knives inc first folding tanto with liner lock and g 10 emerson in february 1996 emerson and his wife mary founded emerson knives inc abbreviated as in torrance california to manufacture knives on a larger scale than he was then capable of this new company would be a distinct entity from his specwar custom knives although several custom designs would make their way into production lineup four years after starting this venture emerson sold an entire year s worth of production in four hours at shot shooting hunting and outdoor trade show in january 2000 emerson continued to collaborate with other companies on knife related projects as his own company grew in some cases these collaborators had become his competition such as gerber knives in 2002 emerson collaborated with gerber knives to

blade catcher which when snagged on edge of pocket or sheath causes knife blade to open as it is drawn due to its visual aesthetic emerson called this innovation wave and secured a patent for it in 1998 since another knife and tool company leatherman had trademarked name wave in march 1999 emerson changed its name to wave shaped opening feature emerson s wave made its way onto most of knives in both production and custom lines with exception of viper models it is a required feature on all knives that emerson supplies to military units search and rescue units and law enforcement agencies
