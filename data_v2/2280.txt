usually sceptical iona and peter opie this was based around idea that a bridge would collapse unless body of a human sacrifice was buried in its foundations and that watchman is actually a human sacrifice who will then watch over bridge however there is no archaeological evidence for any human remains in foundations of london bridge age and damage theory until mid eighteenth century old london bridge was only crossing on thames in london it was damaged in a major fire in 1633 but in fire of 1666 this damage acted as a fire break and prevented flames from further damaging bridge and crossing to south side of thames with its 19 narrow arches it impeded river traffic and flow central piers were removed to create a wider navigational span widening and removal of its houses was completed in 1763 but it remained relatively narrow and needed continual and expensive repairs in early nineteenth century it was decided to replace bridge with a new construction new london bridge
