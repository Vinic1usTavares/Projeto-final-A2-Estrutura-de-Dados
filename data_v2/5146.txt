stage in late 17th century restoration period enthralling audiences with action music dance moveable scenery baroque illusionistic painting gorgeous costumes and special effects such as trapdoor tricks flying actors and fireworks these shows have always had a bad reputation as a vulgar and commercial threat to witty legitimate restoration drama however they drew londoners in unprecedented numbers and left them dazzled and delighted basically home grown and with roots in early 17th century court masque though never ashamed of borrowing ideas and stage technology from french opera spectaculars are sometimes called english opera however variety of them is so untidy that most theatre historians despair of defining them as a genre at all hume 205 only a handful of works of this period are usually accorded term opera as musical dimension of most of them is subordinate to visual it was spectacle and scenery that drew in crowds as shown by many comments in diary of theatre lover samuel pepys hume 206 209 expense of mounting ever more elaborate scenic productions drove two competing theatre companies into a dangerous spiral of huge expenditure and correspondingly huge

for all its relied on opulent scenery however true spectacular of which milhous counts only eight over entire 1660 1700 restoration period was produced on a whole different scale spectacular is defined by large number of sets and performers required vast sums of money invested potential for great profits and long preparation time needed milhous calculates a likely requirement of at least four to six months of planning contracting building and rehearsing to be compared with four to six weeks of rehearsal time a new legitimate play would get milhous 45 48 previous generations of theatre historians have despised operatic spectaculars perhaps influenced by john dryden s sour comments about expensive and tasteless scenes machines and empty operas prologue spoken at opening of new house march 26 1674 new house refers to king s company s recently opened playhouse in drury lane however audiences loved scenes and machines and operas as samuel pepys diary shows dryden wrote several baroque machine plays himself first state of innocence 1677 was never staged as his designated company king s had neither capital nor machinery for it a dramatisation of john milton s paradise lost it called for rebellious angels wheeling in air and seeming transfixed with thunderbolts over a lake of brimstone or rolling fire king s company s theatre royal drury lane was not up to lakes of rolling

crocodile suit there are no extant drawings or descriptions of machinery and sets for restoration theatre although some documentation exists for court masques from first half of 17th century notably work of inigo jones and his pupil john webb one reason for lack of information for public theatres is that stage effects and particularly machines were trade secrets inventors of theatrical effects took great pains to hold on to their secrets and playhouses guarded their machine workings as zealously as a magician guards her or his tricks what technology and visual experiences were can only be tenuously inferred from stage directions milhous concludes from a review of dorset garden performances that at a conservative estimate theatre was equipped to fly at least four people independently and had some very complex floor traps for transformations such as that of proteus milhous 46 plates printed in first edition of elkanah settle s empress of morocco 1673 see detail top right are only pictures of actual restoration stage sets pepys mentions of stage effects in his diary 1660 68 give modern reader some help in visualising what audiences saw in 1660s and even more in entering into their enthusiasms but 1660s were still early days there are scarcely any descriptions or reactions preserved from heyday of machine play in 1670s 90s although a general idea of its technology can be gathered from better documented french and italian opera scenery which inspired thomas betterton at dorset garden theatre although based on continental sources diagrams and animations of changeable scenery and machines at appalachian state university s website development of scenic spectacle give some idea of restoration theatrical technology 1625 1660 court masques and stealth performances

davenant s spolia 1640 for instance last of court masques before civil war queen henrietta maria pregnant at time makes her entrance descending by a theatrical device from a cloud as early as 1639 davenant had obtained a royal patent authorising construction of a large new public theatre with technology that would allow such effects and accommodate music scenery and dancing such an invasion of court drama technique in public theatre met opposition from legitimate dramatists and before opposition could be overcome war had closed down theatres in 1642 freehafer passim public stage ban 1642 60 imposed by puritan regime represents a long and sharp break in dramatic tradition but was still never completely successful in suppressing ideologically hateful make believe of play acting performances in grand private houses were not unusual and could have quite elaborate sets as can be seen from extant drawings for original performance of davenant s opera siege of rhodes 1656 at his home rutland house this was public theatre in all but name as davenant charged 5 shillings for admission some professional actors also managed to scrape a living and evade authorities in stealth acting companies in london such as that of michael mohun at red bull theatre professional writers from previous era were growing middle aged biding their time and hoping for monarchy to be restored by later 1650s it was becoming obvious that that time was at hand and william davenant for example stepped up his theatrical activities sir william davenant from dictionary of literary biography volume

lifted at restoration of monarchy in 1660 charles ii immediately encouraged drama and took a personal interest in scramble for acting licences and performance rights which followed two middle aged pre commonwealth playwrights notable for their loyalty during charles exile emerged from struggle with royal letters patent for new or refurbished patent theatre companies thomas killigrew and william davenant killigrew was able to take over michael mohun s skilled veteran troupe for his king s company and to start with what was essentially a going concern hume with added advantage of traditional performance rights mohun brought with him for practically whole classic repertory of william shakespeare ben jonson and beaumont and fletcher team competition davenant s duke s company seemed doomed to a secondary position with its young scratched together troupe and scarcely any performance rights they were only allowed to put on abridged and modernized versions of shakespeare plays and a few that davenant had written however davenant a brilliant impresario hume was soon able to turn tables on killigrew by realising his old pre civil war dream of music dance and spectacular visual effects on public stage hume 233 238 thumb upright michael mohun best actor in world during autumn of 1660 while duke s company was still getting financed mostly by means of actors buying company shares and having temporary quarters set up king s company offered a string of well received productions their new albeit traditional theatre in vere street was already fully operational devoted playgoer samuel pepys called it finest playhouse that ever was in england in his diary a sentiment he would need to revise many times over coming decade and recorded his awe at seeing michael mohun who is said to be

even within acts scene change animation from development of scenic spectacle production was a revamped version of davenant s own five year old opera siege of rhodes it is not known who painted scenes or shutters or whether continental craftsmen were responsible for technical construction but result was such a sensation that it brought charles ii to a public theatre for first time competing king s company suddenly found itself playing to empty houses as pepys notes on 4 july i went to theatre in vere street and there i saw first time i ever saw it well acted but strange to see this house that use to be so thronged now empty since opera begun and so will continue for a while i believe siege of rhodes continued acting 12 days without interruption with great applause according to prompter john downes in his historical review of stage roscius anglicanus 1708 this was a remarkable run for limited potential audience of time as four more acclaimed duke s company productions with scenes followed at lincoln s inn fields in course of 1661 including hamlet all highly admired by pepys king s company had no other recourse than to hastily commission a changeable scenery playhouse of their own bowing to inevitable just seven months after opening of lincoln s inn fields killigrew and his actors signed orders for a new even more magnificent theatre in bridges street this theatre first step in war of spectacle escalation of 1660s was so full when pepys and his wife went to see an opera there that they told us we could have no room large yet compact restoration playhouses with audience capacities from 700 bridges street to upwards of 2 000 next house on same site theatre royal drury lane finished in 1674 were enormous investments financed through selling shares in companies which were thus bound to make more and more money from ticket sales not only theatres and their technical equipment but flats painted for a single performance special effects and elaborate stage clothes were extremely expensive audiences appreciated both luxury and appropriateness of decor and costume pepys was quite capable of going several times to see a play that as such he disliked purely for pleasure of viewing striking and innovative scenery like a good scene of a town on fire companies struggled to outdo each other in catering to these expensive tastes with precarious finances and ever present consciousness that investments could literally burn to ground in a few hours when theatre in bridges street did burn down in january 1672 with its entire stock of scenery and costumes it was an economic blow from which king s company s never recovered milhous 23 duke s company operating smoothly under what soon became davenant s and thomas betterton s joint management consistently led way while king s lagged further and further behind moving only in forced response and suffering from chronic management conflict between killigrew and powerful actor shareholders like michael mohun and charles hart who insisted on actor centred talk drama difference can be traced in pepys regular preference for performances at duke s and in his ever renewed admiration for betterton s acting in december 1667 king s company even ceased acting for some days because of a quarrel between mohun and hart with escalation of expense days with zero takings were a very serious matter crowning grand

messy ownership situation for duke s company and pepys eyesight forced him to stop keeping a diary thomas betterton though formally a minority shareholder continued to run duke s company and in spirit of davenant commissioned most elaborate of restoration playhouses theatre at dorset garden or dorset gardens with a flat for himself on top although dorset garden theatre quickly became a famous and

technical capacities of dorset garden were little used for restoration comedy and while most heroic drama included some scenes that showed off perspective stage or used some of simpler machines spectacle on this limited scale could be just as well staged at drury lane plays for which dorset garden was built machine plays of 1670s and 1680s and operas of 1690s were a category to themselves different from ordinary serious drama more static more mythological much more gorgeous infinitely more expensive so elaborate was scale of these productions and so long each preparation time that only five machine plays were produced during 1670s yet they were hugely important for finances of duke s company mostly in a positive sense they were davenant s version of macbeth 1672 73 settle s empress

stage direction act 3 gold cupids on columns are due to come to life and jump off use of perspective scenery and many arches is evident here creating an illusion of first court being at a good distance and next at a mighty distance this creation of fake depth was a favourite device repeated when scene changed halfway through act scene changes to principal street of city with vast numbers of people looking down from tops of houses and out of windows and balconies which are hung with tapestry in this street is a large triumphal arch with columns of doric order adorned with statues of fame

in these mass scene stage directions dance scenes like that of cyclops and all cupids who will join them on floor minutes later rely on coordination choreography and generous collective effects of course many highly paid dancers would be busy in many roles returning as townspeople after scene change of act 3 with most of gold paint hastily washed off and entranced looking upwards to see mars and venus meet in air in their chariots his drawn by horses and hers by doves each production was a gamble aspect of machine plays that posterity knows most about is their economics as this was what old prompter downes most vividly recalled when he wrote his roscius anglicanus in 1708 scenery alone for psyche cost more than ps800 which can be related to entire annual box office takings for company of ps10 000 ticket prices for these performances would be raised to up to four times normal both psyche and tempest actually complained of production costs in their hinting pointedly that public ought to reward poor players for their risk taking and for offering splendours that had so far been reserved for royal masques we have d all we have to treat you here and therefore sirs you should not be severe we in one vessel have d all loss should we be d were not small poor players have this day that splendor shown which yet but by great monarchs has been done psyche epilogue audience apparently agreed transfixed by such sights as venus ascending into heavens and being almost lost in clouds whereupon cupid flies up and gets into her chariot and brings her back followed by jupiter appearing on a flying eagle psyche turned out highly profitable it is altogether a pattern that 1670s productions did make money while those of 1680s and 1690s barely broke even or were actual

economics of restoration spectacular spiralled out of control with magnificent production of fairy queen in 1691 92 season it was a great popular success but so stuffed with special effects and so
