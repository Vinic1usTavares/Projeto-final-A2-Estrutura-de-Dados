council of european union referred to in treaties and other official documents simply as council is third of seven institutions of european union eu as listed in treaty on european union it is one of two legislative bodies and together with european parliament serves to amend and approve proposals of european commission council represents executive governments of eu s member states and is based in europa building in brussels council of european union and european council are only eu institutions that are explicitly intergovernmental that is forums whose attendees express and represent position of their member state s executive be they ambassadors ministers or heads of state government council meets in 10 different configurations of 28 national ministers one per state precise membership of these configurations varies according to topic under consideration for example when discussing agricultural policy council is formed by 28 national ministers whose portfolio includes this policy area with related european commissioners contributing but not voting composition presidency of council rotates every six months among governments of eu member states with relevant ministers of respective country holding presidency at any given time ensuring smooth running of meetings and setting daily agenda continuity between presidencies is provided by an arrangement under which three successive presidencies known as presidency trios share common political programmes foreign affairs council national foreign ministers is however chaired by union s high representative its decisions are made by qualified majority voting in most areas unanimity in others or just simple majority for procedural issues usually where it operates unanimously it only needs to consult parliament however in most areas ordinary legislative procedure applies meaning both council and parliament share legislative and budgetary powers equally meaning both have to agree for a proposal to pass in a few limited areas council may initiate new eu law itself general secretariat of council of european union also known as council secretariat assists council of european union presidency of council of european union european council and president of european council secretariat is headed by secretary general of council of european union secretariat is divided into seven directorates general each administered by a director general history council first appeared in european coal and steel community ecsc as special council of ministers set up to counterbalance high authority supranational executive now commission original council had limited powers issues relating only to coal and steel were in authority s domain and council s consent was only required on decisions outside coal and steel as a whole council only scrutinised high authority executive in 1957 treaties of rome established two new communities and with them two new councils council of european atomic energy community eaec and council of european economic community eec however due to objections over supranational power of authority their councils had more powers new executive bodies were known as commissions in 1965 council was hit by empty chair crisis due to disagreements between french president charles de gaulle and commission s agriculture proposals among other things france boycotted all meetings of council this halted council s work until impasse was resolved following year by luxembourg compromise although initiated by a gamble of president of commission walter who later on lost presidency crisis exposed flaws in council s workings under merger treaty of 1967 ecsc s special council of ministers and council of eaec together with their other independent institutions were merged into council of eec which would act as a single council of european communities in 1993 council adopted name council of european union following establishment of european union by maastricht treaty that treaty strengthened council with addition of more intergovernmental elements in three pillars system however at same time parliament and commission had been strengthened inside community pillar curtailing ability of council to act independently treaty of lisbon abolished pillar system and gave further powers to parliament it also merged council s high representative with commission s foreign policy head with this new figure chairing foreign affairs council rather than rotating presidency european council was declared a separate institution from council also chaired by a permanent president and different council configurations were mentioned in treaties for first time development of council has been characterised by rise in power of parliament with which council has had to share its legislative powers parliament has often provided opposition to council s wishes this has in some cases led to clashes between both bodies with council s system of contradicting developing parliamentary system and supranational principles powers and functions primary purpose of council is to act as one of two vetoing bodies of eu s legislative branch other being european parliament together they serve to amend approve or disapprove proposals of european commission which has sole power to propose laws jointly with parliament council holds budgetary power of union and has greater control than parliament over more intergovernmental areas of eu such as foreign policy and macroeconomic co ordination finally before entry into force of treaty of lisbon it formally held executive power of eu which it conferred upon european commission legislative procedure thumb 300px simplified illustration of voting rules that apply within ordinary legislative procedure actual procedure involves various stages of consultations aimed at achieving compromise between positions of two legislative chambers eu s legislative authority is divided between council parliament and commission as relationships and powers of these institutions have developed various legislative procedures have been created for adopting laws in early times avis maxim was commission proposes and council disposes but now vast majority of laws are now subject to ordinary legislative procedure which works on principle that consent from both council and parliament are required before a law may be adopted under this procedure commission presents a proposal to parliament and council following its first reading parliament may propose amendments if council accepts these amendments then legislation is approved if it does not then it adopts a common position and submits that new version to parliament at its second reading if parliament approves text or does not act text is adopted otherwise parliament may propose further amendments to council s proposal it may be rejected out right by an absolute majority of meps if council still does not approve parliament s position then text is taken to a conciliation committee composed of council members plus an equal number of meps if a committee manages to adopt a joint text it then has to be approved in a third reading by both council and parliament or proposal is abandoned few other areas that operate special legislative procedures are justice home affairs budget and taxation and certain aspects of other policy areas such as fiscal aspects of environmental policy in these areas council or parliament decide law alone procedure used also depends upon which type of institutional act is being used strongest act is a regulation an act or law which is directly applicable in its entirety then there are directives which bind members to certain goals which they must achieve but they do this through their own laws and hence have room to manoeuvre in deciding upon them a decision is an instrument which is focused at a particular person or group and is directly applicable institutions may also issue recommendations and opinions which are merely non binding declarations council votes in one of three ways unanimity simple majority or qualified majority in most cases council votes on issues by qualified majority voting meaning that there must be a minimum of 55 of member states agreeing at least 15 who together represent at least 65 of eu population a blocking minority can only be formed by at least 4 member states representing at least 35 of eu population foreign affairs legal instruments used by council for common foreign and security policy are different from legislative acts under cfsp they consist of common positions joint actions and common strategies common positions relate to defining a european foreign policy towards a particular third country such as promotion of human rights and democracy in myanmar a region such as stabilisation efforts in african great lakes or a certain issue such as support for international criminal court a common position once agreed is binding on all eu states who must follow and defend policy which is regularly revised a joint action refers to a co ordinated action of states to deploy resources to achieve an objective for example for mine clearing or to combat spread of small arms common strategies defined an objective and commits eus resources to that task for four years budgetary authority furthermore legislative branch officially holds union s budgetary authority eu s budget which is around 155 billion euro is subject to a form of ordinary legislative procedure with a single reading giving parliament power over entire budget prior to 2009 its influence was limited to certain areas on an equal footing to council if there is a disagreement between them it is taken to a conciliation committee as it is for legislative proposals but if joint conciliation text is not approved parliament may adopt budget definitively in addition to budget council coordinates economic policy of members organisation council s rules of procedure contain provisions necessary for its organisation and functioning presidency presidency of council is not a single post but is held by a member state s government every six months presidency rotates among states in an order predefined by council s members allowing each state to preside over body from 2007 every three member states co operate for their combined eighteen months on a common agenda although only one formally holds presidency for normal six month period for example president for second half of 2007 portugal was second in a trio of states alongside germany and slovenia with whom portugal had been co operating council meets in various configurations as outlined below so its membership changes depending upon issue person chairing council will always be member from state holding presidency a delegate from following presidency also assists presiding member and may take over work if requested exception however is foreign affairs council which has been chaired by high representative since entry into force of lisbon treaty role of presidency is administrative and political on administrative side it is responsible for procedures and organising work of council during its term this includes summoning council for meetings along with directing work of coreper and other committees and working groups political element is role of successfully dealing with issues and mediating in council in particular this includes setting agenda of council hence giving presidency substantial influence in work of council during its term presidency also plays a major role in representing council within eu and representing eu internationally for example at united nations configurations legally speaking council is a single entity this means that technically any council configuration can adopt decisions that fall within remit of any other council configuration but it is in practice divided into several different council configurations or con formations article 16 6 of treaty on european union provides each council configuration deals with a different functional area for example agriculture and fisheries in this formation council is composed of ministers from each state government who are responsible for this area agriculture and fisheries ministers chair of this council is held by member from state holding presidency see section above similarly economic and financial affairs council is composed of national finance ministers and they are still one per state and chair is held by member coming from presiding country councils meet irregularly throughout year except for three major configurations top three below which meet once a month there are currently ten formations general affairs gac general affairs co ordinates work of council prepares for european council meetings and deals with issues crossing various council formations foreign affairs fac chaired by high representative rather than presidency it manages cfsp csdp trade and development co operation it sometimes meets in a defence configuration thumb since 2017 europa building seen here has been seat of council economic and financial affairs ecofin composed of economics and finance ministers of member states it includes budgetary and eurozone matters via an informal group composed only of eurozone member ministers agriculture and fisheries composed of agriculture and fisheries ministers of member states it considers matters concerning common agricultural policy common fisheries policy forestry organic farming food and feed safety seeds pesticides and fisheries justice and home affairs jha this configuration brings together justice ministers and interior ministers of member states includes civil protection employment social policy health and consumer affairs composed of employment social protection consumer protection health and equal opportunities ministers competitiveness created in june 2002 through merging of three previous configurations internal market industry and research depending on items on agenda this formation is composed of ministers responsible for areas such as european affairs industry tourism and scientific research with entry into force of lisbon treaty eu acquired competence in space matters art 4 of treaty on functioning of eu http eur lex europa eu lexuriserv lexuriserv do uri oj c 2010 083 0200 en pdf and space policy has been attributed to competitiveness council transport telecommunications and energy created in june 2002 through merging of three policies under one configuration and with a composition varying according to specific items on its agenda this formation meets approximately once every two months environment composed of environment ministers who meet about four times a year education youth culture and sport composed of education culture youth communications and sport ministers who meet around three or four times a year includes audiovisual issues complementing these political and security committee psc brings together ambassadors to monitor international situations and define policies within csdp particularly in crises european council is similar to a configuration of council and operates in a similar way but is composed of national leaders heads of government or state and has its own president currently donald tusk body s purpose is to define general impetus of union european council deals with major issues such as appointment of president of european commission who takes part in body s meetings ecofin s eurozone component euro group is also a formal group with its own president its european council counterpart is euro summit formalized in 2011 and following entry into force of a framework agreement between eu and esa there is a space council configuration a joint and concomitant meeting of eu council and of esa council at ministerial level dealing with implementation of esp adopted by both organisations administration general secretariat of council provides continuous infrastructure of council carrying out preparation for meetings draft reports translation records documents agendas and assisting presidency secretary general of council is head of secretariat secretariat is divided into seven directorates general each administered by a director general committee of permanent representatives coreper is a body composed of representatives from states ambassadors civil servants etc who meet each week to prepare work and tasks of council it monitors and co ordinates work and deals with parliament on co decision legislation it is divided into two groups of representatives coreper ii and their deputies coreper i agriculture is dealt with separately by special committee on agriculture sca numerous working groups submit their reports to council through coreper or sca governments represented in council treaty of lisbon mandated a change in voting system from 1 november 2014 for most cases to double majority qualified majority voting replacing voting weights system decisions made by council have to be taken by 55 of member states representing at least 65 of eu s population almost all members of council are members of a political party at national level and most of these are members of a european level political party however council is composed to represent member states rather than political parties and nature of coalition governments in a number of states means that party breakdown at different configuration of council vary depending on which domestic party was assigned portfolio however broad ideological alignment of government in each state does influence nature of law council produces and extent to which link between domestic parties puts pressure on members in european parliament to vote a certain way location by a decision of european council at edinburgh in december 1992 council has its seat in brussels but in april june and october it holds its meetings in luxembourg city between 1952 and 1967 ecsc council held its luxembourg city meetings in cercle municipal on place d armes its secretariat moved on numerous occasions but between 1955 and 1967 it was housed in district of city in 1957 with creation of two new communities with their own councils discretion on location was given to current president in practice this was to be in chateau of val duchesse until autumn of 1958 at which point it moved to 2 rue in brussels 1965 agreement finalised by edinburgh agreement and annexed to treaties on location of newly merged institutions council was to be in brussels but would meet in luxembourg city during april june and october ecsc secretariat moved from luxembourg city to merged body council secretariat in ravenstein building of brussels in 1971 council and its secretariat moved into charlemagne building next to commission s but council rapidly ran out of space and administrative branch of secretariat moved to a building at 76 rue joseph ii jozef ii straat and during 1980s language divisions moved out into frere orban and guimard buildings in 1995 council moved into justus lipsius building across road from charlemagne however its staff was still increasing so it continued to rent frere orban building to house finnish and swedish language divisions staff continued to increase and council rented in addition to owning justus lipsius froissart espace rolin and woluwe heights buildings since acquiring lex building in 2008 three aforementioned buildings are no longer in use by council services when council is meeting in luxembourg city it meets in kirchberg conference centre and its offices are based at european centre on plateau du kirchberg council has also met occasionally in strasbourg in various other cities and also outside union for example in 1974 when it met in tokyo and washington d c while trade and energy talks were taking place under council s present rules of procedures council can in extraordinary circumstances hold one of its meetings outside brussels and luxembourg from 2017 both council of european union and european council adopted purpose built europa building as their official headquarters although they continue to utilise facilities afforded by adjacent justus lipsius
