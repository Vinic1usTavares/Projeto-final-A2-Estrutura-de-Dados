galapagos tortoise complex or galapagos giant tortoise complex chelonoidis nigra and related species are largest living species of tortoise modern galapagos tortoises can weigh up to today giant tortoises exist on only two remote archipelagos galapagos islands 1000 km due west of mainland ecuador and aldabrachelys gigantea of aldabra in indian ocean 700 km east of tanzania galapagos tortoises are native to seven of galapagos islands a volcanic archipelago about west of ecuadorian mainland with lifespans in wild of over 100 years it is one of longest lived vertebrates a captive individual lived at least 170 years spanish explorers who discovered islands in 16th century named them after spanish meaning tortoise shell size and shape vary between populations on islands with humid highlands tortoises are larger with domed shells and short necks on islands with dry lowlands tortoises are smaller with saddleback shells and long necks charles darwin s observations of these differences on second voyage of beagle in 1835 contributed to development of his theory of evolution tortoise numbers declined from over 250 000 in 16th century to a low of around 3 000 in 1970s this decline was caused by overexploitation of species for meat and oil habitat clearance for agriculture and introduction of non native animals to islands such as rats goats and pigs extinction of most giant tortoise lineages is thought to have also been caused by predation by humans or human ancestors as tortoises themselves have no natural predators tortoise populations on at least three islands have become extinct in historical times due to human activities specimens of these extinct taxa exist in several museums and also are being subjected to dna analysis 10 species of original 15 survive in wild an 11th species chelonoidis abingdonii had only a single known living individual kept in captivity and nicknamed lonesome george until his death in june 2012 conservation efforts beginning in 20th century have resulted in thousands of captive bred juveniles being released onto their ancestral home islands and total number of species is estimated to have exceeded 19 000 at start of 21st century despite this rebound species as a whole is classified as vulnerable by international union for conservation of nature taxonomy early classification galapagos islands were discovered in 1535 but first appeared on maps of gerardus mercator and abraham ortelius around 1570 islands were named insulae de los islands of tortoises in reference to giant tortoises found there first navigation chart showing individual islands was drawn up by pirate ambrose cowley in 1684 he named them after fellow pirates or english noblemen more recently ecuadorian government gave most of islands spanish names while spanish names are official many researchers continue to use older english names particularly as those were names used when darwin visited this article uses spanish island names initially giant tortoises of indian ocean and those from galapagos were considered to be same species naturalists thought that sailors had transported tortoises there in 1676 pre linnaean authority claude perrault referred to both species as tortue des indes in 1783 johann gottlob schneider classified all giant tortoises as testudo indica indian tortoise in 1812 august friedrich schweigger named them testudo gigantea gigantic tortoise in 1834 andre marie constant dumeril and gabriel bibron classified galapagos tortoises as a separate species which they named testudo nigrita black tortoise thumb alt black and white photograph of walter rothschild straddling an adult galapagos tortoise rothschild is a victorian gentleman sporting a beard and top hat walter rothschild of two galapagos tortoise species recognition of subpopulations first systematic survey of giant tortoises was by zoologist albert gunther of british museum in 1875 gunther identified at least five distinct populations from galapagos and three from indian ocean islands he expanded list in 1877 to six from galapagos four from seychelles and four from mascarenes gunther hypothesized that all giant tortoises descended from a single ancestral population which spread by sunken land bridges this hypothesis was later disproven by understanding that galapagos seychelles and mascarene islands are all of recent volcanic origin and have never been linked to a continent by land bridges galapagos tortoises are now thought to have descended from a south american ancestor while indian ocean tortoises derived from ancestral populations on madagascar at end of 19th century georg baur and walter rothschild recognised five more populations of galapagos tortoise in 1905 06 an expedition by california academy of sciences with joseph r slevin in charge of reptiles collected specimens which were studied by academy herpetologist john van denburgh he identified four additional populations and proposed existence of 15 species van denburgh s list still guides taxonomy of galapagos tortoise though now 10 populations are thought to have existed current species and genus names current specific designation of nigra black quoy gaimard 1824b was resurrected in 1984 after it was discovered to be senior synonym an older taxonomic synonym taking historical precedence for then commonly used species name of elephantopus elephant footed harlan 1827 quoy and gaimard s latin description explains use of nigra testudo toto corpore nigro means tortoise with completely black body quoy and described nigra from a living specimen but no evidence indicates they knew of its accurate provenance within galapagos locality was in fact given as california garman proposed linking of nigra with extinct floreana species later pritchard deemed it convenient to accept this designation despite its for minimal disruption to already confused nomenclature of species even more senior species synonym of californiana californian quoy gaimard 1824a is considered a nomen oblitum forgotten name previously galapagos tortoise was considered to belong to genus geochelone known as typical tortoises or terrestrial turtles in 1990s subgenus chelonoidis was elevated to generic status based on phylogenetic evidence which grouped south american members of geochelone into an independent clade branch of tree of life this nomenclature has been adopted by several authorities tortoise freshwater turtle specialist group 2016 chelonoidis nigra iucn red list of threatened species species thumb alt a map of galapagos with labels for names of

archipelago up to 15 species of galapagos tortoises have been identified although only 11 survive to this day six are found on separate islands five of them on volcanoes of isabela island several of surviving species are seriously endangered one of species c abingdonii from pinta island is considered extinct last known specimen named lonesome george died in captivity on 24 june 2012 george had been mated with female tortoises of several other species but none of eggs from these pairings hatched species inhabiting floreana island g nigra is thought to have been hunted to extinction by 1850 only 15 years after charles darwin s landmark visit of 1835 when he saw shells but no live tortoises there however recent dna testing shows that an intermixed non native population currently existing on island of isabela is of genetic resemblance to species native to floreana suggesting that g nigra has not gone entirely extinct existence of c phantastica species of fernandina island is disputed as it was described from a single specimen that may have been an artificial introduction to island however a live female was found in 2019 likely confirming species validity prior to widespread knowledge of differences between populations sometimes called races from different islands and volcanoes captive collections in zoos were indiscriminately mixed fertile offspring resulted from pairings of animals from different races however captive crosses between tortoises from different races have lower fertility and higher mortality than those between tortoises of same race and captives in mixed herds normally direct courtship only toward members of same race valid scientific names of each of individual populations are not universally accepted and some researchers still consider each

tortoises evolved from common ancestors that arrived from mainland south america by overwater dispersal genetic studies have shown that chaco tortoise of argentina and paraguay is their closest living relative minimal founding population was a pregnant female or a breeding pair survival on 1000 km oceanic journey is accounted for because tortoises are buoyant can breathe by extending their necks above water and are able to survive months without food or fresh water as they are poor swimmers journey was probably a passive one facilitated by humboldt current which diverts westwards towards galapagos islands from mainland ancestors of genus chelonoidis are believed to have similarly dispersed from africa to south america during oligocene closest living relative though not a direct ancestor of galapagos giant tortoise is chaco tortoise chelonoidis chilensis a much smaller species from south america divergence between c chilensis and c nigra probably occurred 6 12 million years ago an evolutionary event preceding volcanic formation of oldest modern galapagos islands 5 million years ago mitochondrial dna analysis indicates that oldest existing islands espanola and san cristobal were colonised first and that these populations seeded younger islands via dispersal in a stepping stone fashion via local currents restricted gene flow between isolated islands then resulted in independent evolution of populations into divergent forms observed in modern species evolutionary relationships between species thus echo volcanic history of islands species modern dna methods have revealed new information on relationships between species isabela island five populations living on largest island isabela are ones that are subject of most debate as to whether they are true species or just distinct populations or subspecies it is widely accepted that population living on northernmost volcano volcan wolf is genetically independent from four populations to south and is therefore a separate species it is thought to be derived from a different colonization event than others a colonization from island of santiago apparently gave rise to volcan wolf species c becki while four southern populations are believed to be descended from a second colonization from more southerly island of santa cruz tortoises from santa cruz are thought to have first colonized sierra negra volcano which was first of island s volcanoes to form tortoises then spread north to each newly created volcano resulting in populations living on volcan alcedo and then volcan darwin recent genetic evidence shows that these two populations are genetically distinct from each other and from population living on sierra negra c guentheri and therefore form species c vandenburghi alcedo and c microphyes darwin fifth population living on southernmost volcano c vicina is thought to have split off from sierra negra population more recently and is therefore not as genetically different as other two isabela is most recently formed island tortoises inhabit so its populations have had less time to evolve independently than populations on other islands but according to some researchers they are all genetically different and should each be considered as separate species floreana island phylogenetic analysis may help to resurrect extinct species of floreana c nigra a species known only from subfossil remains some tortoises from isabela were found to be a partial match for genetic profile of floreana specimens from museum collections possibly indicating presence of hybrids from a population transported by humans from floreana to isabela resulting either from individuals deliberately transported between islands or from individuals thrown overboard from ships to lighten load nine floreana descendants have been identified in captive population of fausto breeding center on santa cruz genetic footprint was identified in genomes of hybrid offspring this allows possibility of re establishing a reconstructed species from selective breeding of hybrid animals furthermore individuals from species possibly are still extant genetic analysis from a sample of tortoises from volcan wolf found 84 first generation c nigra hybrids some less than 15 years old genetic diversity of these individuals is estimated to have required 38 c nigra parents many of which could still be alive on isabela island pinta island thumb c abingdonii lonesome george at charles darwin research station in 2006 pinta island species c abingdonii now extinct has been found to be most closely related to species on islands of san cristobal c chathamensis and espanola c hoodensis which lie over 300 km 190 mi away rather than that on neighbouring island of isabela as previously assumed this relationship is attributable to dispersal by strong local current from san cristobal towards pinta this discovery informed further attempts to preserve c abingdonii lineage and search for an appropriate mate for lonesome george which had been penned with females from isabela hope was bolstered by discovery of a c abingdonii hybrid male in volcan wolf population on northern isabela raising possibility that more undiscovered living pinta descendants exist santa cruz island mitochondrial dna studies of tortoises on santa cruz show up to three genetically distinct lineages found in nonoverlapping population distributions around regions of cerro montura cerro fatal and la caseta although traditionally grouped into a single species c porteri lineages are all more closely related to tortoises on other islands than to each other cerro montura tortoises are most closely related to g duncanensis from pinzon cerro fatal to g chathamensis from san cristobal and la caseta to four southern races of isabela as well as floreana tortoises in 2015 cerro fatal tortoises were described as a distinct taxon prior to identification of this species through genetic analysis it was noted that there existed differences in shells between cerro fatal tortoises and other tortoises on santa cruz by classifying cerro fatal tortoises into a new taxon greater attention can be paid to protecting its habitat according to caccone who is a member of team making this classification pinzon island when it was discovered that central small island of pinzon had only 100 200 very old adults and no young tortoises had survived into adulthood for perhaps more than 70 years resident scientists initiated what would eventually become giant tortoise breeding and rearing program over next 50 years this program resulted in major successes in recovery of giant tortoise populations throughout archipelago in 1965 first tortoise eggs collected from natural nests on pinzon island were brought to charles darwin research station where they would complete period of incubation and then hatch becoming first young tortoises to be reared in captivity introduction of black rats onto pinzon sometime in latter half of 19th century had resulted in complete eradication of all young tortoises black rats had been eating both tortoise eggs and hatchlings effectively destroying future of tortoise population only longevity of giant tortoises allowed them to survive until galapagos national park island conservation charles darwin foundation raptor center and bell laboratories removed invasive rats in 2012 in 2013 heralding an important step in pinzon tortoise recovery hatchlings emerged from native pinzon tortoise nests on island and galapagos national park successfully returned 118 hatchlings to their native island home partners returned to pinzon island in late 2014 and continued to observe hatchling tortoises now older indicating that natural recruitment is occurring on island unimpeded they also discovered a snail species new to science these exciting results highlight conservation value of this important management action in early 2015 after extensive monitoring partners confirmed that pinzon and plaza sur islands are now both rodent free espanola on southern island of espanola only 14 adult tortoises were found two males and 12 females tortoises apparently were not encountering one another so no reproduction was occurring between 1963 and 1974 all 14 adult tortoises discovered on island were brought to tortoise center on santa cruz and a tortoise breeding program was initiated in 1977 a third espanola male tortoise was returned to galapagos from san diego zoo and joined breeding group after 40 years work reintroducing captive animals a detailed study of island s ecosystem has confirmed it has a stable breeding population where once 15 were known now more than 1 000 giant tortoises inhabit island of espanola one research team has found that more than half tortoises released since first reintroductions are still alive and they are breeding well enough for population to progress onward unaided fernandina c phantastica species from fernandina was originally known from a single specimen an old male from voyage of 1905 06 no other tortoises or remains were found on island for a long time after its sighting leading to suggestions that specimen was an artificial introduction from elsewhere fernandina has neither human settlements nor feral mammals so if this species ever did exist its extinction would have been by natural means such as volcanic activity nevertheless there have occasionally been reports from fernandina in 2019 an elderly female specimen was finally discovered on fernandina and transferred to a breeding center and trace evidence found on expedition indicates that more individuals likely exist in wild it has been theorized that rarity of species may be due to harsh habitat it survives in such as lava flows that are known to frequently cover island species of doubtful existence species were described from two other islands but their existence is based on scant evidence purported rabida island species c wallacei was described from a single specimen collected by california academy of sciences in december 1905 which has since been lost this individual was probably an artificial introduction from another island that was originally penned on rabida next to a good anchorage as no contemporary whaling or sealing logs mention removing tortoises from this island santa fe species has no binomial name having been described from limited evidence of bone fragments but no shells most durable part of 14 individuals old eggs and old dung found on island in 1905 06 island has never been inhabited by man nor had any introduced predators remains are considered artificial introductions possibly from camping at good anchorage on island description thumb galapagos tortoise at rostock zoo tortoises have a large bony shell of a dull brown or gray colour plates of shell are fused with ribs in a rigid protective structure that is integral to skeleton lichens can grow on shells of these slow moving animals tortoises keep a characteristic scute shell segment pattern on their shells throughout life though annual growth bands are not useful for determining age because outer layers are worn off with time a tortoise can withdraw its head neck and fore limbs into its shell for protection legs are large and stumpy with dry scaly skin and hard scales front legs have five claws back legs four gigantism discoverer of galapagos islands fray tomas de berlanga bishop of panama wrote in 1535 of such big tortoises that each could carry a man on top of himself naturalist charles darwin remarked after his trip three centuries later in 1835 these animals grow to an immense size several so large that it required six or eight men to lift them from ground largest recorded individuals have reached weights of over and lengths of size overlap is extensive with aldabra giant tortoise however taken as a species galapagos tortoise seems to average slightly larger with weights in excess of being slightly more commonplace weights in larger bodied species range from in mature males and from in adult females however size is variable across islands and species those from pinzon island are relatively small with a maximum known weight of and carapace length of approximately compared to range in tortoises from santa cruz island f galapagos tortoise conservation program plight and future for pinzon island tortoise tortoises gigantism was probably a trait useful on continents that was fortuitously helpful for successful colonisation of these remote oceanic islands rather than an example of evolved insular gigantism large tortoises would have a greater chance of surviving journey over water from mainland as they can hold their heads a greater height above water level and have a smaller surface area volume ratio which reduces osmotic water loss their significant water and fat reserves would allow tortoises to survive long ocean crossings without food or fresh water and to endure drought prone climate of islands a larger size allowed them to better tolerate extremes of temperature due to gigantothermy fossil giant tortoises from mainland south america have been described that support this hypothesis of gigantism that pre existed colonization of islands shell shape galapagos tortoises possess two main shell forms that correlate with biogeographic history of species group they exhibit a spectrum of carapace morphology ranging from saddleback denoting upward arching of front edge of shell resembling a saddle to domed denoting a rounded convex surface resembling a dome when a saddleback tortoise withdraws its head and forelimbs into its shell a large unprotected gap remains over neck evidence of lack of predation during evolution of this structure larger islands with humid highlands over in elevation such as santa cruz have abundant vegetation near ground tortoises native to these environments tend to have domed shells and are larger with shorter necks and limbs saddleback tortoises originate from small islands less than in elevation with dry habitats e g espanola and pinzon that are more limited in food and other resources two lineages of galapagos tortoises possess island of santa cruz and when observed it is concluded that despite shared similarities of growth patterns and morphological changes observed during growth two lineages and two sexes can be distinguished on basis of distinct carapace features lineages differ by shape of vertebral and pleural scutes females have a more elongated and wider carapace shape than males carapace shape changes with growth with vertebral scutes becoming narrower and pleural scutes becoming larger during late ontogeny evolutionary implications in combination with proportionally longer necks and limbs unusual saddleback carapace structure is thought to be an adaptation to increase vertical reach which enables tortoise to browse tall vegetation such as opuntia prickly pear cactus that grows in arid environments saddlebacks are more territorial and smaller than domed varieties possibly adaptations to limited resources alternatively larger tortoises may be better suited to high elevations because they can resist cooler temperatures that occur with cloud cover or fog a competing hypothesis is that rather than being principally a feeding adaptation distinctive saddle shape and longer extremities might have been a secondary sexual characteristic of saddleback males male competition over mates is settled by dominance displays on basis of vertical neck height rather than body size see below this correlates with observation that saddleback males are more aggressive than domed males shell distortion and elongation of limbs and neck in saddlebacks is probably an evolutionary compromise between need for a small body size in dry conditions and a high vertical reach for dominance displays saddleback carapace probably evolved independently several times in dry habitats since genetic similarity between populations does not correspond to carapace shape saddleback tortoises are therefore not necessarily more closely related to each other than to their domed counterparts as shape is not determined by a similar genetic background but by a similar ecological one sexual dimorphism sexual dimorphism is most pronounced in saddleback populations in which males have more angled and higher front openings giving a more extreme saddled appearance males of all varieties generally have longer tails and shorter concave plastrons with thickened knobs at back edge to facilitate mating males are larger than females adult males weigh around while females are behavior thumb alt a tortoise somewhat submerged in a green outdoor pool full of algae a tortoise bathing in a pool routine tortoises

low elevations which become grassy plains in wet season and areas of higher elevation up to in dry season same routes have been used for many generations creating well defined paths through undergrowth known as tortoise highways on these wetter islands domed tortoises are gregarious and often found in large herds in contrast to more solitary and territorial disposition of saddleback tortoises tortoises sometimes rest in mud wallows or rain formed pools which may be both a thermoregulatory response during cool nights and a protection from parasites such as mosquitoes and ticks parasites are countered by taking dust baths in loose soil some tortoises have been noted to shelter at night under overhanging rocks others have been observed sleeping in a snug depression in earth or brush called a pallet local tortoises using same pallet sites such as on volcan alcedo results in formation of small sandy pits diet right thumb alt an adult tortoise with a mouthful of green leaves a tortoise feeding tortoises are herbivores that consume a diet of cacti grasses leaves lichens berries melons oranges and milkweed they have been documented feeding on hippomane mancinella poison apple endemic guava water fern microphylla and bromeliad insularis juvenile tortoises eat an average of 16 7 of their own body weight in dry matter per day with a digestive efficiency roughly equal to that of hindgut fermenting herbivorous mammals such as horses and rhinos tortoises acquire most of their moisture from dew and sap in vegetation particularly opuntia cactus therefore they can survive longer than 6 months without water they can endure up to a year when deprived of all food and water surviving by breaking down their body fat to produce water as a byproduct tortoises also have very slow metabolisms when thirsty they may drink large quantities of water very quickly storing it in their bladders and root of neck both of which served to make them useful water sources on ships on arid islands tortoises lick morning dew from boulders and repeated action over many generations has formed half sphere depressions in rock senses regarding their senses charles darwin observed inhabitants believe that these animals are absolutely deaf certainly they do not overhear a person walking near behind them i was always amused when overtaking one of these great monsters as it was quietly pacing along to see how suddenly instant i passed it would draw in its head and legs and uttering a deep hiss fall to ground with a heavy sound as if struck dead although they are not deaf tortoises depend far more on vision and smell as stimuli than hearing mutualism tortoises share a mutualistic relationship with some species of galapagos finch and mockingbirds small groups of finches initiate process by hopping on ground in an exaggerated fashion facing tortoise tortoise signals it is ready by rising up and extending its neck and legs enabling birds to reach otherwise inaccessible spots on tortoise s body such as neck rear legs cloacal opening and skin between plastron and carapace birds benefit from food source and tortoises get rid of irritating ectoparasites some tortoises have been observed to insidiously exploit this mutualistic relationship after rising and extending its limbs bird may go beneath tortoise to investigate whereupon suddenly tortoise withdraws its limbs to drop flat and kill bird it then steps back to eat bird presumably to supplement its diet with protein thumb left alt two tortoises with their necks extended a pair of tortoises engaging in a dominance display mating mating occurs at any time of year although it does have seasonal peaks between february and june in humid uplands during rainy season when mature males meet in mating season they face each other in a ritualised dominance display rise up on their legs and stretch up their necks with their mouths gaping open occasionally head biting occurs but usually shorter tortoise backs off conceding mating rights to victor behaviour is most pronounced in saddleback species which are more aggressive and have longer necks prelude to mating can be very aggressive as male forcefully rams female s shell with his own and nips her legs mounting is an awkward process and male must stretch and tense to maintain equilibrium in a slanting position concave underside of male s shell helps him to balance when straddled over female s shell and brings his cloacal vent which houses penis closer to female s dilated cloaca during mating male vocalises with hoarse bellows and grunts described as rhythmic groans this is one of few vocalisations tortoise makes other noises are made during aggressive encounters when struggling to right themselves and hissing as they withdraw into their shells due to forceful expulsion of air thumb right alt a tour guide holds up a tortoise egg and a small tortoise egg comfortably rests in palm of a hand it is spherical and size of a

for c duncanensis on pinzon female makes a muddy plug for nest hole out of soil mixed with urine seals nest by pressing down firmly with her plastron and leaves them to be incubated by sun females may lay one to four clutches per season temperature plays a role in sex of hatchlings with lower temperature nests producing more males and higher temperature nests producing more females this is related closely to incubation time since clutches laid early incubate during cool season and have longer incubation periods producing more males while eggs laid later incubate for a shorter period in hot season producing more females early life and maturation young animals emerge from nest after four to eight months and may weigh only and measure when young tortoises emerge from their shells they must dig their way to surface which can take several weeks though their yolk sac can sustain them up to seven months in particularly dry conditions hatchlings may die underground if they are encased by hardened soil while flooding of nest area can drown them species are initially indistinguishable as they all have domed carapaces young stay in warmer lowland areas for their first 10 15 years encountering hazards such as falling into cracks being crushed by falling rocks or excessive heat stress galapagos hawk was formerly sole native predator of tortoise hatchlings darwin wrote young tortoises as soon as they are hatched fall prey in great numbers to buzzard hawk is now much rarer but introduced feral pigs dogs cats and black rats have become predators of eggs and young tortoises adult tortoises have no natural predators apart from humans darwin noted old ones seem generally to die from accidents as from falling down precipices at least several of inhabitants told me they had never found one dead without some such apparent cause sexual maturity is reached at around 20 25 years in captivity possibly 40 years in wild life expectancy in wild is thought to be over 100 years

of evolution thumb left upright alt three quarter length portrait of charles darwin aged about 30 with straight brown hair receding from his high forehead and long side whiskers smiling quietly in wide jacket waistcoat and high collar with cravat charles darwin as a young man probably subsequent to galapagos visit charles darwin visited galapagos for five weeks on second voyage of hms beagle in 1835 and saw galapagos tortoises on san cristobal chatham and santiago james islands they appeared several times in his writings and journals and played a role in development of theory of evolution darwin wrote in his account of voyage i have not as yet noticed by far most remarkable feature in natural history of this archipelago it is that different islands to a considerable extent are inhabited by a different set of beings my attention was first called to this fact by vice governor mr lawson declaring that tortoises differed from different islands and that he could with certainty tell from which island any one was brought inhabitants as i have said state that they can distinguish tortoises from different islands and that they differ not only in size but in other characters captain porter has described those from charles and from nearest island to it namely hood island as having their shells in front thick and turned up like a spanish saddle while tortoises from james island are rounder blacker and have a better taste when cooked significance of differences in tortoises between islands did not strike him as important until it was too late as he continued i did not for some time pay sufficient attention to this statement and i had already partially mingled together collections from two of islands i never dreamed that islands about fifty or sixty miles apart and most of them in sight of each other formed of precisely same rocks placed under a quite similar climate rising to a nearly equal height would have been differently tenanted though beagle departed from galapagos with over 30 adult tortoises on deck these were not for scientific study but a source of fresh meat for pacific crossing their shells and bones were thrown overboard leaving no remains with which to test any hypotheses it has been suggested that this oversight was made because darwin only reported seeing tortoises on san cristobal c chathamensis and santiago c darwini both of which have an intermediate type of shell shape and are not particularly morphologically distinct from each other though he did visit floreana c nigra species found there was already nearly extinct and he was unlikely to have seen any mature animals thumb line drawing of hms beagle by f g king a colleague of darwin s galapagos tortoises were stacked in lower hold however darwin did have four live juvenile specimens to compare from different islands these were pet tortoises taken by himself from san salvador his captain fitzroy two from espanola and his servant syms covington from floreana unfortunately they could not help to determine whether each island had its own variety because specimens were not mature enough to exhibit morphological differences although british museum had a few specimens their provenance within galapagos was unknown however conversations with naturalist gabriel bibron who had seen mature tortoises of paris natural history museum confirmed to darwin that distinct varieties occurred darwin later compared different tortoise forms with those of mockingbirds in first tentative statement linking his observations from galapagos with possibility of species when i recollect fact that from form of body shape of scales and general size spaniards can at once pronounce from which island any tortoise may have been brought when i see these islands in sight of each other and possessed of but a scanty stock of animals tenanted by these birds but slightly differing in structure and filling same place in nature i must suspect they are only varieties if there is slightest foundation for these remarks zoology of archipelagos will be well worth examining for such facts would undermine stability of species his views on mutability of species were restated in his notebooks animals on separate islands ought to become different if kept long enough apart with slightly differing circumstances now galapagos tortoises mocking birds falkland fox fox and irish hare these observations served as counterexamples to prevailing contemporary view that species were individually created darwin also found these antediluvian animals to be a source of diversion i frequently got on their backs and then giving a few raps on hinder part of their shells they would rise up and walk away but i found it very difficult to keep my balance conservation several waves of human exploitation of tortoises as a food source caused a decline in total wild population from around 250 000 when first discovered in 16th century to a low of 3 060 individuals in a 1974 census modern conservation efforts have subsequently brought tortoise numbers up to 19 317 estimate for 1995 2009 species c nigra became extinct by human exploitation in 19th century another species c abingdonii became extinct on 24 june 2012 with death in captivity of last remaining specimen a male named lonesome george world s rarest living creature all other surviving species are listed by iucn as at least vulnerable in conservation status if not worse thumb chelonoidis porteri on santa cruz island historical exploitation an estimated 200 000 animals were taken before 20th century relatively immobile and defenceless tortoises were collected and stored live on board ships where they could survive for at least a year without food or water some anecdotal reports suggest individuals surviving two years providing valuable fresh meat while their diluted urine and water stored in their neck bags could be used as drinking water 17th century british pirate explorer and naturalist william dampier wrote they are so extraordinarily large and fat and so sweet that no eats more pleasantly while captain james of british navy wrote of land tortoise which in whatever way it was dressed was considered by all of us as most delicious food we had ever tasted us navy captain david porter declared after once tasting galapagos tortoises every other animal food fell off greatly in our estimation meat of this animal is easiest of digestion and a quantity of it exceeding that of any other food can be eaten without experiencing slightest of inconvenience darwin was less enthusiastic about meat writing breast plate roasted as gauchos do carne con cuero with flesh on it is very good and young tortoises make excellent soup but otherwise meat to my taste is indifferent in 17th century pirates started to use galapagos islands as a base for resupply restocking on food and water and repairing vessels before attacking spanish colonies on south american mainland however galapagos tortoises did not struggle for survival at this point because islands were distant from busy shipping routes and harboured few valuable natural resources as such they remained unclaimed by any nation uninhabited and uncharted in comparison tortoises of islands in indian ocean were already facing extinction by late 17th century between 1790s and 1860s whaling ships and fur sealers systematically collected tortoises in far greater numbers than buccaneers preceding them some were used for food and many more were killed for high grade turtle oil from late 19th century onward for lucrative sale to continental ecuador a total of over 13 000 tortoises is recorded in logs of whaling ships between 1831 and 1868 and an estimated 100 000 were taken before 1830 since it was easiest to collect tortoises around coastal zones females were most vulnerable to depletion during nesting season collection by whalers came to a halt eventually through a combination of scarcity of tortoises that they had created and competition from crude oil as a cheaper energy source galapagos tortoise exploitation dramatically increased with onset of california gold rush in 1849 tortoises and sea turtles were imported into san francisco sacramento and various other gold rush towns throughout alta california to feed gold mining population galapagos tortoise and sea turtle bones were also recovered from gold rush era archaeological site thompson s cove ca sfr in san francisco california population decline accelerated with early settlement of islands in early 19th century leading to unregulated hunting for meat habitat clearance for agriculture and introduction of alien mammal species feral pigs dogs cats and black rats have become predators of eggs and young tortoises whilst goats donkeys and cattle compete for grazing and trample nest sites extinction of floreana species in mid 19th century has been attributed to combined pressures of hunting for penal colony on relatively small island conversion of grazing highlands into land for farming and fruit plantations and introduction of feral mammals scientific collection expeditions took 661 tortoises between 1888 and 1930 and more than 120 tortoises have been taken by poachers since 1990 threats continue today with rapid expansion of tourist industry and increasing size of human settlements on islands tortoises are down from 15 different types of species when darwin first arrived down to 11 threats introduced mammals poachers destruction of habitat characteristics that make tortoises vulnerable slow growth rate late sexual

tortoise populations began only 11 of 14 original populations remained and most of these were endangered if not already on brink of extinction breeding and rearing program for giant tortoises began in response to condition of population on pinzon where fewer than 200 old adults were found all of hatchlings had been killed by introduced black rats for perhaps more than a century without help this population would eventually disappear only thing preserving it was longevity of tortoise its genetic resistance to negative effects of inbreeding would be another breeding and release programs began in 1965 and have successfully brought seven of eight endangered species up to less perilous population levels young tortoises are raised at several breeding centres across islands to improve their survival during their vulnerable early development eggs are collected from threatened nesting sites and hatched young are given a head start by being kept in captivity for four to five years to reach a size with a much better chance of survival to adulthood before release onto their native ranges most significant population recovery was that of espanola tortoise c hoodensis which was saved from near certain extinction population had been depleted to three males and 12 females that had been so widely dispersed that no mating in wild had occurred fruitless attempts to breed one of tortoises lonesome george for example is speculated to be attributed to a lack of postnatal cues and confusion over which would be most appropriate genetic species would be most appropriate to mate him with on islands 15 remaining tortoises were brought to charles darwin research station in 1971 for a captive breeding program and in following 33 years they gave rise to over 1 200 progeny which were released onto their home island and have since begun to reproduce naturally one of tortoises diego is one of main drivers of a remarkable recovery of hoodensis species having fathered between 350 and 800 progeny island restoration galapagos national park service systematically culls feral predators and competitors goat eradication on islands including pinta was achieved by technique of using judas goats with radio location collars to find herds marksmen then shot all goats except judas and then returned weeks later to find judas and shoot herd to which it had relocated goats were removed from pinta island after a 30 year eradication campaign largest removal of an insular goat population using ground based methods over 41 000 goats were removed during initial hunting effort 1971 82 this process was repeated until only judas goat remained which was then killed other measures have included dog eradication from san cristobal and fencing off nests to protect them from feral pigs efforts are now underway to repopulate islands formerly inhabited by tortoises to restore their ecosystems island restoration to their condition before humans arrived tortoises are a keystone species acting as ecosystem engineers which help in plant seed dispersal and trampling down brush and thinning understory of vegetation allowing light to penetrate and germination to occur birds such as flycatchers perch on and fly around tortoises to hunt insects they displace from brush in may 2010 39 sterilised tortoises of hybrid origin were introduced to pinta island first tortoises there since evacuation of lonesome george 38 years before sterile tortoises were released so problem of interbreeding between species would be avoided if any fertile tortoises were to be released in future it is hoped that with recent identification of a hybrid c abingdonii tortoise approximate genetic constitution of original inhabitants of pinta may eventually be restored with identification and relocation of appropriate specimens to this island this approach may be used to floreana in future since captive individuals have been found to be descended from extinct original stock applied science galapagos tortoise movement ecology programme is a collaborative project coordinated by dr stephen blake of max planck institute for ornithology its goal is to assist galapagos national park to effectively conserve giant tortoises by conducting cutting edge applied science and developing an inspirational tortoise based outreach and education programme since 2009 project team have been analysing movements of giant tortoises by tracking them via satellite tags as of november 2014 team have tagged 83 tortoises from four species on three islands they have established that giant tortoises conduct migrations up and down volcanoes primarily in response to seasonal changes in availability and quality of vegetation in 2015 they will start to track movements of hatchling and juvenile tortoises
