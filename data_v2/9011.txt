black necked spitting cobra naja nigricollis is a species of spitting cobra found mostly in sub saharan africa they are moderately sized snakes that can grow to a length of in length their coloration and markings can vary considerably they prey primarily on small rodents they possess medically significant venom although mortality rate for untreated bites on humans is relatively low 5 10 in endemic regions under 1 like other spitting cobras they can eject venom from their fangs when threatened one drop over and more in perfect accuracy neurotoxic venom irritates skin causing blisters and inflammation and can cause permanent blindness if venom makes contact with eyes and is not washed off naja nigricollis belongs to cobra genus naja under family elapidae it previously included two subspecies that have been moved to species naja nigricincta zebra spitting cobra naja nigricincta nigricincta and black spitting cobra naja nigricincta woodi taxonomy naja nigricollis is classified under genus naja of family elapidae it was first described by norwegian zoologist johan reinhardt in 1843 generic name naja is a latinisation of sanskrit word meaning cobra specific epithet nigricollis is latin for black necked niger meaning black and collis meaning neck naja nigricollis previously included two subspecies naja nigricollis nigricincta and naja nigricollis woodi but genetic studies in 2007 by wolfgang wuster etal have concluded that these subspecies should be treated under a separate species naja nigricincta wuster w s crookes i y mane c e pook j f trape d g

molecular phylogenetics and evolution 45 437 453 description n nigricollis is a moderately sized venomous snake with a moderately distinct head shape of head is due primarily to two large venom glands found on each side of head its colour can vary depending on region of origin some specimens are black or pale grey with a yellow or reddish ventral side with a broad black neck band often with an orange or pinkish bar on neck other specimens can be yellowish brown or have a yellow copper colour and are missing around neck and reddish colour on belly some other specimens are deep reddish brown and yet others are an olive brown some can even be striped black and white or totally white with dark eyes there are 21 23 dorsal scales at mid body 182 196 ventral scales and 54 66 subcaudal scales this species generally grows to a length of to these sizes are subject to trends based on geographic location and subspecies distribution and habitat species is very common and is widespread through much of sub saharan africa and is found in western eastern central and parts of southern africa it is absent from rainforests of congo basin it has been recorded from angola benin burkina faso cameroon central african republic chad democratic republic of congo except in center congo ethiopia gabon ghana guinea bissau guinea ivory coast kenya liberia mali niger nigeria senegal sierra leone gambia mauritania sudan tanzania somalia togo uganda zambia older records from south africa botswana zimbabwe swaziland mozambique or most of namibia refer to naja or naja nigricincta which were formerly regarded as subspecies of n nigricollis n nigricollis usually inhabits savanna and semi desert regions of africa however they can be found at altitudes up to as well as in tropical and subtropical regions of central africa in moist savanna and cleared former forest regions particularly near rivers and streams adaptable snakes naja n nigricollis occurs in southeastern nigeria where their habitat has been transformed from rainforest to man made farmlands plantations suburban areas and a few fragmented forests this species of cobra has found advantages in drastic changes which have taken place in nigeria s rainforests a study by herpetologist luca suggests this snake now forages in much drier microhabitats range of naja nigricollis is currently expanding from southeastern regions of nigeria to more desert and arid conditions in central part of nation they also live in coastal scrubs and dry grasslands like other cobra species they may find abandoned termite mounds or rodent holes to hide or cool off however tree trunks seem to be their favourite hiding places they are excellent tree climbers thus can be arboreal at times because they are so common across africa they are encountered in villages or small towns where they may come in direct contact with people behavior unlike other snakes naja nigricollis can be either nocturnal or diurnal depending on time of year geographic location and average daytime temperature this adaptability allows snake to better regulate its body temperature and to gain access to most abundant food sources of a particular area it feeds primarily on small rodents such as small rats and mice birds and fishes but will also eat lizards eggs and other snakes like other snakes it may fall prey to raptors especially different species of snake eagles that migrate to africa when it is winter in northern hemisphere short toed snake eagle may be a particular threat as it is almost strictly an ophiophagus raptor other snakes also prey on this species like other spitting cobras this species is known for its ability to project venom at a potential threat venom is an irritant to skin and eyes if it enters eyes symptoms include extreme burning pain loss of coordination partial loss of vision and permanent blindness n nigricollis is known for its tendency to liberally spit venom and bite with only slightest provocation this species is sometimes found in captivity and wild caught individuals are generally nervous and prone to spitting captive bred animals tend to be much more docile and calm when compared to their wild caught counterparts reproduction like other cobra species this snake is oviparous mating season of this species can vary from end of winter september to beginning of summer december usually mating season is same whether in captivity or in wild females will commonly lay 10 to 15 eggs but can lay anywhere between eight and 22 eggs at a time gestation period lasts about 90 100 days but once eggs are laid they hatch in 60 70 days and need to be in a temperature of at birth young are about in length and are completely independent venom venom of naja nigricollis is somewhat unusual among elapids in that it consists primarily of cytotoxins but with other components also it retains typical elapid neurotoxic properties while combining these with highly potent cytotoxins necrotic agents and cardiotoxins bite symptoms include severe external hemorrhaging and tissue necrosis around bite area and difficulty breathing although mortality rate in untreated cases is low 5 10 when death occurs it is usually due to asphyxiation by paralysis of diaphragm of naja nigricollis is 2 mg kg sc and 1 15 mg kg iv average venom yield per bite of this species is 200 to 350 mg dry weight according to minton 1974 snake venom ophthalmia in 1944 writing as major harold ridley frcs ramc english ophthalmic surgeon published a short paper in british journal of ophthalmology on spitting snakes and an account of composition and action of snake venom in general from his own experiences in wartime ghana then known as gold coast ridley described snake venom ophthalmia in a 30 year old labourer named kumasi who was cutting grass when a black necked cobra raised its head from grass and forcibly spat venom toward man s right eye from a four or five feet distance ridley treated man and followed his case until eye had fully about a week in conclusion after discussion on therapeutic uses of snake venom he conjectured that in future diluted venom or a constituent of venom might be used as a powerful anaesthetic in some cases of ophthalmic surgery see also red spitting cobra mozambique spitting cobra references external links information on n nigricollis with photos video an article about naja
