alexander semin 400th career nhl point march 19 2012 transactions going into off season there was concern over future of goaltender semyon varlamov washington had given restricted free agent a qualifying offer giving capitals right to match any other nhl offers or receive draft pick compensation if they did not match though washington had control of his negotiating rights varlamov indicated that he would leave nhl to play in kontinental hockey league khl he stated that while he wanted to play in nhl he did not want to be a back up if varlamov left league washington would not receive any compensation but would retain his nhl rights in khl a war for varlamov s services was developing lokomotiv yaroslav claimed to retain varlamov s khl rights and wanted to sign him to a contract around 2 million a season alternatively ska saint petersburg filed a complaint with khl stating his rights were not owned because his original contract with yaroslav predated formation of khl and was therefore invalid before situation could be resolved capitals traded varlamov s rights to colorado avalanche for a first round pick in 2012 nhl entry draft along with a conditional second round selection 2012 or 2013 following trade team owner ted leonsis noted that varlamov wanted assurances that we couldn t make to him he was disappointed but wished varlamov well with colorado avalanche
