composition and lyrics i have forgiven jesus which was co written by morrissey and his band member alain whyte is an alternative rock ballad p with r b and pop rock undertones it is composed in key a minor and morrissey s vocal ranges from note a3 to g5 song describes a person who blames jesus christ for creating a human full of love and desires but who is unable to transmit it although forgives divine figure for doing so it features confessional lyrics mixed with a darkly comedic tone and elements of black humour that discuss frustrated sexual desire and catholic guilt nicholas p greco of providence college wrote that despite attributing to jesus blame for making him way he is song deals mainly with one s inability to convey one s own desires although it could be interpreted merely as morrissey s to think he is in a superior position to forgive christ greco found it to be a serious lament that people can relate to this latter perception was echoed by spin annie zaleski and jason anderson who described it as an anguish filled lament about curse of having so much love to express in a loveless world and lisa de jong of utrecht university who characterised it as a song aimed at comforting misfits kitty empire of observer said it expresses his agony and a deep vein of self loathing that poignant in his younger self seems more troubling in a man in his forties adrian may of p n review described it as about what to do with abandonment of desire how to forgive and transcend to a greater truth or good this truth said may is search for a new identity song starts by establishing title character as a good kid who would do no harm while a middle height vocal is accompanied by a 1960s sounding almost beatle esque keyboard in words of academic isabella van elferen as drama rises and child starts to doubt values taught to him andante tempo that expressed safety provided by uncontested religious truths changes to high pitched vocals that symbolise naivete being replaced by despair of being deserted by those same truths gavin hopps author of biography morrissey pageant of his bleeding heart wrote that song uses a humorous tone to describe this loss of faith when morrissey uses schoolboy nonstandard brung in verse forgive me any pain i may have brung to you and when he ironically repeat s back to christ promises he feels have been broken or seem meaningless i ll always be near to you biographer david bret commented that morrissey described how as a dutiful catholic boy he withstood humiliation and condescension to attend church in verse through hail and snow i d go just to moon you in sequence morrissey sings i carried my heart in my hand which hopps suggested could be an allusion to sacred heart third verse in low pitched sequences describes a suffering routine from monday to friday both hopps and de jong interpreted it as emulating pain christ is said to have suffered on his way to calvary morrissey concludes this part with by friday life has killed me which hopps said could be an allusion to good friday death in this part argued may is a symbolic one that indicates a self exile from previous beliefs and search for a new identity guardian ben hewitt described it as a secular experience of a week of joyless sexless activity this sequence was meant to express dull drone of emptied out daily life without love or god wrote van elferen in this part character is still haunted by recent abandonment of his beliefs song then transitions to a melancholy cello melody as calm tone becomes agitated and singer asks why he has been given so much love in a loveless world singer s tone gradually thickens until it reaches a point of a stubborn repetition of a despairing call to jesus do you hate me underlined by a strong on beat drum with subtle syncopated keyboard motifs after this urgent existential complaint in which wrote hopps feeling that god must have hated him in creating him he suffers so much from being himself beat stops abruptly as song ends relation to religion song s main character according to zaleski and anderson can be that irish catholic boy in manchester who according to song is a nice kid who does not know how to handle his desires bronte of royal holloway university of london said this inability is correlated to morrissey s discomfort with his queer identity during his catholic upbringing because of this link between desire and religion some journalists including rolling stones james hunter and advocate david white understood song as a critique of organized religion hua hsu of slate however stated that it finds morrissey at peace with his spiritual non relationships rather than flailing helplessly against torture of religious upbringing van elferen said song depicts a more relation of morrissey to his religious background because of way song inverts divine human relations both academics and journalists have described it as blasphemy and blasphemous according to hopps beyond appearance of blasphemy it featured elements reminiscent of lamentations and accusations in old testament of god being unjust especially those found in book of job hopps said however that at same time it seems to be making fun of religious teaching in a way psalmists and job do not author concluded that catholic faith is light that never goes out on morrissey s life because song mixes an apparently blasphemous bitterness with what seems to be an unironic sense of dereliction but jesus hurt me when he deserted me which implies a prior and latent state of relation an anonymous author of centre for christian apologetics scholarship and education of new college university of new south wales also described song as being both blasphemous and offensive to christian sensibilities and a meditation on desire although writer ultimately condemned it he said it could be positively interpreted as a prayer of complaint directed to jesus similar to psalmists appeal to god scholar anti nylen wrote that morrissey s songs usually feature christian imagery but from an incredulous position considering that i have forgiven jesus is an exception to this he stated that prayer and blasphemy are present in song at same time and that it is a song about reconciliation by a christian who has faith but who still has enormous difficulties in submitting to it entwinement of prayer and blasphemy is characteristic of anti modern tradition of catholic romanticism into which nylen puts morrissey van elferen interpreted morrissey s position regarding catholicism as akin to that of gothic fiction which like romanticism sought to reconstruct divine mysteries that reason had begun to dismantle both gothic literature and song van elferen wrote ponder what remains when comfort of religious truth disappears in its shadow returning like uncanny of freudian repressed haunting one with relentless relation to morrissey discography scholars and critics have debated connections of i have forgiven jesus to morrissey s general oeuvre macquarie university s jean philippe traced back its themes of painful sexual failure that issues a traumatic confusion about sexual preferences and sexual abilities to smiths s song i want one i can t have from 1985 album meat is murder scholar daniel manco argued that i have forgiven jesus is thematically related to morrissey s 1990 song november spawned a monster both of which feature disabled people and dialogues with jesus manco also commented that it echoes november spawned a monster in its discussion of blameless youth dysfunctional corporeality social and sexual abjection and divine culpability de jong compared it with you are quarry let me kiss you 2004 she wrote that both songs approach love in a grim way and highlight themes of physical uncertainties because of its references to morrissey s anglo irish upbringing and way song cast doubts on values he learnt van elferen called it religious counterpart of irish blood english heart 2004 eric schumacher rasmussen of paste went further writing that it summed up raison d etre of his entire career critical reception upon its release i have forgiven jesus was described as a controversial track and has polarized critics josh tyrangiel of time called it woeful alexis petridis of guardian criticized it for its cheap synthesised strings and andrew stevens of 3 am magazine said it is flat and go es nowhere people staff dubbed it bloody brilliant and scotsman labelled it a touching song about repressed desire it was considered to be one of best tracks on you are quarry along with irish blood english heart by rolling stones jonathan ringen by sfgate aidin vaziri and by jordan kessler of popmatters who paired it with first of gang to die by start of 2005 bbc

bucky via directors bureau was released online in november 2004 its images were later used on covers of song s single release video was later released as bonus material on morrissey s 2005 live dvd who put m in manchester in video morrissey is dressed as a roman catholic priest in a white clerical collar and black blazer and pants while carrying rosaries and wearing a crucifix it opens with a close up of morrissey which is followed by a shot of grey sky and a long shot of him walking towards camera sepia toned image shows singer walking down grey deserted streets in a broken down los angeles park first alone morrissey is joined by band members who wear jobriath s t shirts during walk morrissey s decision to take role of a priest in music video was controversial it was interpreted by james g crossley of department of biblical studies of university of sheffield as a desire to express personal angst and to have an ironical and humorous take on it hewitt said singer s clothing in video and december release as a christmas single were clear evidence that morrissey planned it as a jocular provocation van elferen said video expresses his ambivalent relationship with catholicism as he presents himself as his own spectre through depiction of someone tormented by his own flesh and bone and painfully aware of contradictions between prescribed catholic dealings with issues of sexuality and his own feelings nylen said choice of band members t shirts may be an argument because jobriath was an openly gay rock star while catholicism usually condemns homosexuality live
