man o war march 29 1917 november 1 1947 was an american thoroughbred who is widely considered one of greatest racehorses of all time several sports publications including blood horse sports illustrated espn and ap associated press voted man o war as outstanding horse of 20th century during his racing career just after world war i man o war won 20 of 21 races and 249 465 in purses he was unofficial 1920 american horse of year and was honored with babe ruth as outstanding athlete of year by new york times he was inducted into national museum of racing and hall of fame in 1957 on march 29 2017 museum opened a special exhibit in his honor man o war at 100 in 1919 man o war won 9 of 10 starts including hopeful stakes and belmont futurity then most important races for two year old horses in united states his only loss came at saratoga race course later nicknamed graveyard of champions where he lost by a neck to a colt fittingly named upset man o war was not entered in 1920 kentucky derby because his owner samuel riddle did not believe in racing at distance of 10 furlongs so early in a young horse s career instead man o war made his three year old debut in preakness stakes where he defeated upset by lengths man o war later won belmont stakes by 20 lengths while setting a world record throughout summer and fall he continued to dominate his fellow three year olds setting multiple records while conceding large amounts of weight to his rivals only time he faced older horses was in final race of his career in a match race against sir barton who had won what would later be known as american triple crown in 1919 man o war won easily by seven lengths in first horserace to be filmed in its entirety riddle originally intended to race man o war in 1921 but decided against it because man o war would have been assigned record weights in handicap format used in almost all races for older horses instead man o war was retired to stud where he became a leading sire whose multiple champions included triple crown winner war admiral he was grandsire of seabiscuit and his sire line continues today through horses such as in reality tiznow da tara and tourist also successful as a broodmare sire man o war is found in almost all modern american pedigrees background man o war was a chestnut horse with a white star and stripe on his forehead he was foaled at nursery stud near lexington kentucky he was bred by august belmont jr whose father s accomplishments were recognized through naming of belmont stakes in 1867 belmont jr was an equally notable horseman who served as chairman of jockey club from 1895 until his death in 1924 belmont park was named in family s honor when it opened in 1905 thumb left man o war at nursery stud man o war was sired by fair play a multiple stakes winner who finished second in 1908 belmont stakes to undefeated colin man o war was second foal out of mahubah a lightly raced mare by english triple crown champion rock sand not long after colt was foaled on march 29 1917 belmont jr joined united states army at age 65 to serve in france during world war i while he was overseas his wife named foal man o war in honor of her husband originally belmonts intended to race man o war themselves however in summer of 1918 with ongoing war effort they decided to liquidate their racing stable at saratoga yearling sale man o war was sold at a final bid of 5 000 to samuel d riddle who brought him to his glen riddle farm near berlin maryland underbidder at auction was robert l gerry sr who is reported to have said to his wife forty five hundred is enough to spend for any yearling two years later in 1920 riddle declined an offer of 400 000 for horse at maturity man o war stood with prominent withers and a high croup but was sometimes faulted for a dipped back that grew more pronounced with age he had virtually flawless legs and solid bone traits he passed on to his offspring he had a slightly roman nose and notably high head carriage his nickname was big red though his coat had tinges of yellow and gold an energetic spirited horse he is often pictured standing very still and gazing off into distance described as look of eagles his stride was measured at 28 feet believed to be longest of all time racing career thumb upright silks of samuel o war was odds on favorite in every start of his career and justified that faith even in his sole defeat he typically won in front running fashion and was only closely pushed in two of his starts he won belmont stakes by twenty lengths and lawrence realization by a hundred lengths he set record times in both of those races plus many more at distances ranging from six to thirteen furlongs in many of his starts he won under heavy restraint and often conceded his rivals large amounts of weight he retired as then leading money earner in american history developing this talent was not easy for trainer louis feustel due to man o war s occasionally wild temperament in his early days man o war would routinely dump his exercise riders once getting free for over 15 minutes after a morning workout he fought like a tiger riddle later recalled he screamed with rage and fought us so hard that it took several days before he could be handled with safety feustel brought colt along slowly and gradually settled him into a regular routine man o war developed a strong bond with his groom frank loftus who taught horse to fetch and to carry his hat oranges were man o war s favorite treat 1919 two year old season man o war made his debut at belmont park on june 6 1919 in a maiden race over five furlongs at time horses had to race clockwise at belmont park rather than counter clockwise like all other american tracks of day so horses had to learn to race in both directions this practice ended in 1922 after man o war retired man o war won his first race by six lengths then just three days later was entered in keene memorial stakes at a distance of furlongs on a muddy track at belmont park at this point in his career man o war had not yet learned how to start quickly but soon settled into fourth place with an eighth of a mile remaining jockey johnny loftus urged man o war to run and horse responded by pulling away from his rivals to win by three lengths twelve days later man o war followed up with another win in youthful stakes at jamaica race course two days after that he swept to victory in hudson stakes at aqueduct to record his fourth win in just 18 days less than two weeks later he returned to win tremont stakes at aqueduct on july 5 he was then shipped upstate for summer meet at saratoga race course where competition would be much fiercer he made his first appearance there in united states hotel stakes on august 2 despite getting a bad start and carrying 130 pounds man o war won easily by two lengths in his first meeting with a well regarded colt named upset thumb man o war suffers his sole defeat to upset in sanford stakes his next start was sanford memorial stakes on august 13 where he went off as odds on favorite with upset as third betting choice this race is notorious in racing history as man o war s only defeat playing a part in developing saratoga s reputation as graveyard of champions in early 1900s there were no starting gates horses circled around and then lined up behind a piece of webbing known as barrier and were sent away when it was raised in sanford most sources state that man o war was still circling with his back to starting line when barrier was raised though some accounts say he was turned only slightly sideways what is undisputed is that man o war had a terrible start which new york times attributed to absence of regular starting official start was delayed for several minutes as other colts repeatedly broke through barrier and starter finally released field when only horses near rail were ready as a result man o war found himself far behind other starters loftus then put man o war in a bad position getting boxed in by other horses then checked by tiring horses despite this man o war came close to winning losing by about a neck while conceding 15 pounds to upset it is sometimes erroneously thought that upset s unexpected win popularized a new phrase in sports meaning an underdog beating favorite in fact term upset was already in use to describe such a situation for decades two horses faced off five times during their racing careers with man o war beating upset four times loss only enhanced man o war s reputation j l dempsey of daily racing form wrote without attempting to detract from merits of upset s performance man o war proved himself in running unquestionably best it was upset s advantage at start coupled with 15 pounds weight concession a perfect ride he received from knapp and his success in saving ground on stretch turn that brought his triumph over man o war had race been a sixteenth farther finish would have been reversed man o war gained his revenge with a victory in grand union hotel stakes on august 23 beating upset by two lengths with blazes in third after race loftus stated that man o war was best horse he had ever ridden and that his ride had been responsible for loss in sanford while carrying 130 pounds man o war tied stakes record of 1 12 2 5 for six furlongs that had been set by garbage while carrying only 107 pounds just 7 days later man o war entered hopeful stakes whose purse of 30 000 made it one of richest prizes in racing at time he faced only eight rivals a small field at time for such a prestigious race heavy rain started to fall as field headed to starting post and man o war broke through barrier several times delaying race by twelve minutes despite this he won with ridiculous ease by six lengths man o war then returned to belmont park for futurity stakes on september 14 futurity had a purse of 5 000 added meaning prize money was increased by nomination and entry fees because futurity was one of preeminent races of day added money was large enough to increase winners share of purse to 26 650 man o war briefly dueled for lead with a well regarded sprinter named dominique then opened up a commanding lead turning into stretch john p grier swept into second with an all out drive but failed to make up any ground on man o war who had not been urged at any point in race man o war won by three lengths while carrying 127 pounds 10 pounds more than john p grier journalists horsemen and fans agreed that man o war had to be considered as one of greatest american horses of his age and compared him favorably to unbeaten colin man o war completed his two year old campaign with nine wins from ten starts and earnings of 82 275 he was named american champion two year old colt of 1919 he was rated at 136 pounds by c c ridley of daily racing form 16 pounds ahead of second ranked colt blazes 1920 three year old season in 1920 johnny loftus was denied a renewal of his jockey s license by jockey club a development that was rumored to be related to man o war s defeat in sanford he was replaced as man o war s rider by clarence kummer over winter man o war had grown to high and filled out to about with a 72 inch girth edward l bowen 2000 man o war thoroughbred legends eclipse press usa page 83 states he filled out to 1 150 height reached 16 2 hands thumb man o war at age three riddle decided early on to restrict man o war to races within his own age division in large part because most valuable races in country were restricted to three year olds he decided not to enter man o war in kentucky derby because it was run only a few days before his preferred target preakness stakes which was held close to riddle farm where man o war had spent winter riddle also did not like racing in kentucky and believed it was too early in year for a young horse to go a mile and a quarter thus man o war did not have a chance to complete what would later be known as u s triple crown of thoroughbred racing consisting of kentucky derby preakness and belmont stakes previous year sir barton had won three races which gained in prestige and importance 10 years later when gallant fox accomplished same feat under a great deal of media attention instead man o war made his three year old debut on may 18 in preakness stakes then run at a distance of miles despite long layoff and never having raced beyond six furlongs he went off as 4 5 favorite in a field of nine horses that included his old rival upset who had finished second in derby man o war broke alertly and took lead within first 10 yards then established a two length lead down backstretch while under restraint as they rounded final turn upset started to close ground so kummer loosened his grip man o war responded by again pulling away completing opening mile in what would have been a new pimlico track record of 1 38 eased in final furlong man o war won by lengths over upset in a final time of 1 51 horse was then returned to his home base at belmont park where a crowd of 25 000 turned out to watch him in withers stakes on may 29 he was sent off at generous odds of 1 7 against only two rivals wildair winner of metropolitan handicap who was at odds of 6 1 and overmatched david harum at 30 1 man o war again seized early lead completing first quarter mile in while tugging at bit when wildair tried to close ground around turn kummer briefly released his hold and man o war opened up his lead again eased in final sixteenth of a mile man o war still won by two lengths while setting an american race record of 1 35 for mile thumb man o war after winning belmont stakes man o war s next start was on june 12 in belmont stakes then run at a distance of miles race would establish man o war as one of all time greats with an almost unbelievably brilliant performance before a crowd of 25 000 at odds of 1 20 he faced only one rival well regarded colt man o war led from start and kummer let him run freely at top of stretch allowing man o war to draw away by 20 lengths although eased in final furlong man o war set a world record of 2 14 beating previous standard set in england by over two seconds and beating sir barton s american record by over three seconds this time stood as american record until 1961 when wise ship ran distance in 2 14 flat on a turf course it still stood as american dirt record until 1991 just ten days later man o war returned in stuyvesant handicap which he won easily against only one rival his odds of 1 to 100 were believed to be lowest ever offered in an american horserace his next start in dwyer stakes on july 10 proved far more demanding colt john p grier who had challenged man o war in belmont futurity at age two had matured into second best three year old in country under conditions of dwyer man o war was assigned 126 pounds while john p grier carried only 108 two colts scared away all rivals turning dwyer into a match race they raced side by side down backstretch with man o war on rail blocking john p grier from view of spectators two horses ran race as a sprint completing first three quarters of a mile in 1 09 2 5 an american record as they entered turn man o war started to open up an advantage but john p grier rallied and got back on even terms they completed mile together in a time of 1 35 3 5 breaking man o war s american record set in withers john p grier made another surge and for a moment spectators believed that he would win race kummer then hit man o war with whip and man o war made a final surge opening up a lead of two lengths in final fifty yards final time was 1 49 1 5 a new world record for miles thumb man o war in summer of 1920 man o war was then shipped to saratoga and was entered in miller stakes on august 7 there was a then record crowd of 35 000 many of whom gathered in saddling area where man o war was surrounded by twelve pinkerton guards his jockey for race was earl sande replacing an injured kummer as expected man o war took early lead and was unchallenged in a six length victory he had been tightly restrained but even so his time of 1 56 3 5 for distance of miles was just seconds off track record his connections had a brief scare when man o war exhibited signs of lameness after a workout on august 17 but he quickly recovered on august 21 he entered travers stakes where he faced his two strongest rivals upset for fifth and last time and john p grier for third time a record crowd overflowed grandstand and stretched all way down rail and track apron as a result saratoga management opened up infield and 5 000 people moved across track to line inner rail man o war s jockey for race was andy schuttinger as kummer was still recovering from injury and sande was not available after start john p grier tried to match strides with man o war but could not keep up after establishing a clear lead by first turn schuttinger took hold of man o war for rest of race upset made a late run to move into second but man o war still won by three lengths despite not being extended man o war completed distance of miles in 2 01 4 5 equaling track record set earlier in year by sir barton this record stood until 1941 it is possible time was also a world record as existing record time of 2 00 flat credited to whisk broom ii in 1913 was disputed riddle contemplated entering man o war against older horses for first time in 5 000 saratoga gold cup but ultimately chose to enter 15 000 lawrence realization stakes against three year olds instead when his only rival scratched from race it nearly became a walkover until mrs riddle s niece sarah jeffords entered hoodwink to compensate for lack of competition riddle announced that man o war would be allowed to show his speed man o war was reunited with regular jockey kummer after being ridden by sande and schuttinger while kummer recovered from an injury kummer neither restrained horse nor urged him on at any point in race running as he pleased man o war won by slightly more than a quarter mile official margin was 100 lengths while setting a new world record of 2 40 4 5 for a mile and five eighths this broke existing world record set in england by seconds and lowered american record by over four seconds this world record stood until 1956 when it was broken by man o war s great grandson swaps performance drew superlatives from racing community turf writer b k beckwith later called it most astounding display of arrogant annihilation adding man o war was like a big red sheet of flame running before a prairie wind new york times commented at belmont park yesterday man o war gave what was undoubtedly greatest exhibition of speed over a considerable distance of ground ever witnessed anywhere man o war s next start was jockey club gold cup on september 12 first time he entered a race open to older horses race organizers tried to lure sir barton into entering by promising to increase purse from 15 000 to 25 000 if he did so but sir barton needed more time to recover from his last race it was also speculated that sir barton s owner was holding out for an even higher purse for a match race with man o war connections of exterminator another future hall of famer were also considering race but ultimately bypassed it because under weight for age conditions of gold cup he would have had to concede man o war five pounds as it was man o war faced only one competitor and won under tight restraint by fifteen lengths although declared a hollow victory by new york times man o war still set an american record for miles of 2 28 4 5 breaking existing mark by 4 5 seconds man o war next entered potomac handicap at havre de grace racetrack in maryland on september 18 man o war was assigned 138 pounds conceding from 24 to 34 pounds to his rivals which included kentucky derby winner paul jones man o war faced an early challenge from blazes then turned back a late run by wildair to win by lengths while breaking track record by seconds although man o war was not seriously challenged high weight and a poorly maintained racing surface took a toll man o war came out of race with a swollen tendon on his right foreleg thumb race of age final start of man o war s career came in windsor ontario canada in kenilworth park gold cup on october 11 event was so highly anticipated that it became first horserace to be filmed in its entirety with resulting footage later shown in movie theaters across country race was originally intended to be a face off between three great horses of time man o war sir barton and exterminator however owners of sir barton and man o war agreed to a distance of miles which was too short for exterminator to run his best and agreed to a weight for age format under which older exterminator would concede weight to man o war therefore exterminator was not entered and in fact raced that same day on a different track now essentially a match race advantage shifted to man o war whose front running style allowed him to dictate pace man o war was almost flat footed at break but quickly gathered speed to draw clear of sir barton in first furlong kummer then slowed pace while maintaining a two length lead down backstretch on final turn man o war put in a brief spurt and quickly opened lead to five lengths kummer again pulled him in and man o war maintained a steady pace to wire to win by seven lengths in a ridiculously easy fashion although time of 2 03 was well off american record shared by man o war and sir barton it still broke track record by over six seconds man o war s share of purse made him highest earning horse in american history gold trophy presented in winner s circle designed by tiffany co was later donated by mrs riddle to saratoga and is now used as trophy for travers stakes there were no formal awards for american horse of year at time but man o war was informally acknowledged as such in a retroactive poll of turf writers in its summary of sporting year new york times stated a superman babe ruth and a superhorse these were sport s greatest contributions to history of year about to close some might rate superhorse man o war as outstanding figure of two for he has passed on from field of competition and has left a story of achievement which may never be surpassed over his two year career man o war won 20 of 21 races setting three world records two american records and three track records weight carrying at time there were few weight for age races in united states majority of races were run under handicap conditions with better horses being assigned higher weights in an attempt to equalize chances of other horses in field as one writer put it one certain thing about racing is that weight will eventually stop greatest of racers and bring them down to equal terms with horses of much less quality as a two year old man o war carried in six races few racehorses have ever carried that much at any age as a three year old he carried as much as in races conceding as much as to other horses had he raced at age four handicappers would have started him at 140 pounds increasing amount each time he won until such time as man o war either lost or was injured for this reason riddle decided to retire him at end of his three year old campaign race record lbs ref belmont park 5 furlongs maiden 1 6 lengths 0 59 flat 115 belmont

huffman mill pike outside of lexington that had been jointly purchased by riddle his wife s niece sarah jeffords and her husband walter this land including stallion barn is now part of mt brilliant farm in late 1936 or early 1937 riddle horses were moved to an adjacent property also called faraway farm where man o war spent his final years this portion of faraway is now called man o war farm during his lifetime over 500 000 people signed guest book at faraway farm and as many as 1 5 million are estimated to have visited him there his longtime groom will harbut would lead stallion out on display and proudly proclaim his charge s many accomplishments man o war and harbut were featured together on cover of saturday evening post in 1941 this photograph inspired a popular collectors plate forever friends by equine artist fred stone man o war was leading sire in north america of 1926 and was runner up in 1928 1929 and 1937 jockey club credits him with 62 stakes winners from 381 named foals riddle restricted man o war s book to about 25 mares a year most of which were owned by him or his friends and family though many breeding experts believe that riddle did not breed stallion to enough good mares especially after first five seasons he still sired many leading horses man o war s first crop included three horses who were considered champions american flag belmont stakes florence nightingale coaching club american oaks and maid at war alabama stakes his second crop was highlighted by crusader who won belmont stakes in 1926 and was largely accepted as best racehorse of 1926 among man o war s other famous offspring were 1929 kentucky derby winner clyde van dusen battleship who won 1938 english grand national steeplechase and war admiral 1937 triple crown winner and second official horse of year another of his offspring hard tack sired seabiscuit who was horse of year in 1938 man o war s most successful sons at stud were war admiral and war relic and war relic s branch of male line survives today tiznow tourist da tara in reality desert vixen honour and glory bal a bali skywalker and are all sire line descendants of man o war man o war s influence in modern pedigrees is magnified by success of his daughters as broodmares although man o war never led broodmare sire list he was runner up ten times and finished in top ten 22 times female line descendants from man o war include eight thirty stymie nijinsky sword dancer riverman jim french sir ivor and kelso war admiral was also a leading broodmare sire especially when crossed with influential mare la and his name can be found in many modern pedigrees through such horses as seattle slew and dr fager american flag also contributed to man o war s modern influence as he was sire of second dam of raise a native who is an almost omnipresent name in american pedigrees some modern breeders design matings to concentrate influence of man o war through deep inbreeding for example he appears 23 times in

different things in him but one thing they will all remember was that he brought exaltation into their hearts an editorial in new york times stated no other horse ever won such fame as man o war none was more beautiful with lovelier lines of grace and power none was more beloved by an admiring and faithful public few have lived so long american scene seems a little vacant with man o war gone to elysian fields where all good horses go man o war was embalmed and buried in a casket lined with riddle s black and gold racing silks he was originally interred at faraway farm but in early 1970s he was re interred at a new burial site at kentucky horse park where his grave is marked with a statue by american sculptor herbert haseltine legacy man o war was inducted into national museum of racing
