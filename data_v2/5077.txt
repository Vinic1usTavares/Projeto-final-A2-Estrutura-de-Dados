a history of british birds is a natural history book by thomas bewick published in two volumes volume 1 land birds appeared in 1797 volume 2 water birds appeared in 1804 a supplement was published in 1821 text in land birds was written by ralph beilby while bewick took over text for second volume book is admired mainly for beauty and clarity of bewick s wood engravings which are widely considered his finest work and among finest in that medium british birds has been compared to works of poetry and literature it plays a recurring role in charlotte bronte s novel jane eyre william wordsworth praised bewick in first lines of his poem two thieves oh now that genius of bewick were mine and skill which he learned on banks of tyne book was effectively first field guide for non specialists bewick provides an accurate illustration of each species from life if possible or from skins common and scientific name s are listed citing naming authorities bird is described with its distribution and behaviour often with extensive quotations from printed sources or correspondents those who provided skins or information are acknowledged species are grouped into families such as of falcon using limited and conflicting scientific sources of time families of land birds are further grouped into birds of prey omnivorous birds insectivorous birds and granivorous birds while families of water birds are simply listed with related families side by side each species entry begins on a new page any spaces at ends of entries are filled with tail pieces small often humorous woodcuts of country life british birds remains in print and has attracted attention of authors such as jenny uglow critics note bewick s skill as a naturalist as well as an engraver approach thumb foot of red necked grebe preface states that while one of editors of this work was engaged in preparing cuts which are faithfully drawn from nature and engraved upon wood compilation of descriptions of land birds was undertaken by other subject however to corrections of his friend whose habits had led him to a more intimate acquaintance with this branch of natural history and goes on to mention that compilation of text was production of those hours which could be spared from a laborious employment namely long hours of work engraving minutely detailed wood printing blocks what preface does not say is reason for this statement about editors which was an angry stand off between bewick and beilby caused by beilby s intention to have an introduction which merely thanked bewick for his assistance and a title page naming beilby as sole author bewick s friend and his wife s godfather thomas hornby heard of this and informed bewick an informal trade panel met to judge matter and preface was result and beilby s name did not appear on title page uglow 2006 pp 259 261 each species of bird is presented in a few pages generally between two and four occasionally as with mallard or common wild duck a few more first is a woodcut of bird always either perched or standing on ground even in case of water birds such as smew that as winter visitors do not nest in britain and consequently are rarely seen away from water there bewick then presents name with variations and latin and french equivalents for example musk duck is also named on line below as cairo guinea or indian duck and next line anas linn le canard buff provides scholarly references to giving of latin binomial by linn and a french description by buff on bewick 1797 1804 text begins by stating size of bird bewick then describes bird typically in one paragraph naming any notable features such as colour of eyes irides bill legs and plumage on each part of body next origin and distribution of species are discussed with notes or quotations from authorities such as john ray gilbert white and buffon bewick then mentions any other facts of interest about bird in case of musk duck this concerns its musky smell which arises from liquor secreted in glands on rump if bird hybridizes with other species this is described along with whether hybrids are fertile productive thumb left 220px sabine s snipe added to later editions was described by vigors in 1825 thumb 220px one of bewick s uncaptioned tail pieces miniature woodcuts showing country life here shooting from a hide at end of sabine s snipe finally bewick acknowledges anyone who helped musk duck is stated to have been drawn from a living specimen which was however excepting head entirely white unlike general appearance shown in woodcut bird was lent to this work by william losh esq of point pleasant near newcastle losh one of bewick s many collaborators was a wealthy partner in losh wilson and bell manufacturers of chemicals and iron many of birds especially rarer species were necessarily illustrated from skins rather than from life for example for sabine s snipe author was favoured by n a vigors esq who had described supposed species with a preserved specimen from which above figure is taken in a memoir posthumously published in 1862 bewick states that he intended to stick to nature as closely as i could but admits that he had in several cases to rely on stuffed preserved skins of his neighbour richard routledge wingate grouping of species gave bewick difficulty uglow 2006 p 249 as scientific sources of time did not agree on how to arrange species in families or on a sequence or grouping of those families bewick for example uses family groups like of falcon in which he includes buzzards and sparrowhawks as well as what are now called falcons families of land birds are further grouped into birds of prey omnivorous birds insectivorous birds and granivorous birds while families of water birds are simply listed with what seemed to be related families such as of anas ducks and of mergus ducks side by side in this way book takes form of and sets a precedent for modern field guides indeed french naturalist francois 1753 1830 assembled a field guide using bewick s woodcuts as early as 1800 each account is closed with a miniature woodcut known from its position in text as a tail piece these small artworks depict aspects of country life often with humorous subjects but all with bewick s eye for detail style and precision some add to illustration of bird in question as for example heron where tail piece shows one heron catching an eel and another flying away tail piece for sabine s snipe a gamebird shows a hunter firing and a small bird falling to ground there is no exclusion of human life from images one tail piece depicts a works complete with smoking chimney beside a river outline land birds thumb 220px hanging washing with pigs and chickens an uncaptioned tail piece in volume 1 land birds like many others this has a humorous touch with a bird leaving muddy footprints on a newly laundered shirt first volume containing history and description of land birds begins with a preface an introduction and a list of technical terms illustrated with bewick s woodcuts introduction begins in no part of animal creation are wisdom goodness and bounty of providence displayed in a more lively manner than in structure formation and various endowments of feathered tribes birds are divided into granivorous grain eating and carnivorous groups which are explained in some detail speed senses flight migration pairing behaviour and feeding of birds are then discussed with observations from spallanzani and gilbert white whose natural history and antiquities of selborne was published in 1789 pleasure of watching birds is mentioned to practical ornithologist there arises a considerable gratification in being able to ascertain distinguishing characters of birds as they appear at a distance whether at rest or during their flight for not only every genus has something peculiar to itself but each species has its own appropriate marks by which a judicious observer may discriminate almost with certainty bewick volume 1 land birds 1847 edition introduction thumb left woodcut of great bustard a horseman and pair of greyhounds gallop after another bustard in background bewick also mentions conservation in context of probable local extinction of a valuable resource both this and great bustard are excellent eating and would well repay trouble of domestication indeed it seems surprising that we should suffer these fine birds to be in danger of total extinction although if properly cultivated they might afford as excellent a repast as our own domestic poultry or even as turkey for which we are indebted to distant countries bewick volume 1 land birds 2nd edition 1847 little bustard 1847 edition revised with additional woodcuts and descriptions is organized as follows with species grouped into families such as shrikes water birds thumb 220px bird s eggs from sea cliffs uncaptioned tail piece in volume 2 water birds bewick has chosen a seabird theme but humans are closely involved and birds are a useful resource second volume containing history and description of water birds begins with its own preface and its own introduction bewick discusses question of where many seabirds go to breed revisits subject of migration and concludes with reflections on an all wise providence as shown in nature thumb left heron common heron or ardea cinerea lath heron woodcut 1847 edition is organized as follows foreign birds foreign birds are not grouped but just listed directly as species from bearded vulture to mino fifteen birds are included with no description and despite their placement in table of contents they appear at front of volume as an appendix reception thumb 220px sparrow hawk shows textures bewick achieved with engraving tools on end grain of hard boxwood in 1805 british critic wrote that it was superfluous to much on merits of a work that everyone liked because of aptness of its descriptions accuracy of its figures spirit of its wood engravings and ingenious variety of its vignettes 1829 magazine of natural history commented that montagu s ornithological dictionary and bewick s birds have rendered department of natural history popular throughout land ibis reviewing memoir of thomas bewick written by himself in 1862 compares effect of bewick and gilbert white writing it was pages of gilbert white and woodcuts of bewick which first beguiled english schoolboy to observation of our feathered friends and how few of our living naturalists but must gratefully acknowledge their early debt to white s history and to life like woodcuts of bewick reviewer judges that probably we shall not wrong cultivated annalist of selborne by giving first place to bewick however comparing them as people bewick has not slightest claim to rank with gilbert white as a naturalist white was what bewick never was a man of science but if no naturalist bewick was a lover of nature a careful observer and a faithful copier of her ever varying forms in this and in this alone lies his charm 1911 encyclopaedia entry on thomas bewick describes british birds as his great achievement that with which his name is inseparably associated observing that bewick from his intimate knowledge of habits of animals acquired during his constant excursions into country was thoroughly qualified to do justice to this great task british birds reviewing a lavishly illustrated british library book on bewick writes that no ornithologist will ever regard thomas bewick known primarily for history of british birds 1797 1804 as a naturalist of same standing as contemporaries such as edward donovan john latham and james bolton noting however that bewick helped to define a certain english romantic sensibility more directly review notes that bewick was aware that his role was to offer a modest guide to birds that common man not only could afford but would also want to possess bewick was not a scientist but he was a perfectionist book s text was written by failed author ralph beilby but text is almost extraneous given bewick s masterpiece tate gallery writes that bewick s best illustrations are in his natural history books history of british birds 2 vols newcastle upon tyne 1797 1804 reveals bewick s gifts as a naturalist as well as an engraver artist was responsible for text as well as illustrations in second volume article notes that book makes extensive use of narrative tailpieces vignettes in which manifold aspects of north country life are expressed with affection humour and a genuine love of nature in later years these miniature scenes came to be more highly regarded than figures they accompany dissenting from general tone of praise for bewick jacob kainen cites claims that many of best tailpieces in history of british birds were drawn by robert johnson and that greater number of those contained in second volume were engraved by clennell granted that outlook and engraving style were bewick s and that these were notable contributions fact that results were so close to his own points more to an effective method of illustration than to outpourings of genius kainen argues that while competent bewick was no holbein no botticelli it is absurd to think of him in such terms but he did develop a fresh method of handling wood engraving thumb left 220px bewick s woodcut of yellow wagtail shows bird in its habitat by fresh water with a detailed illustration including figures in background linnean society writes that history shows that he was also an excellent naturalist a meticulous observer of birds and animals in their habitats university of maryland writes that birds is specific to those species indigenous to britain and is incredibly accurate due to bewick s personal knowledge of habits of birds in wild acquired during his frequent bird watching expeditions it adds that bewick s woodcarvings are considered a pinnacle example of medium jenny uglow writing in guardian notes that an added delight was way he filled blank spaces with tail pieces tiny witty vivid scenes of ordinary life she describes importance of birds in jane eyre and ends he worked with precision and insight in a way that we associate with poets such as clare and wordsworth gerard manley hopkins and elizabeth bishop to bewick nature was source of joy challenge and perpetual consolation in his woodcuts of birds and animals as well as his brilliant tail pieces we can still feel this today however in her biography of bewick she adds that country might be beautiful but it also stank in his vignettes men relieve themselves in hedges and ruins a woman holds her nose as she walks between and a farmyard privy shows that men are as filthy as pigs they despise uglow 2006 p 314 hilary spurling reviewing uglow s biography of bewick in observer writes that when birds appeared people all over britain became his pupils spurling cites charles kingsley s story of his father s hunting friends from new forest mocking him for buying a book about dicky birds until astonished they saw book and discovered things they had known all their lives and never even noticed john brewer writing in london review of books says that for his birds bewick had acquired national renown as artist who most truthfully depicted flora and fauna of british countryside he adds that bewick s achievement was both technical and aesthetic in his view bewick reconciled nature science and art his engravings of british birds which represent his work at its finest are almost all rendered with precision of ornithologist but they also portray animals in their natural habitat grouse shelters in his covert green woodpecker perches on a gnarled branch waders strut by streams he observes that most of best engravings include a figure incident or building which draws viewer s eye beyond and behind animal profile in foreground thus in distant field pulls our gaze past yellow wagtail in culture thumb 220px uncaptioned tail vol 1 p 232 mentioned in charlotte bronte s

mr rochester use bird names for each other including linnet dove skylark eagle and falcon bronte has jane eyre explain and quote bewick i returned to my book bewick s history of british birds letterpress thereof i cared little for generally speaking and yet there were certain introductory pages that child as i was i could not pass quite as a blank they were those which treat of haunts of sea fowl of solitary rocks and by them only inhabited of coast of norway studded with isles from its southern extremity or naze to north cape where northern ocean in vast whirls boils round naked melancholy isles of farthest thule and atlantic surge pours in among stormy hebrides thumb upright 1 5 uncaptioned tail piece woodcut for partridge showing a reaper finding he has just killed a bird
