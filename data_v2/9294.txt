a bitchy stylist who is hired at jabot cosmetics as a fashion consultant explaining her initial portrayal of chloe hendrickson stated i was one who wanted to make her edgy and funny most of people i know who are in fashion business are a little bitchy i wanted to make chloe interesting instead of just playing her like some girl who was putting on fancy clothes there was no conflict there writers definitely gave me that in writing and i tweaked it a little they seemed to enjoy it each day chloe kept getting funnier and she first works with young model lily winters christel khalil new face of jabot whom she treats harshly according to hendrickson chloe takes her job very seriously she is used to working with more professional models and is very hard on lily regarding you know keeping up some sort of appearance if you will regarding fashion industry which is weight so chloe starts to give lily a little weight complex because she is constantly throwing in her face that either she doesn t fit into things or they have to make things larger for her etc chloe is kate as her story progresses following her constant manipulative behavior chloe reveals her true identity kate valentine daughter of chancellor maid esther valentine kate linder storyline was dubbed chloe is kate hendrickson was pleased that writers decided to give chloe a backstory saying i was so excited when i found

relationship is with man believed to be millionaire son of jill abbott cane ashby daniel goddard in july 2009 it is revealed that cane ashby is not son of jill abbott hendrickson compared their relationship which ensued as a result of chloe practically threatening him to psychological thriller film fatal attraction 1987 i ve definitely channeled my inner glenn close at times but i m trying really hard not to make chloe go down crazy path i don t think she s crazy she just desperately wants to be loved she said while cane is drunk chloe sleeps with him and becomes pregnant hendrickson described chloe s actions as definitely plotting but in reference to chloe s backstory said it was not because of who he is she just wanted him prior to revelation that she is kate valentine chloe

mess with her i mean no one dumps chloe mitchell in midst of these events chloe begins a recurring relationship with chance s brother ronan malloy jeff branson actress was pleased with pairing s
