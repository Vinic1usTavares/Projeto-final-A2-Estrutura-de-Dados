by two pairs of recitatives and arias one for bass and other for duet of soprano and alto and a concluding chorale similar to other cantatas on words by franck work is scored for a small baroque chamber ensemble of two violins viola two cellos and continuo bach composed a unique aria with a dark texture of a bass voice and two obbligato cellos a duet has been described as a love duet and compared to operatic duets music of closing chorale is lost except for continuo part it is not clear if bach set stanza printed in libretto from heermann s or instead his by christian in a tune that appears as a cantus firmus in movement 5 history and text on 2 march 1714 bach was appointed concertmaster of weimar court orchestra kapelle of co reigning dukes wilhelm ernst and ernst august of saxe weimar as concertmaster he assumed principal responsibility for composing new works specifically cantatas for schlosskirche palace church on a monthly schedule bach composed cantata in 1715 for 23rd sunday after trinity prescribed readings for sunday were from epistle to philippians our conversation is in heaven and from gospel of matthew question about paying taxes answered by render unto caesar librettist was salomon franck court poet in weimar he began with a paraphrase of famous answer render unto caesar from gospel and included several allusions to money and gold he was also numismatist of weimar court franck included a stanza from a hymn by johann heermann as sixth and last movement of this cantata according to printed libretto final stanza of wo soll ich fliehen hin 1630 music of that chorale is lost only continuo part has survived recent scholarship found that bach possibly chose to set a stanza from heermann s meinen jesum lass ich nicht instead in a tune he used instrumentally in movement 5 which would match continuo part bach led first performance on 24 november 1715 it was first cantata performed after a period of mourning for prince johann ernst from august to november no account is extant of a later performance in leipzig but bach scholar christoph wolff writes it seems safe to assume that it was revived scoring and structure cantata in structured in six movements beginning with an aria for tenor t followed by two pairs of recitative and aria one for bass b other for duet of soprano s and alto a and a concluding chorale when all four parts are united as with several other cantatas on words by franck it is scored for a small baroque chamber ensemble of two violins vl viola va two cellos vc and basso continuo bc in following table of movements scoring keys and time signatures are taken from alfred durr using symbol for common time 4 4 instruments are shown separately for winds and strings while continuo playing throughout is not shown music opening da capo aria for tenor is based on a paraphrase of render to caesar nur jedem das seine aria features an unusual ritornello in which strings assume a motif introduced by continuo which is then repeated several times through all parts movement is a da capo aria emphasizing dualism and debt craig smith remarks that it is almost academic in its metrical insistence second movement is a secco bass recitative you are my god giver of all gifts it has been described as operatic in its intensity and subtle adjustments of character recitative is remarkable for its aggressive even belligerent conclusion following bass aria let my heart be coin has an unusual and unique accompaniment of two obbligato cellos with continuo cellos present an imitative motif to introduce bass john eliot gardiner who conducted bach cantata pilgrimage in 2000 comments that bach conjures up an irresistible picture of two coin at work a sort of eighteenth century sorcerer goading his apprentice observing that two cellos polish away in contrary motion with wide leaps bach was interested in coins and precious metals conductor craig smith compares dark texture to descent into earth in wagner s das rheingold aria is in three thematic sections enjoining melodramatically rhetoric and fourth movement is a soprano and alto duet recitative i would gladly o god give you my heart it is rhythmically metrical and presents five sections based on mood and text recitative is high and light but very complicated in its myriad of detail duet aria take me from myself and give me to you again for soprano and alto is in triple time tune of johann heermann s hymn meinen jesum lass ich nicht i will not let go of my jesus is interwoven in texture as a cantus firmus of upper strings in unison movement is a love duet characterized by antiphonal of commitment to god rather than a carnal desire musicologist julian mincham compares its presentation to monteverdi s l incoronazione di poppea movement begins with sparse scoring and becomes more richly textured as it progresses adding chorale tune final movement possibly fuhr auch mein herz und sinn also lead my heart and mind is a four part chorale setting marked chorale in semplice stylo however only continuo line is extant while libretto shows that a stanza from heermann s wo soll ich fliehen hin was to be used sung to a melody by christian friedrich witt bach scholar andreas glockner found that continuo part matches tune in previous movement which appeared in a hymnal published by witt recordings amsterdam baroque orchestra
