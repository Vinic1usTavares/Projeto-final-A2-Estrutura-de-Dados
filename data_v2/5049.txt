thumb alt a black typewriter decorated with ornate floral patterns sits affixed to an iron sewing machine stand with a treadle sholes and glidden typewriter as produced by e remington and sons sholes and glidden typewriter also known as remington no 1 was first commercially successful typewriter principally designed by american inventor christopher latham sholes it was developed with assistance of fellow printer samuel w soule and amateur mechanic carlos s glidden work began in 1867 but soule left enterprise shortly thereafter replaced by james densmore who provided financial backing and driving force behind machine s continued development after several short lived attempts to manufacture device machine was acquired by e remington and sons in early 1873 an arms manufacturer seeking to diversify remington further refined typewriter before finally placing it on market on july 1 1874 during its development typewriter evolved from a crude curiosity into a practical device basic form of which became industry standard machine incorporated elements which became fundamental to typewriter design including a cylindrical platen and a four rowed qwerty keyboard several design deficiencies remained however sholes and glidden could print only upper case letters an issue remedied in its successor remington no 2 and was a blind writer meaning typist could not see what was being written as it was entered initially typewriter received an unenthusiastic reception from public lack of an established market high cost and need for trained operators slowed its adoption additionally recipients of typewritten messages found mechanical all upper case writing to be impersonal and even insulting new communication technologies and expanding businesses of late 19th century however had created a need for expedient legible correspondence and so sholes and glidden and its contemporaries soon became common office fixtures typewriter is credited with assisting entrance of women into clerical workplace as many were hired to operate new devices history early development thumb alt a 45 degree view of a wooden device with piano like keyboard and centered on its top a metal disk over which a mechanical arm with two spindles is suspended machine patented on june 23 1868 resembled a cross between a piano and a kitchen table current 1949 p 394 sholes and glidden typewriter had its origin in a printing machine designed in 1866 by christopher latham sholes to assist in printing page numbers in books and serial numbers on tickets and other items oden 1917 p 19 sholes a wisconsin printer formed a partnership with samuel w soule also a printer and together they began development work in charles f s machine shop a converted mill in northern milwaukee carlos s glidden an inventor who frequented machine shop became interested in device and suggested that it might be adapted to print alphabetical characters as well bliven 1954 p 44 in july 1867 glidden read an article in scientific american describing a writing machine invented by john pratt and recently featured in an issue of london engineering glidden showed article to sholes who thought machine complicated and liable to get out of order iles 1912 p 321 and was convinced that a better machine could be designed to that point several dozen patents for printing devices had been issued in united states and abroad cortada 2000 p 15 none of machines however had been successful or effective products campbell kelly 2004 p 24 in november 1866 following their successful collaboration on numbering machine sholes asked soule to join him and glidden in developing new device mathias schwalbach a german clockmaker was hired to assist with construction to test proposed machine s feasibility a key was taken from a telegraph machine and modified to print letter w by september 1867 a model with a full alphabet numbers and rudimentary punctuation had been completed and it was used to compose letters to acquaintances in hope of selling invention or procuring funds for its manufacture current 1977 p 98 one recipient james densmore immediately bought a 25 interest for 600 cost of machine s development to that date bliven 1954 p 1974 p 29 densmore saw machine for first time in march 1868 and was unimpressed he thought it clumsy and impractical and declared it good for nothing except to show that its underlying principles were sound iles 1912 p 328 among other deficiencies device held paper in a horizontal frame which limited thickness of paper that could be used and made alignment difficult iles 1912 p 324 a patent for type writer was granted on june 23 1868 and despite device s flaws densmore rented a building in chicago in which to begin its manufacture fifteen units were produced before a lack of funds forced venture back to milwaukee bliven 1954 p 80 refinement during 1869 an improved model was designed which unlike previous version drew upon work done by other inventors a machine patented in 1833 by charles thurber for example used a cylindrical platen current 1949 p 397 sholes adapted idea and implemented a rotating drum to which paper was clipped replacing frame of previous model current 1977 p 99 soule and glidden did not assist development of new platen and as their interest in venture was waning sold their rights to original machine to sholes and densmore current 1949 p 398 prototypes were sent to professionals in various fields including james o clephane a stenographer whose heavy use destroyed several machines clephane s feedback although caustic led to development of an additional 25 to 30 prototypes each an improvement on its predecessor in summer 1870 densmore traveled to new york to demonstrate machine to western union bliven 1954 p 1974 p 30 which was looking for a method to record telegrams western union ordered several machines but declined to purchase rights as it believed a superior device could be developed for less than densmore s asking price of 50 000 thumb alt a sprawling industrial complex with numerous buildings and smokestacks of varying sizes e remington and sons factory in ilion new york c 1874 to supply orders and to repay debts densmore began to manufacture machine in summer 1871 during this time machine was revised to improve durability and platen was redesigned after feedback from western union which wanted ability to print on a continuous roll indicated that clipping paper to platen was impractical new design however infringed a patent granted to charles a washburn in november 1870 washburn consequently received royalties on future production current 1949 p 400 in 1872 to manufacture new machine in earnest a former wheelwright shop was secured along with several employees although machines worked well lack of economies of scale prevented venture from yielding a profit in exchange for funding ventures densmore had been acquiring an ever increasing ownership interest sholes was eventually bought out for a cash payment of 12 000 melville 1923 p 42 glidden kept his one tenth right of patent current 1949 p 402 densmore consulted with george w n yost a manufacturer with whom he had been acquainted who suggested showing machine to e remington and sons current 1977 p 101 remington an arms manufacturer seeking to diversify after civil war possessed machining equipment and skilled machinists necessary to further develop complex machine a typewritten letter was sent to remington where executive henry h benedict was impressed by novelty and encouraged company president philo remington to pursue device mayo 2007 p 29 start of an industry thumb alt an ornately decorated typewriter with black lacquer gold detailing and various floral arrangements a redesign incorporated floral ornamentation a characteristic from remington s sewing machine division following a demonstration at remington s offices in new york company contracted on march 1 1873 to manufacture 1 000 machines with option to produce an additional 24 000 although agreement required densmore to give remington 10 000 and royalty rights a marketing firm to be formed by densmore and yost was allowed to serve as exclusive sales agent current 1949 p 404 remington dedicated a wing of its factory to typewriter and spent several months retooling and re engineering device production began in september and machine entered market on july 1 1874 typewriter production was largely overseen by jefferson clough and william k manager of remington s sewing machine division redesigned machine was sturdier and more reliable than sholes model but it had taken on some of characteristics of a sewing machine including a case with floral ornamentation and a stand with a treadle to operate carriage return burlingame 1976 p 135 typewriter however had been rushed into production with insufficient testing bliven 1954 p 82 and early models were soon returned for adjustments and repair bliven 1954 p 58 by december 1874 only 400 typewriters had been sold due in part to their high price and poor reliability utterback 1999 p 7 as businesses were slow to adopt machine authors clergymen lawyers and newspaper editors were targeted customers campbell kelly 2004 pp 25 26 individuals however generally did not write enough to justify machine s price of about 125 average annual income per person at time cortada 2000 p 2007 p 14 there were exceptions however mark twain was among first to purchase machine which he termed a curiosity breeding little joker although machine was exhibited at centennial exhibition in 1876 it was overshadowed by alexander graham bell s telephone bliven 1954 p 64 several design and manufacturing improvements followed including replacing treadle with a hand lever and 4 000 machines had been sold by 1877 in 1878 remington outsourced marketing to e t fairbanks company a scale manufacturer as marketing to that point had produced only lackluster sales cortada 2000 p 16 an improved model remington no 2 was also introduced in 1878 new machine was able to type upper and lowercase characters thus remedying a significant drawback of its predecessor as only typewriter manufacturer remington maintained a monopoly position until american writing machine company introduced a typewriter to compete with remington machines in 1881 campbell kelly 2004 p 26 in response to new competition remington lowered price of sholes and glidden referred to in sales literature as remington no 1 to 80 and negotiated an agreement with marketing firm wyckoff seamans benedict to take all machines produced arrangement marked beginning of typewriter s commercial success ingham 1983 p 1270 as agency s marketing prowess led to sale of 1 200 machines in its first year by 1884 more competitors had appeared including hammond typewriter company crandall type writer company and hall typewriter company in decade since introduction of sholes and glidden a thriving typewriter industry had developed design thumb alt a side view of a typewriter depicting internal linkages and components a wire runs from two banked keyboard down to a lever at bottom of device from which another wire runs upwards to a basket formed by typebars several gears and counterweights are located towards rear of machine one variant of sholes and glidden typewriter used wires and levers to connect keys and typebars sholes and glidden typewriter incorporated several components adapted from existing devices such as escapement a mechanism governing carriage movement adapted from clockwork keys adapted from telegraph machines and type hammers adapted from piano utterback 1999 p 4 in developing first model however sholes and soule had not investigated printing machines created by other inventors and consequently developed several poor designs which could have been avoided failure to research earlier designs also led to reinvention of features which had already been developed soule for example suggested a circular typebar orientation a circular arrangement had been used more than 30 years earlier in a machine designed by xavier in 1833 in machine s original 1868 design paper was placed horizontally on top of machine held in place by a movable square frame to provide line and letter spacing above paper and centered on device an arm held an inked ribbon which crossed over a small metal plate depressing a key caused a typebar to rise from underneath paper pressing paper upwards against ribbon and thus printing an inked character this method of imprinting required use of very thin nonstandard paper such as tissue paper two variants were produced with alternative methods of actuating typebars one in which keys and typebars were connected by a series of wires and one in which keys directly kicked typebars upwards current 1949 p 396 thumb left alt a wooden typewriter with a ty keyboard composed of circular white keys platen rests on top of device connected to a bar which extends several inches beyond sides of machine counterweights are suspended from each end of bar to which several wheels and gears are also attached by end of 1872 typewriter had taken an appearance similar to that of a modern typewriter arm and frame components were replaced with a cylindrical platen in 1869 unlike modern typewriters revised machine entered letters around cylinder with axial rotation providing letter spacing and horizontal shifting providing line spacing paper was clipped directly to cylinder which limited its length and width to dimensions of apparatus platen was again redesigned in early 1872 to allow use of paper of any length redesigned platen also introduced modern spacing functionality horizontal and axial movement providing letter and line spacing respectively current 1949 p 401 cylindrical platen became an indispensable part of every standard typewriter by end of 1872 appearance and function of typewriter had assumed form that would become standard in industry and remain largely unchanged for next century although machine possessed a cylindrical platen and what was essentially a qwerty keyboard two design elements that would later become essential were lacking ability to write in upper and lowercase letters and visible print although former was implemented in remington no 2 machine was fundamentally an design meaning typebars struck upwards against underside of platen as this occurred inside machine operator could not see what was being entered as it was typed although competing brands such as oliver and underwood began to market visible typewriters in 1890s a remington branded model did not appear until remington no 10 in 1906 post 1981 p 85 qwerty keyboard qwerty keyboard so named for first six characters of uppermost alphabetic row was invented during course of typewriter s development first model constructed by sholes used a piano like keyboard with two rows of characters arranged alphabetically as follows thumb alt a portion of a metal ring with dashed lines to indicated truncated portion to which a series of u shaped brackets are screwed to one of brackets a pivoting typebar with a curved is affixed typebars were attached to circumference of a metal ring such that they would strike a common center schwalbach later replaced piano like keys with buttons and positioned them into four banked rows current 1954 p 44 mechanics of machine however made alphabetical arrangement problematic typebars were attached to circumference of a metal ring forming a basket when a key was pressed corresponding typebar would swing upwards causing print head to strike at center of ring gravity would then return typebar to its initial position implication of this design however was that pressing adjoining keys in quick succession would cause their typebars to collide and jam machine to mitigate this problem keys were reordered using analysis of letter frequency and trial and error utterback 1999 p 5 densmore asked his son in law a pennsylvania school superintendent what letters and combinations of letters appeared most often in english language lekberg 1972 p 37 typebars corresponding to letters in commonly occurring alphabetical pairs such as s and t were placed on opposite sides on ring campbell kelly 2004 p 25 keyboard ultimately presented to remington was arranged as follows after it purchased device remington made several adjustments including switching period and r keys which created a keyboard with what is essentially modern qwerty layout pool 1997 p 159 reception and legacy thumb alt four lines of shorthand writing symbolic characters composed of dots and straight and curved lines shorthand although capable of being written quickly required special training to comprehend typewriter simultaneously addressed need for speed and legibility sholes and glidden was first commercially successful typewriter industrialization and corporate growth in late 19th century produced a business environment for which device was well suited new communications technologies such as telegraph and telephone facilitated geographic expansion and increased speed with which business was conducted mackenzie 2007 pp 6 7 resulting increase in volume of correspondence required messages to be produced quickly and legibly before typewriter clerks and copyists could write relatively quickly in shorthand or longhand comprehension of these scripts however required either special training or close concentration typesetting was used when legibility was important but it was a slow and expensive process typewriter succeeded because it simultaneously addressed both issues campbell kelly 2005 public was initially skeptical of typewriter and reactions included apathy and antagonism outside of large companies letters generally did not need to be composed quickly as device was reliant upon its operator it offered no automation in business settings involving customer interaction unfamiliar machines were viewed with suspicion as there existed perception that mechanical devices could be rigged by unscrupulous merchants and presence of such a large object between customer and employee interrupted personal touch individuals receiving typewritten letters often found them insulting as type implied they could not read handwriting or impersonal problems exacerbated by all upper case writing burlingame 1976 p 2000 p 18 typewriter also precipitated privacy concerns as recipients of letters of a personal nature believed a third party operator or typesetter must have been involved in their composition bliven 1954 p 71 women and typewriter thumb alt a woman in a long frilled dress with a pleated train sits at a large wooden typewriter which is approximately half her size typewriter is affixed to a small table with an open drawer a female typist operates a sholes and glidden typewriter as depicted in an 1872 scientific american article association of women with typewriter may be linked to way in which it was marketed hoke 1979 p 82 before typewriter was acquired by remington sholes daughter was employed to demonstrate device and to appear in promotional images which served as basis for early advertisements wosk 2001 p 24 remington s sales agents later marketed machine with tactics including use of attractive women to demonstrate device at trade shows and in hotel lobbies miller 1997 p 349 depictions of female operators suggested device was easy enough for a woman and suited for domestic use although also designed to allow remington to maintain manufacturing efficiencies with its sewing machine division typewriter s aesthetics sewing machine stand and floral ornamentation were further intended to facilitate its acceptance into household a major consequence utterback 1999 p 8 of typewriter s development was entrance of women into clerical work force beeching 1974 pp 34 35 although women were already employed in factories and certain service industries in 1880s typewriter facilitated an influx of women into office settings burlingame 1976 p 137 before young women s christian association ywca established first typing school in 1881 bliven 1954 p 72 women were trained by manufacturer and their typing services provided to customers along with machine expansion of correspondence and paper work that demanded efficiency of typewriters however also created demand for additional clerical workers low wages accepted by women often 50 or less of those paid to a man made them more attractive economically to businesses when filling new positions as typing and positions could pay up to ten times more than those in factories women were attracted in large numbers to office work hoke 1979 p 79 in 1874 less than 4 of clerical workers in united states were women by 1900 number had increased to approximately 75 krystal 2007 p 15 before his death sholes remarked of typewriter i do feel that i have done something for women who have always had to work so hard this will enable them
