mascarene parrot or mascarin mascarinus mascarin is an extinct species of parrot that was endemic to mascarene island of reunion in western indian ocean taxonomic relationships of this species have been subject to debate it has historically been grouped with either psittaculini parrots or vasa parrots with latest genetic study favouring former group mascarene parrot was in length with a large red bill and long rounded tail feathers its legs were red and it had naked red skin around eyes and nostrils it had a black facial mask and partially white tail feathers but colouration of body wings and head in living bird is unclear descriptions from life indicate body and head were ash grey and white part of tail had two dark central feathers in contrast stuffed specimens and old descriptions based on them indicate that body was brown and head bluish this may be due to specimens having changed colour as a result of ageing and exposure to light very little is known about bird in life mascarene parrot was first mentioned in 1674 and live specimens were later brought to europe where they lived in captivity species was scientifically described in 1771 only two stuffed specimens exist today in paris and vienna date and cause of extinction for mascarene parrot is unclear latest account from 1834 is considered dubious so it is probable that species became extinct prior to 1800 and may have become extinct even earlier taxonomy thumb upright left 1801 illustration by jacques barraband mascarene parrot was first mentioned by french traveller sieur dubois in his 1674 travelogue and only described a few times from life afterwards at least three live specimens were brought to france in late 18th century and kept in captivity two of which were described while alive today two stuffed specimens exist holotype specimen mnhn 211 which is in museum national d histoire naturelle in paris while other specimen nmw 50 688 is in museum in vienna latter specimen was bought from museum during a sale in london in 1806 a third stuffed specimen existed around turn of 18th century mascarene parrot was scientifically described as psittacus mascarinus abbreviated as mascarin by swedish zoologist carl linnaeus in 1771 this name was first used by french zoologist mathurin jacques brisson in 1760 but was not intended as a scientific name name is a reference to mascarene islands which were themselves named after their portuguese discoverer pedro mascarenhas early writers claimed mascarene parrot was found on madagascar an idea that led french naturalist rene primevere lesson to coin junior synonym mascarinus madagascariensis in 1831 his new genus name prevailed and when italian zoologist tommaso salvadori combined it with earlier specific name in 1891 it became a tautonym a scientific name in which two parts are identical lesson also included species of tanygnathus and psittacula genera in mascarinus but this was not accepted by other writers following year german herpetologist johann georg wagler erected genus coracopsis for mascarene parrot which became coracopsis under this system and lesser vasa parrot coracopsis nigra english zoologist william alexander forbes believing that mascarinus was invalid as a specific name since it was identical to genus name coined new name mascarinus in 1879 in honour of dubois binomial name was emended from m mascarinus to m mascarin by ioc world bird list in 2016 to conform with how other species epithets by linnaeus have been treated an unidentified dark parrot seen alive by swedish naturalist fredrik in africa was given name psittacus obscurus by linnaeus in 1758 who again synonymised it with mascarene parrot in 1766 because of this association some authors believed it was from mascarene islands as well but this dark parrot s description differs from that of mascarene parrot this disagreement led some authors to use now invalid combinations of scientific names such as mascarinus obscurus and coracopsis obscura unidentified parrot may have been a grey parrot psittacus erithacus instead another unidentified parrot specimen this one brown and housed in cabinet du roi was described by french naturalist comte de buffon in 1779 under his entry for mascarene parrot in which he pointed out similarities and differences between two english palaeontologist julian hume has suggested possibility that this might have been a lesser vasa parrot if not a discoloured old mascarene grey parakeet psittacula specimen is now lost english zoologist george robert gray assigned some eclectus parrot eclectus subspecies from moluccas to mascarinus in his book a list of genera of birds from 1840s but this idea was soon dismissed by other writers subfossil parrot remains were later excavated from grottos on reunion and reported in 1996 x rays of two existing stuffed mascarene parrots made it possible to compare remaining bones with subfossils and showed these were intermediate in measurements in comparison to modern specimens lesser vasa parrot was introduced to reunion as early as 1780 but though subfossil parrot bones were similar to that species in some aspects they were more similar to those of mascarene parrot and considered to belong to it evolution thumb skull elements extracted from paris specimen 1866 affinities of mascarene parrot are unclear and two hypotheses have competed since mid 19th century some authors grouped it with of african origin due to its dark plumage and others with parrots of asian origin based on large red beak a feature which is diagnostic for that group its plumage pattern was mostly atypical for a though other members have black facial patterns although little is known about most extinct parrot species of mascarenes subfossil remains show that they shared common features such as enlarged heads and jaws reduced pectoral bones and robust leg bones hume supported their common origin in radiation of psittaculini tribe based on morphological features and fact that psittacula parrots have managed to colonise many isolated islands in indian ocean sea levels were lower during pleistocene so it was possible for species to colonise mascarene islands from other areas check hume 2008 pp 69 71 psittaculini could have invaded area several times as many of species were so specialised that they may have evolved significantly on hotspot islands before mascarenes emerged from sea reunion is 3 million years old which is enough time for new genera to evolve but many endemics would have been wiped out by eruption of volcano des neiges between 300 000 and 180 000 years ago most recent and extant species would therefore probably be descendants of animals which had island from africa or madagascar after this event if mascarene parrot had in fact evolved into a distinct genus on reunion prior to volcanic eruption it would have been one of few survivors of this extinction event a 2011 genetic study by samit kundu and colleagues which sampled paris specimen found that mascarene parrot was grouped among subspecies of lesser vasa parrot from madagascar and nearby islands and therefore not related to psittacula parrots it also found that mascarene parrot line diverged 4 6 to 9 million years ago prior to formation of reunion indicating this must have happened elsewhere cladogram accompanying 2011 study is shown below thumb upright plate from comte de buffon s encyclopaedia histoire naturelle 1700s in 2012 leo joseph and colleagues acknowledged finding but pointed out that sample might have been damaged and that further testing was needed before issue could be fully resolved they also noted that if mascarinus was confirmed to be embedded within genus coracopsis latter would become a junior synonym since former name is older in 2012 hume expressed surprise at these findings due to anatomical similarities between mascarene parrot and other parrots from mascarene islands that are believed to be he also pointed out that there is no fossil evidence found on other islands to support hypothesis that species evolved elsewhere before reaching reunion in 2017 lars and colleagues sampled vienna specimen for a new genetic study and found that mascarene parrot was indeed part of psittacula group as suggested by hume clustering with extinct seychelles parakeet p and asian subspecies of alexandrine parakeet p mascarene parrot was therefore interpreted as having descended from an ancestral lineage of alexandrine parakeets that had dispersed from asia towards mascarene islands across indian ocean researchers suggested that 2011 genetic study had probably used a composite of sequences from two other parrot species sampled for study including a lesser vasa parrot a result of contamination during laboratory procedures 2017 study also found that parrots of genus tanygnathus were grouped among psittacula parrots and proposed and mascarinus should therefore be merged into genus psittacula cladogram accompanying 2017 study is shown below description thumb upright plate by francois nicolas martinet 1779 showing a bluish head and brown body mascarene parrot was in length wing was tail culmen and tarsus it had a large red bill and moderately long rounded tail feathers it had a black velvet like facial mask on front part of head there are several discrepancies in how colour of body wings tail feathers and head have historically been described and depicted in 1674 dubois described live specimens as being petit gris which is colour of dark phase of red squirrel according to hume this colour is a dark blackish grey or brown in 1760 brisson published following description based on a captive bird which may have been specimen now preserved in paris instead of grey several later authors described body as brown and head as bluish lilac based on stuffed specimens and this has become orthodox image of bird live birds were never described with these colours hume proposed that this colouration is an artifact of taxidermy specimens having aged and being exposed to light which can turn grey and black to brown such a transformation has also turned an aberrant dickcissel americana specimen sometimes considered a distinct species townsend s dickcissel from grey to brown two extant mascarene parrot specimens also differ from each other in colouration paris specimen has a greyish blue head and a brown body paler on underparts its tail and wing feathers were severely damaged by sulphuric acid in an attempt at fumigation in 1790s vienna specimen is a pale brown on head and body overall with an irregular distribution of white feathers on tail back and wings in 2017 australian ornithologist joseph m forshaw found it hard to accept that all illustrations that showed colour as brown were wrong he found it more likely that brown would have merely faded in intensity rather than from grey to brown he stated that by time earliest known illustrations of bird were made it is unlikely they would already have faded to brown because of exposure to light he also doubted that poor diet of caged birds would have consistently turned them brown and instead accepted orthodox image of bird as brown thumb illustration of paris specimen s head after its skull was removed and feet 1879 confusion over colouration of mascarene parrot has also been furthered by a plate by french engraver francois nicolas martinet in buffon s 1779 histoire naturelle des oiseaux first coloured illustration of this species it shows bird as brown with a purplish head and strength of these colours differs considerably between copies a result of having been hand coloured by many different artists who worked under martinet in his workshop across these copies body ranges from chestnut brown to greyish chocolate tail from light grey to blackish grey brown and head from bluish grey to dove grey plate also lacks two dark central tail feathers without white bases a feature described by brisson and these features have been repeated by subsequent artists martinet s illustration and buffon s description were perhaps based on paris specimen in 1879 forbes stated cere was covered by feathers which concealed nostrils this contradicts other accounts that mention that nostrils were surrounded by red skin forbes based his description on paris specimen which had its skull and mandible removed for study by french zoologist alphonse milne edwards prior to 1866 this may have led to distortion of shape of head and nostrils as indicated by illustration in forbes article behaviour and ecology thumb upright 1907 depiction by keulemans based on his 1893 illustration very little is known about mascarene parrot in life since several specimens were kept alive in captivity it was probably not a specialised feeder check hume 2008 p 42 that vienna specimen was partially white may have been result of food deficiency during a long period in captivity clipped primary wing feathers indicate it was caged little was known about parrot diet in 1700s and vienna specimen may not have received enough of amino acid tyrosine through its food which it would have needed for melanin synthesis in other parrots this would have resulted in orange instead of white colour in affected feathers due to presence of pigment but coracopsis parrots and mascarene parrot are only parrots that lack this pigment specimen has also been described as partially at times though true albinism lack of enzyme tyrosinase can by definition never only be partial thumb left forested mountain area on reunion 2006 in 1705 french cartographer jean feuilley gave a description of parrots of reunion and their ecology which indicates that they fattened themselves seasonally mascarene parrot may have once inhabited mauritius as well based on a 17th century account by english traveller peter mundy which mentioned russet parrots this is a possibility since reunion and mauritius do share some types of animals but no fossil evidence has yet been discovered many other endemic species of reunion became extinct after arrival of man and resulting disruption of island s ecosystem mascarene parrot lived alongside other recently extinct birds such as hoopoe starling reunion ibis reunion parakeet mascarene grey parakeet reunion swamphen reunion owl reunion night heron and reunion pink pigeon extinct reunion reptiles include reunion giant tortoise and an undescribed leiolopisma skink small mauritian flying fox and snail tropidophora carinata lived on reunion and mauritius but vanished from both islands check hume 2008 pp 30 43 extinction thumb upright carl wilhelm hahn s 1834 illustration of supposedly last living bird which may have been based on martinet s 1779 image of eight or so parrot species endemic to mascarenes only echo parakeet psittacula echo of mauritius has survived others probably all became extinct due to a combination of excessive hunting and deforestation cause and date of extinction for mascarene parrot itself is uncertain in 1834 german zoologist carl wilhelm hahn published an often cited account of a live mascarene parrot in possession of king maximilian i joseph of bavaria bird must have been very old at time and hahn claimed an accompanying illustration was drawn after this specimen iucn red list accepts 1834 account as last mention of a live specimen veracity of hahn s claim was questioned as early as 1876 and illustration appears to be plagiarised from plate by francois nicolas martinet which was published at least 50 years earlier after king maximilian died in 1825 his collection was auctioned off but no mascarene parrot was mentioned in inventory of species hahn did not mention date in which he actually saw bird which could have been long before 1834 fact that martinet s image was copied and that no mounted specimen exists though such a rare bird would probably have been preserved makes hahn s account dubious he may instead have based his account on other sources or even hearsay if hahn s account is disregarded mascarene parrot probably became extinct prior to 1800 last account of wild specimens on reunion is from 1770s it is thought that mascarene parrot went extinct in wild while captive specimens still survived in europe since specimens are known to have lived there after last mention of wild birds in 1790s french naturalist francois levaillant stated that bird was rare and that he had seen three of them in france one of last definite accounts of live specimens is following 1784 description by based on captive birds contrary to feuilley s claims dubois mentioned that mascarene parrot was not edible which may have led to reunion visitors mostly ignoring it check hume 2008 p 107 it was last of indigenous parrots of reunion to become extinct only endemic bird species on reunion that disappeared after mascarene parrot was hoopoe starling in mid 19th century references cited texts external links mascarene parrot
