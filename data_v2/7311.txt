silent film writer of scenario is unknown but it may have been lloyd lonergan lonergan was an experienced newspaperman still employed by new york evening world while writing scripts for thanhouser productions he was most important script writer for thanhouser averaging 200 scripts a year from 1910 to 1915 there has been considerable debate over identity of film s director most commonly directional credit is given to theodore marston apparent origin of this error is from american film index 1908 1915 film historian q david bowers consulted one of co authors of book gunnar lundquist and confirmed that credit of marston was in error theodore marston worked with pathe kinemacolor vitagraph and other companies but there is no record of marston working with thanhouser this error has persisted in following decade in several publications also i del cinema guida per al primo secolo di film also credits marston among more prominent citations of marston s role at thanhouser is in american silent horror science fiction and fantasy feature films 1913 1929 by john t while director of film is not known two thanhouser directors are possible barry o neil was stage name of thomas j

company amelia barleon was a minor actress at thanhouser with more stage experience it is unknown how many films she appeared in but this is credited as her first and winter s tale as her second and last charles compton may have had his film career start in this thanhouser production but he was better known for his juvenile roles on stage bowers credits martin j faust as one of most important
