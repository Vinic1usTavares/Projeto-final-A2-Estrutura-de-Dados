has neither campy fun of its tv predecessor nor blockbuster action of its cinematic superhero competitors and sadly never quite manages to shift into turbo for some good old fashioned morphin time on metacritic which assigns a normalized rating film has a score 44 out of 100 based on 30 critics indicating mixed or average reviews audiences polled by cinemascore gave film an average grade of a on an a to f scale while posttrak reported 66 of audience members gave film a definite recommend ign gave film a 7 10 saying power rangers doesn t quite pull off everything it wants to but it s a fun time at theater nonetheless mike mccahill of guardian wrote that film achieves a functioning mediocrity we perhaps might have thought beyond this franchise and gave it 2 out of 5 stars mike ryan of uproxx gave film a negative review writing power rangers has one of most zig zagged tones of any big budget studio film i ve seen in a long time it s jarring at times how often it goes back and forth between gritty and silly writing for variety owen gleiberman also criticized film s conflicting tones saying 25 years ago mighty morphin power rangers was launched as superhero fodder for kids and there was indeed a place for it but we re now so awash in superhero culture that kids no longer need safe lame pandering junior league version of it they can just watch ant man or pg 13 suicide squad
