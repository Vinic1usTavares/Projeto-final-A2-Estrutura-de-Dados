been asked to write a version of script in 1957 refused and been placed on suspension for his decision according to vidal karl tunberg was one of last writers to work on script other sources place tunberg s initial involvement much earlier tunberg cut out everything in book after crucifixion of jesus omitted sub plot in which ben hur fakes his death and raises a jewish army to overthrow romans and altered manner in which women are healed morsberger and morsberger p 482 according to wyler vidal their biographers see bibliography below and sources that follow them zimbalist was unhappy with

william wyler who had been one of 30 assistant directors on 1925 film freiman p 24 in early 1957 wyler weighs offer new york times february 5 1957 wyler initially rejected it considering quality of script to be very primitive elementary and no better than hack work herman p 394 zimbalist showed wyler some preliminary storyboards for chariot race and informed him that mgm would be willing to spend up to 10 million and as a result wyler began to express an interest in picture herman p 395 mgm permitted wyler to start casting and in april 1957 mainstream media outlets reported that wyler was giving screen tests to italian leading men such as cesare don tour around lot new york times april 7 1957 wyler did not formally agree to direct film until september 1957 and mgm did not announce

promised a base salary of 350 000 as well as 8 percent of gross box office or 3 percent of net profits whichever was greater herman p 393 and he wanted to work in rome again in hollywood on tiber where he had filmed roman holiday p 559 his base salary was at time largest ever paid to a director for a single film professional competitive reasons also played a role in his decision to direct and wyler later admitted that he wished to outdo cecil b demille and make a thinking man s biblical epic eldridge p 15 in later years william wyler would joke that it took a jew to make a good film about christ writing thumb left gore vidal wyler felt tunberg s draft was too much of a morality play overlaid with current western political overtones and that dialogue was too modern sounding madsen p 342 zimbalist brought in playwright s n behrman who also wrote script for quo vadis and then playwright maxwell anderson to write drafts gore vidal biographer fred kaplan states that british poet and playwright christopher fry was hired simultaneously with vidal although most sources including vidal himself state that vidal followed anderson and that fry did not come aboard until vidal was close to leaving picture vidal arrived in rome in early march 1958 to meet with wyler vidal claimed that wyler had not read script and that when he did so at vidal s urging on his flight from u s to italy he was upset with modernist dialogue vidal agreed to work on script for three months so that he would come off suspension and fulfill his contract with mgm although zimbalist pushed him to stay throughout entire production kaplan p 442 vidal was researching a book on 4th century roman emperor julian and knew a great deal about ancient rome kaplan p 441 vidal s working style was to finish a scene and review it with zimbalist once vidal and zimbalist had come to agreement scene would be passed to wyler vidal said he kept structure of tunberg behrman anderson script but rewrote nearly all dialogue kaplan p 445 vidal admitted to william morris in march 1959 that fry rewrote as much as a third of dialogue which vidal had added to first half of script vidal made one structural change which was not revised however tunberg script had ben hur and messala reuniting and falling out in a single scene vidal broke scene in two so that men first reunite at castle antonia and then later argue and end their friendship at ben hur s home vidal also added small character touches to script such as messala s purchase of a brooch for tirzah and ben hur s purchase of a horse for messala vidal claimed that he worked on first half of script everything up to chariot race and scripted 10 versions of scene where ben hur confronts messala and begs for his family s freedom herman p 400 giddins p 247 vidal s claim about a homoerotic subtext is hotly debated vidal first made claim in an interview in 1995 documentary film celluloid closet and asserted that he persuaded wyler to direct stephen boyd to play role as if he were a spurned homosexual lover malamud and mcguire pp 37 38 vidal said that he believed that messala s vindictiveness could only be motivated by feeling of rejection that a lover would feel and claimed to have suggested to wyler that stephen boyd should play role that way and that heston be kept in dark about messala character s motivations whether vidal wrote scene in question or had acting conversation with wyler and whether wyler shot what vidal wrote remain issues of debate chuck roast advocate june 25 1996 p 82 retrieved december 25 2011 wyler himself said that he did not remember any conversation about this part of script or boyd s acting with gore vidal and that he discarded vidal s draft in favor of fry s morgan hudgens publicity

scene yesterday you should have seen those boys embrace quoted in kaplan p 444 film critic f x feeney in a comparison of script drafts concludes that vidal made significant and extensive contributions to script feeney pp 66 73 final writer on film was christopher fry charlton heston has claimed that fry was wyler s first choice as screenwriter but that zimbalist forced him to use vidal whether fry worked on script before vidal or not sources agree that fry arrived in rome in early may 1958 and spent six days a week on set writing and rewriting lines of dialogue as well as entire scenes until picture was finished herman p 401 in particular fry gave dialogue a slightly more formal and archaic tone without making it sound stilted and medieval a highly publicized bitter dispute later broke out over screenplay credits to film involving wyler tunberg vidal fry and screen writers guild ben hur credit is urged for fry new york times october 29 1959 in 1996 los angeles times published a brief letter from charlton heston taking issue with vidal s claims which he wrote irritates hell out of me three months later paper published a 1 200 word response from vidal which included statement that with regard to controversial scene s subtext he had been delegated to inform boyd who was delighted but that wyler had warned don t tell chuck because he ll fall apart final script ran 230 pages screenplay differed more from original novel than did 1925 silent film version some changes made film s storyline more dramatic role of esther was greatly expanded from that of novel to provide a strong onscreen love interest throughout film other changes included incorporating an admiration for jewish culture and people historical and modern as well as representing more pluralistic society of 1950s america rather than christian superiority view of wallace s novel though movie retained a strongly positive religious portrayal of early christianity pp 136 38 casting thumb right charlton

a lot of empty space or you have two people talking and a flock of others surrounding them who have nothing to do with scene your eye just wanders out of curiosity herman p 406 cameras were also quite

straight much faster than car could and long focal length left marton and canutt with too little time to get their shots production company purchased a more powerful american car but horses were still too fast and even with a head start filmmakers only had a few more seconds of shot time as filming progressed vast amounts of footage were shot for this sequence ratio of footage shot to footage used was 263 1 one of highest ratios ever for a film one of most notable moments in race came from a near fatal accident when stunt man joe canutt yakima canutt s son was tossed into air by accident he incurred a minor chin injury marton wanted to keep shot but zimbalist felt footage was unusable marton conceived idea of showing that ben hur was able to land on and cling to front of his chariot then scramble back into quadriga while horses kept going herman p 407 long shot of canutt s accident was cut together with a close up of heston climbing back aboard resulting in one of race s most memorable moments canutt and drake pp 16 19 boyd did all but two of his own stunts for sequence where messala is dragged beneath a chariot s horses and trampled boyd wore steel armor under his costume
