sun which is now more popular title in film a joint european nasa mission to investigate a planet in a position parallel to earth behind sun ends in disaster with death of one of astronauts hendry his colleague thinnes discovers that planet is a mirror image of earth first major live action film of century 21 writer producers gerry and sylvia anderson noted for thunderbirds and other 1960s supermarionation puppet television series doppelganger was shot from july to october 1968 using pinewood studios as principal production base parrish also filmed on location in both england and portugal professional relationship between andersons and their director became strained as shooting progressed while creative disagreements with cinematographer john read resulted in his resignation from century 21 actors and props from doppelganger would re appear in a later anderson tv series ufo although andersons incorporated adult themes into their script in an effort to distinguish film from their children s tv productions cuts to adult oriented content in this case a shot of a pack of contraceptive pills were required in order to permit an a and later pg certificate from british board of film censors bbfc doppelganger premiered in august 1969 in united states and october of that year in united kingdom although film in general has been praised for quality of its special effects and set design plot device of parallel earth has attracted criticism with some commentators judging it to be cliched and uninspired in comparison to precedent established by earlier science fiction in addition although doppelganger has frequently been interpreted as a pastiche of major science fiction films of 1960s including 2001 a space odyssey 1968 some of devices and imagery used have been dismissed as weak imitations of originals since release it has been termed a cult film plot in 2069 european space exploration council s eurosec sun probe discovers a planet orbiting same path as earth on other side of sun probe s findings have been transmitted to a power in east by double agent dr hassler security chief mark neuman traces messages to hassler s laboratory and shoots him dead eurosec director jason webb convinces nasa representative david poulson that west must send a manned mission to planet before hassler s allies nasa astronaut colonel glenn ross and eurosec astrophysicist dr john kane are assigned to mission after undergoing training at eurosec space centre in portugal ross and kane blast off in spacecraft phoenix they go into hibernation for outbound journey and are revived when they reach planet three weeks later scans for extraterrestrial life prove inconclusive so astronauts decide to make a surface landing in their shuttle dove during descent dove is damaged in a thunderstorm and crashes in mountainous terrain seriously injuring kane astronauts are picked up by a human rescue team who tell ross that they have landed near ulaanbaatar mongolia when they are flown back to space centre it seems clear that they have somehow returned to earth neuman and eurosec official lise hartman question ross who denies that he aborted mission kane dies from his injuries soon after eventually ross realises that he is not on earth but has indeed reached unknown planet a counter earth on which all aspects of life are mirror images of those on his earth signs of this reversal include text printed backwards and cars being driven on wrong side of road at first ross s wife sharon and others around him refuse to accept his claims however webb is convinced when ross reads reflected text aloud without hesitation and kane s post mortem examination shows that his internal organs are on wrong side of his body ross theorises that two earths are parallel and that ross of counter earth is experiencing similar events on other side of sun webb proposes that ross go back to phoenix to retrieve its flight recorder then return home eurosec builds a replacement for dove designed to be compatible with reversed technologies of phoenix among modifications is reverse polarisation of electrical circuits ross blasts off in spacecraft which he has named doppelganger and attempts to dock with phoenix however electrical systems malfunction disabling doppelganger and causing it to fall through atmosphere on a collision course with space centre eurosec is unable to repair fault from ground and doppelganger crashes into a parked spacecraft ross is incinerated in collision and resulting chain reaction destroys much of space centre killing key personnel and destroying all records of ross s presence on counter earth years later a wheelchair bound jason webb has been admitted to a nursing home noticing his reflection in a mirror he rolls forward to touch his image but crashes through mirror and dies cast credited roy thinnes as colonel glenn ross ian hendry as dr john kane patrick wymark as jason webb lynn loring as sharon ross loni

andersons puppet series captain scarlet and mysterons american film producer jay kanter travelled to london to establish a european production office for universal pictures bentley 2008 p 306 kanter was open to funding promising film ideas so lew grade andersons employer and financial backer set up a meeting for gerry anderson to pitch a story about a hypothetical mirror earth archer and hearn 2002 p 172 on film s inspiration anderson said i thought rather naively what if there was another planet other side of sun orbiting at exactly same speed and same size as earth that idea then developed into planet being a replicated earth and that s how it ended up a mirrored planet writing assisted by tony williamson anderson and his wife sylvia had written a 194 page treatment long before initial meeting with kanter anderson 2007 p 65 although they had planned it as a one hour drama for associated television sylvia thought that concept was too good for a television play and proposed making it as a feature film instead title doppelganger was suggested by andersons business partner john read according to gerry word means a copy of oneself and legend goes that if you meet your doppelganger it is point of your death following that legend clearly i had to steer film so that i could end it illustrating meaning of that word responding to claims that tone is overly dark anderson said that he wanted film to have an interesting premise kanter was dissatisfied with draft script so anderson hired novelist donald james to improve characterisation james revisions included substantial changes to parts of story set on mirror earth essentially causing characters of ross and kane to switch roles bentley 2008 p 307 in andersons draft ross was blinded in dove crash while kane survived unhurt however kane s claims about a counter earth led eurosec to declare him insane a structural flaw in doppelganger caused it to burn up in atmosphere with kane trapped inside and film ended with kane s wife jason webb and rosses attending kane s funeral despite james s efforts kanter remained unenthusiastic but agreed to finance film on condition that its director be subject to his approval after a ten week search andersons hired robert parrish who had recently co directed casino royale archer and nicholls 1996 p 136 according to gerry parrish told us he loved script and said it would be an honour to work with us jay kanter gave bob thumbs up and we were in business archer and hearn 2002 p 173 he felt that while commercial failure of casino royale raised questions about parrish s ability doppelganger could not have been made without him it wasn t a question of will we get on with him or is he right man he was a name director so we signed him up immediately archer and hearn 2002 p 174 casting leading cast was roy thinnes as colonel glenn ross of nasa gerry anderson cast thinnes after seeing his performance as david vincent in tv series invaders in andersons draft script ross s first name was stewart and he was first man to have walked on mars in a 2008 interview thinnes said of film i thought doppelganger was an interesting premise although now we know that there isn t another planet on other side of sun through our space exploration and telescopic abilities but at that time it was conceivable and it could have been scary to reflect script s characterisation of ross as a heavy smoker thinnes burned his way through many packets of cigarettes over course of production damaging his health in september 1969 age reported that actor intended to demand a non smoking clause in his next film contract stating he smokes about two packets a day but perpetual lighting up of new cigarettes for continuity purposes was too much ian hendry was cast as dr john kane a british astrophysicist and head of phoenix project in his biography anderson recalled that hendry was always drinking and was visibly intoxicated while performing dove crash stunt sequences he was pissed as a newt and it was as much as he could do to stagger away despite all that it looked exactly as it was supposed to on screen archer and hearn 2002 p 175 in draft script kane s first name was philip and he had a wife called susan scenes deleted from finished film showed character pursuing a romance with eurosec official lise hartman portrayed by loni von friedl ross s wife sharon was played by lynn loring role initially went to gayle hunnicutt who quit early in production after falling ill her withdrawal led to casting of loring thinnes then wife and star of tv series f b i hunnicutt was to have appeared in a nude scene written in to distinguish doppelganger from andersons earlier productions in a 1968 interview in daily mail anderson expressed a desire to change public s perception of century 21 saying that his company had been typecast as makers of children s films on rumours that british board of film censors bbfc would give film an x certificate for mature content he stated that it was century 21 s wish to work with live artists doing subjects unsuitable for children finished film replaced nude scene with milder shots showing sharon stepping into and out of a shower a subplot of film concerns rosses attempts to have a child and glenn s discovery that sharon has been taking birth control pills without his knowledge draft script described sharon as a united states senator s daughter and saw her pursuing an affair with eurosec public relations officer carlo in finished film character played by franco de rosa is called paulo landi and appears only briefly with affair implied in one scene but not explored further archer and hearn 2002 p 193 archer and hearn 2002 p 190 in a scene deleted from film glenn finds paolo and sharon in bed together at rosses villa and throws them both into a swimming pool patrick wymark played jason webb director of eurosec wymark was cast on strength of his performance as john wilder in tv series plane makers and power game and was described in publicity material as john wilder 2069 model anderson said that wymark s acting impressed him as much as hendry s but that his hard drinking caused him to slur his lines on set he recalled that in one scene actor had to list these explanations and on take after take he couldn t remember that two followed one we had to do it over and over again anderson s biographers simon archer and marcus hearn characterise wymark s portrayal of webb as dominant performance of film draft script described webb as a british former minister of technology romantically involved with his secretary pam kirby played by norma ronald supporting cast included george sewell as eurosec operations chief mark neuman mark hallam in draft script and ed bishop as david poulson a nasa representative originally peter dyneley was cast as poulson but he was replaced with bishop as producers felt that he looked too similar to wymark and that scenes with both poulson and jason webb would cause audiences to confuse two characters filming thumb alt a sandy rock face in sun topped by a line of trees location shooting was conducted in albufeira portugal filming began on 1 july 1968 at pinewood studios and ended on 16 october crew used neptune house in borehamwood hertfordshire now part of bbc elstree centre to represent exterior of eurosec headquarters and heatherden hall part of pinewood complex in iver heath buckinghamshire as old jason webb s nursing home in september crew travelled to albufeira portugal for location shooting after their arrival in country marcelo caetano succeeded incapacitated antonio de oliveira salazar as prime minister parrish was concerned that political instability would cause shooting delays so reduced filming schedule from a month to two weeks to create illusion of a mirror earth quickly and cheaply crew flipped film negatives using a process called flop over this technique saved considerable time and money that would have been spent building reversed sets and props and organising road closures to shoot cars driving on wrong side of road however it meant that scenes set on counter earth required careful planning and rehearsal with cast and crew it also resulted in a number of continuity errors for example heart lung kidney machines controlling ross and kane s vital functions aboard phoenix are first shown connected to their left wrists then their right thumb left alt a room fitted out in futuristic decor contains a panel of monitor screens each presenting face of a videoconference delegate in foreground of shot men address delegates on monitors no monitor screens were used for videoconference scene instead set alterations and forced perspective were used to keep costs low crew had difficulty realising a scene depicting eurosec board holding a videoconference on several high resolution viewing monitors archer and hearn 2002 p 177 due to high cost of colour tv at time of production and need to avoid black and white to reflect film s future setting instead of using actual monitors crew devised scene by cutting screen sized holes in a wall and placing actors playing conference delegates behind them silver paper was added to reflect studio lights and simulate a high resolution image with altered reinforcing perception that each delegate is facing a camera instead of other characters archer and hearn praise videoconference scene as an example of how anderson proved once again that his productions were ahead of their time as filming progressed anderson and parrish came into conflict according to anderson kanter was brought in more than once to mediate sylvia and i both knew how important picture was to our careers and we both desperately wanted to be in big time archer and hearn 2002 p 176 at one point parrish refused to film a number of scenes having decided that they were inessential to plot when anderson reminded parrish of his contractual obligations he announced to cast and crew hell you heard producer if i don t shoot these scenes which i don t really want don t need and will cut out anyway i ll be in breach of contract so what we ll do is shoot those scenes next in his biography anderson said that his one regret about film was that i hired bob parrish in first place sylvia would later describe parrish s direct as uninspired we had a lot of trouble getting what we wanted from him thumb alt a three story building in victorian style set among trees and gardens closing scenes were filmed at heatherden hall in iver heath other scenes led to disagreements between directors of century 21 gerry and sylvia anderson reg hill and john read film s director of photography archer and hearn 2002 p 178 la riviere 2009 p 188 for a scene depicting lise hartman loni von friedl taking a shower read did lighting in silhouette as instructed by parrish la riviere 2009 p 189 gerry anderson who intended scene to show friedl nude demanded a re shoot insisting that read honour his obligations not just to parrish as director but to him as producer according to sylvia gerry was very keen to show that he was part of swinging sixties and felt that seeing a detailed nude shot as he visualised it was more with it than more subdued version anderson 2007 p 36 another dispute arose when read filmed shots of phoenix spacecraft model using a hand held camera in his biography gerry recalled i knew enough about space travel to know that in a vacuum a spacecraft will travel as straight as a die parrish told me that people were not familiar with space travel and therefore they would expect to see this kind of movement read refused to re shoot scenes stating that parrish s instructions took precedence over anderson s and resigned from both film and his position in century 21 at other directors request anderson elaborated clearly john was in a difficult position i do now understand how he must have felt but in my heart i feel he couldn t play a double role effects thumb alt a pair of spacecraft both designed to a curved aesthetic orbit an earth like planet one vessel smaller than other is a shuttle departing from docking port of mothership dove right exits its mothership phoenix left over counter earth film s effects have been positively received film s special effects were produced at century 21 studios on slough trading estate under direction of derek meddings more than 200 effects shots were filmed design of phoenix spacecraft was based on saturn v rocket during filming scale model unexpectedly caught fire and had to be completely rebuilt for realism launch sequence was shot in studios car park against an actual sky backdrop although century 21 built a full sized dove module in slough they were prevented from using it at pinewood studios due to an agreement with national association of theatrical television and kine employees that props were not be transported module was therefore destroyed and although pinewood carpenters built a replacement anderson considered it inferior to original commenting on film s effects martin anderson of website den of geek describes phoenix command module as beautifully ergonomic without losing too much nasa ness and dove lander as a beautiful fusion of jpl gloss with classic lines he regards phoenix launch as meddings finest work prior to moonraker 1979 archer and hearn describe sequence as one of most spectacular of its kind produced by century 21 post production composer barry gray who wrote music for all of century 21 s productions said that his score for doppelganger was his favourite score was recorded in three studio sessions between 27 and 29 march 1969 first of these sessions used a 55 member orchestra second 44 and third 28 scenes of ross and kane s journey to counter earth are accompanied by a piece titled sleeping astronauts featuring an ondes martenot played by french sylvette archer and hearn describe this piece as one of most enchanting ever written by gray adding that soundtrack as a whole evokes a traditional hollywood feel in contrast with film s future setting title sequence set inside double agent dr hassler s herbert lom laboratory incorporates a spy theme focusing on miniature camera hidden inside character s false eye archer and hearn consider this an imitation of style of 1960s james bond films distribution thumb uk poster showing film s original title distributors universal pictures were unenthusiastic with finished film causing its release to be delayed by a year on 26 march 1969 british board of film censors gave film an a certificate to secure this rating cuts to shots showing contraceptive pills were required after premiering in united states on 27 august 1969 film had its uk opening at london s odeon leicester square on 8 october on 1 november a second round of us openings began in detroit michigan general box office response was poor in europe film was distributed by rank organisation under its original title it was renamed journey to far side of sun in us and australia after universal judged that audiences in these countries might not know meaning of word doppelganger archer and nicholls 1996 p 138 today journey to far side of sun is title by which film is more commonly known gerry anderson biographers simon archer and stan nicholls argue that while it provides a clearer explanation of plot it lacks intrigue and even poetic quality of doppelganger tv broadcasts two prints of doppelganger in its original 35mm format for uk release are known to exist one is retained by british film institute bfi other by fanderson official fan society dedicated to gerry anderson productions original prints of doppelganger position ian hendry before roy thinnes in opening credits in journey to far side of sun format thinnes is billed before hendry certain uk prints alter final scene featuring elderly jason webb with addition of a short voice over from thinnes in character as ross who is heard speaking a line that he says to webb earlier in film jason we were right there are definitely two identical planets in uk doppelganger has been aired on tv under title journey to far side of sun and has been formatted accordingly broadcasts have often contained a reversed picture owing to a mistake made in transferring original print to videotape prior to a screening in 1980s a telecine operator viewed print and being unfamiliar with premise of film concluded that scenes set on parallel earth had been reversed in error an additional flop over edit restored image to normal which became standard for all broadcasts but compromised plot if doppelganger is screened in this modified form viewer is led to conclude that parallel ross has landed on non reversed normal earth home video previously available in laserdisc format doppelganger was released on ntsc region 1 dvd in both 1998 and in digitally remastered form 2008 2008 release included pal region 2 but was titled

fanderson s original film print exclusive to madman release is an feature length audio interview with writer producer gerry anderson who gives a detailed and account of film s production critical response since its original release doppelganger has had a mixed critical reception in both uk and us although archer and nicholls argue that it has acquired cult status gary co writer of 1988 ranks film 81st in his book top 100 sci fi movies praising doppelganger as a fine example of speculative fantasy in late 60s he expresses satisfaction with thinnes and wymark s performances characterisation and themes entailed including adultery infertility and corruption and fourth of july style special effects calling film enigmatic contemporary in a review published in times in october 1969 john russell taylor praised concept of film as quite ingenious but suggested that title and pre release marketing had revealed too much of plot for film to sustain interest of its audience commenting in new york magazine in november judith crist introduced doppelganger as a science fiction film that comes up with a fascinating premise three quarters of way along and does nothing with it she praised production as being nicely gadget ridden and raising questions on conflict between politics and science but criticised editing variety magazine cited a confusing plot and related crash of dove module to coherence of scriptwriting in its declaration that astronauts take a pill to induce a three week sleep during their flight thereafter script falls to pieces in as many parts as their craft in his 1975 work a pictorial history of science fiction films jeff rovin stated that film was confusing but colourful and commended it for its superb special effects rovin 1975 p 223 although it was argued to be better than average for genre in miami news in september 1969 and montreal gazette in april 1972 a december 1969 edition of pittsburgh press dismissed it as a churned out science fiction yarn let s hope there s only one movie like this one and ranked it among worst films of year montreal gazette review maintained that although quality deteriorates towards end of film until then it s a reasonably diverting futuristic melodrama retrospective in a 2008 review for den of geek martin anderson praised robert parrish s direction and derek meddings effects however dialogue described as robust and prosaic was said to sit ill at ease with metaphysical anderson also expressed concern about editing stating that every effects shot precedes another shot with that hornby factor slowing up narrative unnecessarily doppelganger is awarded a rating of three stars out of five and is summarised as an interesting journey with many rewards glenn erickson commenting in 2008 on website dvd talk argued that doppelganger takes an okay premise but does next to nothing with it we see 100 minutes of bad drama and good special effects and then script opts for frustration and meaningless mystery he complained of unappealing cinematography comparing it to premise of thunderbirds in so far as people stand and talk a lot while defining script as being composed of at least 60 percent hardware talk and exposition how people move about airplane parachute centrifuge is more important than what they re doing on subject of effects erickson asserted that sequences such as generic drama challenged main rocket launch detract from human factor of film other design elements were criticised viewing costumes as dated erickson added that actors are defeated by barbie doll house surroundings and suggested that visuals of doppelganger match an ethos of future will be a shopping mall despite judging doppelganger good a rating higher than fair but lower than excellent erickson argued that opportunities presented by parallel earth concept were squandered in determination to turn production into an excuse to show cool rocket toys doppelganger is given a rating of two and a half stars out of five in a negative review published on film4 website which praises effects work and costume design but criticises scenes with character of dr hassler for their irrelevance to main plot and subtext of rosses troubled marriage as an unnecessary diversion from narrative although ross and kane s mission through space is described as a brief trippy light show review questions originality of having a parallel earth as focus and depth of script s vision anderson s has to be cheapest alternate earth ever whereas audiences might expect a world where roman empire never fell or nazis won world war ii here shocking discovery is that people write backwards that s it doppelganger is only recommended for fans of anderson productions and is considered an occasionally interesting failure gary westfahl of webzine sf site asserts that use of a near perfect parallel earth is uninspired referring to setting as most boring and unimaginative alien world imaginable among other reviews tv guide magazine describes doppelganger as a strange little film with an overwritten script and considers subplot concerning dr hassler s treachery to be distracting it awards a rating of two stars out of four to chris bentley writer of episode guides on anderson productions doppelganger is a stylish and thought provoking science fiction thriller sylvia anderson suggested that american audiences who were less familiar with supermarionation productions of century 21 were more enthusiastic she explained it was all too easy to compare our real actors with our puppet characters and descriptions such as wooden expressionless no strings attached and puppet like were cheap shots some of uk critics could not resist typecasting is lazy man s friend and boy were we typecast in britain on doppelganger she said in 1992 i saw it on tv a couple of years ago and i was very pleased with it i thought it came over quite well interpretation thumb alt an elderly man stares transfixed at his reflection in a mirror webb meets his death in a scene believed to imitate visual style of 2001 a space odyssey critic glenn erickson suggests that doppelganger is infected with 2001 itis referring to old webb as a feeble asylum patient who sits in a wheelchair in a corridor resembling dave bowman s holding cell on alien planet beyond star gate archer and nicholls cite among possible causes of commercial failure of doppelganger its quirky offbeat nature and loss of public interest in space exploration after apollo 11 mission subject of july 1969 moon landing dominated a contemporary review in milwaukee journal in which bennett f noted comparisons with doppelganger find a few bugs in their lm and crash on planet and do they ever have their hands full in getting back to earth writing that proliferation of technical dialogue hampers acting he concluded makers of this space may get lots of mileage at box office but neil buzz and mike did it better on tv it has also been suggested that 1968 releases of 2001 a space odyssey and planet of apes established an unattainable standard for other films of science fiction genre erickson argues that film is inferior to 2001 for its depiction of a realistic working future in which humans remain attached to commercialism comparing visual style of doppelganger to that used by film director stanley kubrick he notes similarities in use of close up eye shots and various psychedelic images regretting that all these borrowings are fluff without any deeper meaning film4 s review describes final scenes featuring character of jason webb as hell bent on recreating enigmatic finale of 2001 by using a mirror a wheelchair and a tartan blanket martin anderson discusses connections between doppelganger and other science fiction films of 1960s and 1970s such as solaris acknowledging a lyrical tone in dialogue ultimately however doppelganger doesn t bear comparison with kubrick or solaris director andrei tarkovsky comparing doppelganger to 2001 rovin writes that effects of former occasionally outshine those of latter rovin 1975 p 124 he goes onto state that film attempts to kindle a profundity similar to that of 2001 in its abstract philosophising about dichotomy of dual worlds but fails with a combination of meat and potatoes science fiction and quasi profound themes rovin 1975 p 127 he suggests that it is neither a kid s film nor a cult film but rules that elements that comprise finished effort are more than individually successful erickson contrasts perceived failures on part of script with efforts of nigel kneale for 1958 bbc serial quatermass and pit and 1964 film adaptation of 1901 h g wells novel first men in moon both douglas pratt and institute of contemporary arts ica in london liken concept of alternative earth to plot of parallel a 1963 episode of american television series twilight zone in episode an astronaut returns to earth to find that his world has undergone many changes some trivial some drastic and concludes that he has arrived in a parallel universe critic s t joshi compares theme of duplication in doppelganger to premise of invasion of body snatchers 1956 in which characters fears that their relatives have been abducted and replaced with alien impostors are vindicated with appearance of pod people an extraterrestrial species with power to create doppelgangers that are nearly indistinguishable from humans legacy despite polarised critical reception and commercial failure of doppelganger lew grade offered andersons further opportunities to film in live action their first television series not based on puppetry was ufo which premiered in uk in 1970 doppelganger is considered an immediate precursor to ufo and has also been described as a trial run for andersons third live action series space 1999 ufo featured actors costumes props locations and music that had previously appeared in doppelganger archer and hearn 2002 p 188 of film s cast ed bishop keith alexander cy grant martin king and jeremy wilkin had previously had an association with andersons all had provided voices for captain scarlet and mysterons except alexander who had voiced characters for penultimate supermarionation series joe 90 with 11 other cast members all but grant and king appeared in at least one episode of ufo in which bishop had in lead role of commander ed straker special effects elements from doppelganger that were recycled for ufo included scale models of phoenix and dove futuristic cars which consultants from ford corporation based on chassis of zephyr zodiac archer and nicholls 1996 p 146 and jeeps adapted from british leyland mini were also re used neptune house one of filming locations for doppelganger became face of harlington straker film studios where organisation is headquartered tracks from barry gray s score that were recycled for ufo included sleeping astronauts and strange planet latter serving as ending theme music teleprinter images that served as focus of film s titles formed a creative element that was imitated in opening titles of ufo archer and hearn 2002 p 192 in a retrospective of anderson s career published on ign website it is stated that discussion of politics and economics in doppelganger contrast with conventions of 1960s science fiction furthermore such aspects are reflected in atmosphere of ufo in so far as characters were constantly having to deal with pressures of having to show progress under scrutiny of accountants and elected officials much same way nasa was starting to in us commenting on parallels between film and television series martin anderson makes another connection to kubrick turning his attention to scripting he argues most interesting common ground between two projects remains bleak ending s and
