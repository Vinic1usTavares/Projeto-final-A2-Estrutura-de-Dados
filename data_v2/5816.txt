seasons on spike tv show features professional mma fighters living together in las vegas nevada and follows them as they train and compete against each other for a prized contract with ufc series debuted on january 17 2005 with its first episode quest begins to date there have been twenty seven seasons of show two per calendar year each season features either one or two weight classes in tournament historic forrest griffin vs stephan bonnar fight in first season drew millions of viewers to show and launched sport into mainstream because of this success ultimate fighter was regarded as instrumental to survival and expansion of ufc and mixed martial arts into mainstream many current and past ufc fighters are alumni of show with some competitors going on to become coaches in future seasons show has undergone multiple format changes since its inception including introduction of wildcard bout many winners have gone on to compete for ufc championships with some becoming ufc champions ultimate fighter was originally an experimental series financed by former owners of ultimate fighting championship ufc lorenzo and frank fertitta iii series was aired on spike tv as a last resort measure to gain mainstream exposure for mixed martial arts mma during early days of spike tv channel wanted sports programming but had no budget for sports licensing fees spike tv founder albie hecht began a search to find programming with broad appeal that network could afford in end spike narrowed its choices down to ufc and k 1 hecht flew to japan to meet with head of k 1 but insulted his geisha so meeting did not go well weeks later hecht met with lorenzo fertitta in las vegas hecht was impressed by ufc s celebrity following its plan to acquire and consolidate smaller promotions into ufc and with dana white s ability to be a vince mcmahon like personality falzon a 2013 october 3 albie hecht talks ufc video file retrieved from https www youtube com watch v urwa hecht saw k 1 as a safer bet given it had more international notoriety he was also not a fan of grappling aspects of mma but ufc rebuffed his suggestion to change rules of sport to accommodate striking hecht credits kevin kay and his editorial collaboration with ufc for highlighting show s story lines which he believes helped drive its ratings success airing after world wrestling entertainment s flagship show wwe raw ultimate fighter s debut episode was able to garner a 57 retention rate in viewers from raw which was double usual rate for spike tv it is believed by some that wwe s vince mcmahon had to approve ultimate fighter following raw but this is incorrect according to hecht mcmahon did not have final say but given his stature and raw s importance to spike tv at time network wanted mcmahon to be on board with program lineup at time hecht believes wwe did not see ufc as a challenge live finale for first season saw historic bout of forrest griffin vs stephan bonnar now widely regarded as most influential fight in mma history bout took place in what was first ever mma event on live and free television bout ended in a unanimous decision victory for griffin and led to show s renewal on spike tv regarding success of show ufc president dana white said it s amazing to think how close we came to not being here today if it weren t for what these guys did i don t know if there would even be a ufc i ll never forget these guys ever renewal of show saw ufc produce two more series before subsequent renewals in order to garner more attention for sport ultimate fighter utilizes gimmicks one notable example in ninth season employed a country vs country theme with united states competing against united kingdom these gimmicks enabled ufc to appeal to fans that had been recently introduced to sport during penetration into european market ultimate fighter also drew record viewing figures for spike tv when youtube sensation kimbo slice participated in tenth season slice s fight against veteran roy nelson attracted viewers to sport drawing an audience of 6 1 million making it one of most viewed mma fights in history as part of a new broadcasting relationship between ufc and fox sports ultimate fighter moved to fx beginning in season 15 season 14 was final season of series to air on spike who considered relationship to be incredibly beneficial in building both our brands in september 2013 series moved to fox s new mainstream sports network fox sports 1 because of need to keep fight results secret until airing of episode each fight on ultimate fighter is officially an exhibition and as such does not count towards fighters overall record selection process seasons 1 4 right thumb 450px ultimate fighter uses an elimination tournament format as highlighted by season ten bracket for first four seasons prospect ufc fighters from two different weight categories were selected to compete fighters are divided into two teams irrespective of weight class with each team coached by a current ufc headliner teams then compete in a manner which varies by season with loser being eliminated from competition often incentives are provided for team of a winning fighter this can include right for their team to select next matchup in order to pick off fighters from opposing team by selecting favourable matchups at end of a season two remaining fighters of each weight class are placed in a single elimination fight at ultimate fighter finales such as ultimate fighter 1 finale where title of ultimate fighter is awarded to winner seasons five to seven and ten to twelve have featured fighters from just one weight class each with other seasons focusing on two weight classes show features daily preparations each fighter makes to train for competition at ufc training center and interactions they have with each other living under same roof day to day events on show are overseen by ufc president dana white with exception of season finales fights on ultimate fighter are sanctioned by nevada athletic commission as exhibition matches and do not count for or against a fighter s professional record this is done to keep results from going public before air date however going into semi final stage of each series fights are scheduled for full professional three rounds as opposed to two rounds with possibility of a sudden victory round for all stages prior though officially exhibition fights ufc chooses to record results of semi final matchups for example seventh season winner amir sadollah has one more win on his ufc record than on his official record due to his victory in his season s semi final round changes first six seasons featured sixteen fighters in either one or two weight categories first two seasons however were very different from each following season original format for ultimate fighter saw each team compete in challenges such as hoisting their respective coach up on their shoulders and sprinting down a beach or a team tug of war these challenges resulted in eliminations of fighters who hadn t fought until late in season when challenge incentive was to select next fight where fighters would be eliminated having lost fight in first two seasons fighters would also leave house for good upon losing and this often resulted in odd numbers for teams which forced moving of fighters to opposing teams beginning in season four fighters were no longer removed from house after losing their fights and did not switch teams except in extraordinary cases such as being kicked off a team by head coach in seventh season instead of usual sixteen fighters thirty two fighters participated this new rule introduced a preliminary fight in order to get into house which gave coaches an early evaluation final change to date was introduction of wild card for seasons 11 13 in seasons 11 12 28 fighters competed in preliminary round with winning fourteen entering house a wild card bout would take place at end of round of fourteen featuring two of losing fighters winner of wild card bout would then be included in quarterfinal round of eight fighters this format proved highly successful for middleweight fighter kris mccray who took part in season 11 s wild card bout having lost his opening match in house he won wild card bout to reach quarter finals and went on to win his next two bouts reaching tournament final wild card bout was instituted one last time in season 13 which only featured 14 fighters in house no preliminary fights contract award winners of first three seasons of ultimate fighter competition and certain runners up depending on their performance in their competition finals receive touted six figure contract to fight in ufc these contracts are specifically three year contracts with a guaranteed first year each year consists of three fights first year s purse per fight consists of 12 000 guaranteed with a 12 000 win bonus a maximum of 24 000 per fight second year s purse per fight

300 000 total on contract but only 150 000 is guaranteed for all three years if nine fights are fought some tuf competitors who did not win series were also offered ufc contracts although not on as attractive terms coaches involvement with exception of seasons 2 4 11 13 15 16 22 and first season of tuf brazil coaches fought each other after conclusion of show season two featured rich franklin and matt hughes who were in different weight categories eliminating possibility for a post season fight fourth season saw multiple guest coaches take lead differing from other seasons with two clearly

injury in addition to seasons which did not feature post season fights between coaches several seasons have been impacted forcing postponements due to injuries to season six coaches matt serra and

rashad evans and quinton jackson took place at ufc 114 with rashad evans winning by unanimous decision fight was postponed by five months due to jackson s a team filming commitments and his temporary
