a half mile 800 meters west of connecticut state line history new jersey in 1950s a limited access highway was proposed to bypass new york city this planned beltway would be incorporated into new interstate highway system proposed beltway in new jersey was designated as fai corridor 104 and later received i 287 designation in 1958 southern segment of i 287 was planned in 1950s as middlesex freeway which was to run from outerbridge crossing to staten island and follow route 440 corridor to edison where it would connect to new jersey turnpike before continuing west to i 78 from here freeway would parallel us 202 north to new york border anticipated cost of building i 287 in new jersey was 235 million southernmost part of i 287 in middlesex county was to be cosigned with i 95 this never happened due to cancellation of somerset freeway by mid 1960s i 287 had been completed between new jersey turnpike and bedminster township and from us 46 in parsippany to us 202 in montville more of i 287 in new jersey had been finished by 1969 with sections from us 46 south to route 10 in hanover township and from bedminster township north to maple avenue in bernards township opened segment of highway between maple avenue and route 24 opened in 1973 followed by segment between route 24 and route 10 in early 1975 making i 287 a continuous road between new jersey turnpike in edison

mahwah left two lanes exit interstate 287 south morristown right two lanes straight and right sign says welcome to new jersey i 287 s missing section between us 202 in montville and new york state thruway in suffern ny was controversial dating back to 1965 and continuing until its opening in 1993 property owners along proposed route fought its completion as part of freeway revolts of 1960s and 1970s originally i 287 was proposed to take a more eastern route through lincoln park and wayne areas this routing gained opposition as it passed through populated areas a more western alignment was planned through mountainous areas in 1973 but this was rejected as cost of building road through mountains was too high in 1977 current alignment of i 287 was proposed between montville and suffern this was approved by federal government in 1982 as it was less costly than western alignment and went through less developed areas than eastern alignment permits allowing construction to begin on this segment were issued in 1988 by army corps of engineers officials in rockland county new york filed a lawsuit on november 19 1993 hours before highway s official ribbon cutting seeking to block its opening they claimed incomplete interchange with new york state thruway was inadequate to handle additional traffic that interchange was not complete until 1994 but highway opened as planned on november 19 in a ceremony held on wanaque river bridge where new jersey governor jim florio cut ribbon this moment marked completion of a bypass around new york city that had been planned for decades portion of i 287 between us 202 interchange in oakland and route 208 interchange in franklin lakes overtook westernmost portion of route 208 truncating that route to its current location completion of i 287 in new jersey had significant effects on traffic and development patterns in area several towns along highway such as wanaque and montville saw increases in development in addition as road was a bypass it saw a significant increase in truck traffic wishing to bypass congested roads closer to new york city road also increased truck traffic on other north south corridors such as route 31 from truckers wanting to bypass new jersey turnpike by using these surface roads to get between i 287 bypass of new york city and i 95 south to pennsylvania on july 16 1999 governor christine todd whitman banned oversize trucks from using roads that are not part of national highway system such as route 31 trucks were therefore forced to use i 287 and new jersey turnpike to travel across state in 1990s high occupancy vehicle lanes were built along i 287 between bedminster and parsippany these hov lanes along with ones that had been built on i 80 were opened to all traffic in 1998 due to lack of hov usage and state did not have to repay federal government 240 million to build lanes in 2011 a small section of northbound side of highway in boonton collapsed into rockaway river due to hurricane irene near end of that year five people and a dog were killed when a small tbm 700 airplane en route to georgia crashed on highway near exit 33 in morris township in august 2007 njdot started i 287 middlesex freeway rehabilitation project to resurface pavement between exit 5 in south plainfield and i 95 new jersey turnpike in edison township which is used by about 150 000 vehicles daily some of bridges and overpasses had deteriorated to such a state that they needed to be replaced on september 16 2009 njdot announced start of another rehabilitation and repaving project from exit 5 in piscataway to area of exit 10 in franklin township this project which was funded by american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 cost 29 million and was finished by april 2011 new york state thruway

right lane new york state thruway portion of i 287 was planned around 1950 as part of a tolled limited access highway that was to connect major cities of new york a bridge across hudson river was planned between nyack and tarrytown at a site that was close enough to new york city but far enough from port authority of new york and new jersey s jurisdiction area as they opposed crossing portion of thruway currently followed by i 287 including tappan zee bridge over hudson river opened on december 15 1955 in 1960s i 287 was designated along new york state thruway between suffern and tarrytown while i 87 ran farther to east on present day i 684 on january 1 1970 i 87 designation was shifted onto this portion of new york state thruway to run concurrent with i 287 e zpass electronic toll collection system was first introduced on this segment of thruway at spring valley and tappan zee bridge toll plazas in 1993 same year an interchange in suffern opened providing access to newly opened new jersey portion of i 287 in 1997 tolls for cars were eliminated at spring valley toll plaza with tolls remaining for trucks and other commercial vehicles i 87 i 287 interchange split near tarrytown began a 187 million reconstruction in 2001 in order to add additional lanes and rebuild overpasses and underpasses reconstruction in this area was completed in may 2004 in 2016 tappan zee bridge toll

pointing motorists onto an off for a limited access road to cross westchester county east to west date back to 1920s and became more needed after post world war ii traffic increases when tappan zee bridge was proposed around 1950 cross westchester expressway was becoming a more realistic idea construction of freeway began in 1956 and was given ny 119 designation design of highway met interstate highway standards after opening and was supposed to have i 187 designation however by time highway opened it was officially designated as i 487 instead at a cost of 50 million cross westchester expressway was opened december 1960 later in 1960s this segment of road was redesignated i 287 to make it a part of beltway around new york city i 287 was to continue past i 95 in port chester and was to cross long island sound via unbuilt oyster bay rye bridge on long island route would run along seaford oyster bay expressway ny 135 then i 287 was again to be extended into jones beach by merging with wantagh state parkway in merrick plans for bridge and i 287 extension onto long island were dropped in 1973 by governor nelson rockefeller as a result of community opposition and environmental concerns ownership of cross westchester expressway was transferred from new york state department of transportation to new york state thruway authority in 1990 to help relieve state s budget issues on july 27 1994 a propane truck crashed into an overpass on cross westchester expressway in white plains and exploded killing driver fire from explosion spread into adjacent neighborhoods and injured 23 people in mid 1990s a reversible high occupancy vehicle lane was proposed for cross westchester expressway in order to alleviate congestion at a planned cost of 365 million in addition a metro north railroad line and a guided busway were considered to serve i 287 corridor in westchester county as alternatives to hov lane proposed hov lane was cancelled in 1997 by governor george pataki out of fear it would have negative effects on area in trying to solve traffic since 1999 cross westchester expressway has been under construction in order to reduce congestion and improve safety for motorists who use highway final phase of project a reconstruction in area of exit 8 in white plains was completed in december 2012 nine months ahead of schedule in late 2018 nysdot began installing ramp meters on entrance ramps to i 287 in rockland and westchester counties more are expected to be installed by 2020 tappan zee bridge replacement thumb original tappan zee bridge original tappan zee bridge carrying concurrency of new york state thruway i 87 and i 287 was a cantilever bridge built during 1952 55 bridge was long and spanned hudson at its second widest point before its replacement in 2017 deteriorating structure carried an average of 138 000 vehicles per day substantially more traffic than its designed capacity during its first decade bridge carried fewer than 40 000 vehicles per day part of justification for replacing bridge stems from its construction immediately following korean war on a low budget of only 81 million unlike other major bridges in metropolitan new york tappan zee was designed to last only 50 years federal highway administration issued a report in october 2011 designating tappan zee s replacement to be a dual span twin bridge construction officially began in october 2013 with new spans being built to north of existing bridge new bridge connects to existing highway approaches of i 87 and i 287 on both river banks northbound westbound span opened on august 25 2017 southbound eastbound traffic remained on old bridge until october 6 2017 at that point southbound eastbound traffic shifted to westbound span of new bridge and old bridge closed bridge s eastbound span opened to traffic on september 11 2018 upon completion new tappan zee bridge became one of longest cable stayed spans in nation future proposed crossing to long island in 2008 a private firm associates proposed to construct a more than tunnel across long island sound between rye and oyster bay this proposed tunnel would be longest highway tunnel in world with its length exceeding that of laerdal tunnel in norway by a mile it would start at junction with cross westchester expressway and new england thruway in rye and end at ny 135 and ny 25 in syosset estimated to cost approximately 10 billion it would feature three tubes outer tubes would have three lanes of vehicular traffic each and inner tube would be used for maintenance proposed tunnel which is to be
