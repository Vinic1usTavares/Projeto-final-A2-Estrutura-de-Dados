director stephen hillenburg and neil ross voice king neptune s squire a parrot and cyclops respectively in a post credits scene portrays a theater usher production development spongebob squarepants movie was long planned nickelodeon and paramount pictures had approached series creator stephen hillenburg for a film based on show but he refused for more than a year hillenburg was concerned after watching iron giant and toy story with his son about challenge of spongebob and patrick doing something more cinematically consequential and inspiring without losing what he calls spongebob cadence he said on a break from season four post production to do a 75 minute movie about spongebob wanting to make some jellyfish jelly would be a mistake i think this had to be spongebob in a great adventure that s where comedy s coming from having these two naive characters spongebob and patrick a doofus and an idiot on this incredibly dangerous heroic odyssey with all odds against them i never wanted to do a movie because i didn t think that what we wanted to say needed to be in a movie i like short form for animation then this story idea came up that lent itself to a longer format you can t do a road trip adventure in a short form stephen hillenburg in 2002 hillenburg and show s staff stopped making episodes to work on film after show s third season film s plot originally had spongebob rescue patrick from a fisherman in florida an obvious reference to 2003 film finding nemo this was later said by tom kenny voice of spongebob to be a joke plot to keep fans busy hillenburg wrote film with five other writer animators from show paul tibbitt derek drymon aaron springer kent osborne and tim hill over a three month period in a room of a former glendale california bank osborne said it was hugely fun although it did get kind of gamy in there at beginning of series hillenburg screened a number of silent shorts from laurel and hardy charlie chaplin and buster keaton and work by two modern comic actors jerry lewis and pee wee herman both obvious inspirations for spongebob for film writers created a mythical hero s quest search for a stolen crown which brings spongebob and patrick to surface bill fagerbakke voice of patrick said about plot it s just nuts i m continually dazzled and delighted with what these guys came up with when film was completed hillenburg wanted to end series so it wouldn t jump shark however nickelodeon desired more episodes hillenburg stated well there was concern when we did movie in 2004 that show had peaked there were concerns among executives at nickelodeon as a result hillenburg resigned as series showrunner appointing writer director and storyboard artist paul tibbitt to succeed him tibbitt was one of hillenburg s favorite crew members i totally trusted him tibbitt would remain showrunner until he was succeeded in 2015 by show s creative director vincent waller and staff writer marc ceccarelli he has also acted as an executive producer since 2008 hillenburg no longer wrote or ran show on a day to day basis but reviewed each episode and submitted suggestions i figure when i m pretty old i can still paint i don t know about running shows tom kenny bill fagerbakke and crew confirmed that they had completed four episodes for broadcast on nickelodeon in early 2005 and planned to finish a total of about 20 for fourth season in 2015 hillenburg returned to show following completion of second movie as an executive producer having greater creative input and attending crew meetings until his death on november 26 2018 in september 2003 jules engel hillenburg s mentor when he studied experimental animation at california institute of arts died hillenburg dedicated film to him he truly was most influential artistic person in my life i consider him my art dad casting film stars series main cast members tom kenny as spongebob squarepants gary snail and french narrator bill fagerbakke as patrick star rodger bumpass

dee bradley baker as perch perkins carlos alazraqui as king neptune s squire aaron hendry as cyclops and neil ross as voice of cyclops in addition to series cast it was reported on march 23 2004 that scarlett johansson jeffrey tambor and alec baldwin would play new characters princess mindy king neptune and dennis respectively and david hasselhoff would appear as himself johansson accepted role because she likes cartoons and was a fan of ren stimpy show when jeffrey tambor signed for his voice cameo he saw his character king neptune and joked this is me he remembered first cartoon he saw bambi my first cartoon i had to be carried out crying it was bambi it s like great american wound death of bambi s mother run bambi run another guest voice was alec baldwin stephen hillenburg said that actor recorded his character dennis on a phone i wouldn t say that about his performance he might be mad if we said that technically it was like he was in another booth in studio baywatch and knight rider star david hasselhoff accepted role when his daughters taylor ann and hayley urged him i got an offer to do a cameo in spongebob movie and i turned to my girls who were like 16 and 14 and i said who s spongebob and they said oh my god dad it s number one cartoon in world you gotta do it hasselhoff enjoyed his cameo it was great fun and to this day around world kids stop me and say are you david hasselhoff because i was only human in picture hasselhoff said that film gained him new fans it s amazing so many of kids were so young and didn t see baywatch and knight rider so i got a whole new legion of fans animation there were a number of stages involved in making of film beginning with a rough animation process of ideas drawn on post it notes writers drew working from rough outlines rather than scripts which made humor more visual than verbal storyboard artists including sherm cohen then illustrated ideas conceived by writers in series tom yasumi and andrew overtoom do animatics but director hillenburg and writer derek drymon did animatics for film yasumi and overtoom were film s animation timing directors concentrating on sheets spongebob squarepants movie was animated at rough draft studios in south korea animators worked semi digitally pencil drawn poses would be composited into layouts in photoshop series writer and storyboard artist erik wiese left show for a year to work on samurai jack and danny phantom but returned to do storyboards and character layout for film he always wanted to be a feature animator and movie felt like i was on character animation end describing experience as a blast it felt like coming home hillenburg enjoyed process of making film tv schedule is tight and you don t always have a lot of time to work on your drawings he appreciated film s hand drawn animation i think movie s drawings are much superior than tv show although cgi animation was flourishing at time of film s release there s a lot of talk about 2 d being dead and i hope people don t think that even brad bird is a proponent of 2 d he would agree with me that it s all about what you re trying to say there are many ways to tell a story and what s unique about animation is that there are many styles with which to tell a story clay animation scenes were shot by mark caballero seamus walsh and chris finnegan at screen novelties in los angeles

ideas to some of other board artists hillenburg was counting on casting hasselhoff and first question he asked him was so do we have hasselhoff he replied no with a grin hasselhoff eventually agreed

candy and ice cream tie ins pistor said because of treats simplicity but he had issues with fast food tie ins according to him latter was full of hidden additives pistor said trouble is that you can t go out with animated films without a fast food tie in people don t take you seriously hillenburg replied yeah well my take on that is that we shouldn t do that we didn t want to suddenly become people

boring dreck a depressing plateau of mediocrity and laugh skimpy after film s release fans began to turn away from show causing fansites to bec ome deserted some fans believe that show s 2012 ratings decline correlates with a decline in quality and whatever fan support show enjoys is not enough to save it from its slide in ratings this was due to fact that stephen hillenburg and many writers left
