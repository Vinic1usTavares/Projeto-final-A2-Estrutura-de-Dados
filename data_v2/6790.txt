veratalpa lugdunensiana is a fossil mammal from miocene of france known from a single astragalus a species was assigned to its own genus veratalpa by florentino ameghino in 1905 he placed it in talpidae family of moles but in 1974 john howard hutchison argued that astragalus was not talpid and more likely came from a rodent astragalus is about 4 5 mm long broad for a talpid and has head oriented farther from axis of foot than in talpids taxonomy argentine naturalist florentino ameghino described veratalpa in an overview of astragali from middle miocene of vieux collonges in france astragalus is a bone of foot that is part of ankle joint he listed several species of family talpidae moles and related species from vieux collonges including espece c species c which he named as a new genus and species veratalpa lugdunensiana in a footnote ameghino 1905 p 53 in a 1906 review of ameghino s paper edouard louis trouessart affirmed that veratalpa probably represented a new genus of mole but noted that specific name lugdunensiana would have been more correctly written lugdunensis according to trouessart suffix ana is appropriate for names that reference persons but not for those that refer to places such as this name which is derived from lugdunum latin name for lyon trouessart 1906 p 17 in a 1974 review of miocene european talpids john howard hutchison wrote that astragalus of veratalpa lacked any features that would ally it with talpids and commented that it was most likely a rodent hutchison 1974 p 237 in their 1997 classification of mammals malcolm mckenna and susan bell listed veratalpa as a member of placentalia of uncertain affinities mckenna and bell 1997 p 81 description astragalus of veratalpa is largest among those from vieux collonges that ameghino assigned to talpidae although at 4 5 mm it is about as long as his species a it is broader and hutchison noted broadness as one of characters that argue against classification of veratalpa in talpidae like living moles it has a broad flat and short head but it forms a noticeably small angle with body in actual moles head is more axially oriented i e towards central axis of foot surface of head that contacts navicula is less rounded than in moles body is low and nearly square and has a diameter of about 3 mm a surface on body of bone that articulates with tibia lower leg bone is not large and pulley like as in talpids there is a small perforation on lower side of body this perforation is larger in ameghino s other supposed talpids and trouessart suggested on basis of this feature that internal parts of toes were reduced in veratalpa distribution veratalpa is known only from locality of vieux collonges near lyon in southeastern france ameghino knew this locality as mont ameghino 1905 pp 41 53 ivanov 2000 p 560 this rich fissure filling locality has yielded thousands of and freudenthal 1981 pp 9 10 and is currently dated to early middle miocene boundary around 17 million years ago mn 4 5 in mn zonation ivanov 2000 p 560 mckenna and bell 1997 fig 1 as veratalpa is known from a single astragalus ameghino considered it to be rare he distinguished six talpid species among astragali ameghino 1905 pp 51 56 but according to hutchison only ameghino s species f which was assigned to talpidae with a query is really a talpid hutchison 1974 p 237 ameghino 1905 pp 55 56 references literature cited ameghino f 1905 la perforation sur quelques mammiferes du miocene moyen de france anales del museo nacional de buenos aires series 3 8 41 58 hutchison j h 1974 notes on type specimens of european miocene talpidae and a tentative classification of old world tertiary talpidae insectivora mammalia subscription required geobios 7 3 211 256 ivanov m 2000 snakes of lower middle miocene transition at vieux collonges rhone france with comments on colonisation of western europe by 22 4 559 588 mckenna m c and bell s k 1997 classification of mammals above species level new york columbia university press 631 pp mein p and freudenthal m 1981 les cricetidae mammalia rodentia du neogene moyen de vieux collonges partie 2 incertae sedis et scripta geologica 60 1 11 trouessart e 1906 mammiferes revue critique de 1 8 17 category cenozoic mammals of europe category miocene mammals category fossil taxa described in 1905
