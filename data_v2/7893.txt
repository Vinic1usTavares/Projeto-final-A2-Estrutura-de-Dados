uss bismarck sea cve 95 was fortieth of fifty s built to serve united states navy during world war ii she was only ship of united states navy to be named for battle of bismarck sea completed in may 1944 she served in support of philippines campaign and landings on iwo jima on 21 february 1945 she sank off of iwo jima due to two japanese kamikaze attacks killing 318 crewmen notably she is last aircraft carrier in u s service to date to sink in enemy action design and description thumb left a profile of design of which was shared with all casablanca class escort carriers bismarck sea was a casablanca class escort carrier most numerous type of aircraft carriers ever built and designed specifically to be mass produced using prefabricated sections in order to replace heavy early war losses standardized with her sister ships she was long overall had a beam of and a draft of she displaced standard with a full load she had a long hangar deck a long flight deck she was powered with two uniflow reciprocating steam engines which provided a force of driving two shafts enabling her to make ship had a cruising range of assuming that she traveled at a constant speed of her compact size necessitated installment of an aircraft catapult at her bow end and there were two aircraft elevators to facilitate movement of aircraft between flight and hangar deck one on fore another on aft one 38 caliber dual purpose gun was mounted on stern and she was equipped with 16 bofors 40 mm anti aircraft guns in twin mounts as well as 12 oerlikon 20 mm cannons which were used in an anti aircraft capability by end of war casablanca class carriers had been modified to carry 30 20 mm cannons as a response to increasing casualties due to kamikaze attacks anti aircraft guns were mounted around perimeter of deck casablanca class escort carriers were designed to carry 27 aircraft but she sometimes went over or under this number for example during philippines campaign she carried 16 wildcat fm 2 fighters and 12 avenger tbm 3 torpedo bombers for a total of 28 aircraft during iwo jima campaign she carried 19 fm 2 fighters and 12 tbm 3 torpedo bombers for a total of 31 aircraft she was designed to accommodate 764 crew but in wartime her complement inevitably crept over that number a reasonable estimate puts number of crew typically onboard a casablanca class escort carrier at around 910 to 916 men construction and service history her construction was awarded to kaiser shipbuilding company vancouver washington under a maritime commission contract on 18 june 1942 under name alikula bay as part of a tradition which named escort carriers after bays or sounds in alaska she was laid down on 31 january 1944 and was assigned designation mc hull 1132 she was launched on 17 april 1944 sponsored by mrs mabel c wallgren wife of senator wallgren under name alikula bay she was renamed bismarck sea on 16 may 1944 as part of a new naval policy which named subsequent casablanca class carriers after naval or land engagements and she was transferred to united states navy and commissioned on 20 may with captain john l pratt in command thumb left bismarck sea photographed in majuro atoll july 1944 after being commissioned bismarck sea engaged in training exercises off west coast throughout june on 1 july she left san pedro ferrying aircraft and pilots to pearl harbor after unloading her aircraft she loaded more aircraft and ferried them to marshall islands arriving at majuro atoll on 16 july she then proceeded back to pearl harbor carrying damaged aircraft arriving on 29 july along with her sister ship throughout august she was stationed at san diego for a four week overhaul where she received her combat air contingent composite squadron vc 86 between 7 september and 16 october she engaged in additional training exercises she then steamed to ulithi caroline islands to join admiral thomas c kinkaid s 7th fleet on 1 november between 14 and 23 november she operated off leyte and mindanao in support of operations onboard leyte on 21 november a japanese aircraft made a strafing run along carrier but without inflicting any damage and escaped to northwest before it could be engaged on 27 november she arrived at seeadler harbor new guinea to join task group 77 4 commanded by rear admiral calvin t durgin throughout december she conducted additional flight training and gunnery exercises on 27 december she left for palau to support invasion of luzon on 5 january 1945 her task group sighted japanese destroyers and engaged in a brief and inconclusive firefight with destroyers before disengaging to provide a screen twenty four fighters and sixteen torpedo bombers were sent against destroyers which bismarck sea supplemented strike group with four avengers and same amount of wildcats aerial strike force inflicted serious damage on both of destroyers sinking albeit damaged was able to escape into manila harbor but she was subsequently sunk on 7 january by aircraft from task force 78 however that same day escort carrier was sunk by a kamikaze aircraft task group then participated in invasion of lingayen gulf and supported air operations over luzon until 17 january when task group proceeded towards ulithi in preparation for invasion of iwo jima she departed ulithi on 10 february reorganized into task unit 52 2 still under command of durgin and consisting of ten escort carriers and their destroyer screens along with two escort carriers loosely tied into task group on anti submarine duties on 16 february she arrived off iwo jima to support landings task group s aircraft conducted anti submarine patrols anti aircraft patrols and supported first wave of troops on 19 february close air support almost all of it derived from carriers played a major role throughout invasion sinking thumb left lunga point burning from third kamikaze on 21 february 1945 which sparked a brief gasoline fire damage sustained by lunga point proved to be minimal thumb left bismarck sea exploding after being hit by a kamikaze photographed from on 16 february vice admiral kimpei authorized formation of a kamikaze special attack unit to counter imminent landings on iwo jima kamikaze force consisted of thirty two aircraft in total and on early morning of 21 february they departed from katori naval air base in asahi chiba they refueled at hachijo jima and proceeded towards u s naval contingent surrounding iwo jima arriving near sunset when kamikazes arrived bismarck sea was performing routine close air support with rest of task group 52 2 at time escort carrier task group having split in two consisted of bismarck sea her sister ships saginaw bay and along with a destroyer contingent task group was steaming approximately east of iwo jima at 17 30 aircraft on bismarck sea were scrambled to deal with incoming planes which turned out to be friendly after recovering her planes she found it necessary to take on three planes from other carriers and due to lack of deck space to shelter four of her fighters below decks without emptying their fuel tanks a decision which would later prove disastrous this brought number of aircraft aboard carrier to thirty seven aircraft 19 fm 2 fighters 15 tbm 3 torpedo bombers 2 oy 1 reconnaissance aircraft and a f6f hellcat fighter at 18 45 task group spotted japanese planes headed for them when a mitsubishi g4m made a dive towards lunga point gunners from bismarck sea shot it down at 18 46 five nakajima b6ns dove towards lunga point all four of kamikazes missed with their torpedoes and none of them made successful contact with lunga point albeit third kamikaze s wreckage skidded across carrier s deck sparking a brief gasoline fire damage to lunga point was minimal and eleven of her crew were wounded there were no fatalities and she was able to continue operating in support of troops on iwo jima fifth plane however switched targets and proceeded towards bismarck sea at it was spotted by and engaged by gunners aboard bismarck sea however despite heavy gunfire which damaged plane it quickly approached bismarck sea from starboard side at a low angle which anti aircraft guns could not depress sufficiently to fire at plane plowed in under first 40 mm gun aft crashing through hangar deck and striking ship s magazines at time of crash aircraft elevator was in operation and nearly up to flight deck when its cables were cut by kamikaze causing platform to drop onto hangar deck with a tremendous amount of force force of explosion distributed munitions including torpedoes across deck and started a fire ship s steering was also rendered dysfunctional by blast sprinkler system and water curtains were inoperative but fire was nearly under control when about two minutes later a second plane likely attracted by ship s glow against darkness approaching from port side struck aft elevator shaft exploding on impact killing majority of fire fighting party and destroying fire fighting salt water distribution system thus preventing any further damage control second plane detonated amongst four fighters which were sheltered belowdecks and fighters with full gasoline tanks quickly turned fire into a conflagration enveloping entire aft side of ship when munitions onboard ship began to detonate and with no firefighting equipment operational situation quickly deteriorated at 19 00 crew assembled at their abandon ship locations and engines were cut captain john l pratt issued order to abandon ship at 19 05 as crew abandoned ship a large explosion likely from detonation of torpedoes within hangar deck rocked ship this explosion tore much of aft end of ship to shreds and she quickly acquired a list to starboard majority of crew made it off ship in next 30 minutes at 20 07 ship s island detached from hull and slid into water two hours after dual kamikaze attacks at 21 15 bismarck sea sank with loss of 318 men and was last us navy aircraft carrier to be lost during world war ii many casualties were inflicted once crew abandoned ship through hypothermia choppy seas and japanese aircraft strafing survivors three destroyers and three destroyer escorts rescued survivors over next 12 hours between them saving a total of 605 officers and men from her crew of 923 destroyer escort directed rescue operations of remaining hands in spite of darkness heavy seas and continuing air attacks rescuing a majority of surviving crew thirty of edmonds own crew went over side to bring wounded and exhausted carrier men to safety edmonds hauled up 378 men destroyer escort retrieved 136 men and destroyer recovered 39 survivors survivors were then transferred to attack transports and special attack unit which struck on 21 february in addition to sinking bismarck sea also heavily damaged and slightly damaged lunga point and bismarck sea was only ship to sink as a result of attacks and was struck from navy list on 30 march to date she is last
