an average of 17 64 including four hat tricks a leading member of yorkshire team which achieved a high level of success in time he played macaulay was a volatile character who played aggressively he left a job at a bank to become a professional cricketer making his first class debut aged 23 as a fast bowler meeting limited success he altered style to deliver off spin in addition to his pace bowling this proved so effective that he was chosen to play for england in test matches however his perceived poor attitude towards game and an unsuccessful match in 1926 ashes probably prevented him playing more tests his form slumped following injuries in late 1920s but a recovery in early 1930s led to a recall by england although he broke down in his second match back another injury in 1934 made cricket difficult for him and his first class career ended in 1935 although he continued playing club cricket until second world war a pilot officer in royal air force he died of pneumonia on

cricket in his spare time playing career yorkshire debut in 1920 yorkshire needed to strengthen its bowling attack of team s previously successful bowlers major booth had been killed in war alonzo drake had died soon afterwards from illness and george hirst was past his best although wilfred rhodes was able to ease shortfall by resuming his career as a frontline spin bowler yorkshire needed new bowlers particularly pacemen macaulay had been spotted playing club cricket by sir stanley christopherson a former kent player subsequently harry hayley a 19th century yorkshire cricketer saw macaulay in action and was sufficiently impressed to recommend him for a trial with county at beginning of 1920 season macaulay played in two warm up games for yorkshire taking six wickets for 52 runs in a one day game and four for 24 and two for 19 in a two day game this was good enough to earn a first class debut on 15 may 1920 against derbyshire in county championship although he only took one wicket playing in early part of season he took five wickets for 50 runs his first five wicket haul against gloucestershire followed by six for 47 against worcestershire he continued to play until middle of june before dropping out of team after an unsuccessful match against surrey woodhouse p 305 in ten first class matches he had taken 24 wickets at an average of 24 35 and managed a top score of just 15 with bat wisden said he had neither pace nor stamina required while it later said he tried to bowl at speeds beyond his capability even so he decided to become a professional cricketer hirst and rhodes persuaded him to reduce his pace and concentrate on bowling a good length while trying to spin ball he practised through winter of 1920 21 to be ready for next season bowling a mixture of medium pace and his new style of off spin macaulay played 27 matches in 1921 after taking wickets steadily at start of season in his fourth game he took six wickets for ten runs as warwickshire were bowled out for 72 four more wickets in second innings gave yorkshire a big victory and macaulay had match figures of ten wickets for 65 runs first time he had taken ten wickets in a match macaulay

he took 101 first class wickets at an average of 17 33 placing him third in yorkshire bowling averages with bat he scored 457 runs at an average of 22 59 surprising commentators with his ability this included a maiden first class century against nottinghamshire his innings of 125 not out took yorkshire from 211 for seven wickets when he came in to bat 228 for eight soon after to a total of 438 for nine declared a lead of 264 yorkshire went on to a comfortable win his overall success in season meant that his place in team was secure macaulay improved his bowling record in 1922 taking more wickets at a lower average 133 wickets at an average of 14 67 and scoring another century helping yorkshire to win first of four county championships in a row macaulay finished second to rhodes in team s bowling averages first two matches of season brought macaulay figures of six for eight and five for 23 in a ten wicket win over northamptonshire and six for 12 out of an opposition total of 78 in an innings win over glamorgan while he took only one wicket in second innings his first three innings had given him 17 wickets for 43 runs he continued to pick up wickets but his most significant performance came in june in front of marylebone cricket club mcc members at lord s he took five for 31 as middlesex were bowled out for 138 those watching were impressed and he was selected for players against gentlemen at same ground in july he took three for 97 out of a total of 430 in one of most important matches of season these performances earned his selection for mcc tour to south africa that winter although there were concerns his fitness was insufficient statistically macaulay s best performance came shortly afterwards against gloucestershire he took seven for 47 and twelve wickets in match macaulay also scored 486 runs at an average of 17 35 test debut macaulay played eight first class matches in south africa in 1922 23 taking 29 wickets at an average of 16 37 his best first class performances were six for 18 against pretoria and eight wickets in match against transvaal while he was effective in minor matches taking five for 40 against east rand and six for 19 against zululand after england lost first test match which wisden attributed to a weakness in bowling macaulay replaced greville stevens and made his test match debut for england in second test he took wicket of george hearne with his first ball he was fourth player to take a wicket with his maiden delivery in test cricket in total he took two for 19 in first innings in second innings south africa were comfortably placed with a score of 157 for one but four wickets fell to macaulay while 13 runs were scored macaulay ended innings with five wickets for 64 wisden commented that he bowled very finely in this match he hit winning run batting at number eleven to seal a one wicket win for england he played in remaining three tests finishing with 16 wickets at an average of 20 37 england won series 2 1 but wisden correspondent for tour was not impressed by english performances noting that no really effective bowlers had emerged thumb left macaulay in 1920s alt a man wearing a white shirt with his health improved by tour wisden reported that macaulay was in excellent form for whole of 1923 season his performances earned him selection as one of wisden s cricketers of year citation praised his stamina spin and ability to bowl on all kinds of pitches but noted that he was easily discouraged and had a negative attitude if circumstances went against him he achieved his highest season total of wickets to date taking 166 at an average of 13 84 and came third in both yorkshire and national bowling averages woodhouse p 327 his best performance came in first match of season when he took seven wickets for 13 against glamorgan as they were dismissed for 63 later in season he took a hat trick against warwickshire while claiming five for 42 with bat macaulay scored 463 runs at an average of 18 52 there were no international matches that season but macaulay was selected for rest in a test trial against england in which he took just one wicket in 1924 macaulay further increased his total of wickets to 190 and lowered his bowling average to 13 23 placing him first in national averages woodhouse p 333 his batting declined as he scored 395 runs at an average of 11 96 although selected for another test trial macaulay did not play in series against touring south african team until third test at leeds where he took one wicket in each south african innings but was omitted from final two tests despite his success in season he was not chosen to tour australia with mcc that winter even though maurice tate leading bowler on tour lacked support macaulay had been involved in controversy on field in 1924 at time yorkshire team were notorious for their aggressive attitude while fielding hill p 106 in a match against middlesex in 1924 at sheffield hostility of crowd provoked an mcc inquiry which found that yorkshire bowler abe waddington had incited spectators hill pp 106 07 further incidents followed against surrey hill p 107 editor of wisden blamed yorkshire s poor discipline on a small group of approximately four players without naming macaulay as one of them he noted that lord hawke yorkshire president believed macaulay should have been in team to australia and that it was entirely his own fault he was not chosen it is also possible that during a match at this time macaulay openly criticised captaincy and bowling of arthur gilligan england captain marshall p 106 marshall claims that incident took place in 1924 lord s test but macaulay did not play in that game since 1923 macaulay had run a cricket outfitters in leeds and wakefield with his yorkshire team mate herbert sutcliffe borrowing ps250 from his mother to help establish business during winter of 1924 25 shop became a limited company and macaulay one of its directors according to sutcliffe s biographer alan hill macaulay quickly lost interest and partnership was dissolved a year later but sutcliffe made lone venture a success hill pp 77 78 macaulay received ps900 from outfitters upon his resignation mid 1920s career macaulay s most successful season in terms of wickets was 1925 despite a very dry summer which produced a succession of good batting pitches he took 211 wickets at an average of 15 48 coming top of yorkshire averages exactly 200 of his wickets were taken for yorkshire only wilfred rhodes and george hirst had previously reached 200 wickets for yorkshire and only bob appleyard has done so since as of 2013 one of macaulay s highest profile performances in 1925 came for yorkshire against sussex who were chasing 263 to win game just after lunch on final day score was 223 for three wickets a possibly apocryphal story suggests that macaulay drank champagne in interval pope p 166 he then delivered a spell of five wickets for eight runs in 33 balls to bowl out his opponents and finish with figures of seven for 67 he then left field exhausted cricket historian mick pope describes match as a lasting testimony to macaulay s belief that no cause was ever lost pope pp 165 66 macaulay was again selected for players against gentlemen at lord s and took five wickets in match with bat macaulay scored 621 runs at an average of 23 88 although he only passed fifty twice yorkshire s reign as county champions ended in 1926 first season since 1921 when yorkshire did not win championship wisden noted that yorkshire attack with exception of rhodes was less effective than previously rogerson p 142 macaulay bowled less overs and took fewer wickets at a higher bowling average his 134 wickets at an average of 17 78 placed him second in yorkshire averages selected for a test trial he failed to take a wicket wisden described his performance as lifeless while cricket writer neville cardus noted that he had yet again fallen below his best away from yorkshire xi he was not chosen for gentlemen v players match never representing players again macaulay was selected for third test against australia at headingley possibly because arthur carr england captain expected pitch to favour spinners australians were concerned that macaulay represented a threat to their batting but match did not work out in macaulay s favour as a bowler having been dropped at start of play charlie macartney played what wisden called one of best innings of his career and vigorously attacked england bowling achieving rare feat of scoring a century before lunch interval australian batsman had asked his captain if he could attack macaulay in particular and yorkshire bowler suffered as macartney quickly dominated him macaulay eventually had macartney caught after hitting a short ball in air but it was macaulay s only success in innings macaulay conceded 123 runs in 32 overs as australia scored 494 when macaulay came into bat from number ten in batting order england were 182 for eight wickets and facing defeat he played an attacking innings of 76 hitting ten fours in a partnership of 108 with george geary this began an england recovery which helped team to escape with a draw nevertheless macaulay did not play in final two tests of series later in season he took fourteen wickets for 92 runs against gloucestershire including eight for 43 in second innings these were best bowling figures of his career that he achieved in a match apart from his batting success in test match macaulay scored another two fifties and in match against somerset achieved a century decline over next four seasons yorkshire failed to win championship although they never finished lower than fourth in table woodhouse pp 344 350 358 366 67 team displayed an unaccustomed weakness in bowling particularly after death of roy kilner in 1928 effectiveness of main bowlers was reduced by age and injury only macaulay remained at something approaching his bowling peak woodhouse pp 358 367 however his performances worsened each year his bowling figures in 1927 season were similar to his achievements in 1926 showing only a slight decline but his total of wickets fell each season until 1930 in 1927 macaulay took 130 wickets at an average of 18 26 however he suffered a foot injury in 1928 and took time to recover his best form hodgson p 122 his wicket tally fell to 120 and his average climbed to 24 37 his total of wickets decreased further to 102 in 1929 and his average remained above 20 hampered by another foot injury throughout 1930 macaulay failed to take 100 wickets for first time since his debut season his average of 25 12 was highest of his career hodgson p 128 in these seasons he was only selected for one representative match a test trial in 1928 in which he failed to take a wicket at same time his batting faded in 1927 macaulay scored his highest run aggregate and passed fifty six times while hitting 678 runs at an average of 25 11 he improved his batting average in 1928 accumulating 517 runs at 25 85 with four more fifties however after 1928 he never averaged more than 16 26 with bat and only scored two more fifties in his career both in 1929 end of first class career return to form from 1931 season yorkshire once again dominated county championship winning three consecutive trophies a large part of success was an increase in bowling strength in 1931 macaulay slightly increased his haul of wickets from 91 to 97 and his average dropped from 25 12 to 15 75 this placed him third in yorkshire averages behind hedley verity and bill bowes who both took over 100 wickets and led a very strong bowling attack woodhouse p 368 that season macaulay was awarded a benefit match against surrey which raised ps1 633 bowes p 72 worth approximately ps82 700 in 2008 calculated using retail price index in ps at at time this was considered a poor reward for a yorkshire cricketer following season macaulay took fewer wickets managing 84 at an average of 19 07 which placed him fifth in yorkshire averages he achieved his best bowling figures in first class cricket when he took eight for 21 against indian touring side by now macaulay was a specialist spinner and had largely abandoned pace bowling bill bowes and arthur rhodes opened yorkshire bowling hodgson p 132 1933 season signalled a return to form for macaulay wisden judged that he recovered fully his length spin and command over variations in pace he bowled more overs than anyone else in team and passed 100 wickets for first time since 1929 tenth and final time he did so taking 148 wickets at an average of 16 45 hodgson p 136 against northamptonshire he took seven for nine as team was bowled out for 27 he finished match with thirteen for 34 against lancashire when his match figures were twelve for 49 he took a hat trick in a sequence of four wickets in five balls he also took twelve wickets against leicestershire his form won a recall to test side after seven years not picked initially a decision described by wisden as unfair he played in first test when e w clark dropped out of team before match macaulay took one wicket in first innings but had figures of four for 57 in second innings to earn approval from wisden he was picked for second test but bowled only 14 overs before injuring his foot when fielding he was unable to take any further part in game he did not play in third test but was selected in festival game at scarborough for team selected from mcc party which toured australia in previous winter he played instead of an injured player even though he did not take part in tour macaulay ended second in yorkshire bowling averages in its review of season wisden stated that his form in early part of season would have placed his among best cricketers in world final seasons macaulay s final two seasons were affected by injury as he was increasingly bothered by rheumatism hodgson p 138 in 1934 season while trying to take a catch he injured finger he used to spin ball he did not appear for yorkshire until june but went on to take 55 wickets at an average of 23 43 next season was his final one he only played nine matches taking 22 wickets at 20 09 at end of year he retired from first class cricket and yorkshire awarded him a special grant of ps250 yorkshire did have a replacement in mind frank smailes was considered to be versatile enough in his bowling style to take macaulay s place but it was not until ellis robinson secured a place in 1937 that a new specialist off spinner was found hodgson p 145 macaulay ended his career with 1 837 first class wickets at an average of 17 65 in eight test matches he took 24 of those wickets at an average of 27 58 in addition he scored 6 055 runs at an average of 18 07 and held 373 catches he took 100 wickets in a season ten times a record only surpassed by four others for yorkshire while only three other yorkshire bowlers have taken 200 wickets in a season he also took four hat tricks post yorkshire career following his retirement macaulay initially attempted to market a patented rheumatic medicine but business quickly failed he then established an athletic outfitting shop in leeds this business also was unsuccessful macaulay blamed a lack of money and competition from other businesses consequently he filed for bankruptcy in 1937 macaulay accused yorkshire of worsening his situation by withholding most of his benefit money of total raised he received only he believed that he was owed balance and continued his business under that assumption but yorkshire had invested amount and he only received interest matter arose in court and when asked why he thought money would be paid to him macaulay answered because i had earned it he also rejected accusation that he spent his time drinking in public houses and another that he had neglected his two failed businesses official receiver found that macaulay s complaint against yorkshire was without justification macaulay suggested that he should arrange for invested money to be paid to his creditors in his will macaulay secured new employment and a few days after hearing it was announced that he would play professional cricket in wales macaulay played league cricket in wales and lancashire until second world war during 1937 he was professional at ebbw vale cricket club and in 1938 and 1939 he played in lancashire league as professional for todmorden for whom he took nine wickets for 10 runs against ramsbottom in worsley cup final ramsbottom were bowled out for 47 to give macaulay s team a 26 run win woodhouse pp 306 07 when second world war began macaulay joined royal air force raf volunteer reserve in 1940 as a pilot officer and was stationed at church fenton close to ash where he lived with his wife edith later in year he was stationed in shetland islands where he was bothered by cold pope pp 166 67 six days after his 43rd birthday he died of pneumonia at sullom voe raf station on 13 december 1940 he was buried in lerwick cemetery on shetland woodhouse p 307 swanton p 61 style and personality as a batsman macaulay was reasonably good and possibly better than his statistics would suggest he was capable of batting well in a crisis but may have been prevented from honing his batting skills by yorkshire leadership who wished him to focus on bowling he generally batted low down in order after all rounders in team marshall p 38 macaulay s fielding was also very effective he was excellent at close range to batsmen particularly from his own bowling as a bowler macaulay fulfilled two roles at start of an innings when ball was new and hard he opened bowling with medium fast deliveries that swung away from right handed batsmen in this style he was very accurate and bowled a variety of deliveries to unsettle his opponents cricket writer r c robertson glasgow considered him to be better than any similar bowler in 1920s except maurice tate leading medium paced bowler in england robertson glasgow p 136 macaulay could vary his pace from medium to fast depending on needs of match situation and type of pitch robertson glasgow p 135 when pitch was suitable for spinning ball he bowled medium paced off breaks wisden said that his spin made him more effective than other bowlers of his speed on a sticky wicket a pitch which has been affected by rain making it erratic and difficult to bat on his obituary further stated under suitable conditions for using off break batsmen seemed at his mercy this was because he could bowl deliveries which were almost impossible for batsmen to play without getting out but at same time it was very difficult to score runs against him robertson glasgow wrote that on a rain damaged pitch he was in his glory he would make small adjustments to positions of his fielders or bowl from different sides of wicket often making gestures or facial expressions as he did so robertson glasgow said that only best could survive onslaught except by a miracle and described macaulay as a great bowler cricket writer jim kilburn suggested that macaulay was a great cricketer he was great not so much in mathematical accomplishment as in cricketing character macaulay s bowling action was relaxed and effortless being admired by his contemporaries kilburn wrote his run up was half shambling his steps short and his shoulders swaying but his feet were faultlessly placed and his aim was high at instant of delivery however critics and team mates more widely knew him as passionate hostile and fiery when bowling kilburn said that batsmen were macaulay s mortal enemies he knew many tricks to dismiss or unsettle them including tactic of bowling ball straight at their head without pitching which was usually considered dangerous and unfair bowes pp 29 30 kilburn observed that should batsman survive he would be rewarded with a glare of concentrated venom calculated to stagger any but heart every scrap of his heart and soul went into every ball he bowled he never gave up and his persistence was invariably triumphant sooner or later yorkshire post after his death observed macaulay will always be remembered for fierceness of his enthusiasm when there was a fighting chance of victory quoted in pope p 167 macaulay displayed a temper when matters went against him robertson glasgow described him as an unusual man fiercely independent witty argumentative swift to joy and anger he had pleasure in cracking a convention or cursing an enemy a cricket bag came between him and his blazer hanging on a peg and he d kick it and tell it a truth or two then laugh bill bowes described how when he was bowling he would glare and mutter under his breath he seemed to be filled with a devilish energy bowes p 64 he would make sharp or biting comments particularly if a fielder made a mistake when he was bowling and although often amusing it could at times hurt recipients and his anger made his team mates wary of him hodgson p 109 bowes pp 76 77 yet he could also express appreciation when a skillful batsmen hit a good shot from his bowling result was that his colleagues were never sure what to expect from him even after playing with him for years bowes p 81 herbert sutcliffe said he could be charming when not playing but his wit could be sharp robertson glasgow nevertheless described him as
