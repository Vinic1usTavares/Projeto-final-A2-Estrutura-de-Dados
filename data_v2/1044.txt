nauru reed warbler acrocephalus rehsei is a passerine bird endemic to island of nauru in pacific ocean it is one of only two native breeding land birds on nauru and it is only passerine found on island it is related to other micronesian reed warblers all of which evolved from one of several radiations of genus across pacific related warblers on nearby islands include carolinian reed warbler with which nauru species was initially confused and nightingale reed warbler which was formerly sometimes considered same species a medium sized warbler nauru reed warbler has dark brown upperparts cream underparts and a long thin beak it makes a low cup shaped nest into which it lays two or three white eggs and it feeds on insects however details about its behavior and ecology are little known it is found throughout nauru which has changed substantially in recent decades due to phosphate mining nauru reed warbler is potentially threatened by introduced predators and habitat loss and its small range means that it could be vulnerable to chance occurrences such as tropical cyclones reports of a similar warbler from nearby islands suggest that it might previously have been found elsewhere but was driven to local extinction by introduced cats taxonomy and systematics otto finsch was first naturalist to visit island of nauru stopping for six hours on 24 july 1880 while travelling from marshall islands to solomon islands his 1881 report included a warbler he initially identified as carolinian reed warbler by 1883 he considered it to be a new species calamoherpe rehsei buden 2008a p 8 generic name calamoherpe is now recognised as a synonym of acrocephalus jobling 2010 p 84 leading to current binomial name generic name acrocephalus derives from greek akros meaning topmost and kephale meaning head akros part of name may have been given through confusion with acutus and taken to mean sharp pointed referring to angular head shape typical of this genus jobling 2010 pp 30 31 synonym calamoherpe is from greek meaning reed and herpes meaning creeping thing finsch named species after ernst a german ornithologist and collector and one of finsch s travelling companions finsch 1883 p 142 jobling 2010 p 332 since original descriptions little has been written about species buden 2008a p 16 and details about its ecology and behaviour are poorly known though nauru reed warbler is generally accepted as a species some authorities such as h e wolters in die der erde 1980 and howard and moore in a complete checklist of birds of world 1991 have considered it a subspecies of acrocephalus luscinius nightingale reed warbler recent dna studies have affirmed its status as a separate species it is considered monotypic meaning there are no recognised subspecies species is known by english common names finsch s reed warbler nauru warbler pleasant warbler nauru reed warbler and nauru reed warbler in native language it is known as a 2009 phylogenic study of family did not include this species and as recently as 2010 its relation with other members of genus was unknown a 2011 analysis of mitochondrial dna showed that nauru reed warbler forms a clade with australian reed warbler southern marquesan reed warbler and a now extinct species from pagan island in marianas closest relative of nauru reed warbler appears to be extinct warbler from pagan this is currently named as a subspecies of nightingale reed warbler a luscinius but that species is polyphyletic and pagan form which has been proposed as a new species pagan reed warbler is in a different clade to nightingale reed warblers from other islands pattern of colonisation of pacific islands and eventually australia by acrocephalus warblers from asia was complex with multiple of even remote archipelagos although hawaiian islands were colonised about 2 3 million years ago other islands were reached much more recently in mid pleistocene between 0 2 1 4 million years ago or even later nearest other warblers geographically to nauru are carolinian reed warbler and nightingale reed warbler spenneman 2006 p 258 description nauru reed warbler is a medium sized and warmly coloured reed warbler with a relatively light build entirety of upperparts are dark brown with rump and uppertail coverts slightly brighter than tail and mantle when closed wing is same colour as mantle short and rounded wing does not reach start of tail feathers which enhances appearance of a long tail close inspection of wing reveals darker centres to both greater coverts and tertial feathers its face shows little contrast as ear coverts crown nape chin and throat are all a similar shade of pale brown lores are a dark brown and there is a pale creamy supercilium or eyebrow extending from beak to ear coverts which are a cinnamon brown darkening and merging with nape beak is long thin and straight underparts are much lighter darkening towards vent and undertail coverts chin is a dull cream merging with throat which then browns towards base centre of breast is a dull brown yellow while sides are a reddish brown upper mandible of beak is dark grey with pink edges while lower mandible is pink darkening towards to tip legs and feet are dark grey bird measures up to with a wingspan of species exhibits no sexual dimorphism and characteristics of young are unknown as only passerine on island there is no chance that this species may be confused with any other nauru reed warbler is slightly smaller than carolinian reed warbler which is also lighter in colour with a more contrasting eyebrow nightingale reed warbler is substantially larger and oriental reed warbler has a duller colouration with whiter underparts finsch 1883 p 143 distribution and habitat thumb left scrubland remaining after phosphate mining an environment in which nauru reed warbler thrives nauru reed warbler is endemic to island of nauru in pacific ocean it is one of only two indigenous land birds which breed on island other being micronesian pigeon warbler can be found throughout island thriving in scrubland in areas previously used for phosphate mining as well as remaining patches of forest on island s central plateau it is most common in remains of forest found on island s steep slopes it is also readily observed in gardens and ruderal areas on island s coast in 1881 finsch described species as abundant calling it as common as house sparrow in england biologist donald buden again found it widespread on island in 2008 species is sedentary meaning that birds do not naturally leave nauru is nearest island and despite being similar to nauru it lacks any warblers however it is possible that populations of nauru reed warbler existed on other islands until comparatively recently on marshall islands traditional stories refer to a small bird known variously as annan anang and this bird was considered property of chieftains though no physical descriptions exist of species it has been described as butterfly sized pleasant smelling and as living among rocks on shores of north western islands spenneman 2006 p 257 ethnographers kramer and reported that bird became extinct or extirpated around 1880 based on descriptions of birds seen on jaluit paul schnee hypothesised that annan may have been a nauru reed warbler extinction of annan may have been due to hunting by cats spenneman 2006 p 259 which were introduced to marshall islands by russian otto von kotzebue in 1817 to hunt rats they then multiplied before being spread by locals as pets after which they started to become feral spenneman 2006 p 260 behaviour and ecology nauru reed warbler nests are cup shaped and woven from grasses and twigs they sometimes include filiformis vine or casuarina equisetifolia needles nests are bound to upright stems in a way typical of warblers buden reported that warblers nest in trees and shrubs at a height of species may also nest on ground young in ground nests may be more vulnerable to predation by rats eggs have variously been reported in december and july and ornithologist a pearson suggested that species may nest all year round clutch size has been reported as two or three eggs incubation and fledgling periods are unknown pearson reported lower nesting than buden recording nests in bushes and undergrowth between from ground especially in forked branches of hibiscus and lime buden reported that birds were more vocal in december than in march and april song has been described as similar to that of a song thrush common blackbird or willie wagtail and it is delivered both day and night finsch described warbler as insectivorous feeding primarily on dragonflies six species of dragonfly have been observed on island aurora guttatus bipunctata flavescens and buden did not observe species feeding on dragonflies but did see three different feeding habits most frequently birds were seen moving through trees and shrubs catching prey on foliage other birds were seen perched close to floor darting to ground and returning to perch with prey in open areas birds were observed moving across ground occasionally grasping a presumed prey item in coastal areas they have been observed feeding in coconut trees potential predators for birdlife of nauru in general include feral cats and dogs as well as polynesian rat and rat buden 2008a p 9 feral cats and wild rats in particular are potential threats to nauru reed warbler status iucn lists species as vulnerable because its very small range leaves it susceptible to chance events such as cyclones and introduction of alien predators birdlife international previously estimated that there were between 10 000 and 20 000 nauru reed warblers based on 1993 data but buden s 2006 estimate was 5 000 birds of all ages led to a revised figure of 3 000 mature individuals in 2001 it was observed that removal of phosphate deposits on island meant that vegetation was decreasing presenting a potential threat to species hildyard 2001 pp 1620 1621 in 2008 however buden claimed that habitat degradation and loss of native forest via mining operations has apparently had no major adverse effects on population nauru reed warblers were observed to be common on island and flourishing in scrubland left by mining unlike other birds on island species is not hunted and is protected under schedule 1 of nauru s wild birds preservation ordinance 1937 buden 2008a pp 16 17 for conservation purposes iucn recommends regular surveys of population and establishment of a monitoring programme through training local people it also proposed raising conservation awareness by increasing profile of bird see also list of birds of nauru notes cited texts
