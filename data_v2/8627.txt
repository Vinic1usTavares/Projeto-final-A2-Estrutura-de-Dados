betula pendula commonly known as silver birch warty birch european white birch european white birch td tree bee or east asian white birch is a species of tree in family betulaceae native to europe and parts of asia though in southern europe it is only found at higher altitudes its range extends into siberia china and southwest asia in mountains of northern turkey caucasus and northern iran it has been introduced into north america where it is known as european white birch and is considered invasive in some states in united states and parts of canada tree can also be found in more temperate regions of australia silver birch is a medium sized deciduous tree that owes its common name to white peeling bark on trunk twigs are slender and often pendulous and leaves are roughly triangular with doubly serrate margins and turn yellow in autumn before they fall flowers are catkins and light winged seeds get widely scattered by wind silver birch is a hardy tree a pioneer species and one of first trees to appear on bare or fire swept land many species of birds and animals are found in birch woodland tree supports a wide range of insects and light shade it casts allows shrubby and other plants to grow beneath its canopy it is planted decoratively in parks and gardens and is used for forest products such as joinery timber firewood tanning racecourse jumps and brooms various parts of tree are used in traditional medicine and bark contains triterpenes which have been shown to have medicinal properties description thumb left upright silver birch silver birch typically reaches tall exceptionally up to with a slender trunk usually under diameter bark on trunk and branches is golden brown at first but later this turns to white as a result of papery tissue developing on surface and peeling off in flakes in a similar manner to closely related paper birch b papyrifera bark remains smooth until tree gets quite large but in older trees bark thickens becoming irregular dark and rugged young branches have whitish resin warts and twigs are slender hairless and often pendulous buds are small and sticky and development is terminal bud dies away and growth continues from a lateral bud species is monoecious with male and female catkins found on same tree some shoots are long and bear male catkins at tip while others are short and bear female catkins immature male catkins are present during winter but female catkins develop in spring soon after leaves unfurl leaves have short slender stalks and are long triangular with broad wedge shaped bases slender pointed tips and coarsely double toothed serrated margins they are sticky with resin at first but this dries as they age leaving small white scales foliage is a pale to medium green and turns yellow early in autumn before leaves fall in midsummer female catkins mature and male catkins expand and release pollen and wind pollination takes place small 1 to 2 mm winged seeds ripen in late summer on pendulous cylindrical catkins long and broad seeds are very numerous and are separated by scales and when ripe whole catkin disintegrates and seeds are spread widely by wind silver birch can easily be confused with similar downy birch betula pubescens yet downy birches are characterised by hairy leaves and young shoots whereas same parts on silver birch are hairless leaf base of silver birch is usually a right angle to stalk while for downy birches it is rounded in terms of genetic structure trees are quite different but do however occasionally hybridise distribution and habitat silver birch grows naturally from western europe eastwards to kazakhstan sakha republic in siberia mongolia and xinjiang province in china and southwards to mountains of caucasus and northern iran iraq and turkey it is also native to northern morocco and has become naturalised in some other parts of world in southern parts of its range it is mainly found in mountainous regions its light seeds are easily blown by wind and it is a pioneer species one of first trees to sprout on bare land or after a forest fire it needs plenty of light and does best on dry acid soils and is found on heathland mountainsides and clinging to crags its tolerance to pollution make it suitable for planting in industrial areas and exposed sites it has been introduced into north america where it is known as european white birch and is considered invasive in states of kentucky maryland washington and wisconsin it is naturalised and locally invasive in parts of canada taxonomy thumb right upright tree in autumn thumb right upright tree in winter three subspecies of silver birch are accepted betula pendula subsp pendula europe and eastwards to central asia betula pendula subsp regel ashburner mcall eastern asia and western north america treated by some botanists as betula d ed 1993 betula proceedings of ids betula symposium 2 4 october 1992 p 51 international society betula pendula subsp szechuanica c k schneid ashburner mcall western china from qinghai and gansu to yunnan and southeast treated by some botanists as betula szechuanica b pendula is distinguished from related b pubescens other common european birch in having hairless warty shoots hairy and without warts in downy birch more triangular leaves with double serration on margins more ovoid and with single serrations in downy birch and whiter bark often with scattered black fissures greyer less fissured in downy birch it is also distinguished cytologically silver birch being diploid with two sets of chromosomes whereas downy birch is tetraploid four sets of chromosomes hybrids between two are known but are very rare and being triploid are sterile two have differences in habitat requirements with silver birch found mainly on dry sandy soils and downy birch more common on wet poorly drained sites such as clay soils and peat bogs silver birch also demands slightly more summer warmth than does downy birch which is significant in cooler parts of europe many north american texts treat two species as conspecific and cause confusion by combining downy birch s alternative vernacular name white birch with scientific name b pendula of other species but they are regarded as distinct species throughout europe several varieties of b pendula are no longer accepted including b pendula var carelica laciniata meridionalis microlepis and as well as forms betula pendula f crispa and palmeri other synonyms include ecology silver birch has an open canopy which allows plenty of light to reach ground this allows a variety of mosses grasses and flowering plants to grow beneath which in turn attract insects flowering plants often found in birch woods include primrose primula vulgaris violet viola bluebell hyacinthoides non scripta wood anemone anemone nemorosa and wood sorrel oxalis acetosella small shrubs that grow on forest floor include blaeberry vaccinium and vaccinium vitis idaea birds found in birch woodland include chaffinch tree pipit willow warbler nightingale robin woodcock and green woodpecker branches of silver birch often have tangled masses of twigs known as witch s brooms growing among them caused by fungus taphrina old trees are often killed by decay fungus and fallen branches rot rapidly on forest floor this tree commonly grows with mycorrhizal fungus amanita muscaria in a mutualistic relationship this applies particularly to acidic or nutrient poor soils other mycorrhizal associates include leccinum scabrum and cantharellus cibarius in addition to mycorrhiza presence of microfauna in soil assists growth of tree as it enhances mobilization of nutrients thumb birch sawfly septentrionalis larvae feeding on silver birch west wales july 2014 larvae of a large number of species of butterflies moths and other insects feed on leaves and other parts of silver birch in germany almost 500 species of insects have been found on silver and downy birch including 106 beetles and 105 lepidopterans with 133 insect species feeding almost exclusively on birch birch dieback disease can affect planted trees while naturally regenerated trees seem less susceptible this disease also affects b pubescens and in 2000 was reported at many of sites planted with birch in scotland during 1990s in united states wood is attacked by bronze birch borer an insect pest to which it has no natural resistance conservation b pendula is considered a species of least concern by iucn red list synonym betula as b was previously listed on red list as vulnerable though it is now considered a synonym of b pendula subsp pendula b was previously considered extinct in wild on red list but is now considered a form of b pendula with presence of a mutant gene causing it to grow weakly and fruit heavily uses silver birch is often planted in parks and gardens grown for its white bark and gracefully drooping shoots sometimes even in warmer than optimum places such as los angeles and sydney in scandinavia and other regions of northern europe it is grown for forest products such as lumber and pulp as well as for aesthetic purposes and ecosystem services it is sometimes used as a pioneer and nurse tree elsewhere silver birch wood is pale in colour with no distinct heartwood and is used in making furniture plywood veneers parquet blocks skis and kitchen utensils and in turnery it makes a good firewood that produces a good heat when burnt but is quickly consumed by flames slabs of bark are used for making roof shingles and strips are used for handicrafts such as wooden footwear and small containers historically bark was used for tanning bark can be heated and resin collected resin is an excellent waterproof glue and useful for starting fires thin sheets of bark that peel off young wood contain a waxy resin and are easy to ignite even when wet dead twigs are also useful as kindling for outdoor fires thumb left foliage coloring in autumn birch brushwood is used for racecourse jumps and besom brooms in spring large quantities of sap rise up trunk and this can be tapped it contains around 1 sugars and can be used in a similar way to maple syrup being drunk fresh concentrated by evaporation or fermented into a wine in sweden bark of birch trees was ground up and used to make bark bread a form of famine food removal of bark was at one time so widespread that carl linnaeus expressed his concern for survival of woodlands thumb a pair of finnish traditional shoes woven from strips of birch bark silver birch is used in traditional medicine as a diuretic and is reputed to be useful in treatment of high blood pressure high cholesterol obesity gout kidney stones nephritis cystitis digestive disturbances and respiratory diseases for these purposes a decoction of bark or leaves is generally used externally silver birch is used to promote healing relieve pain and treat inflammations and infections of skin such as eczema and psoriasis outer part of bark contains up to 20 main components in essential oil of buds are a 10 d 15 and d 13 also present in bark are other substances which have been shown to have anti inflammatory antiviral and anti cancer properties silver birch is finland s national tree leafy fragrant boughs of silver birch called or vasta are used to gently beat oneself in finnish sauna culture cultivation thumb upright right b pendula laciniata successful birch cultivation requires a climate cool enough for at least occasional winter snowfall as they are shallow rooted they may require water during dry periods they grow best in full sun planted in deep well drained soil cultivars carelica or curly birch is called in finland wood is hard and throughout it is prized for its decorative appearance and is used in wood carving and as veneer laciniata commonly misidentified as has deeply incised leaves and weeping branches purpurea has dark purple leaves tristis has an erect trunk with weeping branchlets has dense twiggy weeping growth with no central leader and requires
