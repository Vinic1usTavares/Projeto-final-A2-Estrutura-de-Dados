vintner of stratford upon avon circumstances of marriage including quiney s misconduct may have prompted rewriting of shakespeare s will thomas was struck out while judith s inheritance was attached with provisions to safeguard it from her husband bulk of shakespeare s estate was left in an elaborate fee tail to his elder daughter susanna and her male heirs judith and thomas quiney had three

bank of river avon on 10 february 1616 judith shakespeare married thomas quiney a vintner of stratford in holy trinity church assistant vicar richard watts who later married quiney s sister mary probably officiated wedding took place during pre lenten season of shrovetide which was a prohibitive time for marriages in 1616 period in which marriages were banned without dispensation from church including ash wednesday and lent started on 23 january septuagesima sunday and ended on 7 april sunday after easter hence marriage required a special licence issued by bishop of worcester which couple had failed to obtain presumably they had posted required banns in church since walter wright of stratford was cited for marrying without banns or licence but this was not considered sufficient schoenbaum 1977 p 292 infraction was a minor one apparently caused by minister as three other couples were also wed that february quiney was nevertheless summoned by walter nixon to appear before consistory court in worcester this same walter nixon was later involved in a star chamber case and was found guilty of forging signatures and taking bribes quiney failed to appear by required date register recorded judgement which was excommunication on or about 12 march 1616 it is unknown if judith was also excommunicated but in any case punishment did not last long in november of same year they were back in church for baptism of their firstborn child schoenbaum 1977 293 marriage did not begin well quiney had recently impregnated another woman margaret wheeler who died in childbirth along with her child both were buried on 15 march 1616 a few days later on 26 march quiney appeared before bawdy court which dealt among other things with whoredom and uncleanliness confessing in open court to carnal copulation with margaret wheeler he submitted himself for correction and was sentenced to open penance in a white sheet according to custom before congregation on three sundays he also had to admit to his crime this time wearing ordinary clothes before minister of bishopton in warwickshire first part of sentence was remitted essentially letting him off with a five shilling fine to be given to parish s poor as bishopton had no church but only a chapel he was spared any public humiliation schoenbaum 1977 pp 293 94 chapel lane atwood s and cage where quineys lived after their marriage is unknown but judith owned her father s cottage on chapel lane stratford while thomas had held since 1611 lease on a tavern called atwood s on high street cottage later passed from judith to her sister as part of settlement in their father s will in july 1616 thomas swapped houses with his brother in law william chandler moving his vintner s shop to upper half of a house at corner of high street and bridge street schoenbaum 1977 p 294 this house was known as cage and is house traditionally associated with judith quiney in 20th century cage was for a time a wimpy bar before being turned into stratford information office schoenbaum 1977 p 5 cage provides further insight into why shakespeare would not have trusted judith s husband around 1630 quiney tried to sell lease on house but was prevented by his kinsmen in 1633 to protect interests of judith and children lease was signed over to trust of john hall susanna s husband thomas nash husband of judith s niece and richard watts vicar of nearby harbury who was quiney s brother in law and who had officiated at thomas and judith s wedding eventually in november 1652 lease to cage ended up in hands of thomas eldest brother richard quiney a grocer in london schoenbaum 1977 p 295 william shakespeare s last will and testament thumb nash s house standing adjacent to site of new place inauspicious beginnings of judith s marriage in spite of her husband and his family being otherwise unexceptional has led to speculation that this was cause for william shakespeare s hastily altered last will and testament he first summoned his lawyer francis collins in january 1616 on 25 march he made further alterations probably because he was dying and because of his concerns about quiney schoenbaum 1977 p 297 in first bequest of will there had been a provision vnto my sonne in l aw but sonne in l aw was then struck out with judith s name inserted in its stead chambers 1930 ii pp 169 80 to this daughter he bequeathed ps100 in discharge of her marriage another ps50 ps in if she were to relinquish chapel lane cottage and if she or any of her children were still alive at end of three years following date of will a further ps150 ps in of which she was to receive interest but not principal this money was explicitly denied to thomas quiney unless he were to bestow on judith lands of equal value in a separate bequest judith was given my broad silver gilt bole finally for bulk of his estate which included his main house new place his two houses on henley street and various lands in and around stratford shakespeare had set up an entail his estate was bequeathed in descending order of choice to following 1 his daughter susanna hall 2 upon susanna s death to first sonne of her bodie lawfullie yssueing to heires males of bodie of first sonne lawfullie yssueing 3 to susanna s second son and his male heirs 4 to susanna s third son and his male heirs 5 to susanna s sixte sonnes and their male heirs 6 to elizabeth hall susanna and john hall s firstborn and her male heirs 7 to judith and her male heirs or 8 to whatever heirs law would normally recognise this elaborate entail is usually taken to indicate that thomas quiney was not to be entrusted with shakespeare s inheritance although some have speculated that it might simply indicate that susanna was favoured child children judith and thomas quiney had three children shakespeare baptised 23 november 1616 buried 8 may 1617 richard baptised 9 february 1618 buried 6 february 1639 thomas baptised 23 january 1620 buried 28 january 1639

died at six months of age richard and thomas quiney were buried within one month of each other 21 and 19 years old respectively deaths of all of judith s children resulted in new legal consequences entail on her father s inheritance led susanna along with her daughter and son in law to make a settlement using a rather elaborate legal device for inheritance of her own branch of family legal wrangling continued for another thirteen years until 1652 chambers 1930 ii 179 80 death judith quiney died by 9 february 1662 day of her burial and a week after her 77th birthday she outlived her last surviving child by 23 years schoenbaum 1977 p 318 p 13 she was buried in grounds of holy trinity church but exact location of her grave is unknown of her husband records show little of his later years it has been speculated that he may have died in 1662 or 1663 when parish burial records are incomplete or that he may have left stratford upon avon he is known to have had a nephew living in london
