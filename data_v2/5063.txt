whiskey rebellion also known as whiskey insurrection was a tax protest in united states beginning in 1791 and ending in 1794 during presidency of george washington ultimately under command of american revolutionary war veteran major james mcfarlane so called whiskey tax was first tax imposed on a domestic product by newly formed federal government it became law in 1791 and was intended to generate revenue for war debt incurred during revolutionary war tax applied to all distilled spirits but american whiskey was by far country s most popular distilled beverage in 18th century so excise became widely known as a whiskey tax farmers of western frontier were accustomed to distilling their surplus rye barley wheat corn or fermented grain mixtures to make whiskey these farmers resisted tax in these regions whiskey often served as a medium of exchange many of resisters were war veterans who believed that they were fighting for principles of american revolution in particular against taxation without local representation while federal government maintained that taxes were legal expression of congressional taxation powers throughout western pennsylvania counties protesters used violence and intimidation to prevent federal officials from collecting tax resistance came to a climax in july 1794 when a u s marshal arrived in western pennsylvania to serve writs to distillers who had not paid excise alarm was raised and more than 500 armed men attacked fortified home of tax inspector general john neville washington responded by sending peace commissioners to western pennsylvania to negotiate with rebels while at same time calling on governors to send a militia force to enforce tax washington himself rode at head of an army to suppress insurgency with 13 000 militiamen provided by governors of virginia maryland new jersey and pennsylvania rebels all went home before arrival of army and there was no confrontation about 20 men were arrested but all were later acquitted or pardoned most distillers in nearby kentucky were found to be all but impossible to tax in next six years over 175 distillers from kentucky were convicted of violating tax law rorabaugh w j alcoholic

remained difficult to collect events contributed to formation of political parties in united states a process already under way whiskey tax was repealed in early 1800s during jefferson administration

1789 following ratification of united states constitution previous central government under articles of confederation had been unable to levy taxes it had borrowed money to meet expenses and fund revolutionary war accumulating 54 million in debt state governments had amassed an additional 25 million in debt chernow 297 secretary of treasury alexander hamilton sought to use this debt to create a financial system that would promote american prosperity and national unity in his report on public credit he urged congress to consolidate state and national debts into a single debt that would be funded by federal government congress approved these measures in june and july 1790 chernow 327 30 a source of government revenue was needed to pay respectable amount due to previous bondholders to whom debt was owed by december 1790 hamilton believed that import duties which were government s primary source of revenue had been raised as high as feasible chernow 341 he therefore promoted passage of an excise tax on domestically produced distilled spirits this was to be first tax levied by national government on a domestic product hogeland 27 whiskey was by far most popular distilled beverage in late 18th century america so excise became known as whiskey tax taxes were politically unpopular and hamilton believed that whiskey excise was a luxury tax and would be least objectionable tax that government could levy chernow 342 43 hogeland 63 in this he had support of some social reformers who hoped that a sin tax would raise public awareness about harmful effects of alcohol slaughter 100 whiskey excise act sometimes known as whiskey act became law in march 1791 slaughter 105 hogeland 64 george washington defined revenue districts appointed revenue supervisors and inspectors and set their pay in november 1791 american state papers finance volume 1 110 western grievances population of western pennsylvania was 17 000 in 1790 among farmers in region whiskey excise was immediately controversial with many people on frontier arguing that it unfairly targeted westerners slaughter 97 whiskey was a popular drink and farmers often supplemented their incomes by operating small stills hogeland 66 farmers living west of appalachian mountains distilled their excess grain into whiskey which was easier and more profitable to transport over mountains than more cumbersome grain a whiskey tax would make western farmers less competitive with eastern grain producers hogeland 68 additionally cash was always in short supply on frontier so whiskey often served as a medium of exchange for poorer people who were paid in whiskey excise was essentially an income tax that wealthier easterners did not pay hogeland 67 holt 30 small scale farmers also protested that hamilton s excise effectively gave unfair tax breaks to large distillers most of whom were based in east there were two methods of paying whiskey excise paying a flat fee or paying by gallon large distillers produced whiskey in volume and could afford flat fee more efficient they became less tax per gallon they would pay as low as 6 cents according to hamilton western farmers who owned small stills did not usually operate them year round at full capacity so they ended up paying a higher tax per gallon 9 cents which made them less competitive slaughter 147 49 hogeland 68 70 regressive nature of tax was further compounded by an additional factor whiskey sold for considerably less on cash poor western frontier than in wealthier and more populous east this meant that even if all distillers had been required to pay same amount of tax per gallon small scale frontier distillers would still have to remit a considerably larger proportion of their product s value than larger eastern distillers small scale distillers believed that hamilton deliberately designed tax to ruin them and promote big business a view endorsed by some historians hogeland 68 69 holt 30 however historian thomas slaughter argued that a conspiracy of this sort is difficult to document slaughter 148 whether by design or not large distillers recognized advantage that excise gave them and they supported it slaughter 148 hogeland 69 other aspects of excise law also caused concern law required all stills to be registered and those cited for failure to pay tax had to appear in distant federal rather than local courts only federal courthouse was in philadelphia some 300 miles away from small frontier settlement of pittsburgh from beginning federal government had little success in collecting whiskey tax along frontier many small western distillers simply refused to pay tax federal revenue officers and local residents who assisted them bore brunt of protester s ire tax rebels harassed several whiskey tax collectors and threatened or beat those who offered them office space or housing as a result many western counties never had a resident federal tax official in addition to whiskey tax westerners had a number of other grievances with national government chief among which was perception that government was not adequately protecting residents living in western frontier northwest indian war was going badly for united states with major losses in 1791 furthermore westerners were prohibited by spain which then owned louisiana from using mississippi river for commercial navigation until these issues were addressed westerners felt that government was ignoring their security and economic welfare adding whiskey excise to these existing grievances only increased tensions on frontier slaughter 108 resistance many residents of western frontier petitioned against passage of whiskey excise when that failed some western pennsylvanians organized extralegal conventions to advocate repeal of law slaughter 110 opposition to tax was particularly prevalent in four southwestern counties allegheny fayette washington and westmoreland slaughter 206 a preliminary meeting held on july 27 1791 at redstone old fort in fayette county called for selection of delegates to a more formal assembly which convened in pittsburgh in early september 1791 pittsburgh convention was dominated by moderates such as hugh henry brackenridge who hoped to prevent outbreak of violence hogeland 23 25 slaughter 113 convention sent a petition for redress of grievances to pennsylvania assembly and u s house of representatives both located in philadelphia hogeland 24 as a result of this and other petitions excise law was modified in may 1792 changes included a 1 cent reduction in tax that was advocated by william findley a congressman from western pennsylvania but new excise law was still unsatisfactory to many westerners hogeland 114 15 thumb 300px left famous whiskey insurrection in pennsylvania an

by officials to serve court warrants to johnson s attackers was whipped tarred and feathered hogeland 103 04 because of these and other violent attacks tax went uncollected in 1791 and early 1792 slaughter 114 attackers modeled their actions on protests of american revolution supporters of excise argued that there was a difference between taxation without representation in colonial america and a tax laid by elected representatives of american people slaughter 103 older accounts of whiskey rebellion portrayed it as being confined to western pennsylvania yet there was opposition to whiskey tax in western counties of every other state in appalachia maryland virginia north carolina south carolina and georgia mary k tachau a new look at whiskey rebellion in boyd whiskey rebellion past and present perspectives 97 118 whiskey tax went uncollected throughout frontier state of kentucky where no one could be convinced to enforce law or prosecute evaders slaughter 117 in 1792 hamilton advocated military action to suppress violent resistance in western north carolina but attorney general edmund randolph argued that there was insufficient evidence to legally justify such a reaction slaughter 119 hogeland 124 in august 1792 a second convention was held in pittsburgh to discuss resistance to whiskey tax this meeting was more radical than first convention moderates such as brackenridge and findley were not in attendance future secretary of treasury albert gallatin was one moderate who did attend to his later regret hogeland 122 23 a militant group known as mingo creek association dominated convention and issued radical demands as some of them had done in american revolution they raised liberty poles formed committees of correspondence and took control of local militia they created an extralegal court and discouraged lawsuits for debt collection and foreclosures hogeland 117 19 122 23 hamilton regarded second pittsburgh convention as a serious threat to operation of laws of federal government in september 1792 he sent pennsylvania tax official george clymer to western pennsylvania to investigate clymer only increased tensions with a clumsy attempt at traveling in disguise and attempting to intimidate local officials his somewhat exaggerated report greatly influenced decisions made by washington administration slaughter 125 27 washington and hamilton viewed resistance to federal laws in pennsylvania as particularly embarrassing since national capital was then located in same state on his own initiative hamilton drafted a presidential proclamation denouncing resistance to excise laws and submitted it to attorney general randolph who toned down some of language washington signed proclamation on september 15 1792 and it was published as a broadside and printed in many newspapers slaughter 119 23 federal tax inspector for western pennsylvania general john neville was determined to enforce excise law slaughter 151 53 he was a prominent politician and wealthy planter and also a large scale distiller he had initially opposed whiskey tax but subsequently changed his mind a reversal that angered some western pennsylvanians hogeland 97 102 in august 1792 neville rented a room in pittsburgh for his tax office but landlord turned him out after being threatened with violence by mingo creek association hogeland 119 24 from this point on tax collectors were not only people targeted in pennsylvania those who cooperated with federal tax officials also faced harassment anonymous notes and newspaper articles signed by tom tinker threatened those who complied with whiskey tax those who failed to heed warnings might have their barns burned or their stills destroyed hogeland 130 31 resistance to excise tax continued through 1793 in frontier counties of appalachia opposition remained especially strident in western pennsylvania slaughter 151 in june neville was burned in effigy by a crowd of about 100 people in washington county slaughter 150 on night of november 22 1793 men broke into home of tax collector benjamin wells in fayette county wells was like neville one of wealthier men in region slaughter 153 at gunpoint intruders forced him to surrender his commission president washington offered a reward for arrest of assailants to no avail slaughter 165 insurrection thumb in his 1796 book congressman william findley argued that alexander hamilton had deliberately provoked whiskey rebellion resistance came to a climax in 1794 in may of that year federal district attorney william rawle issued subpoenas for more than 60 distillers in pennsylvania who had not paid excise tax slaughter 177 cooke 328 under law then in effect distillers who received these writs would be obligated to travel to philadelphia to appear in federal court for farmers on western frontier such a journey was expensive time consuming and beyond their means hogeland 142 at urging of william findley congress modified this law on june 5 1794 allowing excise trials to be held in local state courts slaughter 170 but by that time u s marshal david lenox had already been sent to serve writs summoning delinquent distillers to philadelphia attorney general william bradford later maintained that writs were meant to compel compliance with law and that government did not actually intend to hold trials in philadelphia slaughter 182 timing of these events later proved to be controversial findley was a bitter political foe of hamilton and he maintained in his book on insurrection that treasury secretary had deliberately provoked uprising by issuing subpoenas just before law was made less onerous cooke 321 in 1963 historian jacob cooke an editor of hamilton s papers regarded this charge as preposterous calling it a conspiracy thesis that overstated hamilton s control of federal government cooke 321 22 in 1986 historian thomas slaughter argued that outbreak of insurrection at this moment was due to a string of ironic coincidences although question about motives must always remain slaughter 183 in 2006 william hogeland argued that hamilton bradford and rawle intentionally pursued a course of action that would provoke kind of violence that would justify federal military suppression hogeland 124 according to hogeland hamilton had been working towards this moment since newburgh crisis in 1783 where he conceived of using military force to crush popular resistance to direct taxation for purpose of promoting national unity and enriching creditor class at expense of common taxpayers historian s e morison believed that hamilton in general wished to enforce excise law more as a measure of social discipline than as a source of revenue s e morison oxford history of united states 1783 1917 london oxford university press 1927 182 battle of bower hill federal marshal lenox delivered most of writs without incident on july 15 he was joined on his rounds by general neville who had offered to act as his guide in allegheny county slaughter 177 that evening warning shots were fired at men at miller farm about south of pittsburgh neville returned home while lenox retreated to pittsburgh hogeland 146 on july 16 at least 30 mingo creek militiamen surrounded neville s fortified home of bower hill number of militiamen in first attack on bower hill varies in contemporary accounts hogeland 268 they demanded surrender of federal marshal whom they believed to be inside neville responded by firing a gunshot that mortally wounded oliver miller one of rebels slaughter 179 hogeland 147 48 rebels opened fire but were unable to dislodge neville who had his slaves help to defend house slaughter 3 rebels retreated to nearby couch s fort to gather reinforcements next day rebels returned to bower hill their force had swelled to nearly 600 men now commanded by major james mcfarlane a veteran of revolutionary war hogeland 150 51 neville had also received reinforcements 10 u s army soldiers from pittsburgh under command of major abraham kirkpatrick neville s brother in law slaughter 179 hogeland 152 before rebel force arrived kirkpatrick had neville leave house and hide in a nearby ravine david lenox and general neville s son presley neville also returned to area though they could not get into house and were captured by rebels hogeland 153 following some fruitless negotiations women and children were allowed to leave house and then both sides began firing after about an hour mcfarlane called a ceasefire according to some a white flag had been waved in house as mcfarlane stepped into open a shot rang out from house and he fell mortally wounded enraged rebels then set fire to house including slave quarters and kirkpatrick surrendered hogeland 153 54 slaughter 3 179 80 number of casualties at bower hill is unclear mcfarlane and one or two other militiamen were killed one u s soldier may have died from wounds received in fight slaughter 180 rebels

opponent of whiskey tax who tried to prevent violent resistance mcfarlane was given a hero s funeral on july 18 his murder as rebels saw it further radicalized countryside slaughter 181 83 moderates such as brackenridge were hard pressed to restrain populace radical leaders emerged such as david bradford urging violent resistance on july 26 a group headed by bradford robbed u s mail as it left pittsburgh hoping to discover who in that town opposed them and finding several letters that condemned rebels bradford and his band called for a military assembly to meet at braddock s field about east of pittsburgh slaughter 183 85 on august 1 about 7 000 people gathered at braddock s field slaughter 186 hogeland 172 crowd consisted primarily of poor people who owned no land and most did not own whiskey stills furor over whiskey excise had unleashed anger about other economic grievances by this time victims of violence were often wealthy property owners who had no connection to whiskey tax slaughter 186 87 some of most radical protesters wanted to march on pittsburgh which they called sodom loot homes of wealthy and then burn town to ground slaughter 187 others wanted to attack fort fayette there was praise for french revolution and calls for bringing guillotine to america david bradford it was said was comparing himself to robespierre a leader of french reign of terror slaughter 188 89 hogeland 169 at braddock s field there was talk of declaring independence from united states and of joining with spain or great britain radicals flew a specially designed flag that proclaimed their independence flag had six stripes one for each county represented at gathering pennsylvania counties of allegheny bedford fayette washington and westmoreland and virginia s ohio county holt 10 holt writes that earlier historians had misidentified six counties represented by flag pittsburgh citizens helped to defuse threat by banishing three men whose intercepted letters had given offense to rebels and by sending a delegation to braddock s field that expressed support for gathering slaughter 185 brackenridge prevailed upon crowd to limit protest to a defiant march through town in pittsburgh major kirkpatrick s barns were burned but nothing else slaughter 187 88 hogeland 170 77 meeting at whiskey point a convention was held on august 14 of 226 whiskey rebels from six counties held at parkison s ferry now known as whiskey point in present day monongahela convention considered resolutions which were drafted by brackenridge gallatin david bradford and an eccentric preacher named herman husband a delegate from bedford county husband was a well known local figure and a radical champion of democracy who had taken part in regulator movement in north carolina 25 years earlier holt 54 57 parkison s ferry convention also appointed a committee to meet with peace commissioners who had been sent west by president washington slaughter 188 89 there gallatin presented an eloquent speech in favor of peace and against proposals from bradford to further revolt federal response president washington was confronted with what appeared to be an armed insurrection in western pennsylvania and he proceeded cautiously while determined to maintain governmental authority he did not want to alienate public opinion so he asked his cabinet for written opinions about how to deal with crisis cabinet recommended use of force except for secretary of state edmund randolph who urged reconciliation elkins mckitrick 479 washington did both he sent commissioners to meet with rebels while raising a militia army washington privately doubted that commissioners could accomplish anything and believed that a military expedition would be needed to suppress further violence slaughter 197 99 for this reason historians have sometimes charged that peace commission was sent only for sake of appearances and that use of force was never in doubt slaughter 199 holt 11 historians stanley elkins and eric mckitrick argued that military expedition was itself a part of reconciliation process since a show of overwhelming force would make further violence less likely elkins mckitrick 481 meanwhile hamilton began publishing essays under name of tully in philadelphia newspapers denouncing mob violence in western pennsylvania and advocating military action democratic republican societies had been formed throughout country and washington and hamilton believed that they were source of civic unrest historians are not yet agreed on exact role of societies in whiskey rebellion wrote

beyond control of local authorities on august 4 1794 justice james wilson delivered his opinion that western pennsylvania was in a state of rebellion slaughter 192 93 196 elkins mckitrick 479 on august 7 washington issued a presidential proclamation announcing with deepest regret that militia would be called out to suppress rebellion he commanded insurgents in western pennsylvania to disperse by september 1 slaughter 196 negotiations in early august 1794 washington dispatched three commissioners to west all of them pennsylvanians attorney general william bradford justice jasper yeates of pennsylvania supreme court and senator james ross beginning on august 21 commissioners met with a committee of westerners that included brackenridge and gallatin government commissioners told committee that it must unanimously agree to renounce violence and submit to u s laws and that a popular referendum must be held to determine if local people supported decision those who agreed to these terms would be given amnesty from further prosecution slaughter 199 200 hogeland 199 committee was divided between radicals and moderates and narrowly passed a resolution agreeing to submit to government s terms popular referendum was held on september 11 and also produced mixed results some townships overwhelmingly supported submitting to u s law but opposition to government remained strong in areas where poor and landless people predominated slaughter 203 on september 24 1794 washington received a recommendation from commissioners that in their judgment it was necessary that civil authority should be aided by a military force in order to secure a due execution of laws on september 25 washington issued a proclamation summoning new jersey pennsylvania maryland and virginia militias into service and warned that anyone who aided insurgents did so at their own peril hogeland 205 06 trend was towards submission however and westerners dispatched representatives william findley and david redick to meet with washington and to halt progress of oncoming army washington and hamilton declined arguing that violence was likely to re emerge if army turned back militia expedition under authority of recently passed federal militia law state militias were called up by governors of new jersey maryland virginia and pennsylvania federalized militia force of 12 950 men was a large army by american standards of time comparable to washington s armies during revolution chernow 475 76 hogeland 189 relatively few men volunteered for militia service so a draft was used to fill out ranks draft evasion was widespread and conscription efforts resulted in protests and riots even in eastern areas three counties in eastern virginia were scenes of armed draft resistance in maryland governor thomas sim lee sent 800 men to quash an anti draft riot in hagerstown about 150 people were arrested slaughter 210 14 thumb photo of albert gallatin who spoke publicly to rebel groups about need for moderation liberty poles were raised in various places as militia was recruited worrying federal officials a liberty pole was raised in carlisle pennsylvania on september 11 1794 slaughter 208 federalized militia arrived in that town later that month and rounded up suspected pole raisers two civilians were killed in these operations on september 29 an unarmed boy was shot by an officer whose pistol accidentally fired two days later an itinerant person was bayoneted to death by a soldier while resisting arrest man had tried to wrest rifle from soldier he confronted it is possible he had been a member of a 500 strong irish work crew nearby who were digging a canal into at least one of that work gang s members protested killing so vigorously that he was put under guard president washington ordered arrest of two soldiers and had them turned over to civilian authorities a state judge determined that deaths had been accidental and soldiers were released slaughter 205

first and only time a sitting american president led troops in field ellis his excellency george washington 225 along way he traveled to reading pennsylvania on his way to meet up with rest of militia

western representatives in bedford pennsylvania on october 9 before going to fort cumberland in maryland to review southern wing of army slaughter 215 16 he was convinced that federalized militia would meet little resistance and he placed army under command of virginia governor henry harry lee a hero of revolutionary war washington returned to philadelphia hamilton remained with army as civilian adviser slaughter 216 daniel morgan victor of battle of cowpens during american revolution was called up to lead a force to suppress protest it was at this time 1794 that morgan was promoted

without a shot being fired after uprising had been suppressed morgan commanded remnant of army that remained until 1795 in pennsylvania some 1 200 militiamen one of whom was meriwether lewis higginbotham pp 193 98 aftermath insurrection collapsed as federal army marched west into western pennsylvania in october 1794 some of most prominent leaders of insurrection such as david bradford fled westward to safety it took six months for those who were charged to be tried most were acquitted due to mistaken identity unreliable testimony and lack of witnesses only two convicted of treason and sentenced to hang were john mitchell and philip wigle they were later pardoned by washington slaughter 219 immediately before arrests as many as 2 000 of rebels had fled into mountains beyond reach of militia it was a great disappointment to hamilton who had hoped to bring rebel leaders such as david bradford to trial in philadelphia and possibly see them hanged for treason instead when militia at last turned back out of all suspects they had seized a mere twenty were selected to serve as examples they were at worst bit players in uprising but they were better than nothing captured participants and federal militia arrived in philadelphia on christmas day some artillery was fired and church bells were heard as a huge throng lined broad street to cheer troops and mock rebels

revenue officers served a writ on william miller shots were fired but officers were not injured later william was pardoned washington administration s suppression of whiskey rebellion met with widespread popular approval elkins mckitrick 481 84 episode demonstrated that new national government had willingness and ability to suppress violent resistance to its laws it was therefore viewed by washington administration as a success a view that has generally been endorsed by historians boyd popular rights 78 washington administration and its supporters usually did not mention however that whiskey excise remained difficult to collect and that many westerners continued to refuse to pay tax events contributed to formation of political parties in united states a process already underway slaughter 221 boyd popular rights 80 whiskey tax was repealed after thomas jefferson s republican party came to power in 1801 which opposed federalist party of hamilton and washington hogeland 242 rebellion raised question of what kinds of protests were permissible under new constitution legal historian christian g fritz argued that there was not yet a consensus about sovereignty in united states even after ratification of constitution federalists believed that government was sovereign because it had been established by people radical protest actions were permissible during american revolution but were no longer legitimate in their thinking but whiskey rebels and their defenders believed that revolution had established people as a collective sovereign and people had collective right to change or challenge government through extra constitutional means historian steven boyd argued that suppression of whiskey rebellion prompted anti federalist westerners to finally accept constitution and to seek change by voting for republicans rather than resisting government federalists for their part came to accept public s role in governance and no longer challenged freedom of assembly and right to petition boyd popular rights 80 83 in popular culture 100px left thumb susanna rowson soon after whiskey rebellion actress playwright susanna rowson wrote a stage musical about
