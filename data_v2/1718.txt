hell toupee was worked on by assistant director chris clements moe s death scene was originally more violent but it was toned down at request of mike scully animators looked forward to working on

warren martyn and adrian wood wrote another collection of horrors of varying degrees of wit itchy and scratchy one is by far best and starship poopers is only really amusing once jerry springer segment begins colin jacobson of dvd movie guide gave episode a positive review saying series usually rises to occasion of its halloween episodes and ix doesn t disappoint each of three stories satisfies as they offer a lot of clever amusing moments toupee is probably best though as it s most creative of bunch while funny other two can be a bit predictable kay mcfadden of seattle times wrote that episode is certainly not on a par with that all time doppelganger classic treehouse of horror vii still no 9 s dialogue is sharp and there s reassuring continuity to such beloved institutions as
