columbia canada on june 12 2002 and took at least twenty days king had no involvement in this version after another film adaptation rage carrie 2 1999 disappointed him it was produced by mgm television and trilogy entertainment group based on a screenplay by bryan fuller network originally wanted a movie of week but studio wanted to capitalize on production so it was planned as a backdoor pilot for a potential television series although producers tried to be faithful to king s novel in order to allow for a continuation of story ending was changed so that carrie remained alive fuller had earlier considered idea of giving carrie s abilities to sue or creation of another carrie but he deemed killing a character who is victimized her entire life as really cruel another adaptation was developed with intention of creating a sub plot for series featuring jasmine guy as a paranormal investigator but it was ultimately scrapped envisaged as a remake of brian de palma s 1976 film fuller aimed to give it a little more of an epic feel rather than fairy tale feeling fuller ascribed to original he also thought his version could add a little more depth with some scope to characters and situation that you didn t have in original writer said bettis portrayal of role was meant to give carrie a more edgy characterization instead of victim feeling he believed sissy spacek gave to her in de palma s film in his words fuller sought to update film s 1970s setting to a contemporary one aware that high school violence in particular has changed since then because fuller felt columbine high school massacre was still on people s recent memory he was careful in addressing film s teenage vigilante theme release carrie was first broadcast in united states on nbc at 8 pm est on november 4

april 14 2015 a region a disc it featured english only subtitles and contained a new audio commentary with director david carson and cinematographer victor goss reception several critics questioned necessity of a new carrie considering a remake of original classic to be unneeded peoples tom summarized it as a pointless remake some reviewers considered it to be excessively derivative of de palma s film and others assessed it unfavorably in comparison to 1976 film steve johnson from chicago tribune disagreed arguing that flashback structure make s it more than just a rehash of first film it also elicited praise from ron wertheimer who wrote for new york times that flashbacks and new ending were creative ideas john levesque of seattle post intelligencer and anthony arrigo of dread central however felt former alteration was not an improvement calling conclusion so undramatic and undeniably weak respectively thumb left 180px while film was generally poorly received by critics angela bettis performance was highly lauded while johnson considered film a respectable piece of work owing to an intelligent script that developed all of king s themes wertheimer classified it negatively within generic made for television standard ian jane of dvd talk opined carrie was decent enough for limitations of a tv film and arrigo said lack of cinematic quality reflected television standards of 2000s although wertheimer claimed that film s drawbacks were not simply caused by medium he did make criticism that prom scenes were sapped by commercial breaks filmmakers he argued should have opted for a shorter sequence sf gates edward also criticized film s overall length especially in regard to prom scene as he considered dramatic impact was not enhanced phil gallo of variety likewise felt some scenes were extended just to fit time needed for next break randy miller iii of dvd talk said home media release evidenced gaps in action caused by commercials film s special effects were heavily criticized fuller himself called effects cheap levesque and gallo found their usage to be excessive and former said film suddenly shifts into a special effects bonanza another common complaint was that film was not scary which lead levesque to write that new carrie doesn t even fit category of scary movie genre gallo found that it deviated from horror in favor of prurient side routes mentioning sofer s acting as well as locker room and post coital scenes johnson made a similar remark on sexual content most of praise film received was directed towards its cast although wertheimer and arrigo were critical about acting while clarkson mcclure and keith were praised by more than one reviewer bettis performance was especially praised linda stasi of new york post was one of those who thought a remake was unnecessary so she had low expectations for film stasi however concluded she had been completely mistaken she was positively surprised by acting and went so far as to state that bettis should win an emmy for her performance wertheimer remarked that bettis expressed character s emotions well and lamented that film affords ms bettis few opportunities for such genuine acting at 29th saturn awards carrie was nominated for best single television presentation but winner was taken it was also nominated for 2003 american society of cinematographers awards in movie of week or pilot network category csi miamis cross jurisdictions won it aftermath production of television series was subordinated to film s audience ratings although it obtained strong numbers according to variety series was never produced fuller and bettis were expected to reprise their roles and writer had a concept in mind he hoped to create a series in which carrie had to deal with remorse and responsibility for killing several people series would also feature carrie and sue on a journey to help other people with telekinetic powers fuller wrote outline for a second episode but nbc had no interest on it so mgm ended their deal in fuller s opinion network n ever intended to do a series they were just playing studio another remake based on carrie novel and 1976 film was released in 2013
