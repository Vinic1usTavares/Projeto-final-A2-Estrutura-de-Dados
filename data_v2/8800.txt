defendant in custody is not notified of their rights via a miranda warning any confession they give may not be admissible in court miranda warning legal information institute cornell university law

motion north carolina supreme court affirmed with a divided panel ing to extend test for custody to include consideration of age of an individual subjected to questioning by police supreme court granted certiorari to determine whether miranda custody analysis includes consideration of a juvenile suspect s age american civil liberties union american bar association and national association of criminal defense lawyers were among organizations that filed amicus briefs in support of j d b attorneys general of 30 states and 2 unincorporated territories filed an amicus brief in support of north carolina published supreme court briefs march 2011 american bar association march 11 2011 accessed june 21 2011 opinion of court thumb upright justice sotomayor authored court s opinion associate justice sonia sotomayor wrote opinion for court court held that a child s age properly informs miranda custody analysis relevancy of age court underscored dangers of not applying age to custody analysis writing to hold that a child s age is never relevant to whether a suspect has been taken into custody and thus to ignore very real differences between children and adults would be to deny children full scope of procedural safeguards that miranda guarantees to adults opinion cited stansbury v california where court held that a child s age would have affected how a reasonable person in suspect s position would perceive his or her freedom to leave yarborough v alvarado was also cited where court wrote that a child s age generates commonsense conclusions about behavior and perception finally court pointed out that law reflects idea that a child s judgment is not same as an adult s in form of legal disqualifications on children as a class e g limitations on a child s ability to marry without parental consent miranda as an objective test court placed emphasis on fact that age is an objective circumstance and including it in a custody analysis does not place an undue burden on police court has repeatedly emphasized that custody analysis is an objective test in thompson v keohane court wrote that court wrote that consideration of age involved no consideration of specific mindset of individual rather court held that age is an objective factor that affects how a reasonable person would perceive his or her freedom to leave dissent thumb upright justice alito authored opinion for dissent associate justice samuel alito wrote a dissenting opinion for four justices primary objection of dissent was that ruling of majority was inconsistent with one of main justifications for miranda rule need for a clear rule that is easily applied in all cases alito argued decision shifted custody determination from a simple test to an inquiry that must account for individualized characteristics alito emphasized that age is not only characteristic that may affect a subject under interrogation and that in future cases court will be tasked with adding additional characteristics to custody determination or by arbitrarily distinguishing a suspect s age from other personal characteristics reception and subsequent developments case attracted differing opinions from legal community steven professor at northwestern university school of law characterized ruling as huge noting that police would no longer be able to choose to question young suspects at a school in order to avoid giving a miranda warning a practice he characterized as a loophole sanger david e high court age must be considered in interrogation national public radio june 16 2011 accessed june 17 2011 juvenile law center praised ruling as a resounding statement in line with settled research and basic common sense barnes robert supreme court children are different when it comes to miranda warning against self incrimination washington post june 16 2011 accessed june 17 2011 steven shapiro legal director of aclu concurred stating that we have to ensure that students rights are protected and decision is a step in that direction other analysts were troubled that decision would leave a murky landscape for law enforcement john charles thomas representing national district attorneys association concluded pressure is basically to err on side of caution to give miranda warning almost every time professor stephen of george washington university agreed that ruling would pressure police to adopt a strategy of when in doubt give miranda warnings but also opined that it would make little practical difference to young people facing police questioning reality is that even with miranda warnings it s doubtful that young people understand exactly what it all means and understand their choices and so in long run i doubt that there will be many fewer confessions because of this
