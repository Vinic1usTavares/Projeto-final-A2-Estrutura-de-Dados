able to use as 1989 wore on prost continually claimed his honda v10s were not producing same amount of power as those in senna s car it actually got to point where honda f1 boss osamu goto felt compelled to speak to specialist british media on matter he claimed that senna s foot tapping style with accelerator helped keep e s revs up in engine s mid range where most of power was while prost s smoother style dropped engines into low revs where they had a pick up problem apparently talk was convincing until most of those present noticed goto continually called them ayrton and prost
