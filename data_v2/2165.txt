hayes membership had previously kept show s creators from writing a full episode which parodies scientology however decision to ultimately produce a south park episode satirizing scientology was partially inspired by friendship show s creators have with penn jillette jillette was originally planning to do an episode of bullshit based on scientology but showtime prohibited him from doing so to avoid possibility of legal action from church of scientology parker commented we re going that s fucked up and hearing other people say you can t do that you can only say you can t do that so many times to matt and me before we re gonna do it finally we just had to tell isaac dude we totally love working with you and this is nothing personal it s just we re south park and if we don t do this we re belittling everything else we ve ripped on although some questions were raised prior to episode s screening about whether it was wise to take swipes at cruise and scientology comedy central declared that it supported stone and parker a comedy central spokesman told radar magazine in november 2005 that they are free and have been to satirize anybody and anything they want to they ve made fun of mtv they ve made fun of viacom they ve made fun of comedy central and we ve never interfered with them during production on episode investigative journalist mark ebner served as a consultant to matt stone and trey parker ebner had previously authored new york times best seller hollywood interrupted which includes an analysis of church of scientology and its effects on culture in hollywood and has a chapter on tom cruise and john travolta s relationship to scientology on official comedy central website for south park episode it is asserted that section of trapped in closet that explains scientology s portrayal and beliefs was not exaggerated nothing about what you see here is exaggerated in slightest seriously title is a reference to r kelly song of same name and a depiction of r kelly appears in episode to sing a parody of it controversy isaac hayes departure thumb isaac hayes was voice of chef on south park on march 13 2006 hayes a scientologist himself announced that he was quitting show because of series treatment of religion saying there is a place in this world for satire but there is a time when satire ends and intolerance and bigotry towards religious beliefs of others begins religious beliefs are sacred to people and at all times should be respected and honored as a civil rights activist of past 40 years i cannot support a show that those beliefs and practices guardian observed that show had mocked most other religions but that he drew line at scientology later in an interview on cnn s showbiz tonight hayes added he did not see episode itself but was told about it in a separate interview he reportedly said regarding parker and stone guys you have it all wrong we re not like that i know that s your thing but get your information correct because somebody might believe that shit you know but i understand what they re doing i told them to take a couple of scientology courses and understand what we do responding to hayes departure stone asserted that this is 100 percent having to do with his faith of scientology he has no problem and he s cashed plenty of checks with our show making fun of christians according to stone neither he nor trey parker had heard a peep out of isaac in any way until we did scientology he wants a different standard for religions other than his own and to me that is where intolerance and bigotry begin stone commented that in 10 years and over 150 episodes of south park isaac never had a problem with show making fun of christians muslims mormons and jews he got a sudden case of religious sensitivity when it was his religion featured on show to bring civil rights struggle into this is just a non sequitur of course we will release isaac from his contract and we wish him well according to a later commentary by stone prior to episode s screening hayes had asked south park creators to have comedy central pull episode before it aired and not include it in series dvd which they refused there were many conflicting stories as to exact nature of hayes departure additional reasons given by hayes ten months after departure include they didn t pay me enough and they weren t that nice in late 2007 reports emerged claiming that hayes was in no condition to stay because of a stroke he suffered in january according to a fox news article hayes agent christina kimball herself a practicing scientologist was source of statements that hayes quit south park stone lent support to this view in a 2007 interview with rolling stone commenting that there are reports that isaac had a stroke and scientology quit show for him and i believe it it was a brutal up close personal thing with isaac if you look at timeline something doesn t add up due to absence of hayes chef was voiced in return of
