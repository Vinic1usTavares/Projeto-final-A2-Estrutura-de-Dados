hurricane fred was easternmost atlantic hurricane to form in tropics and first to move through cape verde since 1892 second hurricane and sixth named storm of 2015 atlantic hurricane season fred originated from a well defined tropical wave over west africa in late august 2015 once offshore wave moved northwestward within a favorable tropospheric environment and strengthened into a tropical storm on august 30 following day fred grew to a category 1 hurricane with peak winds of 85 mph 140 km h as it approached cape verde after passing boa vista and moving away from santo antao it entered a phase of steady weakening dropping below hurricane status by september 1 fred then turned to west northwest enduring increasingly hostile wind shear but maintained its status as a tropical cyclone despite repeated forecasts of imminent dissipation it fluctuated between minimal tropical storm and tropical depression strength through september 4 5 before curving sharply to north by september 6 fred s circulation pattern had diminished considerably and storm dissipated later that day under threat from hurricane all of cape verde was placed under a hurricane warning for first time in nation s history gale force winds battered much of barlavento region throughout august 31 downing trees and utility poles on easternmost islands of boa vista and sal fred leveled roofs and left villages without power or phone services for a few days about 70 percent of houses in povoacao velha suffered light to moderate damage across northernmost islands rainstorms flooded homes washed out roads and ruined farmland sao nicolau endured great losses of crops and livestock material damage across cape verde totaled us 2 5 million though rain s overall impact on agriculture was positive and replenishing swells from hurricane produced violent seas along west african shoreline destroying fishing villages and submerging swaths of residential areas in senegal between coasts of west africa and cape verde maritime incidents related to fred resulted in nine deaths meteorological history early on august 28 national hurricane center nhc began monitoring an unusually vigorous tropical wave an elongated area of low air pressure inland over west africa trailed by widespread cloudiness wave tracked toward open atlantic as it developed a broad cyclonic rotation within lower atmosphere near guinea s coastline disturbance veered toward northwest and entered ocean off conakry around 18 00 utc august 29 by that time nhc was predicting favorable conditions for development of a tropical cyclone within next 48 hours strong thunderstorms thrived overnight and consolidated near a well defined low pressure center around midnight august 30 satellite images and scatterometer data confirmed that a tropical depression with sustained winds of 35 mph 55 km h had formed about 300 miles 480 km west northwest of conakry although tropical cyclones in extreme eastern atlantic are typically propelled westward by high pressures from north atlantic subtropical ridge this depression took an atypical northwestward path along a breach in ridge from a previous disturbance its cyclonic structure steadily improved as a sharply curved rainband tightened around center resembling precursor to an eye at 06 00 utc on august 30 depression was upgraded to tropical storm fred while 390 mi 625 km east southeast of praia cape verde among four easternmost locations for a tropical storm to form since modern record keeping began in 1851 a steady trend of intensification ensued while fred moved through a region with ample tropical moisture light upper winds and above average sea surface temperatures storm developed a thick circular central dense overcast with good outflow and eye feature became well established at all levels of circulation based on these characteristics as well as satellite intensity estimates of 75 mph 120 km h winds fred was upgraded to a category 1 hurricane at 00 00 utc august 31 then centered 165 mi 270 km east southeast of sal cape verde it became easternmost tropical cyclone ever to attain hurricane status in tropical atlantic thumb right tropical storm fred with a well defined but largely convection free circulation on september 3 alt a satellite image depicts tropical cyclone over open waters as a spiral of patchy low level clouds devoid of strong thunderstorms a compact cyclone fred quickly reached its peak strength as a hurricane with a minimum central pressure of 986 mbar hpa 29 12 inhg and 85 mph 140 km h winds through rest of august 31 hurricane traversed barlavento islands of cape verde barely skirting southern coast of boa vista around 12 00 uc gradually decreasing in definition eye passed north of sao nicolau and then north northeast of santo antao over next 12 hours on september 1 drier air and stronger wind shear aloft dispersed convection around cyclone s core causing fred to diminish to a tropical storm weakened storm turned slightly toward west northwest over considerably cooler waters in response to high pressure rebuilding to its north through much of september 1 4 fred produced limited convective activity with intermittent flares of thunderstorms that were continuously blown away from center by strong upper winds despite adverse environment and storm s lack of stable convection fred maintained a robust spiral of low level clouds and gales during this period defying nhc s repeated forecasts of its dissipation at 12 00 utc on september 4 nhc downgraded fred to a tropical depression as its wind circulation waned though its winds briefly picked up back to tropical storm force next day fred continued as a depression with minimal convection throughout remainder of its existence concurrently a deep altitude disturbance a few hundred miles east of bermuda began to erode southern edge of high pressure ridge that fred had circumnavigated for most of its journey this changed steering pattern in region turning depression abruptly to north on september 6 over next hours fred became increasingly diffuse because of its progressively worsening surroundings it officially lost its status as a tropical cyclone at 18 00 utc on september 6 degenerating into a surface trough about 1 200 mi 1 950 km to southwest of azores before merging with disturbance off bermuda preparations

crew of 19 twelve members were rescued but remaining seven disappeared at sea and were presumed dead cape verde a tropical storm warning was issued for cape verde upon storm s formation as well as a hurricane watch in light of forecasts of additional intensification when fred showed definitive signs of strengthening alerts were replaced by a hurricane warning marking first occasion of a hurricane level advisory in nation s history on morning of august 31 cabo verde airlines suspended its flights from capital of praia to dakar all operations at airports of boa vista sal and sao vicente were halted when squalls began to spread across islands officials urged shipping interests on all islands to secure their vessels and remain in port a national music festival was canceled in porto novo on northernmost island of santo antao throughout cape verde hurricane fred displaced more than 50 families and caused cve 250 million 2 5 million in damage primarily to agricultural and private sectors of barlavento islands it was first hurricane to move through cape verde with a documented impact as well as nation s only record of onshore hurricane force winds although there were no casualties on land two fishermen navigating through storm never returned to port in boa vista and were presumed dead despite losses in crops and livestock in barlavento region rainfall from fred had a generally

restoration costs similar conditions occurred in parts of sal along island s southern shore fred s storm surge sunk or stranded dozens of vessels and destroyed island s main tourist pier in santa maria restoration efforts had not yet been completed by may 2017 about 1 5 years after hurricane delay led to concerns over island s precarious tourism reliant economy hotels restaurants and beach facilities were flooded and roads in town became impassable gusts leveled roof of a high school gym which had initially been set up as a storm shelter to 100 citizens elsewhere on island winds knocked out power to homes in and caused minor structural damage to sal international airport at height of storm floods forced nearly 130 people living in impoverished outskirts of terra boa and to relocate
