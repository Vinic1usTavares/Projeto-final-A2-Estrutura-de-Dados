thumb 300px hill farm with welsh black cattle agriculture in wales has in past been a major part of economy of wales a largely rural country that forms part of united kingdom wales is mountainous and has a mild wet climate this results in only a small proportion of land area being suitable for arable cropping but grass for grazing of livestock is present in abundance as a proportion of national economy importance of agriculture has become much reduced a high proportion of population now live in towns and cities in south of country and tourism has become an important form of income in countryside and on coast arable cropping is limited to flatter parts and elsewhere dairying and livestock farming predominate holdings in wales tend to be small and operated as family farms arable crops and horticulture are limited to southeastern wales welsh marches northeastern part of country coastal fringes and larger river valleys eighty percent of country is classified as being in a less favoured area dairying takes place on improved pasture in lowland areas and beef cattle and sheep are grazed on uplands and more marginal land much of land at higher elevations is extensive country and is grazed by hardy welsh mountain sheep that roam at will as with other parts of united kingdom farming has been under great pressure leading to declines in number of people employed on land amalgamation of holdings and an increase in part time farming farmhouses have been used for bed and breakfast or converted into self catering accommodation and farmers have diversified into tourism related and other activities agriculture in wales is heavily subsidised by european union s common agricultural policy and welsh government has introduced several schemes designed to encourage farming community to co operate in caring for their land in an environmentally sustainable way overview thumb hill farm in a less favoured area climate and topography of wales is such that much of land is unsuitable for arable cropping and livestock farming has traditionally been focus of agriculture wales is formed from an exposed mountainous region over in northwest of country encompassing much of what is now gwynedd and an upland area of acidic moorland between with a coastal strip of flatter but still undulating land this consists of vale of glamorgan monmouthshire welsh marches flintshire and denbighshire coastal plain of north wales island of anglesey coastal plain on cardigan bay and pembrokeshire and these are main arable cropping areas mild atlantic climate with predominantly westerly winds give country a high rainfall in uplands there may be or more and on coast thumb corn being combined near in welsh marches compared with other parts of united kingdom wales has smallest percentage of arable land 6 and a considerably smaller area of rough grazing and hill land than scotland 27 against 62 dairy industry is well developed in more favourable parts of country livestock is raised in upland areas with mountainous areas being used extensively for sheep farming there are of farmland in wales and eighty percent of country is classified as being in a less favoured area history between 400 and 800 ad after demise of roman empire in britain land was cleared of forest in wales implying an expansion of agriculture pryor 2011 p 211 in middle ages land was to some extent held collectively in south wales as in feudal england with villages surrounded by ridge and furrow open fields in contrast in north wales farmers living in same hamlet may have co operated to extent of sharing plough teams but land was held by individuals throughout middle ages sheep were less significant than hardy upland cattle welsh medieval land holdings however were disrupted by partible inheritance where all land was shared amongst all sons of a landowner creating small farms which often sank into poverty partible inheritance was abolished by parliament in 1542 pryor 2011 p 314 by early modern times feudal system of south wales collapsed and open fields were enclosed piecemeal by agreement between affected farmers leaving a countryside of independent farms in north farmers continued to live in hamlets which according to a 15th century account consisted of nine houses all making use of one plough team one kiln one churn one cat one cock and one herdsman pryor 2011 pp 360 361 main farm animal in lowlands remained cattle until 18th century in uplands sheep were kept and if any cereal was grown it was oats transhumance was practised people moving with their animals from a low lying farm in winter to an upland hafod farmhouse in summer transhumance declined through 18th century and collapsed at its end as land was enclosed both upland and lowland over 81 000 hectares of welsh common land was rapidly enclosed and attached to existing landholdings between 1793 and 1815 pryor 2011 pp 486 487 in 1801 population of wales was 587 thousand and most of these would have been living in rural areas and employed in agriculture by 1911 population had swelled to 2 4 million more than half of whom lived in glamorgan and monmouthshire where they were employed in mining steel and other industries there was a shift away from land with many dwellers in rural west emigrating in 1830s and 1840s and migrating to cities in second half of nineteenth century by 1911 agriculture was a minor industry in glamorgan and migrant labour from england was needed to help get in harvest rural craftsmen were also lost and their supply was replenished from depressed areas of southwestern england and by mass immigration from ireland thumb left welsh farm labourers sowing seed c 1940s much of land was in possession of large landowners and let out to tenant farmers in holdings of less than often with buildings in a poor state of repair tenants were too poor to pay higher rents so landowners were loath to make improvements such as land drainage in 1914 there were acres of permanent grassland and of corn in wales there were 86 000 horses used for agricultural purposes 807 000 head of cattle 237 000 pigs and 3 818 000 sheep in 2014 in wales there were 1 048 000 hectares under permanent grass a further 437 000 hectares were rough grassland 87 000 hectares were woodland and 239 000 hectares were arable land including temporary grassland number of horses for agricultural purposes are not mentioned in statistics but there were 290 000 dairy cows 214 000 other cattle 28 400 pigs and 9 739 000 sheep in country there were also 945 arable and horticultural holdings 1 753 dairy farms 12 650 beef and sheep farms 95 specialist pig units and 426 specialist poultry units types of farming arable crops grown in wales include wheat barley rapeseed oil and maize for fodder new potatoes from gower peninsula and pembrokeshire are available early in season horticulture is in long term decline with area of land under cultivation for potatoes vegetables soft fruit and orchards having halved since 1960s to about in general wales produces only about 20 of horticultural produce eaten in country organic farming now covers more than of wales horticultural products most grown organically include potatoes brassicas and salad crops welsh organic milk is marketed as well as organic cheeses and yoghurts thumb cows about to be milked near powys dairying is only economic in wales with a sufficiently large herd in a productive lowland area hand milking a few cows in a byre is a thing of past and nowadays herds are milked by machine in modern parlours two or three times a day milk passes by pipeline to cooler and is stored in a refrigerated bulk tank and collected by milk tanker daily in general cows graze outdoors in summer and spend their winter under cover often in cubicles bulk of their feed being silage milk prices barely cover costs of production margins are tight and there are fewer family run dairy farms each year in 2014 there were 1855 milk producers in wales an annual decline of 1 23 since 2011 but number of cows milked was nearly static at 223 000 lowland livestock farms concentrate largely on beef cattle and various breeds of sheep but there are also small units producing rarer animals including goats deer alpaca llama buffalo and ostrich as well as specialised pig and poultry farms most cattle are now housed in winter with their main feed being silage systems adopted include suckler cows where calf is reared by its mother and buying in and growing on of young beef cattle some of these are crossbred calves a by product of dairy industry where dairy cow is put to a charolais limousin angus hereford or similar beef bull many of these stores are later sold to other parts of united kingdom for fattening beef sector in wales is in slow decline with some 220 000 cattle over two years in wales in 2011 upland and hill farms provide grazing for hardy breeds of cattle like welsh blacks and for welsh mountain sheep cattle are normally housed in winter and may graze open hillside in summer trampling of their hooves helps control bracken and they feed on a wide range of vegetation and on coarse tufts of grass that sheep cannot tackle sheep are mostly hefted on unfenced open hillside all year round here they know their way around know where to graze at different times of year and where to shelter male lambs are used for meat and most of females are retained on hill as flock replacements aged ewes are moved to lower elevations and crossed with lowland rams to produce welsh mule ewes which are then used for breeding livestock thumb right welsh black suckler cows with their calves near penmaenpool in 2013 there were 1 094 644 cattle in wales including 223 208 dairy cows and 174 100 beef cows two years old or over total number of sheep and lambs was 9 460 692 of which 4 003 581 were ewes or replacement females retained for breeding besides this there were 24 890 pigs 10 475 goats and 50 381 horses poultry flock totalled 8 736 547 birds including 6 079 114 table birds broilers welsh black cattle are traditional breed of wales these hardy cows with horns and shaggy coats are able to thrive on poor quality pasture and moorland and can be used to provide both milk and beef large numbers were raised in wales and herded on foot to be fattened in england for selling in english markets on welsh farms they were used to pull ploughs and sometimes wagons during nineteenth century and were prized possessions by which a man s wealth could be estimated nowadays many have been crossed with charolais limousin or hereford bulls but pure bred herds can still be found in many parts of uplands thumb left welsh mountain sheep on grassland welsh mountain sheep is a hardy breed that can scrape a living from mountainous habitats where they spend whole year being adept at exploiting their environment they have local knowledge of their mountains and are left to their own devices being gathered once or twice a year originally often horned and various shades of brown or black they were often of poor conformation and bedraggled appearance more recently scientific breeding has improved them and they have been exported to many parts of world they form part of ancestry of various local breeds of sheep in wales lleyn sheep kerry hill badger faced welsh mule and beulah speckle faced in rural areas sheep are still an important part of life with local livestock shows and sheep dog trials taking place annually pigs are not one of main forms of livestock on welsh farms though there are some specialised units they used to be kept in small numbers on farms and by rural and urban cottagers in twentieth century many miners in south wales valleys still kept a pig in a backyard sty to be killed for production of fresh and salt pork bacon faggots and black pudding in 2011 there were 25 600 pigs in wales less than half number that were present a decade earlier agriculture today agriculture in wales is heavily subsidised by european union s common agricultural policy with farmers getting annual payments for area they farm a new scheme was announced in 2014 after a transitional period lasting until 2019 lowland farms will receive almost ps200 per hectare while farms in disadvantaged areas will receive total payment for wales between 2014 and 2020 will be ps1 870 million but some of this 15 will be used for rural development projects farm incomes have fallen over years as a result of cheap food policies in united kingdom lowering of world commodity prices and removal of production based subsidies particularly hard hit have been incomes of hill farms in wales which averaged ps15 000 in 2014 as against ps23 000 for lowland livestock farms and ps59 000 for dairy farms labour force has been dwindling for many years as a result of increased mechanisation and changes in farming practices fewer farmers are needed today because they are able to produce more food from their land hay is no longer main source of winter feed for livestock and has largely been replaced by silage particularly baled silage wrapped in film that can be handled mechanically this has reduced manpower needed on farms and there has been an increase of use by farmers of specialised contractors who provide services in silage making harvesting and fencing another problem facing welsh farmers is their distance from main distribution centres used by supermarkets which are mostly located near centres of population in england to increase their incomes many farmers have diversified average income from non farming business activities on farms in wales in 2013 2014 was ps4 900 tourism related activities accounted for much of this these included bed and breakfast accommodation self catering accommodation in redundant outbuildings or purpose built units bunkhouses for walkers and provision of food related services in cafes restaurants farm shops pick your own and farmer s markets indoor and outdoor leisure and recreational facilities are provided by some farmers including paint balling laser combat games pony trekking mountain biking and many other activities caravans camp sites and parking provide alternative uses for land and wind turbines can provide extra income from land still farmed in normal way thumb left footpath made available for use by public as part of a tir gofal scheme changes in farming practices especially drainage of land more intensive use of grassland and removal of hedgerows has affected wildlife in wales causes of decline are complex and factors such as climate change also play a part there have been various initiatives over years designed to help farmers diversify and farm in an environmentally friendly fashion tir cymen was a scheme that aimed to preserve traditional landscapes and it was followed by tir gofal which encouraged creation of ponds and wetlands planting of woodland and preservation of hedgerows both of these are now closed to new entrants most recent initiative is which is more objective than previous schemes offering financial support to participants with specific aims of combating climate change improving water management and maintaining and enhancing biodiversity references sources category agriculture in united kingdom category agriculture in wales category economy
