kaweah river is a river draining southern sierra nevada in tulare county california in united states fed primarily by high elevation snowmelt along great western divide kaweah begins as four forks in sequoia national park where watershed is noted for its alpine scenery and its dense concentrations of giant sequoias largest trees on earth it then flows in a southwest direction to lake kaweah only major reservoir on river and into san joaquin valley where it diverges into multiple channels across an alluvial plain around visalia with its middle fork headwaters starting at almost above sea level river has a vertical drop of nearly on its short run to san joaquin valley making it one of steepest river drainages in united states although main stem of kaweah is only long its total length including headwaters and lower branches is nearly lower course of river and its many distributaries including st john s river and mill creek form kaweah delta a productive agricultural region spanning more than before diversion of its waters for irrigation river flowed into tulare lake now dry terminal sink of a large endorheic basin in southern san joaquin valley also fed by kern and tule rivers and southern branches of kings river name kaweah commonly rendered as traditional pronunciation is comes from a native word possibly meaning crow cry yokuts and western mono are main native american groups in kaweah river basin which was explored by spanish in early 1800s and heavily logged after 1850s by american colonists before its upper reaches became part of sequoia national park in 1890 course thumb left hamilton lake and valhalla cliffs at headwaters of kaweah river kaweah river originates along great western divide a chain of peaks in middle of sequoia national park divide separates kaweah drainage from kern river drainage to east middle fork sometimes considered part of main stem flows southwest from confluence of lone pine creek and hamilton creek whose lake sources lie at or above in mount stewart area marble fork begins in a high plateau area known as tableland and drops over a glacial headwall forming tokopah falls before flowing west past lodgepole village and turning south two forks join at bottom of a deep gorge directly below moro rock to form main stem of kaweah river kaweah river flows in a southwest direction paralleled by highway 198 in its narrow canyon a short distance outside sequoia national park it picks up east fork which originates above elevation in mineral king valley from left it continues past town of three rivers where it receives north fork which begins in grant grove area of kings canyon national park south fork enters from left before river empties into lake kaweah reservoir formed by terminus dam in sierra nevada foothills terminus dam a high earthfill dam has primary purpose of flood control but also supplies water for irrigation and hydroelectricity below dam kaweah river passes lemon cove receives dry creek also known as lime kiln creek from right and flows into san joaquin valley where it divides into several major distributaries at mckay point dam st john s river splits off to northwest making a wide loop around visalia before becoming cross creek north of goshen from where it flows south main channel of kaweah river continues to southwest through farmland with outside creek and deep creek splitting to south before kaweah itself divides into mill creek and packwood creek mill creek continues westward through visalia and packwood creek skirts to south of city terminating in a small flood control basin mill creek ends at a confluence with cross creek which flows southward to old tulare lake bed near corcoran joining a channel carrying water from tule river kaweah delta region as defined by kaweah delta water conservation district covers about in tulare and kings counties main cities are visalia and tulare length of kaweah river is between confluence of middle and marble forks and bifurcation of mill and packwood creeks however including its tributaries and distributaries river is much longer mill creek largest distributary stream flows westward for to cross creek for a total distance of including upstream middle fork which is about long and length of cross creek below mill creek which is some water in kaweah system flows from head of middle fork to tulare lake bed most of kaweah river s runoff comes from mountain watershed above visalia which covers a total of including all lands drained and crossed by river s many distributaries down to tulare lake bed kaweah river hydrologic region covers annual runoff of kaweah river between 1975 and 1995 was or about river s highest flows are during peak snowmelt months of may and june winter flows are usually more of a trickle although river often experiences flooding during rainstorms most of water is diverted above visalia for irrigation and groundwater recharge with exception of agricultural wastewater water rarely flows any further downstream except in wet years extremely large storms can temporarily refill tulare lake as occurred most recently in 1997 natural features and environment thumb right lake kaweah is only major reservoir on kaweah river due to its steep fall from sierra nevada to san joaquin valley kaweah river passes through a wide range of climate and vegetation zones in a relatively short distance historically lower kaweah flowed into a vast area of seasonally flooded wetlands surrounding tulare lake almost all of which have been diked and drained for agriculture kaweah historically formed a large overflow area east of visalia known as visalia swamp and in areas west of visalia stream channels were poorly defined often simply disappearing into marsh lands during periods of high water foothill zone is characterized mostly by grassland and rangeland california oak woodland occurs along kaweah river and its perennial tributaries although its range has been much reduced since native american times further upstream and higher in elevation watershed is mostly mixed coniferous forest pines and firs largest concentrations of giant sequoias which grow only on western slope of sierra nevada are found in this section of kaweah watershed at mean elevations of although specimens have been found as low as kaweah watershed includes giant forest most visited and accessible of all sequoia groves located on divide between middle and marble forks it includes general sherman tree largest tree in world by volume redwood mountain grove largest sequoia grove in world at and 21 other groves are also located in kaweah watershed a relatively small portion of kaweah basin is high craggy alpine country typical of southern sierra such treeless lake studded areas of exposed granite are mostly found along crest of great western divide today mule deer are largest wild animal inhabiting valley and foothill area historically large herds of tule elk frequented area but their habitat in kaweah delta has been almost entirely eliminated by agriculture there are many species of foxes wildcats squirrels and rabbits including endemic san joaquin kit fox san joaquin antelope squirrel and others california grizzly bear and beaver were once common to area but were hunted or trapped out entirely by early 1900s mountain areas continue to provide habitat for black bears mule deer and bighorn sheep and kaweah river above three rivers has native rainbow trout and introduced brown trout and bass in alpine areas above tree line small mammals such as marmots and pika are common history thumb right marble fork of kaweah river in sequoia national park kaweah river watershed was originally inhabited by indigenous yokuts people of central valley and western mono descended from paiute peoples of great basin greatest concentration of native american settlements was along foothill reach of kaweah river in what is today three rivers and lake kaweah oak trees grew in abundance along low elevation permanent streams and provided staple food of acorns which were used to make cakes and bread native americans ground acorns into a fine mush using holes in local granite bedrock as mortars permanent winter settlements in foothills consisted of pit houses thatched with vast amounts of which once grew in marshes of kaweah delta up to in diameter during summer people traveled up into sierra nevada to hunt game and gather herbs hospital rock a flat next to middle fork was used as a camp possibly as early as 1300s ad spanish explorers came to kaweah river area in early 1800s although it is not clear who first explored kaweah delta possibly gabriel moraga party in 1806 early spanish names for river included rio de san gabriel and rio san francisco several such expeditions were sent into region in order to conscript native americans into mission system father pedro munoz wrote that kaweah would be a good place for a mission but none were ever established there because it was too far from coast and could not be easily defended in following decades native american resistance to spanish colonial government prompted many military raids killing many of natives who had not already succumbed to european diseases after california became a u s state california gold rush drew some prospectors to kaweah in 1850s but not much gold mining occurred in area during this time kaweah was often known as river francis a corruption of old spanish name hale tharp a stockman and early settler in three rivers discovered giant forest in 1858 with help of native american guides in 1861 tharp returned to this area between middle and marble forks of kaweah river using a hollowed out fallen sequoia log tharp s log as a cabin in 1873 a silver boom in mineral king attracted thousands of people to high mountain valley along east fork peak of mining had passed by 1882 when empire mine owned by state senator thomas fowler who invested most of his fortune in mine went under small operations continued sporadically into late 1920s after end of silver mining mineral king became a popular summer resort thumb left st john s river a major distributary of kaweah river in san joaquin valley one resource extraction industry that succeeded in kaweah basin was timber many logging camps sprang up in heavily forested western slopes of sierra including in watershed s sequoia groves kaweah colony was a utopian socialist community founded in 1886 along kaweah river in what is now sequoia national park although giant sequoia wood is generally too soft to be useful in construction many sequoias were felled between 1860s and 1880s when u s government began establishing timber reserves in area under pressure from conservationists including john muir who visited kaweah s marble fork and named giant forest in 1875 logging mostly ended after sequoia national park was founded in 1890 bill establishing park was pushed through in part due to actions of southern pacific railroad which saw kaweah colony as a competitor to logging operations that it owned elsewhere some settlers in kaweah colony attempted to continue their operations but were later convicted of illegal logging after which colony dissolved in 1892 kaweah delta historically also known as four creeks area after four major branches of kaweah river was one of earliest places in san joaquin valley to be populated and farmed by u s settlers although before construction of terminus dam entire area was frequently flooded great flood of 1862 temporarily changed course of river creating distributary today known as st john s river agriculture began in kaweah delta around 1864 when a group of local farmers dug consolidated peoples ditch people of visalia hired native americans to extend a canal from mill creek to power expanding settlement s flour mill in addition multiple channels had to be dug to redirect flow of st john s river back into kaweah which had been blocked by sediment during 1862 flood it was not until after wright act of 1887 however that farming expanded significantly wright act allowed formation of tulare irrigation district which began to establish a network of canals across kaweah delta surface water provided main supply as late as 1900 after which area s abundant groundwater reserves were pumped at increasing rates tulare lake disappeared by early 1900s and by 1930s agricultural development had surpassed capacity of local water resources in 1960s disney proposed to construct a ski resort in mineral king which would have brought one of most intense developments in history of upper kaweah watershed resort would have included 22 ski lifts a 1 030 room hotel ten restaurants and a railroad along canyon of east fork kaweah river to transport visitors from a parking area further down mountain environmentalists fought against proposal for many years and in 1978 national parks and recreation act designated area as part of sequoia national park river modifications thumb right control tower at terminus dam which provides flood control and irrigation for kaweah delta in order to make kaweah delta suitable for agriculture and eventually urban development tangle of diverging seasonal channels and marshes had to be drained and diked extensively as early as 1870s local irrigation companies were dredging some creeks and blocking off side channels in order to direct floodwater away from farms a major early 20th century project was channelization of mill creek which runs through middle of visalia and posed a major flooding threat before it was straightened deepened and widened in 1910 at a cost of 70 000 dams were built in 1920s and 1930s at mckays point to divide water flow between kaweah and st johns rivers to satisfy downstream water rights today kaweah delta has very little resemblance to historic times most of streams have either disappeared or been channelized and tulare lake itself is now a dry diked basin that only very occasionally floods kaweah delta water conservation district manages distribution of water to irrigation districts and city water districts over a service area primary crops grown in district are cotton various fruits nuts alfalfa and other field crops in addition to surface water district utilizes central valley project water from friant kern canal which delivers water from san joaquin river to tulare basin water can be turned out into either kaweah or st johns rivers augmenting water supply available to kaweah delta users groundwater is other important source of water supply for basin local aquifer has suffered from overdraft for many decades with an estimated annual deficit of between pumping and replenishment in order to increase rate of groundwater recharge more than 40 recharge basins or spreading grounds totaling have been constructed throughout district which allow floodwaters to percolate into ground hydroelectric power development on kaweah river began when mount whitney power company built a diversion flume and kaweah no 1 powerhouse on east fork in 1899 in 1905 it completed kaweah no 2 powerhouse on middle fork company then applied for permission to construct a third power plant on middle fork inside sequoia national park which was approved partly because at time this was an infrequently visited area of park kaweah no 3 plant was completed by 1913 and was followed by more plans to construct a reservoir at wolverton and at least two additional power plants kaweah plants brought electricity to visalia for first time and power was also used by farmers to pump groundwater however construction of wolverton dam was thwarted by bad foundation rock and other power plants were also never built taken over by southern california edison in 1917 system today consists of six dams three powerhouses three and many miles of concrete and wooden flumes kaweah no 3 plant is an eligible property for national register of historic places terminus dam was constructed by u s army corps of engineers in 1962 to help relieve kaweah delta s chronic flooding prior to damming river could reach very high flows during winter storms with a maximum of in december 1955 however capacity of main channel of kaweah river is only and its distributaries have an even lower capacity four years after dam s completion it prevented 19 6 million of damage during a single storm in december 1966 however capacity of reservoir lake kaweah was too small to control most severe floods and was so for many years until completion of a spillway enhancement project in 2004 six huge fuse gates largest of their type in world were added to dam reservoir can now safely hold of water an increase of 30 percent from original capacity recreation thumb right view of kaweah headwaters from high sierra trail a popular backpacking route all forks of kaweah river are located in sequoia national park which receives more than 1 2 million recreational visitors each year river is a major park attraction for boating and fishing but can be extremely hazardous during high water in spring and summer several commercial outfitters serve traditional class iv section of kaweah river between pumpkin hollow bridge near park entrance and lake kaweah advanced kayakers frequent class v middle fork at hospital rock further upstream in sequoia national park north fork is a wilderness run requiring boaters to carry all their equipment to put in river is free flowing above lake kaweah so rafting season depends entirely on natural snowmelt typically between april and july access to kaweah river for fishing swimming and water play can be difficult in three rivers area because most of river banks are on private property in sequoia national park river flows at bottom of a deep canyon and can also be difficult to reach river just above lake kaweah is publicly accessible at slick rock recreation area however this location is inundated most summers when level of lake kaweah is high slick rock known to locals as boulder beach has rock climbing areas and historic native american bedrock mortars lake kaweah itself offers shoreline fishing and flatwater boating upper south fork in sequoia national park has good fishing for wild rainbow trout although a long hike is required to reach it a california fishing license is required for visitors older than age 16 in park upper kaweah is also home to many hiking trails day hikes include walk along marble fork to tokopah falls and mineral king area along east fork also has a number of short trails backpacking is popular on high sierra trail which runs from giant forest through middle fork canyon and summits great western divide via kaweah gap en route toward john muir trail to mount whitney bearpaw meadow high sierra
