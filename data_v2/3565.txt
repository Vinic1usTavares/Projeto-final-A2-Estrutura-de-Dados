for his office even exceeded ps50 amount assembly also complicated shute s negotiations with restive abenaki who occupied lands on province s eastern borders now in state of maine and objected to encroachment of settlers on their lands even though there was some desire on part of french and abenaki for a peaceful resolution to dispute massachusetts assembly over shute s objections took a hard line cutting off trade with abenaki and authorizing a militia expedition against norridgewock one of main abenaki towns hart pp 2 87 88 relations deteriorated into open warfare in 1722 and shute

to avoid participation of bands of western abenaki based in what is now vermont in conflict in both of these he was unsuccessful iroquois despite significant financial inducements refused to take up

regarded as start of permanent european settlement in modern state of vermont haviland and power p 205 fort dummer was ineffective at stopping indian raids when grey lock s raids continued unabated in 1724 dummer renewed his appeals to connecticut governor gurdon saltonstall noting that connecticut was equally vulnerable to raiding should massachusetts towns in connecticut river be abandoned saltonstall sent further reinforcements but abenaki raids in area continued until 1727 when grey lock apparently tired of continuing war without outside support embassies sent by indian commissioners in albany new york and by eastern abenaki leaders failed to make contact with warrior and he disappeared from view calloway pp 120 130 eastern frontier war one of disputes shute was engaged in with assembly at time of his departure concerned appointment of militia officers something that was governor s prerogative assembly had demanded removal of militia commander of eastern district i e maine

line he refused in principle to halt settlement activities in contested territories but allowed penobscots to retain a roman catholic priest he also pressured wenemouet to bring grey lock and other abenaki leaders to peace table these talks led to a preliminary peace with only penobscots at end of july 1725 wenemouet then took up peace cause within wider wabanaki confederacy sending belts of wampum representing peace to other tribes after a translation of written treaty by a french priest revealed differences between what it stated and what was negotiated sauguaaram repudiated written treaty in january 1726 at a peace conference held in august 1726 penobscots attempted to argue against offending language but were convinced to sign treaty anyway penobscots despite their reservations promoted this peace within confederacy and reported in march 1727 that all of tribes except grey lock s band had agreed to it a final major peace conference held at casco bay in july 1727 formally closed hostilities and included dummer new hampshire s acting governor john wentworth nova scotia s military commander paul mascarene and many representatives of wabanaki confederacy treaty that

council of an explanatory charter for province in which council sided with shute on all of major issues barry p 122 shute was preparing to return to massachusetts in 1727 when king george i died king george ii chose to give massachusetts governorship to william burnet instead of renewing shute s commission and he renewed dummer s commission as lieutenant governor batinski p 45 matter of colonial currency arose again in 1726 dummer had been instructed to only allow new issues under exceptional circumstances and ps100 000 was due to be retired assembly proposed to circumvent need for an exception by allocating issue for repair of fortifications something for which dummer had requested funding since proposed currency issuance greatly exceeded amount needed for repairs dummer vetoed request and dissolved assembly pencak pp 79 80 when assembly met in 1727 dummer kept body in session for 165 days demanding it act on mandated currency withdrawal assembly threatened to withhold his
