tropical storm dolly was a short lived and disorganized tropical cyclone that caused moderate damage across tamaulipas mexico in early september 2014 originating from a tropical wave system first became a tropical depression late on september 1 while situated over bay of campeche dolly struggled against strong wind shear for duration of its existence large system featured multiple circulations sometimes becoming a new dominant center and other times simply rotating around a mean vortex as a result multiple center relocations occurred along its general west northwest track dolly eventually made landfall in tamaulipas on september 3 before degenerating into a remnant low system subsequently dissipated following day prior to dolly s landfall schools suspended classes and officials opened shelters across tamaulipas and veracruz storm produced widespread moderate to heavy rain in mexico with accumulations peaking at in la encantada tamaulipas subsequent flooding caused damage amounting to 290 5 million pesos us 22 2 million one fatality was indirectly attributed to storm moisture from dolly also brought scattered storms to southern texas meteorological history on august 19 2014 a tropical wave emerged off west coast of africa system traversed atlantic over next week with no signs of development convection finally increased once wave entered caribbean sea on august 27 however it was not until august 30 when interaction with a kelvin wave spurred organization an area of low pressure consolidated within system as it crossed yucatan peninsula on august 31 formation of a banding feature along southeastern portion of circulation on september 1 marked system s transition into a tropical depression by 18 00 utc while over bay of campeche although situated over warm waters of strong wind shear created an unfavorable environment and hindered intensification during this formative stage depression tracked northward as its center relocated before turning to northwest and later west it was uncertain if a closed circulation truly existed due to conflicting data and depression could have remained a trough until afternoon of september 2 early on september 2 depression acquired gale force winds and became fourth tropical storm of 2014 season accordingly it was assigned name dolly at this time a tight pressure gradient between dolly and a ridge over gulf of mexico created a large area of tropical storm winds along east side of cyclone data hurricane hunters investigating system indicate that dolly achieved its peak winds of 50 mph 85 km h around 12 00 utc winds up to 70 mph 110 km h were found within deep convection to storm s east but considered to be inflated by heavy rains and thus not representative of its actual strength slight weakening took place shortly thereafter as center relocated to south during this relocation multiple circulations were observed rotating around a mean position with yet another vortex located well to southeast around 01 00 utc on september 3 dolly s pressure fell to 1000 mbar hpa 29 53 inhg marking storm s peak intensity maintaining a due west course dolly made landfall just south of tampico at 04 00 utc with winds of 45 mph 75 km h radar observations depicted a secondary center to north that moved ashore near altamira an hour later once onshore dolly s circulation separated from all remaining convection and storm degenerated into a remnant low later that day system subsequently dissipated early on september 4 preparations and impact 275px thumb right tropical storms norbert left and dolly right straddling both coasts of mexico at 17 30 utc on september 2 remnants of dolly brought widespread moisture to southern texas by september 5 scattered thunderstorms developed across region with some producing damaging winds more than of rain fell in brownsville causing street flooding dozens of mexican fishing vessels sought refuge in port of brownsville however two ran aground in shipping channel and a third on south padre island united states coast guard attributed mishaps to sudden influx of numerous ships southerly flow from hurricane norbert over pacific brought moisture from dolly over southwestern united states resulting in possible life threatening flash flooding mexico coinciding with first advisory on tropical depression five late on september 1 government of mexico issued a tropical storm warning for areas between tuxpan and la pesca this was soon expanded northward to include areas between la pesca and public schools and autonomous university of tamaulipas suspended classes on september 2 and 3 in tamaulipas and veracruz officials opened 53 shelters for potential evacuees pemex temporarily suspended operations of two oil production plants between september 1 4 dolly brought widespread heavy rains to mexico accumulations of were common across states of hidalgo nuevo leon san luis potosi tamaulipas and veracruz with a peak value of in la encantada tamaulipas flooding in tamaulipas prompted residents to evacuate and utilize public shelters a roof collapse at a ballpark injured two people losses from heavy rain in el mante reached 7 million pesos us 535 000 prompting a state of emergency total damage in state amounted to 290 5 million pesos us 22 2 million some residences temporarily lost power across tamaulipas road collapses in veracruz city damaged ten homes and four cars one of these further threatened 40 homes in buena vista within city a rockslide occurred in remote community of el flooding in guanajuato caused notable disruptions and some damage no observations of sustained tropical storm force winds were received though a gust of was observed in barra del accordingly wind damage was limited to cabo rojo one death was indirectly
