thumb 250px a veterans affairs veteran identification card with information redacted veterans health administration scandal of 2014 is a reported pattern of negligence in treatment of united states military veterans critics charged that patients at vha hospitals had not met target of getting an appointment within 14 days in some hospitals staff falsified appointment records to appear to meet 14 day target some patients died while they were on waiting list reports differ about whether they died because of delay defenders agreed that it was unacceptable to falsify data but 14 day target was unrealistic in understaffed facilities like phoenix and most private insurers did not meet a 14 day target either by most measures vha system provides excellent care at low cost wrote paul krugman who believes that attacks on vha system are motivated by conservatives who want to discredit a government program that works well conservative legislators have proposed privatizing vha and legislative reforms will make it easier for veterans to go to private doctors cnn reported on april 30 2014 that at least 40 united states armed forces veterans died while waiting for care at phoenix arizona

administration a division of u s department of veterans affairs is responsible for providing health care to u s military veterans and is one of largest healthcare operations in united states with dozens of hospitals and medical facilities across nation it has had a long and troubled history goals for patient wait times timeliness of care was an important goal to vha in 1995 vha established a goal of scheduling primary and specialty care medical appointments within 30 days to ensure veterans timely access to care vha began collecting patients wait time data in 2000 for which then general accounting office gao reported inaccuracies by july 2002 va reported to congress that over 300 000 veterans nationwide were either forced onto waiting lists or forced to wait over six months for a medical appointment despite questions raised by gao and va office of inspector general as to validity of va s performance in providing timely care to veterans vha shortened wait time goal to 14 days for both primary and specialty care medical appointments in fiscal year 2011 in fiscal year 2012 vha added a goal of completing primary care medical appointments within 7 days of desired date a zip

u s senate passed a 500 million aid bill for va merit pay bonuses previous reports of preventable deaths as of april 2014 va had paid approximately 200 million for nearly 1 000 veterans wrongful deaths agency spokesperson victoria dillon said that any adverse incident for a veteran within our care is one too many but deaths were a small fraction of 6 million veterans which receive va care each year house committee on veterans affairs held a hearing on preventable patient deaths in va facilities in september 2013 during which representatives accused va of failing to discipline officials responsible for patient deaths and instead providing performance bonuses for example va regional director michael moreland received a bonus of approximately 63 000 and a five page performance evaluation that made no mention of an outbreak of legionnaires disease that led to deaths of six veterans and illness for 21 others at a pittsburgh vha hospital for which moreland was responsible previous reports of inaccurate data and subsequent manipulation then general accounting office gao has issued reports since va started gathering data in 2000 on veterans wait times to be scheduled for an appointment and these gao reports have called into question reliability and validity of va s wait time data va office of inspector general oig reports in 2005 2007 and 2008 found reported outpatient waiting times to be unreliable because of data integrity concerns associated with vha s scheduling system discrepancies found by oig between requested appointment times documented in medical records and in databases and incomplete waiting lists are attributed to patient preference or scheduler s use of inappropriate scheduling procedures rescinded vha directive 2009 070 vha

veteran thomas breen was rushed to phoenix va on september 28 2013 with blood in his urine and a history of cancer his family said that he was sent home with instructions that he was to be seen within one week by a primary care doctor or urologist and a note on his patient chart said situation was urgent after being sent home his family said that they were told that there was a seven month waiting list and that there were other critical patients thomas breen died on november 30 2013 his death certificate shows that he died from bladder cancer his family said that va called on december 6 2013 to make an appointment after breen had died dr sam foote who retired after 24 years of service with phoenix va system went public with allegations against vha in comments to cnn in april 2014 he said that there was an official list at phoenix va that was sent to washington officials and showed that appointments were timely and an unofficial list where veterans may wait for care for more than a year foote said scheme was deliberately put in place to avoid va s own internal rules he said that workers at phoenix va were intimidated into complying with deception they have families they have mortgages and if they speak out or say anything to anybody about it they will be fired and they know that austin veterans health administration system a scheduler at an austin texas vha care clinic said that practice of zeroing out delays in appointments wasn t a secret at all at clinic and he was instructed by a supervisor in how process worked austin scheduler said that said zeroing out was a practice of falsifying information in va s records system that washington officials used to monitor patient wait times ft collins colorado and cheyenne wyoming va deputy undersecretary for health administrative operations william schoenhard wrote a memo on march 15 2013 indicating that va was changing its performance measure for appointment wait times new goal involved measuring number of days between a veteran s desired appointment date and actual date of appointment a va office of medical inspector report from december 2013 showed a dramatic change in march 2013 of number of appointments booked within 14 day window for ft collins colorado outpatient clinic when investigators asked va employees to explain what occurred in march 2013 employees said that they were instructed by business office staff to access appointment schedule review it for capacity inform veteran of schedule availability and then enter desired date as patient appointment date and by entering desired date as appointment date wait time appears to be zero days ft collins clinic is overseen by cheyenne wyoming veterans affairs office a coordinator at cheyenne office sent an email on june 19 2013 with instructions on how to manipulate appointment dates coordinator wrote yes it is gaming system a bit but you have to know rules of game you are playing as of june 23 2013 united states office of special counsel is investigating reports that two schedulers at ft collins facility were reassigned to wyoming after they refused to comply with instructions to falsify information about patient wait times va office of medical inspector has substantiated a report that punitive action was taken against employees who scheduled appointments in a way that honestly showed that appointments would take place outside of 14 day window and omi also substantiated reports of other problems at facility such as a shortage of medical providers and attempts to hide evidence of cancelled appointments columbia south carolina a va inspector s september 2013 report noted that due to mismanagement thousands of patients at va medical center in columbia had their appointments for colon cancer screenings delayed this resulted in over 50 patients having a delayed diagnosis for colon cancer and some later died from disease additionally a 2008 report indicated that documents that were critical in processing of veterans disability claims had been shredded although this had occurred at at least 40 locations nationwide columbia location had most cases 1 5 of overall cases also between 2009 and 2013 backlog of disability claims in columbia more than doubled from 33 to 71 investigations and findings internal va investigations an audit from secretary of veterans affairs said some front line middle and senior managers felt compelled to manipulate records to meet performance goals manipulation of records was done with knowledge of senior managers in phoenix va system and possibly those of other va facilities investigations are ongoing as of may 31 2014 however a va inspector general s report issued on august 26 2014 reported that six not forty veterans had died experiencing clinically significant delays while on waiting lists to see a va doctor and in each of these six cases we are unable to conclusively assert that absence of timely quality care caused deaths of these veterans va

administration were instructed to change dates for which veterans had requested an appointment in order to hide delays at phoenix va official data showed veterans waited an average of 24 days for an appointment in reality average wait was 115 days shinseki called situation reprehensible former vha doctors were not surprised by findings at least 1700 veterans at phoenix va who wanted an appointment were never placed on an official wait list va s office of inspector general called manipulation of appointments at phoenix va a systemic problem and called for a nationwide audit as of may 30 2014 42 va medical centers were under investigation for their scheduling practices va oig reported in may 2014 that 17 veteran deaths had occurred while waiting for vha treatment in phoenix va system and on june 5 2014 acting secretary of veterans affairs sloan gibson reported that va had identified 18 additional deaths 18 deaths were among group of 1700 identified as at risk of being lost

committee learned that every one of 470 senior executives in va received performance evaluations that indicated they were at least fully successful in each of past four years congressional representatives argued that data shows that senior management in va is out of touch with problems in department republican representative phil roe said do you think that s normal in business that nearly every executive is successful that means you put bar down here so anybody can step over it democratic representative ann mclane kuster compared situation to grade inflation senior executives

to do better at holding executives accountable obama administration investigation president obama s deputy chief of staff rob nabors reported to obama on june 27 2014 that he found significant and chronic system failures a corrosive culture damaged morale and a need for additional staff he reported that goals for wait times for appointments of no more than 14 days are unrealistic that data about patient wait times had been falsified by vha employees that there are a variety of problems with safety and integrity within vha and that transparency and accountability are lacking in response to report republican chair of house veterans affairs committee representative jeff miller said it appears white house has finally come to terms with serious and systemic va health care problems we ve been investigating and documenting for years and that he would work with white house to fix problems independent chair of senate veterans affairs committee bernie sanders said no organization size of va can operate effectively without a high level of transparency and accountability clearly that is not case now at va office of special counsel investigations united states office of special counsel sent a letter to president obama indicating that va office of medical inspector used a harmless error defense against allegations of unsafe practices at va including unsanitary conditions and delays in treatment investigations by office of special counsel supported claims such as high levels of bacteria at a clinic and an 8 year wait for a va psychiatric inpatient to receive an initial evaluation osc said it is currently reviewing more than 50 allegations of unsafe practices at va and has referred 29 cases for further investigation u s special counsel carolyn lerner wrote in letter that these cases are part of a troubling pattern of deficient patient care at va facilities nationwide and continued resistance by va and office of medical inspector in most cases to recognize and address impact on health and safety of veterans and that veterans health and safety has been unnecessarily put at risk by harmless error defense osc substantiated numerous claims of unsafe practices at jackson mississippi va facilities including improper credentialing and illegal prescribing of narcotics lerner said that despite confirming problems in each of these and other patient care areas va refused to acknowledge any impact on health and safety of veterans seeking care acting va secretary sloan gibson said that he accepted osc s recommendations and had directed a review of office of medical inspector that was to be completed in two weeks gibson said i am deeply disappointed not only in substantiation of allegations raised by whistleblowers but also in failures within va to take whistleblower complaints seriously rand corporation investigation congress commissioned a study of va by rand corporation which was published early in 2016 among study s findings were that care provided by va was generally as good as or better than other health care providers according to most criteria used in study and that there was no widespread evidence of long waiting times generally in va although in a few places some veterans did experience long wait times and that most veterans get their appointments within a few days of their preferred date for care specifically more than 90 percent of appointments for already enrolled patients and 80 percent of appointments for new patients occur within two weeks of desired date responses may and june 2014 politicians from both republican and democratic parties have commented on scandal democratic representative steve israel said that it s a shame that when republicans had a chance to help vets get their benefits from v a they blocked a solution referring to republican opposition to 2013 veterans backlog reduction act democrats led by senator patty murray have aggressively sought more money for veterans services since second term of president george w bush many republicans have countered that problems in va are ones of management rather than funding and that obama administration officials are responsible for not discovering patient backlog republican representative jackie said that va had bureaucracy run amok and noted a case in atlanta where two top officials were able to retire early and three were reprimanded over three preventable deaths at end of may 2014 bipartisan agreement emerged among democratic senator barbara a mikulski and republican senator richard c shelby on senate appropriations committee to include funding for civil and criminal investigations into veterans affairs in a veterans spending bill democratic president barack obama s chief of staff denis mcdonough said on may 18

with our recommendations and submitted an action plan va medical facility directors did not take necessary actions to comply with vha s program directives and policy changes in his spoken testimony griffin said that in three fourths of va facilities investigated for falsification of wait time data we re pretty confident that it was knowingly and willingly happening and we re pursuing those he also said he hopes to complete his office s investigations into possible criminal misconduct by end of 2014 if his office finds criminal misconduct it will then refer cases to u s attorneys for possible prosecution senator richard burr said that culture that has developed at va and lack of management and accountability is simply reprehensible in his testimony secretary bob mcdonald

announced that it is firing four additional employees subject to results of appeals deputy secretary gibson said that va will actively and aggressively pursue disciplinary action on those who violates

being fired after a variety of problems were found by va inspector general including long wait times that some schedulers were instructed to conceal deputy chief procurement officer is being fired according to inspector general she improperly disclosed non public va information to unauthorized persons misused her position and va resources for private gain and engaged in a prohibited personnel practice rep jeff miller republican of florida chairs house veterans affairs committee he said that new va law gives agency officials five days to respond to notices of intent to fire them director of georgia va retired four days in advance of va s announcement that he would be fired and procurement official also retired in advance of her firing procurement official was nearly hired by u s department of energy before that department learned of findings against her at va miller said that if any current laws or regulations are impeding va s ability to swiftly hold employees accountable va leaders must work with congress so those laws and regulations can be changed and va appears to be giving failing executives an opportunity to quit retire or find new jobs without consequence he said he opposed allowing officials who had committed misconduct being allowed to slip out back door with a pension november 2014 official in charge of phoenix va facility who had been on administrative leave for almost seven months was fired while on administrative leave she was paid over 90 000 rep d ariz said that payments were a completely unacceptable use of taxpayer dollars that should instead go to providing care for veterans dr sam foote said that firing was a good first step and that i think there are a lot of others who need to follow her out door va temporarily appointed a new manager for southwest region of united states southwest region includes phoenix va facility new manager was previously involved in clandestinely placing a camera inside hospital room of a patient in florida she later said that manner of camera s placement was wrong republic reported that she at first said she authorized videotaping because nurses were upset and wanted to prove family members were committing medical sabotage moments later she said there was no intention to keep filming secret from and camera was really approved for patient safety she said that she has previously been assigned

controversial statements in february on a february 15 2015 airing of meet press mcdonald claimed that 60 u s department of veterans affairs employees had been fired due to va s wait time scandal later he backtracked and clarified it was only 8 employees that lost their jobs on february 23 2015 mcdonald admitted he misspoke to a homeless veteran on january 30 2015 about his serving in u s army special forces a conversation that was recorded by a cbs television news crew accompanying him during a nationwide count of homeless veterans i have no excuse i was not in special forces he told huffington post which first broke story huffington post reported that special operations forces includes army rangers and that mcdonald completed army ranger training and took courses in jungle arctic and desert warfare and while he earned a ranger tab designating him as a graduate of ranger school he never served in a ranger battalion or any other special operations unit april 2015 new york times reported that in contrast to previous statements about number of firings related to scandal new internal documents show that real number of people removed from their jobs is much smaller still at most three department of veterans affairs did not dispute this number but said that disciplinary action is being taken against over 100 other employees congressional republicans were outraged representative jeff miller said rather than disciplining bad employees v a often just transfers them to other v a facilities or puts them on paid leave for months on end and everyone knows accountability is a major problem at department miller said that he would introduce new legislation to hasten firing process raymond kelley legislative director for veterans of foreign wars said that government firing system is so cumbersome bad employees can continue to be paid for years and we need to show them you can no longer hide just because you have a government job unclog middle management that appears to be part of problem and get right people in those positions april 2017 on april 27 2017 president trump signed executive order titled improving accountability and whistleblower protection at department of veterans affairs comments from management experts health care experts and economists management experts said that source of problem was setting an unrealistic goal of a 14 day wait this was compounded by not including provisions for measuring how well system was working experts said that having high stakes goals especially without checks and balances encouraged gaming numbers and cheating in private and public sector managers at federal level should have had data about times and costs for basic services throughout va system that would have identified phoenix facility as anomalous dr robert roswell a previous va undersecretary of health and now professor of medicine at university of oklahoma said that an appropriate measure of vha performance was not patient wait times which were largely outside control of staff because vha employees do not control number of patients seeking care a better measure of performance would for example measure efficient use of vha resources such as number of no show appointments phillip longman author of best care anywhere why va care would work better for everyone said after visiting va hospitals nationwide that as result of veterans in new england mid atlantic and industrial midwest either dying or retiring to sunbelt states there is an imbalance of capacity with empty beds in some vha hospitals and waiting lists in others compounding this problem more liberal eligibility standards allow veterans to get treatment for chronic conditions of aging like heart disease and parkinson s va care still best care anywhere by phillip longman washington monthly june 3 2014 setting a benchmark of 14 days to see a new primary care doc at a va hospital or clinic in boston or northern california may be completely reasonable wrote longman but trying to do same in phoenix and in a handful of other sunbelt retirement meccas is not workable without congress up for building more capacity there economics nobel laureate paul krugman said that scandal came about because conservatives did not like fact that vha system which is an island of socialized medicine is working well so they seized on wait times as a gift from god to discredit vha it s still true that veterans affairs provides excellent care at low cost those waiting lists arise partly because so many veterans want care but congress has provided neither clear guidelines on who is entitled to coverage nor sufficient resources to cover all applicants and yes some officials appear to have responded to incentives to reduce waiting times by falsifying data yet on average veterans don t appear to wait longer for care than other americans and does anyone doubt that many americans have died while waiting for approval
