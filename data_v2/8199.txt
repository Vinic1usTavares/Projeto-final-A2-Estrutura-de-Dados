chimney quoted in benham 68 a was a tribute or an offering in addition to cleaning and rebuilding parts of gothic structure jones added a classical style portico to cathedral s west front in 1630s which william benham notes was altogether incongruous with old building it was no doubt fortunate that inigo jones confined his work at st paul s to some very poor additions to transepts and to a portico very magnificent in its way at west end benham 67 68 work stopped during english civil war and there was much defacement and mistreatment of building by parliamentarian forces during which old documents and charters were dispersed and destroyed and nave used as a stable for cavalry horses kelly 50 much of detailed information historians have of cathedral is taken from william dugdale s 1658 history of st pauls cathedral written hastily during protectorate for fear that one of most eminent structures of that kinde in christian world might be destroyed indeed a persistent rumour of time

felt and specially in church through presbyterian contagion which then began violently to out that you often and earnestly incited me to a speedy view of what monuments i could especially in

additions of 1630 lang 47 63 wren instead recommended that building be completely demolished according to his first biographer james elmes wren expressed his surprise at carelessness and want of accuracy in original builders of structure wren s son described new design as gothic rectified to a better manner of architecture both clergy and citizens of city opposed such a move cassell 605 in response wren proposed to restore body of gothic building but replace existing tower with a dome he wrote in his 1666 of surveyor s design for repairing old ruinous structure of st paul s it must be concluded that tower from top to bottom and adjacent parts are such a heap of that no judicious architect will think it by any expense that can be laid out upon new dressing it clifton taylor 237 wren whose uncle matthew wren was bishop of ely admired central lantern of ely cathedral and proposed that his dome design could be constructed over top of existing gothic tower before old structure was removed from within this he reasoned would prevent need for extensive scaffolding and would not upset londoners unbelievers by demolishing a familiar landmark without being able to see its hopeful successor rise in its stead van eck 155 160 matter was still under discussion when restoration work on st paul s finally began in 1660s but soon after being sheathed in wooden scaffolding building was completely gutted in great fire of london of 1666 fire aided by scaffolding destroyed roof and much of stonework along with masses of stocks and personal belongings that had been placed there for safety chambers 137 samuel pepys recalls building in flames in his diary john evelyn s account paints a similar picture of destruction september 3rd i went and saw whole south part of city burning

that lead over altar at east end was d and among divers monuments body of one bishop remain d intire thus lay in ashes that most venerable church one of most antient pieces of early piety in christian world quoted in benham 74 75 aftermath temporary repairs were made to building while it might have been salvageable albeit with almost complete reconstruction a decision was taken to build a new cathedral in a modern style instead a step which had been contemplated even before fire wren declared that it was impossible to restore old building benham 74 75 following april dean william wrote to him that he had been right in his judgement our work at west end he wrote has fallen about our ears two pillars had collapsed and rest was so unsafe that men were afraid to go near even to pull it down he added you are so absolutely necessary to us that we can do nothing resolve on nothing without you following this declaration by dean demolition of remains of old cathedral began in 1668 demolition of old cathedral proved unexpectedly difficult as stonework had been bonded together by molten lead hart 18 wren initially used then new technique of using gunpowder to bring down surviving stone walls benham 76 like many experimental techniques use of gunpowder was not easy to control several workers were killed and nearby residents complained about noise and damage eventually wren resorted to using a battering ram instead building work on new cathedral began in june 1675 wren s first proposal greek cross design was considered too radical by members of a committee commissioned to rebuild church members of clergy decried design as being too dissimilar from churches that already existed in england at time to suggest any continuity within church of england downes 11 34 wren s approved warrant design sought to reconcile gothic with his better manner of architecture featuring a portico influenced by inigo jones addition to old cathedral however wren received permission from king to make ornamental changes to submitted design and over course of construction made significant alterations including addition of famous dome topping out of new cathedral took place in october 1708 and cathedral was declared officially complete by parliament in 1710 consensus on finished building was mixed james wright 1643 1713 wrote without within below above eye is filled with
