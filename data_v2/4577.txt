siege of constantinople of 860 was only major military expedition of rus khaganate recorded in byzantine and western european sources cause of siege was construction of fortress sarkel by byzantine engineers restricting rus trade route along don river in favor of khazars accounts vary regarding events with discrepancies between contemporary and later sources exact outcome is unknown it is known from byzantine sources that rus caught constantinople unprepared while empire was preoccupied by ongoing arab byzantine wars and unable to deal with rus threat after pillaging suburbs of byzantine capital rus retreated although nature of this withdrawal and indeed which side was victorious is subject to debate event gave rise to a later orthodox christian tradition which ascribed deliverance of constantinople to a miraculous intervention by theotokos background first mention of rus near byzantine empire comes from life of st george of a hagiographic work whose dating is debated byzantines had come into contact with rus in 839 exceptional timing of attack suggests rus had been informed of city s weakness demonstrating that lines of trade and communication did not cease to exist in 840s and nevertheless threat from rus in 860 came as a surprise it was as sudden and unexpected as a swarm of wasps as photius put it turnbull 48 49 empire was struggling to repel abbasid advance in asia minor in march 860 garrison of key fortress loulon unexpectedly surrendered to arabs in april or may both sides exchanged captives and hostilities briefly ceased however in beginning of june emperor michael iii left constantinople for asia minor to invade abbasid caliphate vasiliev 188 siege on june 18 860 this date given by brussels chronicle is nowadays accepted as definitive by historians in 12th century primary chronicle of kievan rus campaign is dated to 866 and associated with names of askold and dir believed to be kievan rulers at time however dating in early part of primary chronicle is generally faulty vasiliev 145 at sunset a fleet of about 200 rus greek sources john deacon puts number of ships at 360 this divergence has led alexander vasiliev to argue that john wrote about an entirely different event a viking attack on constantinople from south in 861 otherwise not attested by any other source vasiliev 25 primary chronicle gives an even more exaggerated number of ships 2 000 logan 188 sailed into bosporus and started pillaging suburbs of constantinople old east slavic old norse attackers were setting homes on fire and drowning and stabbing residents unable to do anything to repel invaders patriarch photius urged his flock to implore theotokos to save city logan 190 having devastated suburbs rus passed into sea of marmora and fell upon isles of princes where former patriarch ignatius of constantinople was in exile at time rus plundered dwellings and monasteries slaughtering captives they took twenty two of patriarch s servants aboard ship and cut them into pieces with axes vasiliev 188 189 attack took byzantines by surprise like a thunderbolt from heaven as it was put by patriarch photius in his famous oration written on occasion emperor michael iii was absent from city as was his navy dreaded for its skill in using greek fire imperial army including those troops that were normally garrisoned closest to capital was fighting arabs in asia minor city s land defences were weakened by absence of these garrisons but sea defences were also lacking byzantine navy was occupied fighting both arabs and normans in aegean sea and mediterranean sea these simultaneous deployments left coasts and islands of black sea bosporus and sea of marmara susceptible to attack invasion continued until august 4 when in another of his sermons photius thanked heaven for miraculously relieving city from such a dire threat writings of photius provide earliest example of name rus rhos being mentioned in a greek source previously dwellers of lands to north of black sea were referred to archaically as patriarch reported that they had no supreme ruler and lived in some distant northern lands photius called them ethnos unknown people although some historians prefer to translate phrase as obscure people pointing out earlier contacts between byzantines and rus vasiliev 187 later traditions thumb left fresco 1644 showing michael and photius putting veil of theotokos into sea church of veil moscow kremlin sermons of photius offer no clue as to outcome of invasion or reasons why rus withdrew to their own country later sources attribute their retreat to emperor s speedy return to capital as story goes after michael and photius put veil of theotokos into sea there arose a tempest which dispersed boats of barbarians in later centuries it was said that emperor hurried to church at blachernae and had robe of theotokos carried in procession along theodosian walls this precious byzantine relic was dipped symbolically into sea and a great wind immediately arose and wrecked rus ships pious legend was recorded by george hamartolus whose manuscript was an important source for primary chronicle for other byzantine authors who narrate stories about miraculous saving of constantinople from scythians see leo grammaticus 240 241 theodose de melitene 168 symeon logothetes 674 675 authors of kievan chronicle appended names of askold and dir to account as they believed that these two varangians had presided over kiev in 866 it was to this year that through some quirk in chronology they attributed first rus expedition against byzantine capital number of raids was multiplied in 16th century nikon chronicle which interpreted 860 raid described in byzantine sources and 866 raid described by primary chronicle as two distinct events this obvious blunder led boris to conclude that rus raided tsargrad in 860 866 874 for a critique see tvorogov 54 59 thumb 200px blachernitissa icon before which michael iii may have prayed to theotokos for deliverance of constantinople from rus nestor s account of first encounter between rus and byzantines may have contributed to popularity of theotokos in russia miraculous saving of constantinople from barbarian hordes would appear in russian icon painting without understanding that hordes in question may have issued from kiev furthermore when blachernitissa was brought to moscow in 17th century it was said that it was this icon that had saved tsargrad from troops of scythian khagan after michael iii had prayed before it to theotokos nobody noticed that story had obvious parallels with sequence of events described by nestor in 9th century a legend sprang up to effect that an ancient column at forum of taurus had an inscription predicting that constantinople would be conquered by rus this legend well known in byzantine literature was revived by in 19th century when russia was on point of wresting city from ottomans criticism as was demonstrated by oleg tvorogov and constantine zuckerman among others 9th century and later sources are out of tune with earliest records of event in his august sermon photius mentions neither michael iii s return to capital nor miracle with veil of which author purportedly was a participant on other hand pope nicholas i in a letter sent to michael iii on september 28 865 mentions that suburbia of imperial capital were recently raided by pagans who were allowed to retreat without any punishment nicolai i 479 480 analyzed in vasiliev 61 62 venetian chronicle of john deacon reports that gentes having devastated of constantinople returned to their own lands in triumph et sic gens cum ad est iohannes diaconus 116 117 it appears that victory of michael iii over rus was invented by byzantine historians in mid 9th century or later and became generally accepted in slavic chronicles influenced by them this theory is advanced by zuckerman among others see zuckerman 2000 however memory of successful campaign was transmitted orally among and may have dictated nestor s account of oleg s 907 campaign which is not recorded in byzantine sources at all notes references iohannes diaconus chronicon rome leo
