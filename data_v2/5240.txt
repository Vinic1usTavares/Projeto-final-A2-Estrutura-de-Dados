1996 pacific hurricane season saw a record four pacific hurricanes strike mexico it was a below average season that produced 9 tropical storms 5 hurricanes and 2 major hurricanes it officially began may 15 1996 in eastern north pacific and on june 1 1996 in central north pacific it ended on november 30 1996 these dates conventionally delimit period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in northeastern pacific ocean season slightly exceeded these bounds when tropical storm one e formed on may 13 few storms formed this season but it was very eventful twelve tropical cyclones formed during this season of which five made landfall and two other impacted land areas two tropical cyclones that formed in other basins entered eastern north pacific ocean early in season three tropical cyclones impacted mexico in a ten day span while first cyclone of season formed before it officially began hurricane douglas was strongest storm reaching category 4 intensity on saffir simpson hurricane scale and had its beginnings in atlantic as hurricane cesar seasonal summary this season was below average in activity in eastern north pacific eleven tropical cyclones formed of these four became hurricanes one of which were major hurricanes because they reached category 3 or higher on saffir simpson hurricane scale remainder were tropical storms in addition one atlantic hurricane hurricane cesar crossed into this zone from atlantic ocean and was renamed douglas none of systems in eastern north pacific crossed 140degw and entered central pacific last time that happened was in 1979 season in central north pacific one tropical depression formed in addition a depression crossed dateline from western pacific before dissipating in this basin none of these two systems reached tropical storm strength in addition data from joint typhoon warning center on september 1 tropical depression rick crossed international dateline entering into cphc s area of responsibility however this storm was not included into cphc database storm eventually became extratropical on september 3 over open waters in terms of number of storms season was below average despite this there were a large number of landfalls of note is fact that three tropical cyclones approached close to or made landfall on mexico during a ten day span from june 23 to july 3 in all a record setting four hurricanes alma boris fausto and hernan struck coastline accumulated cyclone energy ace is a measure of how active a season is it is found by taking a tropical storm or hurricane s windspeed in knots every six hours squaring it adding up results and dividing total by 104 ace of this season makes it a below normal season it is one of lowest totals ever recorded with only 2007 1977 and 2010 seasons had lower totals systems tropical storm one e season had an early start on may 13 when a tropical wave in open ocean organized into tropical depression one e depression moved west northwest and strengthened into a tropical storm on may 14 on that day tropical storm reached its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds at and a minimum central pressure of wind shear steadily weakened cyclone until it dissipated early on may 17 this system was only tropical storm to form in may during period from 1992 99 tropical storm one e was not assigned a name because it was determined to be a tropical storm after season was over storm was initially forecast to become a tropical storm but information available at time did not warrant upgrade subsequently wind reports relayed from us coast guard to national hurricane center suggested that this cyclone was a tropical storm this tropical cyclone impacted two ships first called true blue was near fringes of storm and escaped other solar wind provided wind observations until communications with vessel were lost after 0600 utc on may 14 despite a search by us coast guard ship and its two person crew were never found tropical depression two e on may 15 an area of disturbed weather in intertropical convergence zone developed into a tropical depression disturbance was not readily traceable back to a tropical wave from atlantic on its first day of its existence tropical depression two e was a well organized system with maximum sustained winds of and a minimum central pressure of as it slowly moved west two e experienced a few intermittent bursts of convection however depression gradually became less organized during remainder of its life on may 18 cyclone s organization deteriorated markedly until it dissipated next morning tropical depression two e never threatened land consequently there were no reports of deaths or damage hurricane alma on june 20 southern part of same tropical wave that spawned tropical storm arthur in atlantic overcame shear to strengthen into tropical depression three e it reached tropical storm intensity that same day when shear relaxed alma strengthened into a hurricane weak steering currents sent alma towards mexican coast it made landfall near lazaro cardenas michoacan on june 23 and almost immediately went back out to sea alma slowly paralleled coast as topography disrupted cyclone s circulation alma weakened to tropical storm intensity on june 24 and to tropical depression intensity on june 26 it dissipated next day alma s maximum winds were 105 mph 165 km h and alma s minimum pressure was hurricane alma was first of three consecutive storms to come close to or make landfall on pacific coast of mexico during a ten day span at least three and possibly twenty people were killed three were killed when a house near lazaro cardenas collapsed there were unconfirmed reports that 17 people were killed by floods in state of puebla caused by alma s rains trees were downed and power was knocked out to many places roads were flooded and covered with debris throughout affected area hurricane boris on june 27 a tropical wave developed convection and became tropical depression four it moved north and slowly intensified rate of intensification increased and depression became a tropical storm on june 28 boris reached hurricane intensity on june 28 and peaked with winds of 90 mph 150 km h and a central pressure of boris then made landfall on june 29 about midway between lazaro cardenas and acapulco boris then moved offshore after turning to southwest and dissipated on july 1 while south of puerto vallarta hurricane boris was in general a well forecast storm due to short time when system was at or above tropical storm intensity long range forecasts were not verified average errors were at one and a half days in future boris caused at least five deaths one person was killed in tecpan nearby three other people drowned and five fishers were missing in acapulco a child was killed when a roof collapsed rain was heavy throughout impacted region with highest totals in guerrero highest total was at paso de san antonio to east of point of landfall tropical storm cristina on july 1 a tropical wave organized into tropical depression five e location of depression was easternmost since depression that eventually became hurricane paul in 1982 season five e strengthened into tropical storm cristina on july 2 as it continued its west northwest track cristina was almost a hurricane at time of its landfall near puerto angel on july 3 it peak strength which occurred at landfall was and cristina dissipated over mountains of mexico on july 3 as a whole both cristina s intensity and track were well forecast however tropical cyclone s short life made verification of a small number of forecasts limited when cristina was approaching mexican government issued a tropical storm warning for coast between and punta maldonado on july 2 tropical storm cristina killed one person a fisherman who was aboard a boat caught at sea another person from that boat was missing and a third individual was rescued eleven other fishing boats with a total of twenty two people aboard were missing their fate is unknown national hurricane center received no reports of damage due to tropical storm cristina however there was flooding due to storm surge and damage from wind it also produced rain tropical depression six e on july 4 a persistent area of thunderstorms organized into a tropical depression weak steering currents slowly moved it northwest easterly wind shear inhibited development of system despite wind shear six e was forecast to strengthen into a tropical storm but it instead weakened to a swirl of clouds and advisories were ended on july 5 tropical depression six e dissipated on july 6 at its peak strength six e had winds of and a central pressure of this cyclone never came ashore consequently no reports of damage or deaths were received by national hurricane center hurricane douglas hurricane douglas was a continuation of atlantic hurricane cesar which crossed central america continuing cesar s nearly due west heading it was still a tropical storm when it entered pacific on july 29 and quickly regained hurricane status douglas strengthened over next two days as it turned west northwest paralleling coast of mexico it reached its peak intensity on august 1 with winds of 130 mph 215 km h and a central pressure of making it strongest hurricane of season at a category 4 strength it slow weakening began on august 2 as it entered cooler waters and it officially dissipated on august 6 though like many pacific hurricanes a remnant circulation could be tracked westward for several days afterward compared with long term average hurricane douglas was a well forecast storm cyclone passed close enough to mexico to necessitate a tropical storm warning starting on july 29 for coast from salina cruz to acapulco with a watch along a further section of coast watches and warnings were discontinued on july 30 hurricane douglas brought up to 6 in 150 mm of rain on south coast of mexico and resulted in a 4 ft 1 2 m storm surge no deaths or damages were attributed to douglas portion of hurricane cesar douglas tropical depression seventeen w a tropical depression which formed august 13 from a cutoff area of low pressure area crossed dateline on august 14 it continued to head east passing close to midway island it dissipated on august 14 although remnants of system hung around area for a few more days at its strongest in central north pacific tropical depression seventeen w had winds of and a pressure of seventeen w brought light winds with gusts reaching gale force to midway island it also brought about 2 5 in 63 5 mm of rain after cyclone dissipated showers and gusty winds continued to occur on midway and kure for a few more days seventeen w was first tropical cyclone to cross international dateline in either direction since typhoon john in 1994 season tropical depression dolly hurricane dolly struck eastern mexico and managed to hold together remaining a tropical depression as it entered eastern pacific ocean late on august 24 although tropical depression dolly entered eastern pacific national hurricane center did not re classify system no re intensification occurred after system entered eastern pacific and it had dissipated as a tropical cyclone by following day about 40 mi 65 km west of san juanito in islas marias tropical storm elida a tropical wave organized into tropical depression eight e on august 30 cyclone paralleled coast of mexico and also gradually decelerated despite some wind shear eight e strengthened into a tropical storm on september 2 and was named elida on september 3 and 4 elida came close to southern tip of baja california peninsula at its peak intensity of and winds of 65 mph 100 km h cyclone then drifted into cooler waters was devoid of deep convection on september 5 and dissipated next day storm was forecast slightly better than long term averages for eastern north pacific elida posed enough of a threat to baja california peninsula to require a tropical storm warning for baja california peninsula south of cabo san lazaro on september 3 warning was lifted on september 5 after threat ended moderate to heavy rains fell in association with tropical cyclone across southwest mexico and baja california peninsula with maxima falling at san marcos compostela in southwest mainland mexico which measured and a maximum for baja california of at la poza honda comondu while passing offshore tropical storm killed six people and affected 1 200 others but elida caused no known damage hurricane fausto precursor disturbance to fausto was first noticed over venezuela as early as august 31 and may have been related to tropical wave that spawned hurricane fran by september 4 wave had crossed central america into pacific it steadily organized until it was upgraded to tropical storm fausto on september 10 fausto intensified rapidly after it reached hurricane intensity on september 12 peaking with sustained winds of and a minimum central pressure of 955 mb hurricane weakened as an approaching trough increased shear over storm this same trough also turned storm north on september 13 where it made landfall as a minimal hurricane on baja california that day on september 14 storm turned northeastward across gulf of california and dissipated inland over sierra madre range after its second landfall as a hurricane its extratropical remnants flared up briefly over northern mexico and u s state of texas but otherwise soon lost their identity heavy rainfall was accompanied with passage of this cyclone with a storm total of 18 50 inches 470 mm reported at san vicente de la sierra damage in mexico was relatively minor with only a single casualty caused by a downed power line damage totaled to around 800 000 1996 usd tropical depression one c a tropical disturbance organized into a tropical depression on september 15 it headed west until september 17 that day it turned to west for two days before heading back west northwest on september 19 it soon began to weaken and dissipated next day at its most intense tropical depression one c had winds of 35 mph 55 km h and unknown pressure tropical cyclone caused no known impact and never came near land tropical storm genevieve in gulf of tehuantepec an area of disturbed weather containing convection formed on september 23 it moved westward without incident until september 27 when it developed stronger convection and became tropical depression ten e immediately thereafter it strengthened into a tropical storm and was named genevieve while it continued its westward track genevieve slowly got better organized and reached its peak intensity of and 50 mph 85 km h on september 29 tropical storm then turned to west southwest as steering currents collapsed cyclone began a time of erratic motion which included two loops erratic motion also exposed genevieve to wind shear and tropical storm weakened to a tropical depression on october 1 on october 6 shear temporarily weakened and tropical depression genevieve restrengthened into a tropical storm cyclone s wandering continued and it entrained dry air this dry air weakened system to a depression for a second time on october 8 and genevieve dissipated next day brief flare ups of convection could still be seen for a few days thereafter tropical storm genevieve was a rather poorly forecast storm most tropical cyclone prediction models indicated a northwesterly track that never happened and also over intensified system in addition advisories on tropical depression genevieve were discontinued on october 3 and only resumed three days later later analysis determined that genevieve had been a tropical depression for this whole time tropical storm genevieve never came near land and consequently no watches or warnings were required for any location tropical cyclone had no impact on any land hurricane hernan on september 30 a tropical wave organized into tropical depression eleven e gradual strengthening ensued and depression strengthened into a tropical storm twelve hours later and was named hernan hernan s initial track was to west but system gradually started to recurve its center of circulation reformed and hernan briefly turned to northwest again by october 2 and hernan was close to coast it strengthened into a hurricane that day late on october 2 and early on october 3 hernan closely paralleled coast interaction with land weakened cyclone and when hernan made landfall on october 3 near barra de navidad jalisco it was only a minimal hurricane land weakened cyclone and by time it emerged into ocean north of puerto vallarta it was so disorganized that it dissipated on october 5 at its strongest hurricane hernan had winds of 85 mph 140 km h and a central pressure of national hurricane center forecasts on hurricane were generally forecast slightly worse than average system errors by tropical cyclone prediction models were attributed mainly to hernan s recurvature in terms of intensity this system was correctly predicted to become a hurricane although advisories its eventual intensity for coast from acapulco to manzanillo a tropical storm warning was issued on october 1 a hurricane watch was issued from zihuatanejo to manzanillo on october 2 it was upgraded to a warning later that day also on october 2 coast from manzanillo to san blas was placed under a tropical storm warning meanwhile hurricane warning was extended to cabo corrientes on october 3 hurricane warning was extended to san blas and tropical storm warning was extended to mazatlan because it made landfall in a sparsely populated area hernan killed no one around 1 000 homes were damaged or destroyed and 100 people were injured flooding occurred in jalisco flooding also caused washed out roads along mexico route 200 and 80 in many areas telephone service was interrupted and power outages occurred along coasts of colima and jalisco waves caused by hernan reached 13 ft 3 9 m in height tropical depression twelve e a system acquired enough convection and became organized enough to be considered a tropical depression on november 7 although environment was initially favourable and system was almost upgraded into a tropical storm as was forecast wind shear kept cyclone weak its convection was eventually destroyed and advisories were ended on november 10 twelve e dissipated on november 11 and no deaths or damages were reported season effects one e bgcolor bgcolor bgcolor none none two e bgcolor bgcolor bgcolor none none none alma bgcolor bgcolor bgcolor western mexico
