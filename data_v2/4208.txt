qualified praise with mildred dolores wrote a commentary on poem in that while it was not of same quality as poems of golden age writers it is a better work than other contemporary poems authorship and date not much is known about orientius he is mentioned in passing by venantius fortunatus in his vita s martini and a brief description of his life appears in acta sanctorum tobin 1945 pp 23 from what information is available he was evidently a gaul who had converted to christianity after realizing that he had been living a sinful life he eventually became bishop of augusta what is modern day auch france he devoted remainder of his life to promoting christian spirituality to his followers and it is almost certain that commonitorium was result of this devotion tobin 1945 p 3 given paucity of information concerning orientius himself dating his poem has proven difficult although there are several clues that have helped scholars construct a timeframe in which commonitorium was likely written and published first a short section in poem s second book explicitly references ad 406 invasion of gaul by various barbarian tribes suggesting that poem was written sometime after this event fielding 2014 p 570 second vita s martini claims that when orientius was near end of his life he was sent sometime in mid 5th century by visigothic king theodoric i d 451 to roman commanders flavius aetius d 454 and d 439 to negotiate peace between rome and visigoths given these reference points tobin suggests that poem was likely written ad 430 contents summary commonitorium focuses mostly on morality teaching one how to attain eternal salvation poem can be roughly divided into seven main sections an introduction a discussion of two fold life of man an explanation for why humans exist a discussion on how to worship god considerations for reader an exhortation on importance of trinitarianism and a conclusion tobin 1945 pp 67 in first section poet invites reader to read poem before calling upon god to offer guidance in second portion poet discusses difference between body and soul in third section orientius explains why humans were created tobin 1945 p 6 in fourth section poet lays out ways humans can love god by keeping his commandments namely great commandment by believing in resurrection of dead by praying for strength and by avoiding sin in fifth section poet considers a number of issues including sorrow joy death judgement eternal punishment and rewards awaiting in heaven in penultimate portion of poem orientius stresses utmost importance of believing in trinity work then concludes with both a request that reader pray for orientius as well as a blessing upon reader tobin 1945 p 7 work today is divided into two books one comprising first 618 lines and other containing remaining 418 tobin however argues that poem is a unit and there is no suitable place for a divisions into books she notes that divide is somewhat arbitrary as it a discussion of seven sins she also argues that while there is an address to reader that is traditionally thought of as start to second book this need not be construed as a proper book opening tobin proposes that divide in poem was likely made due either to practical reasons for instance entire poem might not have fit on a certain sized manuscript roll or because it was at this point that poet stopped writing only to take up poem some time later style commonitorium which is written in elegiac couplets is a hortatory and didactic poem while work is mostly of a and protreptic character latinist johannes schwind notes that work is also interjected with occasional elements of diatribe and satire when orientius was writing rhetoric was particularly popular but commonitorium largely eschews this style and its associated devices instead opting to focus on poetics individual who orientius most frequently imitates is augustan poet virgil next comes imperial poet ovid whose influence according to mildred dolores tobin is only slightly less than vergil followed by augustan lyric poet horace tobin 1945 p 13 commonitorium also contains references allusions and borrowings from republican poets lucretius and catullus as well as imperial martial and imperial satirist juvenal in terms of christian poetic influence orientius frequently emulates coelius sedulius fl early 5th century ad and possibly prudentius fl late 4th century ad fortescue 1911 and being a christian work commonitorium recalls bible both by referencing biblical stories as well as by directly imitating wording from many books therein it is likely that orientius used vulgate translation of bible as his source although some lines suggest that poet may have also used vetus latina textual history thumb right commonitorium was rediscovered at anchin abbey c 1600 commonitorium was lost sometime in middle ages only to be rediscovered near turn of seventeenth century at anchin abbey in a manuscript known as codex aquicinctensis finder of poem a jesuit named turned it over to his colleague theologian and latinist martin delrio who dubbed work commonitorium and published editio princeps of it in 1600 this edition was marred by fact that codex thus delrio s only first book of commonitorium almost a century later in 1791 a second manuscript codex ashburnhamensis also known as codex was discovered at abbey tours that contained second book thereby enabling french benedictine historian and edmond martene to publish first complete edition of poem in 1700 tobin 1945 p 1 fielding 2014 p 569 in 1774 italian and patristic scholar andrea published a second complete edition of poem in 1888 classicist robinson ellis published an edition of work which in 1911 adrian fortescue referred to as best modern edition in 1841 guglielmo libri dalla stole codex ashburnhamensis and sold it to bertram ashburnham 4th earl of ashburnham hence its common name and today commonitorium is preserved in only this manuscript as codex aquicinctensis was long ago lost hudson williams 1949 p 130 tobin 1945 p 8 codex aquicinctensis also contained two prayers and four short poems all of which have been attributed to orientius schwind 2006 reception mildred dolores tobin who wrote a commentary on commonitorium in 1945 argued that while orientius s work was not of same quality as poems of golden age writers it does approach nearer standards set by poets of that age than majority of late latin poetry tobin 1945 p 5 ultimately tobin praises poem for its simplicity and its direct classical style however she qualifies her praise by pointing out that some of work s best portions are those that have been borrowed from classical authors which weakens overall impact of orientius s work to some degree a few years later a hudson williams wrote that poem s language is in general clear and direct though tinged here and there with turns of a decidedly late flavour footnotes references bibliography further reading latin copies english
