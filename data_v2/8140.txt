fasci gained support of poorest and most exploited classes of island by channeling their frustration and discontent into a coherent programme based on establishment of new rights consisting of a jumble of traditionalist sentiment religiosity and socialist consciousness movement reached its apex in summer of 1893 when new conditions were presented to landowners and mine owners of sicily concerning renewal of and rental contracts upon rejection of these conditions there was an outburst of strikes that rapidly spread throughout island and was marked by violent social conflict almost

present pp 124 25 according to marxist historian eric hobsbawm fasci were millenarian insofar as socialism preached by movement was seen by sicilian peasantry as a new religion true religion of christ

catania by giuseppe de felice giuffrida an earlier fascio was set up in messina on march 18 1889 but was dormant after its founder nicola petrina was arrested in july of that year and not released until 1892 another reason why first fascio of messina formed after example of fasci workers leagues constituted in central and north italy from 1871 did not develop was that it brought together not individual workers but workers associations of city which retained their independence their status and economic orientation other leaders included rosario garibaldi bosco in palermo nicola barbato in piana dei greci bernardino verro in corleone and lorenzo in santo stefano while ruling elite depicted men of fasci as treasonous socialists communists and anarchists seeking to overthrow monarchy in
