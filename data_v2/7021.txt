produce back of love and band s third album whose working title was happy loss adams p p 91 single which became band s first uk top 20 hit single was recorded in early 1982 at trident studios in soho london this was unusual as band s manager bill drummond had previously been keen to keep band away from temptations of london recording session for back of love went well but relationship between band members was strained with them either not speaking to each other or when they did arguing adams pp 86 87 drummond was aware of tensions within band and so arranged a tour in scotland for april 1982 this was done in an effort to make band work harder write some songs and to communicate with each other drummond s plan failed to work as following tour there was still tension between band members adams p 87 two other album tracks clay and my white devil were first played during tour of scotland following release of back of love on 21 may 1982 band spent summer first playing at inaugural womad festival and then playing at various european music festivals after summer band resumed recording album at rockfield studios in south wales which had been used for band s first two albums and also at amazon studios in liverpool recording album was a slow process de freitas said porcupine was very hard to actually write and record heaven up here was pure confidence we did it really quickly we had a great time doing it but this one was like we had to drag it out of ourselves mcculloch later said that when recording album mood between band members was horrible when presented with finished album wea rejected it as too uncommercial adams p 92 band agreed to re record album despite sergeant s complaints using original version of album as a blueprint follow up recording sessions went more smoothly drummond brought shankar back to add strings to other tracks on album it was these sessions that produced band s next single cutter which was released in january 1983 and went on to become band s first top 10 hit adams 94 95 porcupine an atlas adventure thumb left 200px a screenshot from cutter music video showing echo bunnymen in icy landscape of iceland alt four men in a bleak icy landscape man on left is sitting two middle men are lying down and man on right is standing after echo bunnymen had finished recording porcupine they played a free show in early november 1982 for people at sefton park in liverpool following this wea asked for three music videos and album art for new album band s lighting engineer bill butt was chosen to direct videos and brian griffin was chosen to take photographs for album s cover as he had done for band s two previous albums with a budget of ps butt decided that it would be possible to get photographs for album cover and also to produce a half hour film adams pg 93 deciding that he wanted videos to reflect frigid feel of music on album butt chose to shoot videos in scotland however it was not certain that there would be enough snow in scotland during november so iceland was chosen as location to shoot videos filming took place on and near frozen waterfall near reykjavik feeling it was a dangerous process mcculloch said in 1993 if we had slipped there wasn t anything for hundreds of feet below us in 2001 griffin said sun barely appeared whole time we were there to walk stand up or just think seemed a massive effort despite danger filming proved its worth when british music magazine q said in 2001 porcupine cover is epitome of rock band as heroic archetype young men on some ill defined but glorious mission one easily as timeless as stars and sea adams pg 94 filming was finished in december 1982 with band performing songs from album at their rehearsal room at ministry butt interspersed this with clips from 1929 russian documentary man with movie camera and he also projected psychedelic watercolour effects onto band a vhs video was subsequently released by castle in 1983 called porcupine an atlas adventure which contained six music videos in bluer skies cutter my white devil porcupine heads will roll and back of love describing album cover journalist dave rimmer wrote in british music magazine smash hits iceland does seem an appropriate location for this group it s isolated cold bleak and fits perfectly with moody image they ve attracted to themselves musical content after wea rejected first version of album shankar who had played strings on back of love was brought back by drummond to add strings to remainder of album in an effort to give it a brighter production and to build on success of strings used on single when recording cutter sergeant had asked shankar if he could suggest melody from cat stevens 1967 hit matthew and son in 1984 mcculloch said i think porcupine was a classic autobiographical album most honest thing that i d ever written or sung adams p 101 talking about how album made him feel he went on to say i found material from it really heavy to play like really oppressive that s only reason why i didn t like album songs were great but it didn t make me happy he also said a lot of songs are about coming to terms with opposites in me adams p 103

included on 2003 remastered version of album as a bonus track reception following release of porcupine in 1983 nme reviewer barney hoskyns gave album a negative review hoskyns wrote porcupine is distressing occasion of an important and exciting rock group becoming ensnared by its own strongest points a dynamic force striving fruitlessly to escape brilliant track that trails behind it hoskyns likened sound of album to band turning on their own greatest hits and savaging them hoskyns also criticised mcculloch s lyrics and general mood of album noting only on porcupine itself do various strains of despair coalesce and dismissed entire second side of album saying it horrifies more for its uniform lack of inspiration for fact that every number cops direct from earlier songs without preserving anything of their energy or invention record reviewer wayne king similarly commented that album reused many motifs such as ian mccullough s octave jumps from their previous albums while he praised opening tracks cutter and back of love he remarked that porcupine as a whole was not nearly as good an album as echo and bunnymen s live performances showed they were capable of in a review of original release on allmusic porcupine was described as a solid outing a noticeably better listen than its predecessor heaven up here and well worth hearing when reviewing remastered 2003 version review was expanded to add that new release was a very well done expansion of an already fine album blender magazine described album in a review on their website as impossibly exciting pop rock and pitchfork called album band s definitive statement and described track back of love as astonishing highlight of group s career cmj critic eric wrote that constant emotional peaks and valleys of porcupine may be perhaps too strong for some but musical peaks achieved in getting there are really something to behold album appeared in 1983 end of year critics lists for both melody maker where it
