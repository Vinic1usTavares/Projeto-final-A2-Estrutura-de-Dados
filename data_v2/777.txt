poorly maintained for most of her career including a twenty year long period between russo turkish war in 1877 1878 and greco turkish war of 1897 as a result she was in very poor condition by late 1890s which prompted a major reconstruction of her into a pre dreadnought design type vessel in genoa ship s armament was overhauled though gun turrets that were to have mounted guns never received weapons a new propulsion system was also installed which significantly improved performance ship saw extensive action during first balkan war in 1912 1913 including battles of elli and lemnos in
