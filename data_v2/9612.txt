signing davor suker from real madrid player was prepared to take a pay cut to join club club then signed juventus forward thierry henry for a club record fee of ps11 million wenger who served as player s mentor at monaco believed his best position was as a goalscorer he was top scorer in under 17s for france when i first had him and i think that as well as having qualities of youth pace and power he is a good finisher that is something he has not worked on enough in last two years because he has played more wide but i think he can become a central striker again that is what we will try to develop together other additions to squad included sylvinho and oleh luzhny striker luis boa morte moved to southampton in august 1999 while midfielder stephen hughes completed his transfer to

in april had benefited from league being organised in their favour they had a winter break they didn t play in fa cup it was all wrong from start break was good for them because at same time we dropped points and so did other teams so when they came back they had psychological advantage petit scored a 90th minute winner for arsenal against west ham united and a further win against chelsea
