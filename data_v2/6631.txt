conte di cavour was name ship of three dreadnought battleships built for royal italian navy in 1910s completed in 1915 she served during world war i although she was little used and saw no combat ship supported operations during corfu incident in 1923 and spent much of rest of decade in reserve she was rebuilt between 1933 and 1937 with more powerful guns additional armor and considerably more speed than before during world war ii both conte di cavour and her sister ship participated in battle of calabria in july 1940 where latter was lightly damaged conte di cavour was badly damaged when british torpedo bombers attacked fleet at taranto in november 1940 she was deliberately run aground with most of her hull underwater and repairs were not completed before italian armistice in september 1943 ship was then captured by germans but they made no effort to finish her repairs she was damaged in an allied air raid in early 1945 and capsized a week later conte di cavour was eventually scrapped in 1946 description conte di cavour class was designed to counter french dreadnoughts which caused them to be slower and more heavily armored than first italian dreadnought giorgerini p 269 ships were long at waterline and overall they had a beam of and a draft of gardiner gray p 259 conte di cavour class ships displaced at normal load and at deep load they had a crew of 31 officers and 969 enlisted men giorgerini pp 270 272 ships were powered by three sets of parsons steam turbines two sets driving outer propeller shafts and one set two inner shafts steam for turbines was provided by twenty blechynden water tube boilers eight of which burned oil and twelve of which burned both fuel oil and coal designed to reach a maximum speed of from conte di cavour failed to reach this goal on her sea trials despite mildly exceeding rated power of her turbines reaching only from ships carried enough coal and oilgiorgerini pp 268 272 to give them a range of at armament and armor thumb left upright 1 2 layout of main armament main battery of conte di cavour class consisted of thirteen 305 millimeter model 1909 guns in five centerline gun turrets with a twin gun turret superfiring over a triple gun turret in fore and aft pairs and a third triple turret amidships hore p 175 their secondary armament consisted of eighteen guns mounted in casemates on sides of hull in single mounts for defense against torpedo boats ships carried fourteen guns thirteen of these could be mounted on turret tops but they could also be positioned in 30 different locations including some on forecastle and upper decks they were also fitted with three submerged torpedo tubes one on each broadside and third in stern giorgerini pp 268 277 278 conte di cavour class ships had a complete waterline armor belt that had a maximum thickness of amidships which reduced to towards stern and towards bow they had two armored decks main deck was thick on flat that increased to on slopes that connected it to main belt second deck was thick frontal armor of gun turrets was in thickness and sides were thick armor protecting their barbettes ranged in thickness from walls of forward conning tower were 280 millimeters thick giorgerini pp 270 272mclaughlin p 421 modifications and reconstruction shortly after end of world war i number of 76 2 mm low angle guns was reduced to 13 all mounted on turret tops and six new 76 2 mm anti aircraft aa guns were installed abreast aft funnel in addition two license built 2 pounder aa guns were mounted on forecastle deck in 1925 1926 foremast was replaced by a four legged tetrapodal mast which was moved forward of funnels giorgerini p 277 rangefinders were upgraded and ship was equipped to handle a macchi m 18 seaplane mounted on amidships turret around same time she was equipped with a fixed aircraft catapult on port side of forecastle whitley p grossman p gay p 18 thumb left upright 1 3 office of naval intelligence drawing

shipyard in trieste that lasted until june 1937 bargoni gay p 19 a new bow section was grafted over existing bow which increased her overall length by to and her beam increased to ship s draft at deep load increased to all of changes made increased her displacement to at standard load and at deep load ship s crew increased to 1 260 officers and enlisted men brescia p 58 two of propeller shafts were removed and existing turbines were replaced by two belluzzo geared steam turbines rated at boilers were replaced by eight yarrow boilers in service her maximum speed was about and she had a range of at a speed of bagnasco grossman pp 64 65 thumb stern view of conte di cavour about 1938 main guns were bored out to and amidships turret and torpedo tubes were removed all of existing secondary armament and aa guns were replaced by a dozen 120 mm guns in six twin gun turrets and eight aa guns in twin turrets in addition ship was fitted with a dozen breda light aa guns in six twin gun mounts and twelve breda m31 anti aircraft machine guns also in twin mounts bagnasco grossman p 65 in 1940 13 2 mm machine guns were replaced by aa guns in twin mounts tetrapodal mast was replaced with a new forward conning tower protected with thick armor bargoni gay p 21 atop conning tower there was a fire control director fitted with two large stereo rangefinders with a base length of deck armor was increased during reconstruction to a total of over engine and boiler rooms and over magazines although its distribution over three decks meant that it was considerably less effective than a single plate of same thickness armor protecting barbettes was reinforced with plates all this armor weighed a total of existing underwater protection was replaced by pugliese torpedo defense system a large cylinder surrounded by fuel oil or water that was intended to absorb blast of a torpedo warhead it lacked enough depth to be fully effective against contemporary torpedoes a major problem of reconstruction was that ship s increased draft meant that their waterline armor belt was almost completely submerged with any significant load mclaughlin pp 421 422 construction and service thumb conte di cavour off taranto 1919 conte di cavour named after statesman count camillo benso di cavour silverstone p 296 was laid down at arsenale di la spezia la spezia on 10 august 1910 and launched on 10 august 1911 she was completed on 1 april 1915 and served as a flagship in southern adriatic sea during world war i preston p 176 she saw no action however and spent little time at sea admiral paolo thaon di revel italian naval chief of staff believed that austro hungarian submarines and minelayers could operate too effectively in narrow waters of adriatic halpern p 150 threat from these underwater weapons to his capital ships was too serious for him to actively deploy fleet instead revel decided to implement a blockade at relatively safer southern end of adriatic with battle fleet while smaller vessels such as mas torpedo boats conducted raids on austro hungarian ships and installations meanwhile revel s battleships would be preserved to confront austro hungarian battle fleet in event that it sought a decisive engagement halpern pp 141 142 in 1919 she sailed to north america and visited ports in united states as well as halifax canada ship was mostly inactive in 1921 because of personnel shortages and was refitted at la spezia from november to march 1922 conte di cavour and giulio cesare supported italian operations on corfu in 1923 after an italian general and his staff were murdered at greek albanian frontier italian leader benito mussolini who had been looking for a pretext to seize corfu ordered italian troops to occupy island conte di cavour bombarded main town on island with her 76 mm guns killing 20 civilians and wounding 32 she escorted king victor emmanuel iii and his wife aboard dante alighieri on a state visit to spain in 1924 and was placed in reserve upon her return until 1926 when in april she conveyed mussolini on a voyage to libya ship was again placed in reserve from 1927 until 1933 when she began her reconstruction whitley pp 158 161 world war ii thumb conte di cavour opening fire during battle of calabria early in world war ii conte di cavour and her sister took part in battle of calabria also known as battle of punto stilo on 9 july 1940 they were part of 1st battle squadron commanded by admiral inigo campioni when they engaged major elements of british mediterranean fleet british were escorting a convoy from malta to alexandria while italians had finished escorting another from naples to benghazi italian libya vice admiral andrew cunningham commander of mediterranean fleet attempted to interpose his ships between italians and their base at taranto crews on fleets spotted each other in middle of afternoon and italian battleships opened fire at 15 53 at a range of nearly two leading british battleships and replied a minute later three minutes after she opened fire shells from giulio cesare began to straddle warspite which made a small turn and increased speed to throw off italian ship s aim at 16 00 at same time a shell from warspite struck giulio cesare at a distance of about uncertain how severe damage was campioni ordered his battleships to turn away in face of superior british numbers and they successfully disengaged o hara pp 28 35 repairs to giulio cesare were completed by end of august and both ships unsuccessfully attempted to intercept british convoys to malta in august and september whitley p 161 on night of 11 november 1940 conte di cavour was at anchor in taranto harbor when she was attacked along with several other warships by 21 fairey swordfish torpedo bombers from british aircraft carrier ship s gunners shot down one swordfish shortly after aircraft dropped its torpedo but it exploded underneath b turret at 23 15 knocking out main bow pump her captain requested tugboats to help ground ship on a nearby sandbank at 23 27 but admiral bruno commander of 5th battleship division vetoed request until it was too late and conte di cavour had to use a deeper sandbank at 04 45 following morning she initially grounded on an even keel but temporarily took on a 50 degree list before settling to bottom at 08 00 with an 11 5 degree list only her superstructure and gun turrets were above water by this time cernuschi o hara pp 81 85 88 conte di cavour had lowest priority for salvage among three battleships sunk during attack and little work was done for several months first priority was to patch holes in hull and then her guns and parts of her superstructure were removed to lighten ship false bulwarks were welded to upper sides of hull to prevent water from reentering hull and pumping water overboard began in may 1941 some of water were pumped out before conte di cavour was refloated on 9 june and entered ex austro hungarian floating dry dock go 12 on 12 july damage was more extensive than originally thought and temporary repairs to enable ship to reach trieste for permanent repairs took until 22 december cernuschi o hara pp 88 92 her guns were operable by september 1942 but replacing her entire electrical system took longer so navy took advantage of delays and incorporated some modifications to reduce likelihood of flooding based on lessons learned from attack cernuschi o hara p 92 other changes planned were replacement of her secondary and anti aircraft weapons with a dozen dual purpose guns in twin mounts twelve and twenty three 20 mm aa guns repair work was suspended in june 1943 with an estimated six months work remaining on conte di cavour in order to expedite construction of urgently needed smaller ships she was captured by germans on 8 september when italy surrendered to allies and was reduced to a hulk she was damaged in an air raid on 17 february 1945 and capsized on 23 february cernuschi o hara pp 92 93 refloated
