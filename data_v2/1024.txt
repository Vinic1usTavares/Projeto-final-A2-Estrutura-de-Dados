his former patron henry i david supported claims of henry s daughter and his own niece empress matilda to throne of england in process he came into conflict with king stephen and was able to expand his power in northern england despite his defeat at battle of standard in 1138 term davidian revolution is used by many scholars to summarise changes which took place in scotland during his reign

at thurso eystein forced harald to pay fealty as a condition of his release later in year david hastily responded by supporting claims to orkney earldom of harald s rival erlend haraldsson granting him half of caithness in opposition to harald king eystein responded in turn by making a similar grant to this same erlend cancelling effect of david s grant david s weakness in orkney was that

david used stephen s usurpation as his casus belli with england even if it was not actual reason david s relationship with england and english crown in these years is usually interpreted in two ways

david was latter s brother in law and greatest protege oram lordship of galloway pp 59 63 one of henry s new men kapelle norman conquest pp 202 3 his hostility to stephen can be interpreted as an

kapelle norman conquest of north pp blanchard lothian and beyond pp 23 46 however david s policy towards england can be interpreted in an additional way david was independence loving king trying to build a scoto northumbrian realm by seizing most northerly parts of english kingdom in this perspective david s support for matilda is used as a pretext for land grabbing david s maternal descent from house of wessex and his son henry s maternal descent from english earls of northumberland is thought to have further encouraged such a project a project which came to an end only after henry ii ordered david s child successor mael coluim iv to hand over most important of david s gains it is clear that neither one of these interpretations can be taken without some weight being given to other

cardinal john paparo met david at his residence of carlisle in september 1151 tantalisingly for david cardinal was on his way to ireland with four to create four new irish when cardinal returned to carlisle david made request in david s plan new archdiocese would include all bishoprics in david s scottish territory as well as bishopric of orkney and bishopric of isles unfortunately for david

marked for young king s chastity and religious fervour perhaps greatest blow to david s plans came on 12 july 1152 when henry earl of northumberland david s only son and heir died he had probably been suffering from some kind of illness for a long time david had under a year to live and he may have known that he was not going to be alive much longer david quickly arranged for his grandson malcolm iv to be made his successor and for his younger grandson william to be made earl of northumberland donnchad i mormaer of fife senior magnate in scotland proper was appointed as rector or regent and took 11 year old malcolm around scotland proper on a tour to meet and gain homage of his future gaelic subjects david s health began to fail seriously in spring of 1153 and on 24 may 1153 david died

reputation earliest assessments of david i portray him as a pious king a reformer and a civilising agent in a barbarian nation for william of newburgh david was a king not barbarous of a barbarous nation who wisely tempered fierceness of his barbarous nation william praises david for his piety noting that among other saintly activities he was frequent in washing feet of poor this can be read literally his mother who is now patron saint of scotland was widely known and lauded for same practice a o anderson early sources p 231 another of david s eulogists his former courtier ailred of rievaulx echoes newburgh s assertions and praises david for his justice as well as his piety commenting that david s rule of scots meant that whole barbarity of that nation was softened as if forgetting their natural fierceness they submitted their necks to laws which royal gentleness dictated a o anderson early sources pp 232 3 although avoiding stress on 12th century scottish barbarity lowland scottish historians of later middle ages tend to repeat accounts of earlier chronicle tradition much that was written was either directly transcribed from earlier medieval chronicles themselves or was modelled closely upon them even in significant works of john of fordun andrew wyntoun and walter bower felix j h skene william forbes skene ed john of fordun s chronicle of scottish nation edinburgh 1872 200ff donaldson sources of scottish history p 34 at what point its information about scotland should receive credence is far from clear though wyntoun fordun and bower may have had access to documents which are no longer extant much of their information is either duplicated in other records or cannot be corroborated for a survey of david s historical reputation see oram david pp 203 25 for example bower includes in his text eulogy written for david by ailred of rievaulx this quotation extends to over twenty pages in modern edition and exerted a great deal of influence over what became traditional view of david in later works about scottish history john macqueen macqueen and d e r watt eds scotichronicon by walter bower vol 3 aberdeen 1995 historical treatment of david developed in writings of later scottish historians and writings of men like john mair george buchanan hector boece and bishop john leslie ensured that by 18th century a picture of david as a pious justice loving state builder and vigorous maintainer of scottish independence had emerged oram david pp 213 7 modern treatment thumb 180px statue of david i on west door of st giles high kirk edinburgh in modern period there has been more of an emphasis on david s and on effects of his changes on scottish cultural development lowland scots tended to trace origins of their culture to marriage of david s father mael coluim iii to saint margaret a myth which had its origins in medieval period see for instance steve boardman late medieval scotland and matter of britain in edward j cowan and richard j finlay eds scottish history power of past edinburgh 2002 pp 65 71 with development of modern historical techniques in mid 19th century responsibility for these developments appeared to lie more with david than his father david assumed a principal place in alleged destruction of celtic kingdom of scotland andrew lang in 1900 wrote that with alexander i celtic domination ends with david norman and english dominance is established quoted in oram david p 219 citing lang a history of scotland vol 1 pp 102 9 lang did not neglect old myth about margaret writing of northumbrian refugees arriving in scotland where they became sires of sturdy lowland race lang a history of scotland vol 1 p 91 ages of enlightenment and romanticism had elevated role of races and

better understanding of david s revolution can be achieved by recognising wider european revolution taking place during this period central idea is that from late 10th century onwards culture and institutions of old carolingian heartlands in northern france and western germany were spreading to outlying areas creating a more recognisable europe scotland was just one of many outlying areas
