times review published ten days after show premiered describes what critic caryn james thought was distinctive about show in 2002 virginia heffernan of slate complimented chemistry between meredith vieira star jones joy behar and barbara walters writing that women have eased completely into stock sensibility of middle aged talk shows embracing imperatives that one be healthy careful temperate charitable and moderately cutesy while at same time skeptical ribald and world weary in 2007 ken tucker of entertainment weekly praised show writing that it does for daytime what daily show does for nighttime it reflects pent up frustrations pleasures and hostilities its audience has toward pop and political culture during her first run on show while regarded as outspoken rosie o donnell was criticized for not acting as a moderator oftentimes during discussions during which she would her own often liberal viewpoints due to this o donnell faced backlash from conservative media outlets however as a big name talent she was credited for keeping show s buzz factor up conversely michael schulman of new yorker praised o donnell s time on show further elaborating that on a show that aspired to bring together women of all types o donnell pushed limits of what cheery daytime chatter could sustain and view became more heated and more interesting as a result appointment of jenny mccarthy as a co host attracted backlash largely due to her anti vaccination views david freeman senior science editor for huffington post wrote about concerns of bill nye who stated i believe ms mccarthy s views will be discredited alex of salon criticized decision writing anti vaccine conspiracist and view co host jenny mccarthy isn t just quirky she spreads lies that hurt people writing for guardian jill filipovic remarked other than what her anti vax views imply it s unclear whether she s intellectually checked in or not and that s part of problem outside of anti vaccine activism mccarthy has no record of political activism or even serious engagement with world michael specter of new yorker asserted that abc executives should be ashamed of themselves for offering mccarthy a regular platform on which she can peddle denialism and fear to parents of young children who may have legitimate questions about vaccine safety and that mccarthy s hiring was a strike against reason and progress and hope following walters retirement show faced criticism for constant changes in its lineup of co hosts namely one season stints of mccarthy rosie perez nicolle wallace and michelle collins respectively in july 2015 daniel d of time suggested that it was time for abc to end view citing show s inability to maintain a consistent panel as a factor in 2016 lisa de moraes of deadline hollywood wrote view s revolving door has been spinning so on show past few seasons that panelists these days do a lot of disagreement prefacing with you know i love you but as a pre emptive measure for inevitable they couldn t stand each other press reports whenever a panelist exits regarding changes television personality julie chen stated i mean i should know all of names of hosts and i don t cause it changes so often in 2017 new york post attributed show s resurgence in viewership to its political discussions david hinckley of huffpost opined that show has been successful in consistently implementing its original premise and that in regards to its co hosts it has sought to maintain a balance in areas like ethnicity and ideology while most of panelists over years have tilted a bit to left there has always been a voice from right that s unafraid to speak up writing for new york times in may 2019 amanda fitzsimons notes that what sets view apart from other entertainment and news programs is fascination with show s hosts and that it remains one of few places on tv where audiences can watch authentic human drama u s television ratings in november 2008 show s post election day
