piano instead of his usual guitar while band took a 12 month break following their previous studio album neon ballroom silverchair worked with composer van dyke parks on diorama album contains numerous orchestral arrangements and power ballads a change from grunge music typical of their earlier work but consistent with band s previous orchestrations on neon ballroom album s title refers to a world within a world five singles were released greatest view without you luv your life across night and after all these years all except after all these years a promotional single appeared on australian singles chart diorama was successful in charts but was not as well received by critics as band s earlier albums it reached number one on australian recording industry association aria

diorama was nominated for highest selling album in 2003 and three songs from album were nominated for awards over two years recording and production on diorama silverchair worked with a new producer david bottrill who replaced nick launay though launay had produced band s three previous albums lead singer daniel johns decided he needed someone who understood where he wanted to go johns believed diorama would be kind of record that people were either going to be into or were really going to hate and needed a producer who would understand band s new direction he interviewed several candidates eventually choosing bottrill and taking role of co producer himself johns initially recorded eight songs only to delete files thinking they were too similar to tracks on previous album neon ballroom leaving security and darkness of his earlier work he restarted from scratch to create something more uplifting diorama represented a radical change in silverchair s musical structure heavy grunge influence on their prior work was replaced by string and horn ensembles and highly complex song structures johns felt more comfortable in making this radical change rather than a minor one finding it helped him to regain his passion for music which had diminished during grunge days johns wrote much of album at a baby grand piano he had previously taught himself instrument and composed songs on it for first time with diorama this change in songwriting technique had a significant effect on sound of album johns commented on difference in how his vocals resonated with piano as compared to guitar he worked with others in developing album van dyke parks beach boys u2 collaborated on orchestral arrangements and pair spent much of their recording time attempting to describe music in metaphorical terms with johns describing parks orchestral swells as tidal waves and violins as a flock of birds pair described collaborative experience as mind blowing a dvd titled across night creation of diorama was released in 2002 featuring interviews with johns and parks several songs on diorama were inspired by johns then girlfriend natalie imbruglia but he cautioned against possible misinterpretations of songs stating everyone will think that any lyric that s about someone in a positive light will be about her and noting that there were other people he cared for about whom he wrote songs johns denied rumours that he had written songs intending imbruglia to sing them silverchair intended to tour supporting diorama following its release but plans were postponed when johns developed reactive arthritis causing his joints to swell and making guitar playing and singing too painful after performing greatest view at 2002 aria awards johns said that he wanted to perform dioramas 11 songs at least once in front of an audience before laying album to rest he travelled to california to receive treatments for his arthritis including daily physiotherapy album and single releases following a 31

canada it charted at number thirty six on billboards hot modern rock tracks in 2007 when re released alongside band s next album young modern johns wrote greatest view as a response to media always

guitarist chris joannou in november 1999 when he told fans band had a very small cache of recorded material stored away including without you without you was followed by luv your life which peaked at

afford therapy johns composed most of song s lyrics while listening to a therapist in a performance at london s shepherds bush empire johns jokingly said luv your life was dedicated to all my ladies

three out of five stars in us reviewer mark kemp praised silverchair s development saying that band had developed a strong independent musical ability in contrast to their heavily influenced debut album frogstomp kemp spoke highly of heavy orchestration unpredictable melodic shifts and a whimsical pop sensibility also noting parks arrangements gave music more breadth and depth he argued that album s strength was a product of johns confidence resulting in high quality on world upon your shoulders tuna in brine and after all these years however without you saw silverchair slip into old habits according to kemp and contained an mtv approved hook bradley torreano of review website allmusic gave diorama four stars labeling it an amg album pick he began by noting that silverchair s improvement from frogstomp era was impressive and that diorama saw band finally growing into their own skin bottrill s production was praised and result likened to big country and u2 while johns showcased his rich voice and shockingly catchy tunes with a gusto missing from their earlier albums torreano s criticism was reserved for two songs on album he described apparent goo goo dolls influences on without you as an unwelcome twist and felt that on one way mule band reverted back to their grunge sound james jam of music magazine nme was critical of diorama calling it over produced aussie rock jam compared silverchair to bryan adams in their attempt to venture boldly into exciting new musical landscapes tuna in brine was grossly pretentious and overblown while he saw album as a whole as inoffensive especially in comparison to band s past post grunge according to jam band were not trying to make a mature musical statement with album but rather to impress their parents nikki tranter of pop music website popmatters called album mature praising everything from cover art to finely crafted pop melodies tranter praised diorama for standing out in very similar australian music scene majority of songs on album were rated highly she thought greatest view was a stand out with orchestral twangs and after all these years had sweeping horns introspective lyrics and soft haunting vocals rob o connor of yahoo s music website gave diorama a positive review agreeing that band had matured greatly since their early high school releases pop songs on album luv your life and too much of not enough were said to glide and o connor praised johns for whisper ing his lyrics with grace and subtlety where in past he would shout in angst drawing comparisons to elliott smith his main critique of album was that it still contained some obligatory grunge efforts he felt eliminating those would allow band to reach its full potential commercial performance diorama charted highest in australia spending 50 weeks on aria albums chart including a week at number one this popularity was not matched in other countries it spent ten weeks or less on all other charts though reaching number
