1867 manhattan earthquake struck riley county kansas in united states on april 24 1867 at 20 22 utc or about strongest earthquake to originate in state it measured 5 1 on a seismic scale that is based on an isoseismal map or event s felt area earthquake s epicenter was near town of manhattan earthquake had a maximum perceived intensity of vii very strong on mercalli intensity scale it caused minor damage reports of which were confined to kansas iowa and missouri according to united states geological survey felt over an area of earthquake reached states of indiana illinois and possibly ohio though latter reports have been questioned manhattan is near nemaha ridge a long anticline structure that is bounded by several faults nearby in particular poses a threat to city kansas is not known for earthquake activity but an earthquake could occur at any time a 2016 hazard map from united states geological survey estimated a 1 or lower risk for a major earthquake in kansas for following year though scientists from agency think an earthquake of magnitude 7 0 remains possible background and geography thumb upright 1 3 humboldt fault red and midcontinent rift system green in kansas and nebraska alt a map displays humboldt fault located south of midcontinent rift system two briefly intersect earthquake s epicenter was near manhattan kansas a town just off confluence of kansas river and manhattan lies near nemaha ridge an anticline and 300 million year old precambrian granite range bounded by faults which likely produced earthquake it hosts which in addition to serving as range s easternmost boundary has produced a large portion of state s earthquakes a normal or dip slip fault it is responsible for at least several small tremors smaller than magnitude 2 7 each year fault cuts through permian rock despite being previously thought to be a simple precambrian structure according to geological society of america it may be a complex fault nemaha range lies roughly east of midcontinent rift which forms a layer of basaltic rock about 1 1 billion years old this rift extends northward to lake superior and surrounding area and southward to kansas then terminates abruptly also present in state is central kansas uplift faults of which produced several small earthquakes during late 1980s according to united states geological survey geophysicist don steeples earthquakes at humboldt zone have decreased and activity at uplift was increasing as of 1980s felt over an area of with other sources listing felt area as or 1867 earthquake followed midcontinent seismic trend unlike coastal earthquakes in united states events in central and east central sectors of country are spread out over extensive areas this occurs as a result of region s stiff soil and because earthquakes in kansas tend to occur at a shallow depth 1867 manhattan earthquake remains largest earthquake to originate in state though at least 25 have taken place since including another powerful earthquake north of manhattan in pottawatomie county in 2016 a magnitude 5 1 earthquake with an epicenter in oklahoma shook manhattan area according to a report in bulletin of seismological society of america frequency of moderately strong earthquakes within state is between 40 and 45 years one study found that between december 1977 and june 1989 more than 100 earthquakes were recognized by a seismograph network all were between 4 0 and 0 8 on richter magnitude scale damage and casualties originating at 20 22 utc or around 2 30 local time earthquake was assigned a maximum mercalli intensity scale of vii considered very strong minor damage occurred throughout geographical region including 22 counties in kansas and injuries were reported as well earthquake fractured walls downed chimneys and otherwise damaged structures even loosening stones within epicentral area near manhattan clocks stopped people felt electrical shocks and inhabitants were frightened following day an aftershock occurred between 3 and 4 a m damage within manhattan and a number of other communities may have been exacerbated by their location within alluvial valleys at a farm south of city of wamego earthquake caused liquefaction of ground to north of wamego in city of louisville earthquake knocked over horses in both louisville and city of leavenworth chimneys fell in paola earthquake destroyed one wall of a large republican newspaper office building waves were observed on kansas river reaching in height city of atchison felt two shocks which felled lamps and bottles at a drug store rocked buildings and disrupted water flow in rivers and creeks though no buildings in city sustained damage people fled into streets thumb right in lecompton a building at lane university pictured shook from earthquake alt a stone building can be seen from street with a flagpole next to it this was one of buildings at lane university in lecompton kansas in emporia earthquake was accompanied by a low rumbling sound windows rattled and small boxes were thrown off of shelves as people fled buildings city s brick and stone houses sustained more damage than framed homes city of fort scott only experienced trembling whereas iola had houses and tableware shake in holton items were knocked off shelves and buildings shook residents of irving also heard rumbling prior to earthquake experiencing severe tremors that lasted 30 seconds while buildings in junction city shook violently moving several inches in kansas city tables moved walls cracked water spilled from glasses plaster cracked and shaking caused general panic city of lawrence felt three earthquakes within 30 seconds with violent shaking of doors and windows broken plaster a rumbling noise stones knocked off a local church rattling of silverware and glassware and overturning of a stove in one home similarly in city of leavenworth three shocks were felt over 30 seconds in leavenworth a man was knocked off a a rumbling noise was heard and clocks stopped moreover saws leaning against walls were moved plaster at one home cracked for entire length of house s ceiling and one woman experienced an electrical shock from spring water in city of lecompton one of buildings at lane university shook and a high school in city of marysville also shook violently within montgomery county people in moving vehicles did not feel earthquake houses shook in mound city ottawa and olathe as well as in city of oskaloosa where cupola a relatively small most often dome like tall structure of a new school wobbled in paola people standing were nearly knocked over during earthquake a train on pacific railroad in solomon shook violently and was stopped and evacuated out of fear that its boiler would explode in topeka capital city of kansas ceiling of a methodist church was bent and nearly all of windows in one schoolhouse were destroyed two shocks were felt in city of white cloud and sleeping people were awakened in reports from states of iowa and missouri including descriptions of fallen plaster in dubuque shaking of buildings and people in rocking chairs in des moines and fallen and cracked plaster in chillicothe compliment additional reports of fallen plaster and roof shingles damaged wells and cracked walls other events reported in dubuque included three shocks which caused vibration of gas burners general panic among residents rattling of windows shaking of chairs cases holding newspapers and windows and holes in brick walls in city of st joseph in missouri windows broke women fainted and a rumbling noise could be heard within city a new school building s brick walls cracked several feet above ground as people fled into streets in warrensburg missouri walls of a church shook but there was no damage earthquake also extended into states of indiana and illinois according to and a questionable report came from carthage in ohio that a segment of ground in area sunk by forming a perpendicular wall deep on each of its sides a series of articles published by chicago tribune describes extent of damage throughout state of kansas article at kansas city details that earthquake jolted homes with a sudden burst giving off a resonating roar like thunder tribune observed in its article at leavenworth kansas that earthquake was completely unexpected describing event as sudden in its coming and departure it confirmed that earthquakes were not common in earlier times and stated that all were more or less startled and indeed frightened future threats thumb right tuttle creek dam and reservoir in kansas as seen from west alt from west a large dam and body of water it holds sit to left of a grassy area with some trees although kansas is not seismically active a strong earthquake could pose significant threats to state if an earthquake were to occur it would likely be along nemaha ridge which is still active humboldt fault zone just off ridge lies just east of near manhattan an earthquake there would likely destroy dam releasing of water per second and flooding nearby area which would threaten roughly 13 000 people and 5 900 homes united states army corps of engineers concluded that a moderate earthquake between 5 7 and 6 6 would cause sand underneath dam to liquefy into quicksand causing dam to spread out and top to drop up to three feet a large earthquake would spawn gaps forcing water to leak and eventually cause dam to collapse earthquakes that could pose a threat to dam occur on a cycle of roughly 1 800 years to counter this threat corps of engineers has galvanized an effort to strengthen dam replacing sand which could shift during an earthquake with more than 350 walls group has equipped dam with sensors which are connected to alarms that would alert nearby citizens to earthquake more than 500 earthquakes have been measured in state since 2013 contributing to reactivation of ancient fault lines in 2016 united states geological survey made hazard maps for state determining a 1 or lower risk of a major earthquake within next year because sedgwick and wichita counties could both potentially experience shaking from earthquakes that could not be withstood according to existing building codes officials in area proposed changing building codes to meet perceived hazards scientists at united states geological survey think an earthquake with a magnitude of 7 0 remains possible possibly originating from nemaha ridge where manhattan quake was produced see also list of earthquakes in united states list of historical
