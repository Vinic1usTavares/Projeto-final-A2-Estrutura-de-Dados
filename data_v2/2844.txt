pterygotus is a genus of giant predatory eurypterid a group of extinct aquatic arthropods fossils of pterygotus have been discovered in deposits ranging in age from late silurian to late devonian and have been referred to several different species fossils have been recovered from four continents australia europe north america and south america which indicates that pterygotus might have had a nearly cosmopolitan worldwide distribution type species p anglicus was described by swiss naturalist louis agassiz in 1839 agassiz mistakenly believed remains were of a giant fish with name pterygotus translating to winged fish he would only realize mistake five years later in 1844 pterygotus was among largest eurypterids isolated fossil remains of a large chelicera frontal appendage suggests that largest known species p grandidentatus reached a body length of several other species notably p impacatus at and p anglicus at were similarly gigantic pterygotus was surpassed in size by other giant eurypterids acutiramus was able to surpass 2 metres 6 6 ft and jaekelopterus could reach 2 6 metres 8 5 ft many species were considerably smaller than largest species such as p kopaninensis at like its close relative jaekelopterus pterygotus was a large and active predator noted for its robust and enlarged cheliceral claws that would have allowed it to puncture and grasp prey and a visual acuity clarity of vision comparable to that of modern predatory arthropods description thumb life restoration of p anglicus leftwith largest species p grandidentatus reaching a body length of pterygotus was among largest known eurypterids to have existed though some of its close relatives such as acutiramus and jaekelopterus surpassed it in length though there were a few gigantic species many species were considerably smaller in size smallest species p kopaninensis measured just in length lamsdell james c braddy simon j 2009 10 14 cope s rule and romer s theory patterns of diversity and gigantism

family of eurypterids to which it lends its name a group of highly derived eurypterids of silurian to devonian periods that differ from other groups by a number of features perhaps most prominently in chelicerae first pair of limbs and telson chelicerae of pterygotidae were enlargened and robust clearly adapted to be used for active prey capture and more similar to claws of some modern crustaceans with well developed teeth on claws than to chelicerae of other eurypterid groups unlike most of rest of body which was covered in a scale like ornamentation like other pterygotid eurypterids claws lacked any type of ornamentation additionally end points of claws were round and curved unlike sharp points present at ends of claws of related erettopterus pterygotid telsons were flattened and expanded likely used as rudders when swimming their walking legs were small and slender without spines and they were likely not capable of walking on land pterygotus is distinguishable from other pterygotids by curved distal margin of chelae claws prosoma head is a trapezoid with rounded corners with compound eyes located near edge of front corners telson segment of its body has a pronounced dorsal carina or keel running down its center terminating in a short spine size thumb size of largest p grandidentatus and smallest p kopaninensis species of pterygotus compared to a human pterygotidae includes largest known arthropods to have ever lived with several species surpassing two metres in length such as jaekelopterus rhenaniae at and acutiramus bohemicus at though pterygotus was not largest of pterygotids several species were large surpassing in length largest known species was p grandidentatus with largest known isolated chelicerae fragments suggesting a length of estonian p impacatus is second largest known species largest fragmentary remains suggesting a length of p anglicus type species grew to in length based on a large tergite discovered by henry woodward at some point between 1866 and 1878 measuring just over in length and in width tergite suggests a eurypterid with a full length of from beginning of carapace to end of telson if extended chelicerae are counted normally they are not total length would exceed p carmani from devonian of ohio likely reached lengths in excess of species p cobbi p barrandei and p denticulatus also exceeded 1 metre in length smaller species include p floridanus at p lightbodyi at p arcuatus at p bolivianus at and smallest known species p kopaninensis at in length history of research initial finds left thumb fossils described by john william salter as belonging to pterygotus problematicus in 1852 this species is now considered a nomen vanum first fossils of pterygotus were found in deposits of lochkovian pragian early devonian age by quarrymen in scotland and western england who referred to large fossil remains as louis agassiz a swiss american biologist and geologist described fossils in 1839 and named it pterygotus in belief that they were fossil remains of a large fish pterygotus translating to winged fish specimens described by agassiz from england were referred to a species he dubbed pterygotus problematicus agassiz first recognized true nature of fossils as arthropod remains five years later in 1844 after having examined more complete fossils recovered in old red sandstone of scotland although recognizing fossils of pterygotus as arthropod was closer to its modern phylogenetical position agassiz would consider pterygotus to represent a crustacean of subclass although frederick m coy did note that pterygotus resembled and previously discovered eurypterid eurypterus in 1849 he classified both eurypterus and pterygotus as crustaceans new scottish fossils were named as species p anglicus in 1849 which remains most extensively known species of pterygotus distinguished from subsequently discovered species by possessing curved terminal teeth and primary and intermediate teeth being inclined slightly backwards p problematicus was also used as designation for an incomplete chelicera discovered in welsh borderland of western england by john william salter in 1852 but is in modern times considered a nomen vanum baseless name as species is impossible to define fossil material with which it was described is undiagnostic and insufficient to establish any meaningful characteristics and as such many fragmentary pterygotid fossils have been referred to it throughout its long history rendering it effectively synonymous with family pterygotidae more often than not these fragments consist of patches of pterygotid integument preserving scale like ornamentation characteristic of group which researchers have wrongfully believed was characteristic of only pterygotus or p problematicus as such ornamentation is known from every pterygotid genus it can not be used as a diagnostic feature of a single species though p problematicus is earliest name used for a species of pterygotus it is not considered type species as name is no longer in use instead p anglicus based on a number of diagnostic features and properly illustrated in its description by agassiz in 1844 is considered type species of pterygotus two further species that remain assigned to genus to this day would be described from england during 19th century p ludensis of pridoli late silurian age and p arcuatus of ludlow late silurian age along with a north american species p cobbi from pridoli of united states and canada p arcuatus was originally described from a series a series of specimens out of which a particular holotype is not designated of fossil remains by john william salter containing five separate fossil specimens in 1961 102 years after its description erik n kjellesvig waering noted that only one of these specimens number of geological survey and museum of london a free ramus of a chelicera might truly be referrable to this distinct species as other fossils tergites coxae and indeterminable fragments might actually represent fossils of other species due to not being diagnostic enough p ludensis described by salter in 1859 can be distinguished from other species by more developed and prolonged keel or ridge running along center of telson from its beginning to tail spike rare species p cobbi described by james hall in 1859 based on fossils recovered in new york usa was first species of pterygotus to be described from outside of scotland and expanded known range of genus considerably hall described this new species alongside two other north american species p macrophthalmus now referred to acutiramus and p osborni later synonymized with p macrophthalmus distal tooth of free ramus part of claw that moves was less prominent than in other species which has been noted as similar to distal tooth in free ramus of acutiramus although p cobbi is based on poor fossil material only known from a free ramus it remains recognized as a distinct species on account of being more similar to certain species discovered in czech republic such as p barrandei than it is to other pterygotid species discovered in p cobbi locality such as acutiramus macrophthalmus creation of subgenera and pterygotidae thumb painting painted in 1912 by charles r knight depicting various eurypterids discovered in new york painting includes dolichopterus eusarcana stylonurus eurypterus and hughmilleria pterygotus can be seen in center left by 1859 10 species had been assigned to genus dunlop j a penney d jekel d 2018 a summary list of fossil spiders and their relatives in world spider catalog natural history museum bern and john william salter recognized that it was possible to divide these species into subgenera based on morphology of telsons salter erected subgenus pterygotus erettopterus for species with a bilobed telson further subgenera would be named as more differences were noted between species such subgenera include pterygotus curviramus and pterygotus acutiramus named in 1935 based upon features of denticles teeth of chelicerae pterygotus curviramus was later recognized as synonymous with pterygotus pterygotus by leif stormer same year and erettopterus and acutiramus would be recognized as separate but closely related genera erettopterus by erik n kjellesvig waering in 1961 and acutiramus by stormer in 1974 in 1912 family pterygotidae was erected by john mason clarke rudolf ruedemann in 1912 to include eurypterid genera pterygotus slimonia hughmilleria and hastimima three latter genera would be reclassified as members of hughmilleriidae by erik n kjellesvig waering in 1951 leaving pterygotus and its former subgenera as sole pterygotid eurypterids further discoveries thumb illustration of fossils of p anglicus including three cheliceral claws early discoveries of pterygotus were confined to england and north america fossil finds throughout 20th century would help establish that pterygotus as a genus achieved a nearly cosmopolitan distribution first eurypterid to be discovered in australia was pterygotus australis whose fossils were found in ludlow age melbourne group of formation fossils referred to p australis consisting of four fragments making up about half of a segment that were discovered during process of excavations beneath melbourne during construction of new drainage works for city in 1899 fragmentary fossils closely resemble fossils of erettopterus bilobus classified as a species of pterygotus at time which might make their assignment to pterygotus questionable kjellesvig waering named species p bolivianus in 1964 based on fossils recovered from deposits of emsian eifelian early to middle devonian age in bolivia this species was first pterygotid to be discovered in south america first devonian pterygotid to be recovered in deposits in southern hemisphere and also represents one of last known living member of pterygotid family specimen housed at chicago natural history museum includes well preserved anterior half of a chelicera and ramus tooth of ramus are short wide and conical all being slightly curved backwards terminal tooth is larger but only slightly than tooth succeeding it and inwards bend of claw suggests that another tooth might be present creating a kind of double tooth combination that is also present in some other species such as p lightbodyi p impacatus and erettopterus total length of fossilized ramus is 2 35 cm 1 in but it likely only represents around half of full ramus as in other species and pterygotidae in general teeth are finely ribbed it can be distinguished from all other species of pterygotus by wide but short and evenly sized teeth as well as terminal tooth not having any particular development in 2019 a new fragmentary ramus of a chelicera was found in cuche formation of colombia specimen sgc 2018 i 5 assigned with uncertainty to p bolivianus due to similarities with its holotype represents first eurypterid of colombia and fourth of south america fossil was dated as late devonian showing that pterygotus did not become extinct during middle devonian as previously thought following close examination and discovery of new fossil evidence further genera would be split off from pterygotus p rhenaniae was classified as part of its own genus jaekelopterus by charles d waterston in 1964 he considered species sufficiently distinct from other pterygotus species due to its supposedly segmented genital appendage a feature later realized to be wrong its narrow and long chelicerae and its primary teeth being angled slightly anteriorly another species p was classified as separate genus ciurcopterus in 2007 by o erik tetlie and derek e g briggs distinguished primarily by sharing several features with more basal pterygotioid eurypterids such as its appendages being similar to those of slimonia discoveries in europe thumb 200x200px cheliceral claw of p barrandei new fossil finds also revealed presence of pterygotus in several european countries where it had previously been unknown and established it as a highly taxonomically diverse genus p barrandei was named in 1898 and has fossil representation in pridoli age deposits of czech republic p barrandei is noted to be very similar to p cobbi and a close relation between two species is assumed despite many similarities two species do have some differences most prominently in cheliceral teeth of free rami largest tooth of free ramus of p barrandei is significantly longer than corresponding tooth in p cobbi and teeth of free ramus of p barrandei are directed forwards more prominently in general fossils of p barrandei are rare with fossil finds being confined to a handful of formations of pridoli age in bohemia known fossils include some incomplete chelicerae and a metastoma some additional fossil remains have been assigned to species consisting of coxae and a genital appendage but their assignment to species is doubtful species p nobilis described in 1872 is based on a small and fragmentary chelicera found in what today is czech republic arrangement of teeth seen in this claw though most teeth are not preserved was noted by researcher max semper in 1897 as sharing little to no resemblance with what it seen in type species of pterygotus p anglicus and was noted to in fact be more similar to what is seen in p buffaloensis and p bohemicus today p buffaloensis is considered a junior synonym of p bohemicus which has been reclassified as part of closely related genus acutiramus fragmentary remains of p nobilis makes further studies of its precise identity difficult semper suggested that it may be synonymous with acutiramus bohemicus but noted that questions about its identity can not be answered from material available to me another species p kopaninensis also named in 1872 is known from a single and incomplete fixed cheliceral ramus specimen number recovered from kopanina formation around village of kopanina located in prague specimen measures 4 3 cm 1 7 in in length and was at one point assigned to erettopterus due to peculiar hook like termination of ramus a feature now known to be present due to a remnant of free ramus being present in fossil tooth pattern and shape of claw suggests that an assignment to pterygotus is more likely p siemiradzkii described by strand in 1926 based on fossil material from western ukraine is based on highly fragmentary material with little diagnostic value single specimen designated as p siemiradzkii a telson has unusual and pronounced ridges that are not seen in any known species of pterygotus nor in any other genus of pterygotid eurypterids which makes its assignment to pterygotus questionable in 1964 two species described by kjellesvig waering increased known range of pterygotus to scotland p lanarkensis and estonia p impacatus both ludlow in age p lanarkensis was second pterygotid to be discovered from well known eurypterid fauna of lesmahagow in lanarkshire scotland as pterygotids commonly occur in association with multiple related genera it was considered unusual that there was only one species erettopterus bilobus present in lesmahagow fossil remains of p lanarkensis had been known since 1868 first collected by robert in 1855 1860 but were first recognized as such by kjellesvig waering in 1964 represented by a large chelicera specimen number in british museum of natural history originally doubtfully referred to erettopterus bilobus p lanarkensis more closely resembles p anglicus than it does species of erettopterus terminal tooth broken in this specimen is 0 9 cm in length and central tooth is unusually short combination of an unusually long terminal tooth and an underdeveloped central tooth differentiates p lanarkensis from other species of pterygotus several features distinguish it from erettopterus that it was found associated with including more robust chelicerae of p lanarkensis p impacatus recovered from deposits of ludlow age at in saaremaa estonia is represented by a holotype specimen consisting of a fragmentary free ramus of a chelicera that preserves some diagnostic and well preserved details specimen number 7059 7 housed in museum of comparative zoology alongside this specimen important specimens referred to species include paratype no 7059 3 a fragmentary chelicera this specimen includes several of features that are diagnostic of p impacatus such as upright teeth following thick and long teeth of terminal part of claw particularly of diagnostic value is that there are teeth present at point where terminal teeth first begin central tooth of free ramus is unusually large in this species terminal tooth measures 2 3 cm 1 in in length rami of p impacatus are ornamented with large and pointed pustules elevations in skin and this feature helps distinguish specimens of p impacatus from other pterygotids in fossil sites where its remains are found in 2007 o erik tetlie cast doubt on assignment of p impacatus to pterygotus as shape of eyes and carapace was similar to how these body parts are shaped in erettopterus england left thumb 253x253px telson of p anglicus england site of initial discovery of p problematicus has provided fossils for several additional species kjellesvig waering named three new species from england in 1961 p denticulatus p lightbodyi both late ludlow in age and p grandidentatus wenlock late silurian in age p denticulatus is known from a single specimen no of british museum of natural history includes about half of anterior end of what is presumed to be a fixed ramus of a chelicera claw is stout with unusually short teeth that are faintly ribbed this partial ramus measures 1 4 cm 0 5 in in length and was discovered at in shropshire england associated with fossils of brachiopods and cephalopods though it is sometimes considered synonymous with p lightbodyi p denticulatus can be distinguished by small thick and curved teeth of its claws differing not only from p lightbodyi in this respect but virtually all other species of pterygotus as well p lightbodyi is named in honor of robert lightbody a british amateur geologist who made valuable contributions to paleontological research on early paleozoic of welsh borderland including discovery of important silurian fossils such as eurypterids in 1800s this species was one of most common eurypterid in england during ludlow epoch and was quite large and clearly distinct though it resembles p barrandei p floridanus and p cobbi in its cheliceral morphology from other species of genus being known from multiple specimens most important fossils of p lightbodyi include holotype consisting of most of a chelicera and two paratypes including most of free ramus claws of p lightbodyi are all equipped with vertically placed and very long teeth most of which curve slightly backwards terminal tooth is unusually slender and long in p lightbodyi and as with other teeth slightly curved backwards among more important diagnostic features of species is combination of a large terminal tooth and a large upright tooth near it p grandidentatus is known from a single specimen anterior half of a free ramus of a chelicera discovered in wenlock aged beds at dudley in worcestershire england specimen number i in british museum of natural history it is notable for stout stem and unusually long length 1 75 cm 0 7 in of terminal tooth and unusual thickness of its base p grandidentatus can easily be distinguished from other species from other species not only be its unusual terminal tooth but also by disoriented teeth along claw being bent in a variety of different directions terminal part of ramus ends in an arrangement of multiple teeth otherwise only noted in species p waylandsmithi as this specific part of ramus is poorly known from other species of pterygotus and p waylandsmithi was reclassified as a species of erettopterus in 2007 assignment of p grandidentatus to pterygotus is questionable england would also yield a dubious species p taurinus from deposits of pridoli or devonian age named by salter in 1868 p taurinus is treated as a dubious species for reason that it is effectively a composite composed of fossils of three different eurypterids these fossils consist of a type specimen of chelicerae which is now lost complicating any potential comparisons a large carapace and chelicerae likely actually referrable to pterygotus due to being similar to p anglicus a leg undoubtedly representing a eurypterid potentially carcinosoma and a telson which is far more similar to erettopterus than to pterygotus most of these specimens have been lost since 1870s last record being that they were all in cabinet of a dr mccullough of abergavenny discoveries in north america thumb fossil tergite of p carmani preserving scale like ornamentation characteristic of pterygotid eurypterids 20th century would see description of additional species of pterygotus in north america as well including silurian p marylandicus 1964 maryland usa and p monroensis 1902 new york usa early devonian p carmani 1961 usa and p floridanus 1950 florida usa and middle devonian p gaspesiensis 1953 quebec canada fossil remains of pterygotid eurypterids bearing distinct scale like ornamentation known from group had been reported from eastern canada as early as 1846 when researcher william edmond logan reported occurrence of an animal bearing strong resemblance to murchison s pterygotus problematicus in silurian devonian deposits of gaspe quebec fossils eventually identified as being exclusively of devonian age were first tentatively referred to p atlanticus now synonymized with p anglicus which had been discovered in relatively close proximity to gaspe fossils on account of p atlanticus material being so fragmentary that it was impossible to tell whether or not they represented same species they were described by loris s russell as belonging to new species p gaspesiensis in 1953 john william dawson in 1861 named a new species of lycopod plant formosus based on alleged remains of stems and branches found at gaspe salter convinced dawson that fossils of s formosus actually were fragmentary remains of a eurypterid as confirmed by further findings dawson reclassified it as a eurypterid in 1871 kjellesvig waering in 1964 assigned it as a questionable species of pterygotus in 1921 ruedemann described an eurypterid fauna from vernon formation of pittsford new york among them species p was erected based on two small short carapaces outline and position of eyes suggest an assignation to genus pterygotus differing from p monroensis in being nearly rectangular in shape and with a straight transverse frontal margin he suggested a relationship with slimonia but he did not assigned it due to lack of more material indicative of latter although it was later placed on genus samuel j ciurca jr and o erik tetlie concluded in 2007 that holotype does not really have eyes and is nothing more than an incomplete body segment therefore they regarded species as a nomen dubium a dubious species p floridanus recovered from deposits of lochkovian age in florida extended known range of eurypterids on continent over 800 km 500 miles south prior to its discovery eurypterids in north america were only known from northern parts of continent with new york state representing most fossil rich state remains of p floridanus were first uncovered by g arthur cooper in suwannee county florida and fossils consist of a fixed ramus of chelicera as well as fragments of abdominal plates and tergites and were concluded to represent a new species of pterygotus by erik n kjellesvig waering in 1950 it most closely resembles p cobbi and p barrandei differing from p cobbi in its more developed central tooth and arrangement of smaller teeth of claws and from p barrandei in that p floridanus has a more slender ramus p carmani is most commonly found eurypterid in lower devonian deposits of lucas county ohio described by erik n kjellesvig waering in 1961 and named in honor of dr j ernest carman of ohio state university first to discover eurypterids at locality where p carmani remains were found p carmani is primarily known from incomplete chelicerae and of coxae alongside two coxae and three chelicerae part of its original description known fossil remains also include a metastoma and a pretelson all of these original fossil specimens were designated by kjellesvig waering as paratype specimens upon original description of species designated type specimen is an incomplete chelicerae that remains housed at chicago natural history museum alongside paratype specimens species can be differentiated from other species of pterygotus primarily by features of its cheliceral teeth differing from p barrandei and p cobbi in these teeth being less developed and thicker in p carmani as well as teeth having a markedly different arrangement on claw p marylandicus from deposits of ludfordian late silurian age is known from a fragmentary and small telson from mckenzie formation maryland first described by kjellesvig waering in 1964 who recognized it as a telson of a pterygotus specimen no at united states national museum is very wide 0 75 cm and has a nearly straight base with margins converging anteriorly unlike some species there are no serrations on telson and spine is blunt species is very distinct being distinguishable from all other silurian species of pterygotus by shape of its telson a species of jaekelopterus j howelli from early devonian is similar in wide and truncated telson shape but is easily distinguished by possessing serrations and a much larger terminal spine species p monroensis known from deposits of late wenlock to ludlow age in new york state usa was suggested to represent a synonym of erettopterus osiliensis by samuel j ciurca jr and o erik tetlie in 2007 based upon similar shape of eyes and carapace such a reassignment would have implications for other species of pterygotus as well with p impacatus potentially also representing a synonym of e osiliensis subsequent studies and lists of eurypterid species have continued to treat p monroensis and p impacatus as distinct species of pterygotus classification thumb fossilized specimens of p monroensis discovered in late silurian fiddlers green formation of new york united states thumb jaekelopterus was closely related to pterygotus some researchers suspect that they may represent same genus pterygotus is classified within family pterygotidae in superfamily pterygotioidea lending its name to both its family and its superfamily three most derived pterygotid eurypterids acutiramus jaekelopterus and pterygotus are very similar to each other pterygotus is particularly similar to jaekelopterus from which it is virtually only distinct in features of genital appendage and potentially telson similarities in genital appendage could mean that three genera are all synonyms of each other as they had been classified in past as species of pterygotus some differences between them have also been noted in chelicerae though chelicerae have been questioned as basis of eurypterid generic distinction since their morphology depends on lifestyles and has been observed to vary throughout ontogeny telson morphology is sometimes used as a distinguishing feature though telsons of three derived pterygotid genera are all paddle shaped telson of jaekelopterus is triangular but might fall into morphological range of other genera an inclusive phylogenetic analysis with multiple species of acutiramus pterygotus and jaekelopterus is required to resolve whether or not genera are synonyms of each other cladogram below is based on nine best known pterygotid species and two outgroup taxa slimonia acuminata and hughmilleria socialis cladogram also contains maximum sizes reached by species in question which have been suggested to possibly have been an evolutionary trait of group per cope s rule phyletic gigantism paleobiology thumb restoration depicting pterygotus hunting left upright cheliceral morphology and visual acuity of pterygotid eurypterids separates them into distinct ecological groups primary method for determining visual acuity in arthropods is by determining number of lenses in their compound eyes and interommatidial angle shortened as ioa and referring to angle between optical axes of adjacent lenses ioa is especially important as it can be used to distinguish different ecological roles in arthropods being low in modern active arthropod predators both pterygotus anglicus and jaekelopterus rhenaniae had a very high visual acuity which researchers could determine by observing a low ioa and a large number of lenses in their compound eyes chelicerae of pterygotus were enlarged robust and possessed a curved free ramus and denticles of different lengths and sizes all adaptations that correspond to strong puncturing and grasping abilities in extant scorpions and crustaceans ioa values for both pterygotus and jaekelopterus match those of high level and active modern predatory arthropods indicating that they represented visual and active predators all known pterygotids though they are so far unknown in ciurcopterus possessed cheliceral claws first joint of chelicerae where it connects to a plate located on prosoma or head would have been capable of turning entire appendage in a twisting way which has led researchers to conclude that function of chelicerae would not have been only or even primarily for defense but rather to capture and convey food to mouth when captured prey would need to be broken into smaller pieces to be able to fit into mouth eurypterid mouths were even less adapted to devour large pieces than mouths of modern crabs are eurypterid walking appendages could not cut transport or grasp anything so these tasks would also likely fall to chelicerae in crabs claws tear food apart and then transport smaller pieces to mouth based on feeding process seen in modern arthropods with chelicerae one of claws would hold prey while other would cut off pieces and transport it to mouth with continuous and simple movements paleoecology thumb illustration of fossils of p anglicus
