early extension of his contract with rca records in 1972 label decided not to release any further recordings nelson hired neil reshen as his manager and while reshen negotiated with rca nelson moved to austin texas where ongoing hippie music scene at armadillo world headquarters renewed his musical style in nashville nelson met producer jerry wexler vice president of atlantic records who was interested in his music reshen solved problems with rca and signed nelson with atlantic records as their first country music artist album was recorded in atlantic records studio in new york city in february 1973 nelson and his backup musicians family were joined by doug sahm and his band after recording several tracks nelson was still not inspired following a recording session he wrote shotgun willie song that would become title track of album on empty packaging of a sanitary napkin while in bathroom of his hotel room album produced mostly by arif mardin with assistance from wexler and

younger audiences recording was one of first albums of outlaw country a new subgenre of country music and an alternative to conservative restrictions of nashville sound dominant style in genre at time background in april 1972 after nelson recorded mountain dew his final rca single label requested that he renew his contract ahead of schedule with implication that rca would not release any further recordings if he did not sign neil reshen who nelson hired as his manager to negotiate with label got rca to agree to end contract upon repayment of us 1 400 that nelson had been overpaid at same time nelson had moved to austin texas to take a short break austin s burgeoning hippie music scene at venues like armadillo world headquarters rejuvenated singer his popularity in austin soared as he played his own brand of music that was a blend of country folk and jazz influences nelson who had felt creatively hamstrung by rca s strict recording practices in nashville and frustrated at not being permitted to use his touring band in studio immediately felt a kinship with this younger audience i liked this new world it fit me to a t i never did like putting on stage costumes never did like trim haircuts never did like worrying about whether i was satisfying requirements of a showman it felt good to let my hair grow felt good to get on stage in same jeans i d been wearing all damn day during a trip to nashville tennessee nelson attended a party in harlan howard s house where he sang songs that he had written for album phases and stages another guest was atlantic records vice president jerry wexler who previously had produced works for artists such as ray charles and aretha franklin wexler was interested in nelson s music so when atlantic opened a country music division of their label he offered nelson a contract that gave him more creative control than his deal with rca when nelson asked wexler if he was worried about music not being commercial wexler replied fuck commerce you re going for art you re going for truth in his autobiography nelson later recalled i d never heard a record man talk that way on spot i decided that wexler was my man when nelson was released from his rca contract he signed with atlantic for us 25 000 per year becoming label s first country artist recording recording sessions took place in february 1973 wexler provided nelson and his band with a studio in new york city where most of recordings were produced doug sahm and his band were also invited to sessions during first session nelson recorded songs for troublemaker later he proceeded with shotgun willie wexler had encouraged nelson after singing gospel album to start with new one to couple old material with new and covers he initially recorded twenty three tracks along with his and sahm s band but nelson still was not inspired he wrote title song after one of sessions pacing in his hotel room he went to bathroom where he sat on toilet and took empty envelope from a sanitary napkin from sink and penned song on that title of song refers to nickname nelson received after his daughter susie warned him of domestic abuse suffered by her sister lana nelson drove to lana s house where he fought with her husband steve warren and threatened to kill him if he repeated assault soon after nelson returned home warren arrived in his truck with his brothers men shot at house with 22 caliber rifles in response nelson and paul english shot at aggressors that retreated when they returned later nelson took english s m1 garand and shot truck causing them to surrender he completed rest of song with a reference to john t floore owner of honky tonk floore s country store after hearing completed song wexler decided that album was to be named after it nelson later recalled kris kristofferson told me later song shotgun willie was mind farts maybe so but i thought of it more as clearing my throat most of tracks were produced by arif mardin with exception of two bob wills and his texas playboys covers stay all night stay a little longer and bubbles in my beer which were produced by mardin and jerry wexler in his book willie nelson joe nick patoski notes recording of album was sloppy and chaotic technically and artistically uneven with horns and strings occasionally bumping up against musical core of bee spears paul english bobbie nelson jimmy day and willie music was more country than what was being played on radio but somehow different if there were slips and they stayed in album includes johnny bush s whiskey river which would go on to be nelson s perennial show opener in his autobiography he remembers in 1972 johnny bush called me with part of a song he d written with paul stroud i took song way it was but adapted it to my style which was more blues than rock shotgun willie is also significant for containing a song for you written by leon russell a key figure in nelson s creative evolution during this period song would become a staple of nelson s live show and he would later say he knocked me out i understood how his image with his crazy stovepipe hat and dark aviator glasses added to his mysterious allure beyond mystery though i heard that his musical roots and mine were same hank williams bob wills country black blues nelson would record duet album one for road with russell in 1979 nelson was effusive in his praise for wexler whose laid back encouraging approach was antithesis of what he had experienced in nashville in past wexler s attitude really pumped me up i cranked out songs one after other atmosphere was right whereas nashville had always been uptight about musicians smoking dope in studio atlantic didn t give a shit wexler got high with us wexler never bugged me to put on sweeteners to stimulate sales i felt free to tap into my imagination no hold barred i felt free to go against grain in tunes like sad songs and waltzes a story about why this particular song would never sell during recording there were rumors that there would be appearances by george jones leon russell and kris kristofferson that ultimately did not happen waylon jennings joined backing band playing guitar and provided backing vocals for stay all night stay a little longer along with jessi colter and doug sahm several journalist were on hand during recording like ed ward from creem who later commented i d underestimated professionalism of all concerned not to mention core ensemble of musicians themselves who decided to test sound of studio with a spirited version of under double eagle which left me awestruck willie wasn t only a great songwriter he was a goddamn virtuoso on that battered martin guitar of his parts of album were recorded in quadraphonic studios in nashville as well as in sam phillips recording studio in memphis release and reception album was released in june 1973 although it received good reviews it did not sell well except in austin where it sold more copies than earlier records by nelson did nationwide recording led nelson to a new style he later stated regarding his new musical identity that shotgun willie had cleared his throat it became his breakthrough record and one of first of outlaw movement music created without influence of conservative nashville sound album first to feature nelson with long hair and a beard on cover gained him interest of younger audiences it peaked at number 41 on billboard 200 billboard s album chart and songs shotgun willie and stay all night stay a little longer peaked at number 60 and 22 on billboard hot 100 respectively rolling stone wrote with this flawless album willie nelson finally demonstrates why he has for so long been regarded as a country western singer songwriter s singer songwriter at age of 39 nelson finally seems destined for stardom he deserves robert christgau wrote this attempt to turn nelson into a star runs into trouble when it induces him to memphis horns or western swing billboard wrote this is willie nelson at his narrative best he writes and sings with love and hurt and down to earth things he feels and he has a few peers texas monthly praised nelson and wexler regarding change in musical style they ve switched his arrangements from ray price to ray charles result a revitalized music he s same old willie but veteran producer jerry wexler finally captured on wax energy nelson projects in person school library journal wrote willie nelson differs from rock artists framing their music with a country western facade in that he appears a honky tonk stardust cowboy to core this album abounds in unabashed sentimentalism nasal singing lyrics preoccupied with booze religion and love gone bad and stereotyped nashville instrumentation twangy steel guitars fiddles and a clean rhythm section characterized by minimal use of bass drum and cymbals both of which gain heavy mileage with rock performers stephen thomas erlewine wrote in his review for allmusic willie nelson offered his finest record to date for his debut possibly his finest album ever shotgun willie encapsulates willie s world view and music finding him at a peak as a composer interpreter and performer this is laid back deceptively complex music equal parts country rock attitude jazz musicianship and troubadour storytelling nelson biographer joe nick patoski writes that shotgun willie was nelson s creative
