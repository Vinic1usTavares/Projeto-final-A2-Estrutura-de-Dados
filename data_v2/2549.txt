first battle of newbury was a battle of first english civil war that was fought on 20 september 1643 between a royalist army under personal command of king charles and a parliamentarian force led by earl of essex following a year of royalist successes in which they took banbury oxford and reading without conflict before storming bristol parliamentarians were left without an effective army in field when charles laid siege to gloucester parliament was forced to muster a force under essex with which to beat charles forces off after a long march essex surprised royalists and forced them away from gloucester before beginning a retreat to london charles rallied his forces and pursued essex overtaking parliamentarian army at newbury and forcing them to march past royalist force to continue their retreat essex reacted by making a surprise attack on royalist lines at dawn capturing several pieces of high ground and leaving charles on back foot a series of royalist attacks led to a large number of casualties and slow retreat of essex s force which was driven from central hill and almost encircled essex succeeded in rallying his infantry however and pushed forward in a counter attack slowing of this counter attack in face of royalist cavalry forced essex to send for reinforcements who while marching to him were attacked and forced to retreat this left a hole in parliamentarian line dividing army into two wings through which royalists hoped to pass splitting parliamentarians and allowing charles s troops to encircle and defeat enemy in line with this royalists moved forward to press attack but were forced to halt by london trained bands with night falling battle ended and both exhausted armies disengaged next morning low on ammunition royalists were forced to allow essex to pass and continue his retreat to london reasons for royalist defeat include shortage of ammunition relative lack of professionalism of their soldiers and tactics of essex who compensated for his much lamented paucity of cavalry by tactical ingenuity and firepower countering rupert s cavalry by driving them off with mass infantry formations although numbers of casualties were relatively small 1 300 royalists and 1 200 parliamentarians historians who have studied battle consider it to be one of most crucial of first english civil war marking high point of royalist advance and leading to signing of solemn league and covenant which brought scottish covenanters into war on side of parliament and led to eventual victory of parliamentarian cause background after failure of parliamentarian forces to gain a conclusive victory at battle of edgehill in 1642 royalist armies had advanced on london capturing banbury oxford and reading without conflict on 13 november they faced earl of essex at battle of turnham green with charles s advisers persuading him to retreat to oxford and reading after essex besieged reading and charles s armies failed in their attempts to relieve town a stalemate occurred on front essex s army could not directly engage with royalists at oxford due to disease in ranks while charles was prevented from advancing due to exhaustion of supplies and ammunition after failed expedition to reading despite this setback war was turning increasingly in favour of royalists early months of 1643 saw a crushing defeat of parliamentarians at battle of moor while battle of down left parliament without an effective army in west of england lack of which allowed royalists under prince rupert to storm bristol with western army and oxford army result was that parliamentarian forces were depleted and appeared to be losing essex s army was only significant one left in field and it suffered from reduced morale due to defeats inflicted on parliament by royalist forces elsewhere in war bristol thumb left prince rupert of rhine whose capture of bristol represented high water mark for royalist cause despite this royalist forces were significantly depleted by battle at bristol suffering over 1 000 men dead and having exhausted their supplies armies were forced to regroup even considering this capture of bristol is considered high water mark for royalist cause during first english civil war with city captured however an immediate dispute occurred over who was to govern it and this led to charles travelling there on 1 august to take personal command of royalist forces upon arriving he called his council of war together to discuss their next move primary questions at hand being first whether armies should be united and march in one upon next design and then what design should be western army although still strong refused to advance further to east due to presence of parliamentarian forces within dorset and cornwall army s commanders felt that if they tried to push for such a move their forces would either mutiny or simply desert because of this unrest it was quickly resolved that western army would remain an independent fighting force and remain in dorset and cornwall to mop up remaining parliamentarians accordingly western army commanded by lord carnarvon remained in region capturing dorchester in a bloodless victory on 2 august prince maurice left 1 200 infantry and approximately 200 cavalry to garrison bristol before marching to dorchester and personally taking command greater issues were what to do with oxford army and what next design of royalist campaign would be rupert s strategy was to advance through severn valley and capture gloucester which would allow royalist forces in south wales to reinforce charles s army and thus allow for an assault on london another faction however argued that london could be captured with army as it was and that gloucester would serve as a distraction from main goal of campaign by 6 august it was clear that rupert s strategy would be abandoned instead an alternate means of capturing city was considered during early stages of war loyalty of combatants on both sides particularly that of professional soldiers had been flexible gloucester was led by edward massie a non partisan mercenary who only took a job with parliamentarians after he was refused a significant royalist command at same time it was felt that there was a strong if so far silent party of royalist sympathisers in city while governor of sudeley castle was reporting that gloucester s soldiers had stated they would not resist a royalist advance given this council of war decided to march on gloucester not to besiege it or capture it by force but to capture it by having governor betray city beforehand william legge who had served with massie in bishops wars contacted him and asked him to surrender gloucester to his lawful sovereign although this message was rebuffed legge s messenger reported that he had met massie a second time in secret and had been asked to tell legge that massie was willing to surrender town to king as a result of this on 7 august charles and oxford army marched to gloucester gloucester thumb 150px right sir edward massie royalist advance on gloucester was based on assumption that he would surrender city which he did not charles s main force began marching on 7 august and reached village of painswick a day later however rupert s cavalry screen had already advanced and taken village charles himself did not accompany force but instead rode across cotswolds to where he met reinforcements from oxford on 9 august on morning of 10 august royalist army marched to gloucester itself and besieged city with approximately 6 000 infantry and 2 500 cavalry with force assembled charles sent a group of heralds escorted by 1 000 musketeers forward at approximately 2 00 pm at which point they read out king s demands to a meeting of 26 local council and garrison officers including massie king s announcement was that if officers submitted he would pardon all officers prohibit his army from causing any damage to city and leave only a small garrison behind if they did not he would take city by force and inhabitants would be responsible for all calamities and miseries that must befall them despite earlier claims that massie would surrender he did not a short time later a refusal of offer was drawn up and unanimously signed by officers reasons for massie s failure to surrender city despite feelers he put out to royalist contacts are unknown at this point charles called another council of war to discuss situation it was resolved that it was crucial that gloucester was still to be taken if it was left in parliamentarian hands it would act as a break in lines of communication should royalists advance further east towards london in addition charles s personal reputation had been sullied travelling so far and yet not taking gloucester would impact on respect and prestige accorded to him about which he was notoriously sensitive based on reconnaissance charles s officers were confident that garrison s food and ammunition would not last long they argued that city could be taken in less than 10 days with parliament lacking an effective army to relieve city if essex s forces did not attack royalists would take city if they did attack they would be exhausted and according to royalist intelligence far weaker than oxford army allowing charles to destroy parliament s one remaining significant force under direct command of earl of forth royalists laid siege to city rupert had suggested a direct assault but this proposal was not adopted due to fears of high casualties by 11 august royalist trenches were dug and artillery prepared despite massie s attempts to disrupt work with musket fire with this work done there was no way out for parliamentarians only hope was to delay royalists long enough for a relief army to arrive to this end massie ordered raids under cover of darkness with james his second in command leading a raid on artillery trenches in revenge royalists attacked east of city but were driven off by cannon fire 12 august saw more raids this time during day which cost royalists 10 men and a supply depot with no parliamentarian losses despite this assaults did not disrupt royalist preparations and by evening they were able to start bombarding town by 24 august royalists suffering from shortfalls in their stocks of gunpowder and cannonballs remained unable to breach walls essex in meantime had been urgently preparing his army which thanks to disease indiscipline and desertion numbered less than 6 000 infantry and 3 500 cavalry this was not a force strong enough to defeat royalists and so he demanded an extra 5 000 soldiers parliamentarians in london responded by enlisting london trained bands which provided an additional 6 000 men taking into account additional problems and desertions eventual force was 9 000 foot soldiers and 5 000 cavalry after being mustered on hounslow heath army began marching towards aylesbury arriving on 28 august this force was formally mustered on 30 august and after being reinforced by lord grey on 1 september at brackley marched to gloucester on 5 september with heavy rain falling parliamentarian army reached town and camped on prestbury hill immediately outside it their presence forced royalists to abandon siege given that neither army wet and exhausted was in a state to seek battle pursuit charles s cautious failure to directly assault town putting a higher priority on minimising losses than on victory had cost royalists dearly while claims for their number of dead and wounded men ranged from 1 000 to 1 500 only around 50 people inside city were killed essex s force on other hand was in relatively good shape its one issue was lack of supplies if he stayed in severn valley essex would be unable to get reinforcements or outside aid london elements of army would demand to go home and one remaining significant parliamentarian force would find itself pinned down while charles with secure bases at oxford and bristol would be able to starve them into surrender while other royalist armies ran rampant through britain because of this essex had no choice but to try to return to london travelling back across cotswolds as he had done to reach gloucester initially would expose parliamentarians to charles s cavalry on open ground first alternative was to march southeast to river kennet and cross it going through newbury and returning to reading s fortifications thus evading royalists and allowing for a safe retreat to london disadvantage to this was time it would take to cross relatively open land between essex s position and kennet second and option essex initially took was to go north either to make battle in more advantageous circumstances or to evade royalists if essex was able to cross to west bank of river avon he could secure bridges across it and prevent royalists from crossing it and confronting his army his cavalry advanced to upton to screen main force from royalist interference on 11 september with rest of soldiers quickly following royalists were left wrong footed charles did not discover essex s retreat for another 24 hours during which gap between armies widened royalists finally began to march on 16 september with rupert s cavalry streaming ahead to try to disrupt parliamentarian retreat by 18 september rupert s force had caught up to parliamentarians outside aldbourne essex had lost his advantage parliamentarian intelligence reports had convinced him that charles was heading towards oxford and had given up campaign in fact charles was barely away but complacency such reports induced meant that one contemporary source stated parliamentarians were marching barely a day allowing royalists to quickly catch up suitably chastened by discovery of his error essex increased pace of his retreat with royalists pursuing closely both sides were heading for newbury on roughly parallel routes royalists route took them through faringdon and wantage increasing distance they would have to travel to while parliamentarians had to travel only 20 charles reacted by dispatching rupert and 7 000 cavalry in a flying column to disrupt and harass parliamentary retreat encountering essex s forces at aldbourne chase rupert made battle however lacking enough troops to engage parliamentarians directly he instead attacked a section of their army causing chaos and crucially delaying essex s march just enough for charles s forces to close gap effect of rupert s actions even after his forces disengaged was to force another delay in parliamentarian retreat essex spent much of 19 september looking after wounded soldiers and when he finally managed to begin moving again he was confronted with swampland and bog which further delayed him while royalists marched across relatively open chalk downs above kennet these hardships meant that royalists arrived at newbury before essex with both armies settling down for night outside town too exhausted to immediately fight newbury landscape landscape of area around newbury was a significant factor in tactics of both sides during resulting battle though land was mostly open country a crescent shaped escarpment known as biggs hill sat between royalist and parliamentarian forces to either side of essex s army lay open fields while battlefield was bracketed by river kennet on one side and river enborne on other which neither side attempted to cross on foot essex s most obvious route of advance was to push past royalist forces secure bridge and return to london unfortunately open area approaching bridge was a killing ground soldiers would be entirely in open and forced to march no more than six abreast which would prevent essex effectively deploying against a royalist attack and leave parliamentarian s forces bunched up and subject to artillery fire even if essex managed to cross bridge other side of river featured several hundred metres of waterlogged ground which would slow his soldiers and leave them open to attack while necessitating abandonment of parliamentarian artillery a major humiliation for a seventeenth century army only alternative to a bridge based retreat would be to bypass newbury completely by marching around royalists but this would again involve moving through open fields and subjecting essex s soldiers to attacks of royalist cavalry who were described as greatly outnumbering parliamentarian cavalry confronting royalists directly would involve moving into ground described as containing dense copses and banked hedges with ditches flanking fields and lining sunken lanes while this would allow troops to move in a concealed fashion it would also make deployment difficult and numerous lanes would restrict movement in heat of battle order of battle there are no definitive orders of battle for newbury as official contemporary evidence is thin it is possible to glean some information from both later official reports and contemporary accounts which allow for a reconstruction of likely disposition of each force royalists were led by charles i personally with william vavasour commanding right wing prince rupert left and sir john byron centre artillery support consisted of 20 cannons in total 6 heavy 6 medium and 8 light initial royalist and parliamentarian estimates were of a force of around 17 000 men modern estimates are of around 7 500 infantry and 7 000 cavalry essex led parliamentarians commanding both entire force and separately right wing left wing was commanded by philip stapleton artillery support was provided by two heavy cannons and around 20 light cannons most of heavy artillery was left at gloucester to help defend city estimates as to total number of men vary between 7 000 and 15 000 john barratt noting losses at gloucester estimates that essex s force totalled around 14 000 men with 6 000 cavalry and dragoons and 8 000 infantry battle thumb plan of battle essex attacks battle began on 20 september essex s army was roused before dawn and initial reports stated he had gone from regiment to regiment putting question of a battle unto them after consultation army advanced with most cheerful and courageous spirits at around 7am divided into three bodies of foot both lined and flanked with bodies of horse with a reserve behind them army was preceded by stapleton s cavalry which quickly cleared royalist pickets and allowed essex s advance to wash common a patch of open ground between two forces this march took approximately an hour due to heavy clay soil being soaked from previous night s rain open space before biggs hill objective of their march allowed for a much welcome chance to regroup rupert had established a cavalry guard on biggs hill while size is unknown it was large enough to attack parliamentarian horse head on stapleton waited until royalists were close before firing leading to faltering of their charge and advance of parliamentarian cavalry to drive them off with swords cavalry were unable to make further gains having engaged only a small part of royalist horse and being unwilling to press their attack against larger body by this point parliamentary right flank under philip skippon had begun assaulting main parliamentary objective nearby round hill official account suggests that parliamentarians charged so fiercely that they beat royalists from hill royalist accounts on other hand argue that hill was actually completely undefended official account fails to mention casualties to either attackers or defenders or what happened to royalist guns which were allegedly deployed on hill both sides arguments have a ring of conviction but although essex and his partisans seem to have been genuine in their belief that they had assaulted and captured a defended position facts suggest that royalist version was closer to truth in other words king and his generals had been caught napping regardless of what had happened capture of round hill gave essex advantage allowing skippon to position 1 000 musketeers on top of it to fire down into any royalist advance royalist counter attack as a result of this quick advance charles found his army in chaos with skippon s force organised and flanking them royalist council of war reconvened to discuss events and accounts suggest meeting was acrimonious with fall of round hill described as a most gross and absurd error rupert decided to try to contain both essex and skippon leaving two regiments of horse with byron he led remainder of cavalry to essex s position on left flank byron in meantime was commanded to support an attack by royalist musketeers on skippon s force drawing his regiments up behind infantry ready to second them in case enemy s horse should advance towards them rupert s advance has been criticised by both parliamentarian and royalist sources instead of a small engagement stubbornness of parliamentary resistance forced rupert to commit more and more forces to fray eventually turning a series of small engagements into a full scale battle with reinforcements gradually being drawn in terrain limited localised advantage rupert s forces had in numbers but after three attacks stapleton s brigade crumbled allowing rupert to hook around essex s left flank stop his advance and capture five pieces of artillery this came at a cost royalists took heavy casualties and failed to completely break essex s infantry infantry instead stubbornly retreated allowing parliamentary cavalry to reorganise behind them even though his advance had been stopped essex was not yet beaten byron s attack on skippon s musketeers in centre also went poorly pushing three regiments of foot forward force suffered similarly high casualties in an attempt to take round hill after attack stalled cavalry had to be called in to force it forward despite heavy losses due to only avenue of advance being a narrow lane lined with parliamentarian musketeers this move succeeded in allowing byron to take round hill forcing parliamentarian infantry back to a hedge on far side attack eventually lost momentum and although round hill was taken byron was unable to advance any further on right flank william vavasour attempted to overwhelm parliamentary flank with a substantial brigade of foot which included a small amount of cavalry support his initial attack was repulsed thanks to parliamentarian artillery opening fire but a subsequent head on attack forced skippon s beleaguered force in centre to send several regiments over to assist with fight turning into a bloody melee vavasour s force was eventually forced to retire with parliamentarians failing to give ground crisis and stalemate after heavy fighting royalists had succeeded only in pushing essex s forces briefly back they had given ground but not retreated from battle and his main force of infantry remained strong in an attempt to proceed essex waved his infantry and light artillery forward rupert s cavalry was too weak to defend against this advance due to its large firepower and he instead ordered two regiments of foot commanded by john belasyse to halt essex parliamentarian records report they were hotly charged by enemies horse and foot who succeeded in forcing essex slowly back although fight took four hours in response essex called for skippon to send him reinforcements skippon obliged by ordering a mainwaring s regiment of infantry to remove themselves from his line and march to replace some of essex s exhausted soldiers as soon as they arrived they were charged by two bodies of cavalry and a regiment of infantry under john byron who forced regiment to retreat royalists hacked down fleeing parliamentarians and according to byron his force had not left a man of them but that hedges were so high horse could not pursue them although royalists failed to press this attack due to difficulty of manoeuvring cavalry in field and essex briefly retook ground loss of this infantry regiment opened a gap in parliamentarian line if rupert was able to drive through this gap he would break essex s army into two wings and be able to encircle them recognizing this possibility he began redeploying royalist force two regiments of cavalry and a regiment of infantry under his command would occupy essex while two regiments under charles gerard would push through gap in parliamentarian line luckily for parliamentarians skippon saw this opening and ordered two regiments of london trained bands to close gap although they succeeded in bridging gap between two wings of essex s force there was no cover and a royalist battery of eight heavy guns drawn up on high ground began firing on them unable to move because of necessity of their position they were left enduring close range fire when men s bowels and brains flew in their faces resisting two attacks by royalist cavalry and infantry led by jacob astley historian john day notes that records show most trained band casualties were hit in head while a survivor boasted that artillery did us no harm only shot broke our pikes evidently in heat of battle royalist artillery were firing too high despite this royalist artillery fire had taken its toll and trained band regiments were forced to retreat royalists pursued and only close quarters musket fire allowed militia to regroup without substantial losses after regrouping militia was again attacked by two regiments of foot and two of cavalry who despite surrounding londoners and dragging away a cannon were unable to break them at this point both armies began to draw apart although sporadic fighting continued as night fell by midnight both forces had disengaged completely both army councils met essex s plan to force his way past royalists seemed feasible and many parliamentarians loathe to give up ground they had taken fully expected battle to continue royalists on other hand were plagued by poor morale heavy losses and a lack of supplies having used 80 of their 90 barrels of gunpowder although rupert argued for battle to continue he was out voted and next morning essex was allowed to bypass royalist force without issue and continue his retreat towards london aftermath thumb left essex enters london after battle parliamentarian force now free of charles s army retreated towards aldermaston as quickly as possible and eventually made it to reading and then london where essex received a hero s welcome royalists on other hand were forced to spend next day recovering their casualties finding more than a thousand injured soldiers who were sent back to oxford after they finished recovering their dead and wounded men royalists left 200 infantry 25 cavalry and 4 guns in donnington castle to defend their rear and then marched to oxford having buried their dead senior officers in newbury guildhall casualties at newbury eventually came to approximately 1 300 losses for royalists and 1 200 for parliamentarians loss at newbury was due to a multitude of factors day gives credit to greater ability of essex to conserve his force through campaign which put royalists at a numerical disadvantage by newbury and notes royalist over reliance on cavalry with essex compensating for his much lamented paucity of cavalry by tactical ingenuity and firepower countering rupert s cavalry by driving them off with mass infantry formations royalists infantry were also outperformed essex s force retaining a high level of cohesiveness while royalists were described as relatively unprofessional both day and blair worden also give paucity of ammunition and gunpowder as an important and endemic deciding factor in success or failure of charles campaign although attention of historians is normally on larger battles such as edgehill and marston moor several historians who have studied period consider first battle of newbury to be defining moment of first english civil war both as high point of royalist advance and as one bright period of essex s generalship john day writes that militarily and politically parliament s position at beginning of october 1643 was demonstrably far stronger than in late july with hindsight capture of bristol was high tide of king charles war his best and only chance of ending conflict on his own terms john barratt noted that royalists had failed in what might prove to have been their best chance to destroy principle field army of their opponents and hopes of a crushing victory which would bring down parliamentarian war party lay in ruins high parliamentarian feelings after newbury led to signing of solemn league and covenant bringing a powerful scottish army down to assault royalists thanks to failure to win a decisive victory there english welsh scottish and irish subjects of all of king charles three kingdoms would henceforth play a bloody price in a steadily widening and deepening war sources and historiography malcolm has described first battle of newbury as being both longest battle of english civil war and one that historians have found greatest difficulty in describing this is because there is no contemporary plan of battlefield or record of plans of each side while conversely there are diverse and contradictory accounts from both sides of battle an official royalist account was written by lord digby on 22 september which suffered from defects due to digby s position away from main fighting and because it was designed as a reflection on battle s outcome not a blow by blow description of what happened conversely those written by officers who actively fought in main arenas of battle are very narrow in focus for example accounts of joshua moone and john gwyn commoners who fought on wash common and an anonymous tract from perspective of a soldier who assaulted round hill on parliamentarian side an official source was published a month after battle due to circumstances of its publication and high parliamentarian morale after newbury it made no attempt to gloss over errors and was designed to explain to a lay readership what had happened on battlefield a more narrow view was taken by sergeant henry foster who fought with london trained band in their attempt to prevent royalists splitting essex s army diary of walter yonge of also contains two reports written for house of commons by essex s generals including stapleton although originals have been lost references bibliography further reading category 1643 in england category battles of english civil wars category newbury berkshire
