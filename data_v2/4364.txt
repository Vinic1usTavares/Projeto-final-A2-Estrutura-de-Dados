deinonychus from terrible and genitive claw is a genus of dromaeosaurid theropod dinosaur with one described species deinonychus antirrhopus this species which could grow up to long lived during early cretaceous period about 115 108 million years ago from mid aptian to early albian stages fossils have been recovered from u s states of montana utah wyoming and oklahoma in rocks of cloverly formation cedar mountain formation and antlers formation though teeth that may belong to deinonychus have been found much farther east in maryland paleontologist john ostrom s study of deinonychus in late 1960s revolutionized way scientists thought about dinosaurs leading to dinosaur renaissance and igniting debate on whether dinosaurs were warm blooded or cold blooded before this popular conception of dinosaurs had been one of plodding reptilian giants ostrom noted small body sleek horizontal posture ratite like spine and especially enlarged raptorial claws on feet which suggested an active agile predator terrible claw refers to unusually large sickle shaped talon on second toe of each hind foot fossil ypm 5205 preserves a large strongly curved ungual in life archosaurs have a horny sheath over this bone which extends length ostrom looked at crocodile and bird claws and reconstructed claw for ypm 5205 as over long species name antirrhopus means counter balance which refers to ostrom s idea about function of tail as in other dromaeosaurids tail vertebrae have a series of ossified tendons and super elongated bone processes these features seemed to make tail into a stiff counterbalance but a fossil of very closely related velociraptor mongoliensis igm 100 986 has an articulated tail skeleton that is curved laterally in a long s shape this suggests that in life tail could bend to sides with a high degree of flexibility in both cloverly and antlers formations deinonychus remains have been found closely associated with those of ornithopod tenontosaurus teeth discovered associated with tenontosaurus specimens imply they were hunted or at least scavenged upon by deinonychus discovery and naming fossilized remains of deinonychus have been recovered from cloverly formation of montana and wyoming and in roughly contemporary antlers formation of oklahoma in north america cloverly formation has been dated to late aptian through early albian stages of early cretaceous about 115 to 108 ma additionally teeth found in arundel clay facies mid aptian of potomac formation on atlantic coastal plain of maryland may be assigned to genus first remains were uncovered in 1931 in southern montana near town of billings team leader paleontologist barnum brown was primarily concerned with excavating and preparing remains of ornithopod dinosaur tenontosaurus but in his field report from dig site to american museum of natural history he reported discovery of a small carnivorous dinosaur close to a tenontosaurus skeleton but encased in lime difficult to prepare he informally called animal daptosaurus agilis and made preparations for describing it and having skeleton specimen amnh 3015 put on display but never finished this work brown brought back from cloverly formation skeleton of a smaller theropod with seemingly oversized teeth that he informally named john ostrom reviewing this material decades later realized that teeth came from deinonychus but skeleton came from a completely different animal he named this skeleton microvenator thumb cast of holotype foot ypm 5205 from two angles a little more than thirty years later in august 1964 paleontologist john ostrom led an expedition from yale s peabody museum of natural history which discovered more skeletal material near bridger expeditions during following two summers uncovered more than 1 000 bones among which were at least three individuals since association between various recovered bones was weak making exact number of individual animals represented impossible to determine properly type specimen ypm 5205 of deinonychus was restricted to complete left foot and partial right foot that definitely belonged to same individual remaining specimens were catalogued in fifty separate entries at yale s peabody museum although they could have been from as few as three individuals later study by ostrom and grant e meyer analyzed their own material as well as brown s daptosaurus in detail and found them to be same species ostrom first published his findings in february 1969 giving all referred remains new name of deinonychus antirrhopus specific name antirrhopus from greek means counterbalancing and refers to likely purpose of a stiffened tail in july 1969 ostrom published a very extensive monograph on deinonychus though a myriad of bones was available by 1969 many important ones were missing or hard to interpret there were few postorbital skull elements no femurs no sacrum no furcula or sternum missing vertebrae and ostrom thought only a tiny fragment of a coracoid ostrom s skeletal reconstruction of deinonychus included a very unusual pelvic bone a pubis that was trapezoidal and flat unlike that of other theropods but which was same length as ischium and which was found right next to it further findings thumb left specimen mcz 4371 with skull cast at harvard university in 1974 ostrom published another monograph on shoulder of deinonychus in which he realized that pubis that he had described was actually a coracoid a shoulder element in that same year another specimen of deinonychus mcz 4371 was discovered and excavated in montana by steven during a harvard university expedition headed by farish jenkins this discovery added several new elements well preserved femora a sacrum and better ilia as well as elements of pes and metatarsus ostrom described this specimen and revised his skeletal restoration of deinonychus this time it showed very long pubis and ostrom began to suspect that they may have even been a little like those of birds thumb reconstructed skeleton of specimen amnh 3015 with outdated hand posture a skeleton of deinonychus including bones from original and most complete amnh 3015 specimen can be seen on display at american museum of natural history with another specimen mcz 4371 on display at museum of comparative zoology at harvard university american museum and harvard specimens are from a different locality than yale specimens even these two skeletal mounts are lacking elements including sterna sternal ribs furcula and gastralia parsons w l k m 2009 further descriptions of osteology of deinonychus antirrhopus saurischia theropoda bulletin of buffalo society of natural sciences 38 even after all ostrom s work several small blocks of lime encased material remained unprepared in storage at american museum these consisted mostly of isolated bones and bone fragments including original matrix or surrounding rock in which specimens were initially buried an examination of these unprepared blocks by gerald grellet tinner and peter makovicky in 2000 revealed an interesting overlooked feature several long thin bones identified on blocks as ossified tendons structures that helped stiffen tail of deinonychus turned out to actually represent gastralia abdominal ribs more significantly a large number of previously unnoticed fossilized eggshells were discovered in rock matrix that had surrounded original deinonychus specimen in a subsequent more detailed report on eggshells grellet tinner and makovicky concluded that egg almost certainly belonged to deinonychus representing first dromaeosaurid egg to be identified moreover external surface of one eggshell was found in close contact with gastralia suggesting that deinonychus might have brooded its eggs this implies that deinonychus used body heat transfer as a mechanism for egg incubation and indicates an endothermy similar to modern birds further study by gregory erickson and colleagues finds that this individual was 13 or 14 years old at death and its growth had plateaued unlike other theropods in their study of specimens found associated with eggs or nests it had finished growing at time of its death implications thumb upright similarity of forelimbs left with those of archaeopteryx right led john ostrom to revive link between dinosaurs and birds ostrom s description of deinonychus in 1969 has been described as most important single discovery of dinosaur paleontology in mid 20th century discovery of this clearly active agile predator did much to change scientific and popular conception of dinosaurs and opened door to speculation that some dinosaurs may have been warm blooded this development has been termed dinosaur renaissance several years later ostrom noted similarities between forefeet of deinonychus and that of birds an observation which led him to revive hypothesis that birds are descended from dinosaurs forty years later this idea is almost universally accepted because of its extremely bird like anatomy and close relationship to other dromaeosaurids paleontologists hypothesize that deinonychus was probably covered in feathers clear fossil evidence of modern avian style feathers exists for several related dromaeosaurids including velociraptor and microraptor though no direct evidence is yet known for deinonychus itself when conducting studies of such areas as range of motion in forelimbs paleontologists like phil senter have taken likely presence of wing feathers as present in all known dromaeosaurs with skin impressions into consideration description left thumb size compared with a human based on few fully mature specimens deinonychus could reach in length with a skull length of a hip height of and a weight of though there is a higher estimate of skull was equipped with powerful jaws lined with around seventy curved blade like teeth studies of skull have progressed a great deal over decades ostrom reconstructed partial imperfectly preserved skulls that he had as triangular broad and fairly similar to allosaurus additional deinonychus skull material and closely related species found with good three dimensional preservation show that palate was more vaulted than ostrom thought making snout far narrower while jugals flared broadly giving greater stereoscopic vision skull of deinonychus was different from that of velociraptor however in that it had a more robust skull roof like that of dromaeosaurus and did not have depressed nasals of velociraptor both skull and lower jaw had fenestrae skull openings which reduced weight of skull in deinonychus antorbital fenestra a skull opening between eye and nostril was particularly large deinonychus possessed large hands manus with three claws on each forelimb first digit was shortest and second was longest each hind foot bore a sickle shaped claw on second digit which was probably used during predation thumb life restoration no skin impressions have ever been found in association with fossils of deinonychus nonetheless evidence suggests that dromaeosauridae including deinonychus had feathers genus microraptor is both older geologically and more primitive phylogenetically than deinonychus and within same family multiple fossils of microraptor preserve pennaceous vaned feathers like those of modern birds on arms legs and tail along with covert and contour feathers velociraptor is geologically younger than deinonychus but even more closely related within subfamily velociraptorinae see classification below a specimen of velociraptor has been found with quill knobs on ulna quill knobs are where follicular ligaments attached and are a direct indicator of feathers of modern aspect classification deinonychus antirrhopus is one of best known dromaeosaurid species and also a close relative of smaller velociraptor which is found in younger late cretaceous age rock formations in central asia clade they form is also called velociraptorinae subfamily name velociraptorinae was first coined by rinchen barsbold in 1983 and originally contained single genus velociraptor later phil currie included most of dromaeosaurids abstract two late cretaceous genera tsaagan from mongolia and north american saurornitholestes may also be close relatives but latter is poorly known and hard to classify velociraptor and its allies are regarded as using their claws more than their skulls as killing tools as opposed to like dromaeosaurus which have stockier skulls phylogenetically dromaeosaurids represent one of non avialan dinosaur groups most closely related to birds cladogram below follows a 2015 analysis by paleontologists robert depalma david burnham larry martin peter larson and robert bakker using updated data from theropod working group thumb size of

paleobiology predatory behavior thumb left artist s interpretation of a deinonychus preying on a zephyrosaurus in manner suggested by fowler et al 2011 deinonychus teeth found in association with fossils of ornithopod dinosaur tenontosaurus are quite common in cloverly formation two quarries have been discovered that preserve fairly complete deinonychus fossils near tenontosaurus fossils first yale quarry in cloverly of montana includes numerous teeth four adult deinonychus and one juvenile deinonychus association of this number of deinonychus skeletons in a single quarry suggests that deinonychus may have fed on that animal and perhaps hunted it ostrom and maxwell have even used this information to speculate that deinonychus might have lived and hunted in packs abstract second such quarry is from antlers formation of oklahoma site contains six partial skeletons of tenontosaurus of various sizes along with one partial skeleton and many teeth of deinonychus one tenontosaur humerus even bears what might be deinonychus tooth marks brinkman et al 1998 point out that deinonychus had an adult mass of 70 100 kilograms whereas adult were 1 4 metric tons a solitary deinonychus could not kill an adult tenontosaur suggesting that pack hunting is possible a 2007 study by roach and brinkman has called into question cooperative pack hunting behavior of deinonychus based on what is known of modern carnivore hunting and taphonomy of tenontosaur sites modern archosaurs birds and crocodiles and komodo dragons typically display little cooperative hunting instead they are usually either solitary hunters or are drawn to previously killed carcasses where much conflict occurs between individuals of same species for example in situations where groups of komodo dragons are eating together largest individuals eat first and will attack smaller that attempt to feed if smaller animal is killed it is cannibalized when this information is applied to tenontosaur sites it appears that what is found is consistent with deinonychus having a komodo or crocodile like feeding strategy deinonychus skeletal remains found at these sites are from subadults with missing parts consistent with having been eaten by other deinonychus on other hand a paper by li et al describes track sites with similar foot spacing and parallel trackways implying gregarious packing behavior instead of uncoordinated feeding behavior it should also be noted that contrary to claim crocodilians do not hunt cooperatively they have actually been observed to hunt cooperatively meaning that notion of infighting competition for food and cannibalism ruling out cooperative feeding may actually be a false dichotomy thumb upright foot mor 747 in flexion in 2011 denver fowler and colleagues suggested a new method by which deinonychus and other dromaeosaurs may have captured and restrained prey this model known as raptor prey restraint rpr model of predation proposes that deinonychus killed its prey in a manner very similar to extant accipitrid birds of prey by leaping onto its quarry pinning it under its body weight and gripping it tightly with large sickle shaped claws like accipitrids dromaeosaur would then begin to feed on animal while still alive until it eventually died from blood loss and organ failure this proposal is based primarily on comparisons between morphology and proportions of feet and legs of dromaeosaurs to several groups of extant birds of prey with known predatory behaviors fowler found that feet and legs of dromaeosaurs most closely resemble those of eagles and hawks especially in terms of having an enlarged second claw and a similar range of grasping motion however short metatarsus and foot strength would have been more similar to that of owls rpr method of predation would be consistent with other aspects of deinonychus s anatomy such as their unusual jaw and arm morphology arms were likely covered in long feathers and may have been used as flapping stabilizers for balance while atop struggling prey along with stiff counterbalancing tail its jaws thought to have had a comparatively weak bite force might be used for saw motion bites like modern komodo dragon which also has a weak bite force to finish off its prey if its kicks were not powerful enough bite force thumb left reconstructed skull and neck royal ontario museum bite force estimates for deinonychus were first produced in 2005 based on reconstructed jaw musculature this study concluded that deinonychus likely had a maximum bite force only 15 that of modern american alligator a 2010 study by paul gignac and colleagues attempted to estimate bite force based directly on newly discovered deinonychus tooth puncture marks in bones of a tenontosaurus these puncture marks came from a large individual and provided first evidence that large deinonychus could bite through bone using tooth marks gignac s team were able to determine that bite force of deinonychus was significantly higher than earlier studies had estimated by biomechanical studies alone they found bite force of deinonychus to be between 4 100 and 8 200 newtons greater than living carnivorous mammals including hyena and equivalent to a similarly sized alligator gignac and colleagues also noted however that bone puncture marks from deinonychus are relatively rare and unlike larger theropods with many known puncture marks like tyrannosaurus deinonychus probably did not frequently bite through or eat bone instead they probably used their high bite force in defense or prey capture rather than feeding limb function thumb upright cast in climbing posture despite being most distinctive feature of deinonychus shape and curvature of sickle claw varies between specimens type specimen described by ostrom in 1969 has a strongly curved sickle claw while a newer specimen described in 1976 had a claw with much weaker curvature more similar in profile with normal claws on remaining toes ostrom suggested that this difference in size and shape of sickle claws could be due to individual sexual or age related variation but admitted he could not be sure there is anatomical and trackway evidence that this talon was held up off ground while dinosaur walked on third and fourth toes ostrom suggested that deinonychus could kick with sickle claw to cut and slash at its prey some researchers even suggested that talon was used to disembowel large ceratopsian dinosaurs adams dawn 1987 bigger they are harder they fall implications of ischial curvature in ceratopsian dinosaurs pp 1 6 in currie philip j and koster e eds fourth symposium on mesozoic terrestrial ecosystems tyrrell museum drumheller canada other studies have suggested that sickle claws were not used to slash but rather to deliver small stabs to victim in 2005 manning and colleagues ran tests on a robotic replica that precisely matched anatomy of deinonychus and velociraptor and used hydraulic rams to make robot strike a pig carcass in these tests talons made only shallow punctures and could not cut or slash authors suggested that talons would have been more effective in climbing than in dealing killing blows ostrom compared deinonychus to ostrich and cassowary he noted that bird species can inflict serious injury with large claw on second toe cassowary has claws up to long ostrom cited gilliard 1958 in saying that they can sever an arm or disembowel a man kofron 1999 and 2003 studied 241 documented cassowary attacks and found that one human and two dogs had been killed but no evidence that cassowaries can disembowel or dismember other animals kofron p 1999 attacks to humans and domestic animals by southern cassowary casuarius casuarius in queensland australia cassowaries use their claws to defend themselves to attack threatening animals and in agonistic displays such as bowed threat display also has an enlarged second toe claw and uses it to tear apart small prey items for swallowing in 2011 a study suggested that sickle claw would likely have been used to pin down prey while biting it rather than as a slashing weapon thumb left hand bones of mor 747 biomechanical studies by ken carpenter in 2002 confirmed that most likely function of forelimbs in predation was grasping as their great lengths would have permitted longer reach than for most other theropods rather large and elongated coracoid indicating powerful muscles in forelimbs further strengthened this interpretation carpenter s biomechanical studies using bone casts also showed that deinonychus could not fold its arms against its body like a bird avian folding contrary to what was inferred from earlier 1985 descriptions by jacques gauthier and gregory s paul in 1988 studies by phil senter in 2006 indicated that deinonychus forelimbs could be used not only for grasping but also for clutching objects towards chest if deinonychus had feathered fingers and wings feathers would have limited range of motion of forelimbs to some degree for example when deinonychus extended its arm forward palm of hand automatically rotated to an upward facing position this would have caused one wing to block other if both forelimbs were extended at same time leading senter to conclude that clutching objects to chest would have only been accomplished with one arm at a time function of fingers would also have been limited by feathers for example only third digit of hand could have been employed in activities such as probing crevices for small prey items and only in a position perpendicular to main wing alan in a 2001 study of deinonychus forelimb mechanics found that even if large wing feathers were present grasping ability of hand would not have been significantly hindered rather grasping would have been accomplished perpendicular to wing and objects likely would have been held by both hands simultaneously in a bear hug fashion findings which have been supported by later forelimb studies by carpenter and senter in a 2001 study conducted by bruce rothschild and other paleontologists 43 hand bones and 52 foot bones referred to deinonychus were examined for signs of stress fracture none were found rothschild b tanke d h and ford t l 2001 theropod stress fractures and tendon as a clue to activity in mesozoic vertebrate life edited by tanke d h and carpenter k indiana university press pp 331 336 second phalanx of second toe in specimen ypm 5205 has a healed fracture molnar r e 2001 theropod paleopathology a literature survey in mesozoic vertebrate life edited by tanke d h and carpenter k indiana university press pp 337 363 parsons and parsons have shown that juvenile and sub adult specimens of deinonychus display some morphological differences from adults for instance arms of younger specimens were proportionally longer than those of adults a possible indication of difference in behavior between young and adults another example of this could be function of pedal claws parsons and parsons have suggested that claw curvature which ostrom 1976 had already shown was different between specimens maybe was greater for juvenile deinonychus as this could help it climb in trees and that claws became straighter as animal became older and started to live solely on ground this was based on hypothesis that some small dromaeosaurids used their pedal claws for climbing in a 2015 paper they reported after further analysis of immature fossils that open and mobile nature of shoulder joint might have meant that young deinonychus were capable of some form of flight speed thumb restoration of a walking individual dromaeosaurids especially deinonychus are often depicted as unusually fast running animals in popular media and ostrom himself speculated that deinonychus was fleet footed in his original description however when first described a complete leg of deinonychus had not been found and ostrom s speculation about length of femur upper leg bone later proved to have been an overestimate in a later study ostrom noted that ratio of femur to tibia lower leg bone is not as important in determining speed as relative length of foot and lower leg in modern fleet footed birds like ostrich foot tibia ratio is 95 in unusually fast running dinosaurs like struthiomimus ratio is 68 but in deinonychus ratio is 48 ostrom stated that only reasonable conclusion is that deinonychus while far from slow moving was not particularly fast compared to other dinosaurs and certainly not as fast as modern flightless birds low foot to lower leg ratio in deinonychus is due partly to an unusually short metatarsus upper foot bones ratio is actually larger in smaller individuals than in larger ones ostrom suggested that short metatarsus may be related to function of sickle claw and used fact that it appears to get shorter as individuals aged as support for this he interpreted all these features short second toe with enlarged claw short metatarsus etc as support for use of hind leg as an offensive weapon where sickle claw would strike downwards and backwards and leg pulled back and down at same time slashing and tearing at prey ostrom suggested that short metatarsus reduced overall stress on leg bones during such an attack and interpreted unusual arrangement of muscle attachments in deinonychus leg as support for his idea that a different set of muscles was used in predatory stroke than in walking or running therefore ostrom concluded that legs of deinonychus represented a balance between running adaptations needed for an agile predator and stress reducing features to compensate for its unique foot weapon in his 1981 study of canadian dinosaur footprints richard kool produced rough walking speed estimates based on several trackways made by different species in gething formation of british columbia kool estimated one of these trackways representing gracilis which may have been made by deinonychus to have a walking speed of 10 1 kilometers per hour 6 miles per hour eggs thumb left artist s impression of an individual in brooding position identification in 2000 of a probable deinonychus egg associated with one of original specimens allowed comparison with other theropod dinosaurs in terms of egg structure nesting and reproduction in their 2006 examination of specimen grellet tinner and makovicky examined possibility that dromaeosaurid had been feeding on egg or that egg fragments had been associated with deinonychus skeleton by coincidence they dismissed idea that egg had been a meal for theropod noting that fragments were sandwiched between belly ribs and forelimb bones making it impossible that they represented contents of animal s stomach in addition manner in which egg had been crushed and fragmented indicated that it had been intact at time of burial and was broken by fossilization process idea that egg was randomly associated with dinosaur was also found to be unlikely bones surrounding egg had not been scattered or disarticulated but remained fairly intact relative to their positions in life indicating that area around and including egg was not disturbed during preservation fact that these bones were belly ribs gastralia which are very rarely found articulated supported this interpretation all evidence according to grellet tinner and makovicky indicates that egg was intact beneath body of deinonychus when it was buried it is possible that this represents brooding or nesting behavior in deinonychus similar to that seen in related troodontids and oviraptorids or that egg was in fact inside oviduct when animal died examination of deinonychus egg s microstructure confirms that it belonged to a theropod since it shares characteristics with other known theropod eggs and shows dissimilarities with ornithischian and sauropod eggs compared to other maniraptoran theropods egg of deinonychus is more similar to those of oviraptorids than to those of troodontids despite studies that show latter are more closely related to dromaeosaurids like deinonychus while egg was too badly crushed to accurately determine its size grellet tinner and makovicky estimated a diameter of about 7 cm 2 7 in based on width of pelvic canal through which egg had to have passed this size is similar to 7 2 cm diameter of largest citipati an oviraptorid eggs citipati and deinonychus also shared same overall body size supporting this estimate additionally thicknesses of citipati and deinonychus eggshells are almost identical and since shell thickness correlates with egg volume this further supports idea that eggs of these two animals were about same size a study published in november 2018 by norell yang and wiemann et al indicates that deinonychus laid blue eggs likely to camouflage them as well as creating open nests study also indicates that deinonychus and other dinosaurs that created open nests likely represent an origin of color in modern bird eggs as an adaptation both for recognition and camouflage against predators paleoecology geological evidence suggests that deinonychus inhabited a floodplain or habitat paleoenvironment of both upper cloverly formation and antlers formation in which remains of deinonychus have been found consisted of tropical or sub tropical forests deltas and lagoons not unlike today s louisiana other animals deinonychus shared its world with include herbivorous dinosaurs such as armored and ornithopods zephyrosaurus and tenontosaurus in oklahoma ecosystem of deinonychus also included large theropod acrocanthosaurus huge sauropod sauroposeidon crocodilians and and gar if teeth found in maryland are those of deinonychus then its neighbors would include and a nodosaur called only known from teeth middle portion of cloverly formation ranges in age from 115 10 ma near base to 108 5 0 2 ma near top cultural significance thumb modern feathered and outdated scaly model westphalian museum of natural were featured prominently in both novels jurassic park and lost world by michael crichton and film adaptations directed by steven spielberg however crichton ultimately chose to use name velociraptor for these dinosaurs rather than deinonychus crichton had met with john ostrom several times during writing process to discuss details of possible range of behaviors and life appearance of deinonychus crichton at one point apologetically told ostrom that he had decided to use name velociraptor in place of deinonychus for his book because he felt former name was more dramatic despite this according to ostrom crichton stated that velociraptor of novel was based on deinonychus in almost every detail and that only name had been changed cummings m yale s legacy in jurassic world yale news 18 jun 2015 jurassic park filmmakers followed suit designing film s models based almost entirely on deinonychus instead of actual velociraptor and they reportedly requested all of ostrom s published papers on deinonychus
