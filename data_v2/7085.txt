battle of abu hamed occurred on 7 august 1897 between a flying column of anglo egyptian soldiers under major general sir archibald hunter and a garrison of mahdist rebels led by mohammed zain battle was a victory for anglo egyptian forces and secured for british strategically vital town of abu hamed which was terminus for trade and transportation across nubian desert abu hamed was of critical importance to lord herbert horatio kitchener leader of anglo egyptian campaign that commenced in march 1896 with objective of destroying mahdist state that had occupied much of sudan since initial mahdist rebellion broke out in 1881 town was to be railhead for lord kitchener s supply railway through vast and inhospitable nubian desert allowing expeditionary forces to bypass a great stretch of nile on their way to omdurman capital of mahdist sudan however town was occupied by mahdist forces and construction of desert railway could not safely proceed without their removal accordingly kitchener ordered a flying column led by major general sir archibald hunter and composed of around three thousand egyptian soldiers to march from merowe to abu hamed with all possible speed flying column departed on 29 july 1897 and marching north east along nile for eight days arrived at town as dawn broke on august 7 forming his battalions in a broad semi circle that pitted abu hamed s defenders against river major general hunter ordered his troops to advance at approximately six thirty that morning in action that followed outnumbered mahdist riflemen were driven from their defensive positions through town while a small contingent of mahdist cavalry fled south without engaging to report loss by seven thirty battle was over and major general hunter ordered news be delivered to lord kitchener major general hunter s column lost eighty killed and wounded while quantity of mahdist casualties is estimated to be between 250 and 850 mahdist commander mohammed zain was captured in fighting soon after news of victory spread work on desert railway was resumed and abu hamed reached on october 31 where major general hunter and his column had remained with completion of railway across nubian desert kitchener s general advance into heartland of mahdist sudan was guaranteed and greatest issue of kitchener s campaign supply resolved origins background left thumb

thousand egyptian soldiers and an extensive supply train was given simple objective of crushing insurrection colonel hicks and nearly every man in his army was killed by an overwhelming mahdist force at battle of el pakenham 1991 p 214 after this defeat and facing immense financial difficulties in egypt british government decided not to pursue further offensive action and instead selected general charles george gordon to lead evacuation effort as thousands of civilians and pounds of equipment were to be withdrawn from outposts throughout sudan pakenham 1991 p 215 gordon operating out of khartoum helped extricate many loyal civilians who remained in sudan but refused ultimately to abandon city contrary to his orders he retained a small force in khartoum and determined to give battle with mahdi before relinquishing control perry 2005 p 176 accordingly mahdist forces besieged khartoum in march 1884 isolating city from outside world and placing a dire timer upon gordon to surrender after much delay british government reluctantly dispatched a relief expedition under sir garnet wolseley that would rapidly follow nile to khartoum wolseley s column arrived on 28 january 1885 two days after khartoum had fallen and general charles gordon s head delivered to mahdi kochanski 1999 p 171 mahdi died less than six months later but not before establishing his islamic state in sudan

whereupon government in britain was impelled to act by several factors egyptian economy had improved since british administrators commandeered country s finances public sentiment towards mahdist sudan

ground along its banks is unsuitable for railroads these conditions did not render approach impossible only difficult dangerous and slow kitchener sought an alternative route and settled on one widely thought to be infeasible he determined to build a railway across vast dry and scorching nubian desert that would connect wady halfa to abu hamed a small town then under mahdist control premier engineers in britain deemed railroad an impossibility for several reasons foremost of which being speculated lack of available water sources along 120 miles of proposed 230 mile line simner 2017 ch 7 kitchener disregarded this impediment and all others ordering well known lieutenant percy girouard to make preparations to begin construction capable engineer conducted extensive surveys of proposed line and found that although terrain was certainly difficult and water fearfully sparse line was possible decision was made in december 1896 and work on railway officially begun 1 january 1897 keown boyd 1986 p 153 despite immense difficulties involved in development of such a railway steady progress was made and by 23 july 1897 track stretched 103 miles into desert raugh jr 2008 p xxxviii here

awaiting completion of line to begin general advance alford 1898 p 163 4 as well every delay offered greater chances for disaster if mahdists were alerted to kitchener s plans whole operation would be jeopardized and catastrophic fate of general gordon s expedition potentially repeated in may a scouting mission under captain le had reconnoitered area surrounding abu hamed reporting that town was weakly defended and mahdist presence throughout area fairly slim though khalifa s forces had been moving recently and no one could be sure reinforcements were not on way churchill 2014 1902 p 201

column set out from a small town a few miles north of merowe at five thirty evening of july 29 marching only at night so as to avoid both heat of sun and eyes of any mahdist lookouts there was no road or path to follow and terrain upon which hunter s flying column marched was nearly route alternated between broken rocky ground and ankle high sand ultimately proving extremely difficult to navigate in dark of night added to these difficulties was measure of speed imposed upon column as mounted major general hunter and lieutenant macdonald drove their units to their breaking points in order to preempt mahdist reinforcements column advanced until midnight completing a march of over sixteen miles sleeping during day was made impossible by sweltering heat only when adequate shade was found in barren desert could exhausted men of hunter s flying column rest churchill 2014 1902 p 208 advance continued in this fashion until village of el was reached on august 4 where a shot fired at column alerted major general hunter that his presence was known to mahdists fully aware that reinforcements would be on their way to abu hamed major general hunter further increased his column s pace despite

battery was with 3rd egyptian force reached ridge of plateau overlooking town about three hundred yards away at a quarter past six major general hunter finding mahdist garrison prepared for assault and entrenched in their defenses ordered artillery to bombard their positions which commenced at six thirty however artillery proved ineffective as guns were unable to strike within narrow trenches or blast aside cover behind which mahdist infantry waited hunter ceased barrage and ordered lieutenant macdonald to lead his brigade in a general advance command to fix bayonets was given and troops began an orderly advance across three hundred yards that separated them from their objective however facing a line of mahdist riflemen well protected in their trenches soldiers of each advancing battalion were compelled to open fire without direct orders 2011 p 53 uncoordinated volleys of advancing brigade were moderately effective against mahdist riflemen who had not yet returned fire when battalions were about halfway across three hundred yard stretch their lines of fire began to converge due to their semi circle formation and 10th sudanese on left was forced to halt to avoid coming under fire of rightmost 11th sudanese churchill 2014 1902 p 210 left thumb krupp 75 mm field gun similar to those used in major general archibald hunter s artillery battery mahdists in trenches

sidney and lieutenant edward fitzclarence three egyptian officers and a dozen regular soldiers were killed in volleys over fifty were wounded across brigade following this exchange battalions abandoned their orderly approach and charged trenches with their bayonets a furious melee ensued wherein soldiers of macdonald s brigade poured into trenches and through town engaging in vicious hand to hand combat with mahdists wherever they were to be found in winding alleyways and narrow houses of abu hamed warner 2010 p 189 in several places artillery was used to dislodge particularly stalwart defenders while mahdist cavalry looking on as hunter s battalions swept through town turned to flee south towards berber by seven thirty town was firmly in hands of major general hunter s force almost entirety of mahdist garrison excepting cavalry had been slain in desperate combats throughout settlement however a few isolated pockets of mahdist resistance remained in fortified houses violently refusing to give up fight alford 1898 p 166 six men sent to capture a mahdist sniper s position in a small house near river were each killed forcing hunter to invoke his artillery building was shelled to ruins but sniper survived evidenced by shooting of another soldier sent to locate his body finally a second barrage of artillery blasted what remained of structure and rubble fell silent though sniper s body was never found local inhabitants had armed themselves with clubs and spears to defend themselves during battle but played little role in its outcome aftermath sources differ on number of mahdists killed in battle ranging between 250 and 850 on anglo egyptian side twenty three men were killed and sixty one wounded 10th sudanese battalion alone accounted for sixteen of twenty three killed and thirty four of sixty one wounded mahdist commander mohammed zain was captured in battle and held prisoner farwell 2001 p 4 major general hunter captured a substantial supply of weapons camels horses and property from town after battle soldiers of macdonald s brigade were berated by their commander for opening fire during their advance across three hundred yard gradient between ridge of plateau and town s defenses lieutenant macdonald had not ordered them to do so and considered it flagrant insubordination that botched his plan for a 150 yard bayonet charge brevet major henry

of unparalleled importance to kitchener s campaign his army s advance towards mahdist seat of power and necessary maintenance of that army wholly relied upon trains bearing water supplies and reinforcements that arrived on a daily basis capture of abu hamed allowed for completion of this railway across forbidding nubian desert and made kitchener s approach possible sanderson 1907 p 347 when major general hunter won abu hamed from its defenders mahdist reinforcements he knew had been racing towards town since his force was spotted on august 4 were less than twenty miles away running low on supplies and recognizing severe exhaustion of his men hunter doubted his ability to hold town in likely event of a counter attack from these approaching forces however small troop of mahdist cavalry that had fled battle met incoming detachment and informed them of events whereupon they immediately changed course due southwards in opposite direction of abu hamed commanding mahdist officer at berber heard of battle on august 9 and facing incoming anglo egyptian forces as well as violent internal division decided to evacuate city in late august spiers 1998 p 44 major general hunter then
