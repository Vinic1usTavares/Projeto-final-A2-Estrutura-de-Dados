thumb somerset somerset is a rural county in southwest of england covering it is bounded on north west by bristol channel on north by bristol and gloucestershire on north east by wiltshire on south east by dorset and on south west and west by devon it has broad central plains with several ranges of low hills landscape divides into four main geological sections from silurian through devonian and carboniferous to permian which influence landscape together with water related features low lying areas of north somerset levels and somerset levels have been subject to thousands of years of flooding and man s attempts to control flow of water in north of county limestone of mendip hills dominates landscape while in south blackdown and quantock hills rise out of levels highest areas are on exmoor wide variety of landscapes has led to several areas being designated as sites of special scientific interest for geological reasons and support a range of flora and fauna as can be seen from list of sites of special scientific interest in somerset rock ages oldest rocks are of silurian age 443 419 million years ago most southerly known outcrop of rocks of this age in britain they make up a sequence of lavas tuffs volcanic ash shales and mudstones in a narrow outcrop to northeast of shepton mallet in eastern mendip hills rocks from devonian 419 359 million years ago are found across much of exmoor quantocks including hangman sandstone and tuff and in cores of folded masses of mendip hills carboniferous period 359 299 million years ago rocks are represented by carboniferous limestone that forms mendip hills rising abruptly out of flat landscape of somerset levels and moors limestones are very fossiliferous and contain evidence of abundant marine life that existed at time of their creation including fossil crinoids sea lilies corals and brachiopods at end of permian 299 252 million years ago and triassic periods variscan orogeny resulted in formation of several mountainous areas including dartmoor in south exmoor and quantocks and mendips in taunton area permian 299 252 million years ago red sandstones and breccia outcrop although rocks of triassic age 252 201 million years ago underlie much of somerset and form solid geology of somerset moors and levels there are no glacial deposits thumb triassic rocks right and jurassic rocks left separated by blue anchor fault

red sandstones marls and conglomerates it rises as an anticline in mendips and appears in avon gorge and at portishead carboniferous limestone of marine origin covers sandstone and appears in avon gorge and at weston super mare where it contains volcanic rocks there are outlying hills at worlebury middle hope ridge down portishead down and hill main geological component of mendips is carboniferous limestone it represents remnants of a much higher range of hills that existed hundreds of millions years ago this has allowed formation of features such as cheddar gorge ebbor gorge and burrington combe there are a wide variety of caves and swallet holes caused by dissolution of rock by water further east there are silurian volcanoes carboniferous limestone outcrops variscan thrust tectonics permo triassic conglomerates sediment filled fissures a classic unconformity jurassic clays and limestones cretaceous greensand and chalk topped with tertiary remnants including sarsen stones these sediments have yielded a fairly rich fossil fauna of brachiopods and trilobites indicating that they were deposited in a shallow marine sea into which lavas were extruded rocks are quarried at moons hill near stoke st michael for aggregate coal measures appear in radstock district and surrounding somerset coalfield largely concealed by triassic and newer rocks there are two series of coal bearing sandstones and shales separated by pennant sandstone locally beds are folded and faulted there were mines in radstock and nailsea areas but these have closed this was one of first areas in world to undergo systematic geological study and mapping by john strachey and william smith in 18th century they observed rock layers or strata which led smith to creation of a testable hypothesis which he termed principle of faunal succession as recounted in simon winchester map that changed world new york harpercollins 2001 pp 59 91 mendips were mined for lead silver coal ochre fuller s earth and zinc but this has finished they were also quarried for stone notably at bath and doulting today mendips are a major source of aggregates southern uplands alt triangular shaped building made of corrugated iron and stone thumb ham hill summit and war memorial seen from stoke sub hamdon to south of somerset there is an upland with a series of rolling valleys and scarps from in east to blackdown hills another designated area of outstanding natural beauty in west this is a geologically complex area of clays limestone and marl honey coloured limestone at ham hill also known as hamdon hill is particularly important to geologists because of assemblages of fossils which it contains sedimentary features which it displays and way it relates to other rocks of equivalent age in close vicinity it has been quarried since roman times at least blackdowns are on south west border of somerset extending into devon they are composed of upper greensand scarp faces north and is steep and wooded with a south facing dip slope there is an open plateau which is not as high as mendips quantock hills are a long broad ridge from coast near watchet in north to near taunton in south they reach high at wills neck and are separated from exmoor and by a rift valley quantocks and brendon hills at eastern end of exmoor are formed by thick sequences of slates and sandstones of devonian age that were deposited by large deltas that built out into a shallow sea alt gently sloping rock slab beach in distance are cliffs showing lines of striation thumb left beach at quantoxhead wave cut platform at low tide short cliff shows rock strata quantock hills are largely formed by rocks of devonian period which consist of sediments originally laid down under a shallow sea and slowly compressed into solid rock in higher north western areas older early devonian rocks known as hangman grits predominate and can be seen in exposed rock at west quantoxhead quarry which were worked for road building further south there are newer middle and late devonian rocks known as ilfracombe beds and morte slates these include sandstone and limestone which have been quarried near aisholt at great holwell south of aisholt there is a limestone cave which is only one in devonian limestone of north devon and west somerset lower fringes around hills are composed of younger rocks of triassic period these are known as new red sandstone rocks which represent deposits of large river systems that crossed a desert plain and often contain irregular masses or veins of gypsum which was worked on foreshore at watchet scarp is to west with a dip slope to east west side is cut by combes with broad valleys on east hill tops are open heathland with woods on slopes several areas have outcrops of slates and between st audries and kilve younger rocks of jurassic period can be found this area falls within blue anchor to site of special scientific interest sssi and is considered to be of international geological importance at kilve are remains of a red brick retort built in 1924 when it was discovered that shale found in cliffs was rich in oil at blue anchor coloured alabaster found in cliffs gave rise to name of colour watchet blue exmoor alt rounded hills some wooded and a river valley are covered in snow thumb exmoor in winter exmoor is a dissected plateau of devonian sedimentary rock rising to at dunkery beacon it extends into devon but majority of area is in somerset much of area is a national park landscape is one of rounded hills with hogs back cliffs at coast due to geological movements because of high rainfall there are boggy areas and part by chains is a geological conservation review site recognised as being nationally important for its south western lowland heath communities and for transitions from ancient semi natural woodland through upland heath to blanket mire chains provides palynological record of a mid to late vegetation history on exmoor pollen sequence in peat is calibrated by radiocarbon dating area demonstrates formation of hangman sandstone group hangman sandstone represents middle devonian sequence of north devon and somerset these unusual freshwater deposits in hangman grits were mainly formed in desert conditions as this area of britain was not subject to glaciation plateau remains as a remarkably old landform quartz and iron can be detected in outcrops and subsoil underlying rocks are covered by moors are supported by wet acid soil highest point on exmoor is dunkery beacon at it is also highest point in somerset exmoor has of coastline including highest cliffs in england which reach a height of at culbone hill however crest of this coastal ridge of hills is more than from sea if a cliff is defined as having a slope greater than 60 degrees highest cliff on mainland britain is great hangman near combe martin at high with a cliff face of its sister cliff is little hangman which marks edge of exmoor exmoor s woodlands sometimes reach shoreline especially between porlock and foreland where they form single longest stretch of coastal woodland in england and wales exmoor coastal heaths have been recognised as a site of special scientific interest due to diversity of plant species present alt small stream gushes over rocks surrounded by woodlands thumb left east lyn river high ground forms catchment area for numerous rivers and streams there are about of named rivers on exmoor river exe from which exmoor takes its name rises at exe head near village of simonsbath close to bristol channel coast but flows more or less directly due south so that most of its length lies in devon river and barle valley are both designated as biological sites of special scientific interest another tributary river flows from lake action of streams has cut combes through hills down to sea which are now wooded although much of exmoor is open heathland there is an outlier of exmoor at north hill near minehead iron working was formerly carried out probably from roman period onward because exmoor was a royal forest i e a hunting reserve it was unpopulated in medieval times first house on moor was only built at simonsbath in 1654 it was not until 19th century that farms were built around moor brendon hills are an eastern outlier of exmoor with same undulating landscape but separated from main area by valley of river avill they reach a height of at hill iron ore mining was carried out from roman times up to early 20th century see also somerset geology of uk history of somerset geology of england
