about her and her family might exist at national archives herzig yoshinaga and her husband john jack herzig pored over mountains of documents from war relocation authority a task that was roughly

war ii lawsuit stated 22 causes of action including fifteen alleged violations of constitutional rights and sought 27 billion in damages despite fact us supreme court eventually ruled against class action plaintiffs lawsuit helped bring japanese american case for redress and reparations to public awareness it showed congress and executive branch that us government would have far greater exposure
