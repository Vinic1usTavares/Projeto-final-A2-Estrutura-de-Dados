who but russell t davies vetoed this somehow idea of a fourteen year old doctor on gallifrey inventing sonic screwdrivers takes away from mystery and intrigue of who he is and where he came from said davies he suggested instead a series based on doctor s former companion sarah jane smith character of sarah jane smith played by sladen appeared in doctor who from 1973 to 1976 alongside both jon pertwee as third doctor and tom baker as fourth doctor a pilot episode for another doctor who spin off series k 9 and company made in 1981 featured sarah jane and robot dog k9 however a full series

episodes of third series followed by two more appearances in fourth series he did not appear at all in series 5 production production on full series began in april 2007 two of five two part stories
