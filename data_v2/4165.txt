on sides of head and pectoral fins that are not fused to head modern sharks are classified within clade selachimorpha or and are sister group to rays however term shark has also been used for extinct members of subclass elasmobranchii outside selachimorpha such as cladoselache and xenacanthus as well as other chondrichthyes such as under this broader definition earliest known sharks date back to more than 420 million years ago acanthodians are often referred to as spiny sharks though they are not part of chondrichthyes proper they are a paraphyletic assemblage leading to cartilaginous fish as a whole since then sharks have diversified into over 500 species they range in size from small dwarf etmopterus perryi a deep sea species of only in length to whale shark rhincodon typus largest fish in world which reaches approximately in length sharks are found in all seas and are common to depths of they generally do not live in freshwater although there are a few known exceptions such as bull shark and river shark which can be found in both seawater and freshwater sharks have a covering of dermal denticles that protects their skin from damage and parasites in addition to improving their fluid dynamics they have numerous sets of replaceable teeth well known species such as tiger shark blue shark great white shark mako shark thresher shark and hammerhead shark are apex predators organisms at top of their underwater food chain many shark populations are threatened by human activities etymology until 16th century sharks were known to mariners as sea dogs this is still evidential in several species termed dogfish or porbeagle etymology of word shark is uncertain most likely etymology states that original sense of word was that of predator one who preys on others from dutch meaning villain scoundrel cf card shark loan shark etc which was later applied to fish due to its predatory behaviour online etymology dictionary shark a now disproven theory is that it derives from yucatec maya word pronounced meaning fish evidence for this etymology came from oxford english dictionary which notes shark first came into use after sir john hawkins sailors exhibited one in london in 1569 and posted to refer to large sharks of caribbean sea however middle english dictionary records an isolated occurrence of word shark referring to a sea fish in a letter written by thomas beckington in 1442 which rules out a new world etymology evolutionary history right thumb a collection of cretaceous shark teeth alt photo of dozens of yellowish fossilized teeth teeth are of various sizes and are spread out randomly on a flat black surface evidence for existence of sharks dates from ordovician period 450 420 million years ago before land vertebrates existed and before a variety of plants had colonized continents only scales have been recovered from first sharks and not all paleontologists agree that these are from true sharks suspecting that these scales are actually those of oldest generally accepted shark scales are from about 420 million years ago in silurian period first sharks looked very different from modern sharks at this time most common shark tooth is a style of thin tooth with three tines like a trident apparently to help catch fish majority of modern sharks can be traced back to around 100 million years ago most fossils are of teeth often in large numbers partial skeletons and even complete fossilized remains have been discovered estimates suggest that sharks grow tens of thousands of teeth over a lifetime which explains abundant fossils teeth consist of easily fossilized calcium phosphate an apatite when a shark dies decomposing skeleton breaks up scattering apatite prisms preservation requires rapid burial in bottom sediments among most ancient and primitive sharks is cladoselache from about 370 million years ago which has been found within paleozoic strata in ohio kentucky and tennessee at that point in earth s history these rocks made up soft bottom sediments of a large shallow ocean which stretched across much of north america cladoselache was only about long with stiff triangular fins and slender jaws its teeth had several pointed cusps which wore down from use from small number of teeth found together it is most likely that cladoselache did not replace its teeth as regularly as modern sharks its caudal fins had a similar shape to great white sharks and pelagic shortfin and longfin makos presence of whole fish arranged tail first in their stomachs suggest that they were fast swimmers with great agility most fossil sharks from about 300 to 150 million years ago can be assigned to one of two groups xenacanthida was almost exclusive to freshwater environments hooper virtual natural history museum retrieved

teeth date from 60 to 66 million years ago around time of extinction of dinosaurs in early white shark evolution there are at least two lineages one lineage is of white sharks with coarsely serrated teeth and it probably gave rise to modern great white shark and another lineage is of white sharks with finely serrated teeth these sharks attained gigantic proportions and include extinct shark c megalodon like most extinct sharks c megalodon is also primarily known from its fossil teeth and vertebrae this giant shark reached a total length tl of more than c megalodon may have approached a

branching diagram listing distinguishing characteristics including mouth snout fin spines etc sharks belong to superorder selachimorpha in subclass elasmobranchii in class chondrichthyes elasmobranchii also include rays and skates chondrichthyes also include chimaeras it was thought that sharks form a polyphyletic group some sharks are more closely related to rays than they are to some other sharks but current molecular studies support monophyly of both groups of sharks and batoids superorder selachimorpha is divided into galea or and or are heterodontiformes orectolobiformes lamniformes and carcharhiniformes lamnoids and are usually placed in one clade but recent studies show lamnoids and are a clade some scientists now think that may be are divided into hexanchiformes and squalomorpha former includes cow shark and frilled shark though some authors propose both families to be moved to separate orders squalomorpha contains squaliformes and hypnosqualea hypnosqualea may be invalid it includes squatiniformes and which may also be invalid but includes pristiophoriformes and there are more than 470 species of sharks split across twelve orders including four orders of sharks that have gone extinct carcharhiniformes commonly known as ground sharks order includes blue tiger bull grey reef blacktip reef caribbean reef blacktail reef whitetip reef and oceanic whitetip sharks collectively called requiem sharks along with houndsharks catsharks and hammerhead sharks they are distinguished by an elongated snout and a nictitating membrane which protects eyes during an attack heterodontiformes they are generally referred to as bullhead or horn sharks hexanchiformes examples from this group include cow sharks and frilled sharks which somewhat resembles a marine snake lamniformes they are commonly known as mackerel sharks they include goblin shark basking shark megamouth shark thresher sharks shortfin and longfin mako sharks and great white shark they are distinguished by their large jaws and ovoviviparous reproduction lamniformes also include extinct megalodon carcharodon megalodon orectolobiformes they are commonly referred to as carpet sharks including zebra sharks nurse sharks wobbegongs and whale shark pristiophoriformes these are sawsharks with an elongated toothed snout that they use for slashing their prey squaliformes this group includes dogfish sharks and squatiniformes also known as angel sharks they are flattened sharks with a strong resemblance to stingrays and skates cladoselachiformes hybodontiformes symmoriida xenacanthida xenacantiformes anatomy right thumb 475px general anatomical features of sharks alt drawing of a shark labeling major anatomical features including mouth snout nostril eye spiracle dorsal fin spine caudal keel clasper labial furrows gill openings precaudal pit and fins first and second dorsal anal pectoral caudal and pelvic teeth thumb teeth of tiger sharks are oblique and serrated to saw through flesh alt serrated teeth of a tiger shark used for sawing through flesh shark teeth are embedded in gums rather than directly affixed to jaw and are constantly replaced throughout life multiple rows of replacement teeth grow in a groove on inside of jaw and steadily move forward in comparison to a conveyor belt some sharks lose 30 000 or more teeth in their lifetime rate of tooth replacement varies from once every 8 to 10 days to several months in most species teeth are replaced one at a time as opposed to simultaneous replacement of an entire row which is observed in cookiecutter shark tooth shape depends on shark s diet those that feed on mollusks and crustaceans have dense and flattened teeth used for crushing those that feed on fish have needle like teeth for gripping and those that feed on larger prey such as mammals have pointed lower teeth for gripping and triangular upper teeth with serrated edges for cutting teeth of plankton feeders such as basking shark are small and non functional skeleton shark skeletons are very different from those of bony fish and terrestrial vertebrates sharks and other cartilaginous fish skates and rays have skeletons made of cartilage and connective tissue cartilage is flexible and durable yet is about half normal density of bone this reduces skeleton s weight saving energy because sharks do not have rib cages they can easily be crushed under their own weight on land jaw jaws of sharks like those of rays and skates are not attached to cranium jaw s surface in comparison to shark s vertebrae and gill arches needs extra support due to its heavy exposure to physical stress and its need for strength it has a layer of tiny hexagonal plates called tesserae which are crystal blocks of calcium salts arranged as a mosaic this gives these areas much of same strength found in bony tissue found in other animals generally sharks have only one layer of tesserae but jaws of large specimens such as bull shark tiger shark and great white shark have two to three layers or more depending on body size jaws of a large great white shark may have up to five layers in rostrum snout cartilage can be spongy and flexible to absorb power of impacts fins fin skeletons are elongated and supported with soft and unsegmented rays named filaments of elastic protein resembling horny keratin in hair and feathers most sharks have eight fins sharks can only drift away from objects directly in front of them because their fins do not allow them to move in tail first direction dermal denticles thumb dermal denticles of a lemon shark viewed through a scanning electron microscope alt dermal denticles of a lemon shark unlike bony fish sharks have a complex dermal corset made of flexible collagenous fibers and arranged as a helical network surrounding their body this works as an outer skeleton providing attachment for their swimming muscles and thus saving energy their dermal teeth give them hydrodynamic advantages as they reduce turbulence when swimming tails tails provide thrust making speed and acceleration dependent on tail shape caudal fin shapes vary considerably between shark species due to their evolution in separate environments sharks possess a heterocercal caudal fin in which dorsal portion is usually noticeably larger than ventral portion this is because shark s vertebral column extends into that dorsal portion providing a greater surface area for muscle attachment this allows more efficient locomotion among these negatively buoyant cartilaginous fish by contrast most bony fish possess a caudal fin tiger sharks have a large upper lobe which allows for slow cruising and sudden bursts of speed tiger shark must be able to twist and turn in water easily when hunting to support its varied diet whereas porbeagle shark which hunts schooling fish such as mackerel and herring has a large lower lobe to help it keep pace with its fast swimming prey other tail adaptations help sharks catch prey more directly such as thresher shark s usage of its powerful elongated upper lobe to stun fish and squid physiology buoyancy unlike bony fish sharks do not have gas filled swim bladders for buoyancy instead sharks rely on a large liver filled with oil that contains squalene and their cartilage which is about half normal density of bone their liver constitutes up to 30 of their total body mass liver s effectiveness is limited so sharks employ dynamic lift to maintain depth while swimming sand tiger sharks store air in their stomachs using it as a form of swim bladder bottom dwelling sharks like nurse shark have negative buoyancy allowing them to rest on ocean floor some sharks if inverted or stroked on nose enter a natural state of tonic immobility researchers use this condition to handle sharks safely respiration like other fish sharks extract oxygen from seawater as it passes over their gills unlike other fish shark gill slits are not covered but lie in a row behind head a modified slit called a spiracle lies just behind eye which assists shark with taking in water during respiration and plays a major role in bottom dwelling sharks spiracles are reduced or missing in active pelagic sharks while shark is moving water passes through mouth and over gills in a process known as ram ventilation while at rest most sharks pump water over their gills to ensure a constant supply of oxygenated water a small number of species have lost ability to pump water through their gills and must swim without rest these species are obligate ram ventilators and would presumably asphyxiate if unable to move obligate ram ventilation is also true of some pelagic bony fish species respiration and circulation process begins when deoxygenated blood travels to shark s two chambered heart here shark pumps blood to its gills via ventral aorta artery where it branches into afferent brachial arteries takes place in gills and blood flows into efferent brachial arteries which come together to form dorsal aorta blood flows from dorsal aorta throughout body deoxygenated blood from body then flows through posterior cardinal veins and enters posterior cardinal sinuses from there blood enters heart ventricle and cycle repeats thermoregulation most sharks are cold blooded or more precisely poikilothermic meaning that their internal body temperature matches that of their ambient environment members of family such as shortfin mako shark and great white shark are homeothermic and maintain a higher body temperature than surrounding water in these sharks a strip of aerobic red muscle located near center of body generates heat which body retains via a countercurrent exchange mechanism by a system of blood vessels called rete mirabile miraculous net common thresher and bigeye thresher sharks have a similar mechanism for maintaining an elevated body temperature osmoregulation in contrast to bony fish with exception of coelacanth blood and other tissue of sharks and chondrichthyes is generally isotonic to their marine environments because of high concentration of urea up to 2 5 and n oxide allowing them to be in osmotic balance with seawater this adaptation prevents most sharks from surviving in freshwater and they are therefore confined to marine environments a few exceptions exist such as bull shark which has developed a way to change its kidney function to excrete large amounts of urea when a shark dies urea is broken down to ammonia by bacteria causing dead body to gradually smell strongly of ammonia digestion digestion can take a long time food moves from mouth to a j shaped stomach where it is stored and initial digestion occurs unwanted items may never get past stomach and instead shark either vomits or turns its stomachs inside out and ejects unwanted items from its mouth one of biggest differences between digestive systems of sharks and mammals is that sharks have much shorter intestines this short length is achieved by spiral valve with multiple turns within a single short section instead of a long tube like intestine valve provides a long surface area requiring food to circulate inside short gut until fully digested when remaining waste products pass into cloaca biofluorescence is a characteristic of a few shark species such as swell shark and chain catshark mechanism of which is unique among marine animals and depends upon a small molecule metabolite senses smell thumb 240px shape of hammerhead shark s head may enhance olfaction by spacing nostrils further apart alt photo of hammerhead from front sharks have keen olfactory senses located in short duct which is not fused unlike bony fish between anterior and posterior nasal openings with some species able to detect as little as one part per million of blood in seawater sharks have ability to determine direction of a given scent based on timing of scent detection in each nostril function of bilateral odor arrival time differences in olfactory orientation of sharks jayne m gardiner jelle current biology 13 july 2010 vol 20 issue 13 pp 1187 1191 this is similar to method mammals use to determine direction of sound they are more attracted to chemicals found in intestines of many species and as a result often linger near or in sewage outfalls some species such as nurse sharks have external barbels that greatly increase their ability to sense prey sight thumb left eye of a sixgill shark hexanchus shark eyes are similar to eyes of other vertebrates including similar lenses corneas and retinas though their eyesight is well adapted to marine environment with help of a tissue called tapetum lucidum this tissue is behind retina and reflects light back to it thereby increasing visibility in dark waters effectiveness of tissue varies with some sharks having stronger nocturnal adaptations many sharks can contract and dilate their pupils like humans something no teleost fish can do sharks have eyelids but they do not blink because surrounding water cleans their eyes to protect their eyes some species have nictitating membranes this membrane covers eyes while hunting and when shark is being attacked however some species including great white shark carcharodon carcharias do not have this membrane but instead roll their eyes backwards to protect them when striking prey importance of sight in shark hunting behavior is debated some believe that electro and are more significant while others point to membrane as evidence that sight is important presumably shark would not protect its eyes were they unimportant use of sight probably varies with species and water conditions shark s field of vision can swap between monocular and stereoscopic at any time a micro spectrophotometry study of 17 species of shark found 10 had only rod photoreceptors and no cone cells in their retinas giving them good night vision while making them colorblind remaining seven species had in addition to rods a single type of cone photoreceptor sensitive to green and seeing only in shades of grey and green are believed to be effectively colorblind study indicates that an object s contrast against background rather than colour may be more important for object detection hearing although it is hard to test hearing of sharks they may have a sharp sense of hearing and can possibly hear prey from many miles away a small opening on each side of their heads not spiracle leads directly into inner ear through a thin channel lateral line shows a similar arrangement and is open to environment via a series of openings called lateral line pores this is a reminder of common origin of these two vibration and sound detecting organs that are grouped together as lateralis system in bony fish and tetrapods external opening into inner ear has been lost right 300px thumb electromagnetic field receptors ampullae of lorenzini and motion detecting canals in head of a shark alt drawing of shark head electroreception ampullae of lorenzini are organs they number in hundreds to thousands sharks use ampullae of lorenzini to detect electromagnetic fields that all living things produce this helps sharks particularly hammerhead shark find prey shark has greatest electrical sensitivity of any animal sharks find prey hidden in sand by detecting electric fields they produce ocean currents moving in magnetic field of earth also generate electric fields that sharks can use for orientation and possibly navigation lateral line this system is found in most fish including sharks it is a tactile sensory system which allows organism to detect water speed and pressure changes near by main component of system is a cell similar to hair cells present in vertebrate ear that interact with surrounding aquatic environment this helps sharks distinguish between currents around them obstacles off on their periphery and struggling prey out of visual view shark can sense frequencies in range of 25 to 50 hz life history thumb

shark lifespans vary by species most live 20 to 30 years spiny dogfish has one of longest lifespans at more than 100 years whale sharks rhincodon typus may also live over 100 years earlier estimates suggested greenland shark microcephalus could reach about 200 years but a recent study found that a specimen was 392 120 years old i e at least 272 years old making it longest lived vertebrate known reproduction unlike most bony fish sharks are k selected meaning that they produce a small number of well developed young as opposed to a large number of poorly developed young fecundity in sharks ranges from 2 to over 100 young per reproductive cycle sharks mature slowly relative to many other fish for example lemon sharks reach sexual maturity at around age 13 15 sexual sharks practice internal fertilization posterior part of a male shark s pelvic fins are modified into a pair of intromittent organs called claspers analogous to a mammalian penis of which one is used to deliver sperm into female mating has rarely been observed in sharks smaller catsharks often mate with male curling around female in less flexible species two sharks swim parallel to each other while male inserts a clasper into female s oviduct females in many of larger species have bite marks that appear to be a result of a male grasping them to maintain position during mating bite marks may also come from courtship behavior male may bite female to show his interest in some species females have evolved thicker skin to withstand these bites asexual there have been a number of documented cases in which a female shark who has not been in contact with a male has conceived a pup on her own through parthenogenesis in shark tank an asexual birth boston globe 10 oct 2008 details of this process are not well understood but genetic fingerprinting showed that pups had no paternal genetic contribution ruling out sperm storage extent of this behavior in wild is unknown mammals are now only major vertebrate group in which asexual reproduction has not been observed scientists say that asexual reproduction in wild is rare and probably a last ditch effort to reproduce when a mate is not present asexual reproduction diminishes genetic diversity which helps build defenses against threats to species species that rely solely on it risk extinction asexual reproduction may have contributed to blue shark s decline off irish coast brooding sharks display three ways to bear their young varying by species oviparity viviparity and ovoviviparity ovoviviparity most sharks are ovoviviparous meaning that eggs hatch in oviduct within mother s body and that egg s yolk and fluids secreted by glands in walls of oviduct nourishes embryos young continue to be nourished by remnants of yolk and oviduct s fluids as in viviparity young are born alive and fully functional sharks practice oophagy where first embryos to hatch eat remaining eggs taking this a step further sand tiger shark pups consume neighboring embryos survival strategy for ovoviviparous species is to brood young to a comparatively large size before birth whale shark is now classified as ovoviviparous rather than oviparous because eggs are now thought to have been aborted most ovoviviparous sharks give birth in sheltered areas including bays river mouths and shallow reefs they choose such areas for protection from predators mainly other sharks and abundance of food dogfish have longest known gestation period of any shark at 18 to 24 months basking sharks and frilled sharks appear to have even longer gestation periods but accurate data are lacking oviparity some species are oviparous laying their fertilized eggs in water in most oviparous shark species an egg case with consistency of leather protects developing embryo s these cases may be into crevices for protection egg case is commonly called a mermaid s purse oviparous sharks include horn shark catshark port jackson shark and viviparity viviparity is gestation of young without use of a traditional egg and results in live birth viviparity in sharks can be placental or aplacental young are born fully formed and self sufficient hammerheads requiem sharks such as bull and blue sharks and smoothhounds are viviparous behavior classic view describes a solitary hunter ranging oceans in search of food however this applies to only a few species most live far more social

travel 70 to 80 km in a day secret life of sharks maria adelaide advertiser 3 march 2012 intelligence sharks possess brain to body mass ratios that are similar to mammals and birds and have exhibited apparent curiosity and behavior resembling play in wild there is evidence that juvenile lemon sharks can use observational learning in their investigation of novel objects in their environment sleep all sharks need to keep water flowing over their gills in order for them to breathe however not all species need to be moving to do this those that are able to breathe while not swimming do so by using their spiracles to force water over their gills thereby allowing them to extract oxygen from water it has been recorded that their eyes remain open while in this state and actively follow movements of divers swimming around them and as such they are not truly asleep species that do need to swim continuously to breathe go through a process known as sleep swimming in which shark is essentially unconscious it is known from experiments conducted on spiny dogfish that its spinal cord rather than its brain coordinates swimming so spiny dogfish can continue to swim while sleeping and this also may be case in larger shark species in 2016 a great white shark was captured on video for first time in a state researchers believed was sleep swimming ecology feeding most sharks are carnivorous basking sharks whale sharks and megamouth sharks have independently evolved different strategies for filter feeding plankton basking sharks practice ram feeding whale sharks use suction to take in plankton and small fishes and megamouth sharks make suction feeding more efficient by using luminescent tissue inside of their mouths to attract prey in deep ocean this type of feeding requires gill rakers long slender filaments that form a very efficient sieve analogous to baleen plates of great whales shark traps plankton in these filaments and swallows from time to time in huge mouthfuls teeth in these species are comparatively small because they are not needed for feeding unlike many other sharks great white shark is not actually an apex predator in all of its natural environments as it is sometimes hunted by orcas thumb right alt photo of great white on surface with open jaws revealing meal other highly specialized feeders include cookiecutter sharks which feed on flesh sliced out of other larger fish and marine mammals cookiecutter teeth are enormous compared to animal s size lower teeth are particularly sharp although they have never been observed feeding they are believed to latch onto their prey and use their thick lips to make a seal twisting their bodies to rip off flesh some seabed dwelling species are highly effective ambush predators angel sharks and wobbegongs use camouflage to lie in wait and suck prey into their mouths many benthic sharks feed solely on crustaceans which they crush with their flat teeth other sharks feed on squid or fish which they swallow whole viper dogfish has teeth it can point outwards to strike and capture prey that it then swallows intact great white and other large predators either swallow small prey whole or take huge bites out of large animals thresher sharks use their long tails to stun shoaling fishes and sawsharks either stir prey from seabed or slash at swimming prey with their tooth studded rostra many sharks including whitetip reef shark are cooperative feeders and hunt in packs to herd and capture elusive prey these social sharks are often migratory traveling huge distances around ocean basins in large schools these migrations may be partly necessary to find new food sources range and habitat sharks are found in all seas they generally do not live in fresh water with a few exceptions such as bull shark and river shark which can swim both in seawater and freshwater sharks are common down to depths of and some live even deeper but they are almost entirely absent below

more than 470 species only four have been involved in a significant number of fatal unprovoked attacks on humans great white oceanic whitetip tiger and bull sharks these sharks are large powerful predators and may sometimes attack and kill people despite being responsible for attacks on humans they have all been filmed without using a protective cage perception of sharks as dangerous animals has been popularized by publicity given to a few isolated unprovoked attacks such as jersey shore shark attacks of 1916 and through popular fictional works about shark attacks such as jaws film series jaws author peter benchley as well as jaws director steven spielberg later attempted to dispel image of sharks as man eating monsters to help avoid an unprovoked attack humans should not wear jewelry or metal that is shiny and refrain from splashing around too much in captivity until recently only a few benthic species of shark such as leopard sharks and catsharks had survived in aquarium conditions for a year or more this gave rise to belief that sharks as well as being difficult to capture and transport were difficult to care for more knowledge has led to more species including large pelagic sharks living far longer in captivity along with safer transportation techniques that have enabled long distance transportation great white shark had never been successfully held in captivity
