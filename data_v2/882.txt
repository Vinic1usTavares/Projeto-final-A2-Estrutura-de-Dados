glacier national park is part of a system of 43 parks and park reserves across canada and one of seven national parks in british columbia established in 1886 park encompasses and includes a portion of selkirk mountains which are part of larger grouping of mountains columbia mountains it also contains rogers pass national historic site park s history is closely tied to two primary canadian transportation routes canadian pacific railway cpr completed in 1885 and trans canada highway completed in 1963 rogers pass in centre of park eluded explorers until 1881 railway brought with it tourism establishment of glacier national park and construction of a popular alpine hotel heavy winter snows and steep avalanche prone valleys of park have been a major obstacle to transportation necessitating much railway engineering and avalanche control measures park contains high peaks large active glaciers and one of canada s largest cave systems its dense forests support populations of large mammals birds and alpine species region is noted for its heavy snowfall park has an extensive network of trails three campgrounds and four backcountry huts and cabins due to major transportation routes that bisect it glacier national park sees large numbers of visitors history selkirk mountains were first noted by europeans when explorer david thompson of north west company skirted around them on columbia river in 1811 he named them nelson s mountains after lord horatio nelson but they were later renamed after an executive for rival hudson s bay company lord thomas douglas selkirk finding a pass through selkirks became a priority after construction of canadian pacific railway began completion of railway was a condition of colony of british columbia upon entering canadian confederation in 1867 in 1865 cpr surveyor walter moberly led an expedition up illecillewaet river which he named using word for swift water despite recently discovering eagle pass through nearby monashees moberly failed to find a pass through selkirks after getting sidetracked in tangier creek drainage his party refused to explore further due to lateness of season and moberly was forced to retreat rogers pass an expedition led by major albert bowman rogers up illecillewaet discovered a viable pass in 1881 rogers was awarded a five thousand dollar prize for locating a route through mountains by 1885 cpr had constructed a line through rogers pass and trains were traveling west to pacific for first time in canada federal government and cpr quickly realized tourism potential of mountainous heavily glaciated area following a trip by prime minister john a macdonald and his wife agnes through rockies on newly completed railroad he returned to ottawa inspired and led creation of glacier and yoho national parks both established on october 10 1886 they were second and third national parks in country after banff a year earlier glacier house thumb glacier house in 1909 grade of railway approaching rogers pass was too steep to allow for dining cars on trains so cpr built a hotel west of pass in 1886 this added to a collection of cpr owned hotels across canada including mount stephen house in yoho national park built in same year and with same floor plan glacier house located near terminus of illecillewaet glacier called great glacier at time became a center for tourism mountaineering glaciology and photography in selkirks hotel was expanded in 1905 and 1911 it was considered one of western canada s premier tourist destinations at turn of twentieth century hotel attracted from around world due to its elevation climbers could be in high alpine within hours of leaving their room in 1899 cpr contracted services of several swiss guides to assist less mountain savvy tourists through high country throughout glacier house period many first ascents were made on peaks within park hotel also attracted naturalists and scientists keen to study mountain environment mary vaux walcott and her brothers george and william vaux visited area many times and began first scientific studies of illecillewaet glacier mountaineering glacier house is considered first center of alpinism in north america by american alpine club historian william lowell putnam it saw an influx of european and american professional climbers in its first two decades of operation william spotswood green was first european climber to make note of excellent climbing possibilities of peaks near cpr line green and henry made first recorded ascents of major peaks in summer of 1888 climbing mount bonney and green s peak harold topham a british climber made many first ascents in 1890 including mount fox he later joined with henry forster and two swiss climbers emil huber and carl sulzer to explore southern peaks of park huber and sulzer also claimed prized first ascent of dramatic mount sir donald arthur oliver wheeler a cartographer climber and founding member of alpine club of canada acc came to glacier house in 1901 this started a thirty year relationship with northern selkirks which saw wheeler map region publish large reference works on its geography and explore much of park s terrain an acc hut near illecillewaet campground bears his name as well as a peak and a pass professor charles ernest fay first president of american alpine club after visiting park in 1890s publicized it in club s magazine by 1900s almost all of park s prominent peaks had seen human tracks connaught tunnel and trans canada highway thumb left cpr workers attempt to rescue buried colleagues in 1910 rogers pass avalanche after its first winter in operation in 1886 it became clear to cpr that heavy snows of rogers pass were going to be a serious challenge extensive snow sheds were built to shelter rails from frequent avalanches these wood sheds became a fire hazard in summer months so a separate summer track was built in 1910 while clearing one slide another avalanche came down avalanche mountain killing 62 men more than half workers killed in slide were of japanese descent in all two hundred railway employees were killed between 1886 and 1916 in 1912 cpr admitted defeat and started construction of an eight kilometer tunnel under pass and mount macdonald connaught tunnel opened in 1916 new tunnel bypassed glacier house s siding and resulting lack of rail passengers spelled end for once popular hotel it was closed in 1925 and torn down four years later park saw few visitors besides campers from alpine club of canada s summer camps for next thirty years until this point automobile travelers crossing columbia mountains had to use circuitous big bend highway which followed upper reaches of columbia river north in a large loop with planned inundation of much of that valley by hydro projects outlined in columbia river treaty a new highway route was needed in 1963 trans canada highway was built through rogers pass bringing tourists back to park in large numbers parks canada built several new campgrounds and expanded trail system geography thumb glacier national park as seen from space park covers northern part of selkirk mountains a sub range of columbia mountains it contains numerous glaciers and large swift waterways park is bisected by two major transportation routes trans canada highway and canadian pacific railway nearest towns are revelstoke to west and golden to east only settlement in park is complex at rogers pass summit mountains columbia mountains rise from plateaus of central interior and extend eastward to rocky mountain trench geologically distinct from nearby rockies range is divided into four sub ranges monashees selkirks and purcells glacier encompasses a portion of northern selkirks and a narrow strip of northern purcells topography of park varies between rounded mountains and ridges in east north and west and sharp steep sided peaks in central and southern regions a o wheeler measured many of park s mountains in 1901 and 1902 using a complex system of fixed points and photographs in early 20th century area was referred to as canadian alps most names are from historical figures including explorers surveyors mountaineers and railway and hudson s bay company executives major peaks and ranges highest point in park is mount dawson at precipitous mount sir donald stands at mount macdonald at mount mcnicoll at and mount abbott at peaks of hermit range bonney and bostock groups van horne range purity range and dawson range all lie wholly or in part within park including uto peak at in sir donald range glaciers thumb illecillewaet glacier park has 131 glaciers over in size covering of park throughout its history north america has seen cycles of glaciation where ice sheets advanced and retreated across terrain last glacial period ended about 12 000 years ago before which all but highest peaks of park were covered in ice movements of these rivers of ice formed steep sided u shaped valleys of park they also rounded lesser peaks ranges in west of park show this effect glaciers in park are on whole shrinking and retreating they are also some of most studied glaciers in north america glaciers of park have been dramatically reduced in size in late 20th and early 21st centuries precise measurements of glacial areas started with vaux family and a o wheeler in 1900s modern measurements using satellite imagery began with simon s work in 1980s regular inventories of parks glaciers have been performed since with latest collating data up to 2011 most recent inventory noted a reduction of of glacial surface area from 2000 to 2011 due to its location near highway and railway illecillewaet glacier is most visited and photographed formerly known as great glacier it was a major tourist attraction during glacier house period from 1886 to 1925 glacier s terminus formerly a short walk from glacier house site has retreated far up mountainside neve of glacier spreads far to south also spawning geikie glacier most of large glacial features are south of trans canada corridor other large features include deville dawson asulkan bishops black duncan grand and avalanche park s glaciers have a variety of appearances with high altitude features smooth and uniform cracked and riddled with crevasses on slopes and black with debris on valley bottoms in summer many of glaciers take on a red tint this is result of a variety of snow algae known as watermelon snow rivers all watercourses in park are part of columbia river drainage basin park rivers are swift running and glacially fed and have helped carve out steep valleys and canyons they carry much silt and rocky debris with them and often have a milky white appearance in summer months these rivers have noticeable diurnal cycles they run high in afternoons as snow and ice melt is at its peak then drop considerably with lower nighttime temperatures major rivers are illecillewaet beaver and headwaters of and duncan rivers large creeks and brooks include mountain cougar which runs underground through nakimu caves and battle beaver and illecillewaet flood occasionally 1983 and 2012 saw flooding damage to highway and railway geology thumb eagle peak left uto peak and mount sir donald geology of northern selkirks reveals tremendous tectonic changes that have shaped terrain of western north america like much of british columbia region was first studied by prolific surveyor and geologist dr george mercer dawson in 1890 topographical maps were first produced by a o wheeler in early 1900s and in 1970s wheeler s grandson dr john wheeler conducted an extensive geological survey from land and air from rogers pass layers of quartzite and slate are visible revealing fact that range was part of a large silty continental shelf 600 million years ago 185 million years ago successive plate movements from west began to crumple and compress this material driving some of it deep underground and some into heights of selkirks lime from coral and other organic life was compressed into limestone which is seen in cougar brook area veins of marble are present in metamorphic rock of high peaks although erosion and effects of glaciers are constantly grinding down mountain peaks pressure of underlying rock continues to drive them upward geologists have classed rocks of columbia mountains into groups several of which appear in northern selkirks slates are in creek and lardeau groups quartzite is in hamill group limestone is part of badshot formation while metamorphic rocks are classed in shuswap metamorphic complex caves limestone strata in park is subject to water erosion by cougar brook a process that has formed nakimu caves first discovered in 1907 and originally named caves of cheops then caves this long cave system is one of largest in canada limestone is broken down and softened by carbonic acid in brook s water water also contains pulverised rock from glacial processes which serve to further etch and cut new passages in rock caves contain a large concentration of a rare substance known as this is a suspension of calcium carbonate kept intact by bacteria due to its sensitive nature and damage done to cave environments by early tourists parks canada has closed caves to general public access by organized groups and experienced is allowed with a permit ecology thumb 275px a columbian ground squirrel at rogers pass glacier national park covers a range of habitats from lush temperate rainforest in western valleys to inhospitable ice and rock covered alpine areas to drier fir and pine forests on eastern boundary four of british columbia s biogeoclimatic zones are found within park interior cedar hemlock engelmann spruce subalpine fir interior douglas fir in eastern extremities and alpine tundra at high elevations parks canada characterizes these zones as rainforest snow forest and no forest animal life in park ranges from large mammals like caribou and grizzly bear to bird species such as steller s jay and golden eagle flora valleys on western side of park support dense wet forests with a thick understory widest valleys such as illecillewaet contain a rare wetlands environment featuring skunk cabbage and water hemlock outside of wetlands lower valleys are covered by western red cedar western white pine western hemlock interior douglas fir and white birch ground species include devil s club blueberries liverwort and fern species at middle elevations subalpine zone appears this forest has engelmann spruce mountain hemlock and subalpine fir understory is thick here with rhododendron and berry species as well as deep beds of moss and lichens at higher elevations this forest opens up to meadows and slide chutes which are covered in a lush growth of grasses herbaceous shrubs and alpine wildflowers parks botanists and others have identified 546 species of flowering plants in park late july to mid september see an impressive display of alpine blooms alpine meadows continue into harsh alpine tundra zone where poor soil heavy snowfall cold temperatures and a very short growing season discourage all but hardiest sedge grasses heathers and lichens fauna glacier s rich forests support a large wildlife population which parks staff monitor regularly there are fifty three mammal species found within park bears dominate snow zone berry rich avalanche slides provide an important food source for both black and grizzly species they spend winters in deep dens hibernating other predators include timber wolf coyote red fox wolverine cougar and lynx mountain goats are most common ungulates in glacier national park a 1985 study counted 300 in high peaks and valleys of park caribou migrate through certain park valleys while elk mule and white tailed deer can be found throughout deep snows of winter drive most ungulates out of park into lower elevations of nearby rocky mountain trench and columbia valleys moose are seen in park on rare occasions several species of squirrels are found in lower forests and alpine mammals include pika hoary marmots and martens glacier has 235 observed bird species but majority are migratory and only seen in summer months 30 species who are year round residents include woodpeckers golden eagles owls ravens steller s jays and golden crowned kinglets unpredictable explosions of pine siskins sometimes reaching hundreds of thousands in number will appear and stay year round but be gone next year american dippers feed in many waterfalls and cascades of park climate thumb left snow accumulation on arthur o wheeler hut near illecillewaet campground located within interior precipitation is a major environmental factor in area park straddles two prevalent weather systems with warmer wetter air from pacific meeting colder drier air of continental weather systems moist air is driven to higher elevations by mass of columbia mountains result is frequent rain and snowstorms especially during winter months mean annual precipitation in subalpine areas is this contributes to large and glaciers that cover much of park s high elevations rogers pass can receive up to of snow over course of a winter eastern edge of park along purcells is in rain shadow and is relatively drier area can see wide variations in temperature and weather due to extreme topography winter temperatures in selkirks are moderate compared to similar elevations in rockies to east with summer average highs reaching high teens celsius avalanche control maintaining trans canada highway through snowy rogers pass is a constant battle parks canada works with provincial highways crews and canadian armed forces to keep highway open as much as possible parks staff play both a research and prevention role by monitoring snowpack levels and predicting avalanche probability as well as working with canadian forces to trigger controlled avalanches royal canadian horse artillery operate 105mm howitzer cannons based at circular gun positions along highway highway is closed to traffic shells are fired at trigger points identified by parks forecasters and smaller more controlled avalanches are started facilities right thumb mount macdonald although park sees over four million visitors each year majority are only passing through on trans canada highway about 15 stop to use park facilities of visitors who experience park from outside their vehicles two thirds are from outside of canada there are of established hiking trails in park parks canada administration and rogers pass discovery centre are located at rogers pass interpretive program for glacier and mount revelstoke national parks is based at centre it includes a theatre an exhibit hall with railway models natural history displays and wildlife specimens and a bookstore there are three campgrounds in park illecillewaet is largest with two smaller campgrounds located at loop brook and sir donald there are also five designated backcountry camping areas parks and alpine club of canada maintain four alpine huts and cabins for backcountry users wheeler hut is oldest and largest and is located near illecillewaet camping area asulkan hut sits at on asulkan pass sapphire col hut is a basic shelter near dome and glacier circle cabin in beaver river valley is a base for travelling in southern areas of park none
