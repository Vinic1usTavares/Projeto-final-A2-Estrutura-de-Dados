robert burnell edward i s preferred candidate he was provided appointed by pope to see on 25 january 1279 and consecrated on 19 february 1279 fryde et al handbook of british chronology p 233 peckham laid stress on discipline which often resulted in conflict with his clergy his first episcopal act was calling a council at reading in july 1279 to implement ecclesiastical reform but peckham s specifying that a copy of magna carta should be hung in all cathedral and collegiate churches offended king as an unnecessary intrusion into political affairs another ruling was on non residence of clergy in their livings only exception peckham was prepared to make on non residence was if clerk needed to go abroad to study prestwich edward i p 250 at parliament of winchester in 1279 archbishop compromised and parliament invalidated any regulation of council dealing with royal policies or power copies of magna carta were taken down prestwich edward i p 251 one reason archbishop may have backed down was that he was in debt to italian banking family of riccardi who also were bankers to edward and pope and peckham was under threat of excommunication from pope unless he repaid loans prestwich edward i p 252 however peckham worked hard to reorganise estates of diocese and held an inquiry in 1283 through 1285 into revenues of see he set up administrative structures in manors that divided them into seven administrative groups deboulay lordship of canterbury p 248 peckham though was almost continually in debt and because he was a franciscan he had no personal property to help with his living expenses he had inherited diocesan debts that his predecessor had allowed to accumulate and never managed to clear them moorman church life p 173 relations with welsh notwithstanding his other actions peckham s relations with king were generally good and edward sent him on a diplomatic mission to llywelyn ap gruffudd in wales in 1282 he attempted to mediate between welsh and king edward but given that edward would not budge on main issues it was a hopeless mission prestwich edward i pp 191 192 in end peckham excommunicated some of welsh who were resisting edward not unsurprising given peckham s views of welsh prestwich edward i p 200 peckham visited welsh dioceses as part of his tour of all his subordinate dioceses while there peckham criticised welsh clergy for their unchaste lives conspicuous consumption and heavy drinking he also found welsh clergy to be uneducated although he did order a welsh speaking suffragan bishop to be appointed to help with pastoral duties in diocese of coventry and lichfield walker medieval wales p 87 peckham also criticised welsh people as a whole contrasting their pastoral economy with farming based economy of england and finding welsh to be lazy and idle given state and society p 94 as part of his diplomatic duties peckham wrote to llywelyn and in those letters archbishop continued his criticisms of welsh people this time condemning their laws as contrary to both old and new testament peckham was particularly offended that welsh laws sought to get parties to homicides or other crimes to settle their differences rather than process of english law which condemned criminal given state and society p 77 peckham also had problems with his subordinate thomas bek who was bishop of st david s in wales bek tried to revive a scheme to make st david s independent from canterbury and to elevate it to metropolitan status this had originally been put forth by gerald of wales around 1200 but had been defeated by actions of hubert walter then archbishop of canterbury bek did not manage even four year fight that gerald had managed for peckham routed him quickly walker medieval wales pp 77 79 ecclesiastical matters skirmishes with edward over clerical privileges royal power peckham s use of excommunication and ecclesiastical taxation continued but in october 1286 edward issued a writ entitled which specified what types of cases ecclesiastical courts could hear these included moral issues matrimonial issues disputes about wills and testaments correction of sins and slander and physical attacks on clergy prestwich edward i p 257 peckham was very strict in his interpretations of canon law and once wrote to queen eleanor that her use of loans from jewish moneylenders to acquire lands was usury and a mortal sin prestwich edward i p 125 he also felt that welsh laws were illogical and conflicted with biblical teachings prestwich edward i p 186 he also mandated that clerical tonsure worn by clergy should not just include top of head but also have nape and over ears shaved which allowed clergy to be easily distinguished from laity to help with this archbishop also forbade clergy from wearing secular clothing especially military garb moorman church life p 149 he also forbade an effort by benedictine order in england to reform their monastic rule to allow more time for study and for more education for monks peckham s reason was that they were against custom but he may also have had concerns that these reforms would have drawn recruits away from franciscans southern western society p 236 at an ecclesiastical council held at lambeth in 1281 peckham ordered clergy to instruct their congregations in doctrine at least four times a year they were to explain and teach articles of faith ten commandments works of mercy seven deadly sins seven virtues and sacraments this command was issued as a canon or law of council and group is known as lambeth constitutions swanson religion and devotion pp 59 60 even later these constitutions were collected as ignorantia wallace cambridge history of medieval english literature p 396 six doctrines comprised minimum theological knowledge archbishop considered necessary for laity to know wallace cambridge history of medieval english literature p 548 constitutions which were originally in latin were basis and inspiration for pastoral and devotional works throughout remainder of middle ages and were eventually translated into english in 15th century crime of plurality or pluralism which was holding by one cleric of two or more benefices was one of peckham s targets moorman church life pp 220 221 as were clerical absenteeism and laxity in monastic life his main method of fighting these was a system of visitation of his subordinate dioceses and religious houses which he used with an unprecedented frequency this often resulted in conflicts over whether or not archbishop had jurisdiction to conduct these visits but peckham was also papal legate which added a layer of complexity to resulting disputes numerous legal cases that resulted from his visitation policy strengthened archiepiscopal court at expense of lower courts lawrence thirteenth century english church papacy p 137 peckham also fought with thomas de cantilupe bishop of hereford over right to visit subordinate clergy quarrel involved an appeal over jurisdiction of archbishop that thomas sent to rome in 1281 but thomas died before case could be decided lawrence thirteenth century english church papacy p 128 peckham also decreed that clergy should preach to their flocks at least four times a year moorman church life pp 80 81 peckham often was in conflict with his subordinate bishops mainly because of his efforts to reform them but peckham s own attitude and handling of his clergy contributed to problem southern western society pp 194 196 he once wrote to roger de bishop of coventry and lichfield these things need your attention but you have been absent so long that you seem not to care we therefore order you on receipt of this letter to take up residence in your diocese so that even if you are not competent to redress spiritual evils you may at least minister to temporal needs of poor quoted in southern western society p 194 historian richard southern says that peckham s disputes with his suffragan bishops were conducted in an atmosphere of bitterness and perpetual ill will southern western society p 194 which probably owed something to a petulant strain in peckham s character peckham s conflicts started because his own ideals were those of a franciscan but most of his clergy were concerned with more mundane and materialistic affairs these strains between archbishop and his subordinates were intensified by clashes over ecclesiastical and secular authority as well as edward s great need for income southern western society p 211 archbishop john peckham was a notable anti semite on 19 august 1282 in a letter to richard gravesend bishop of london he ordered bishop to compel jews of london using every instrument of ecclesiastical censure to destroy all their synagogues except one within a brief time period to be determined by bishop in a second letter he congratulates bishop because judaica is being overcome by bishop s attention and vigilance martin ed registrum epistolarum fratris
