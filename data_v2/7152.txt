cortinarius caperatus commonly known as gypsy mushroom is an edible mushroom of genus cortinarius found in northern regions of europe and north america it was known as rozites caperata for many years before genetic studies revealed that it belonged to genus cortinarius fruit bodies appear in autumn in coniferous and beech woods as well as heathlands in late summer and autumn ochre coloured cap is up to 10 cm 4 in across and has a fibrous surface clay colored gills are attached to stipe under cap and stipe is whitish with a whitish ring flesh has a mild smell and flavor popular with mushroom foragers c caperatus is picked seasonally in throughout europe although mild tasting and highly regarded mushrooms are often infested with maggots in central europe old specimens could be confused with poisonous inocybe erubescens in summer fruiting bodies of c caperatus have been found to bioaccumulate mercury and radioactive isotopes of caesium taxonomy gypsy mushroom was originally described as agaricus caperatus in 1796 by south african mycologist christiaan hendrik persoon who noted it grew in beech woods specific epithet caperatus is latin for wrinkled bohemian naturalist julius vincenz von illustrated it in his abbildungen und der und published between 1831 and 1846 it was transferred to genus cortinarius by swedish mycologist elias magnus fries in 1838 later it was transferred to pholiota in 1874 by french mycologist claude casimir gillet a placement followed by italian naturalist pier andrea saccardo finnish mycologist petter adolf karsten established genus rozites in 1879 to accommodate species as rozites caperatus on basis of mushroom having a double veil that is a partial veil remnants of which become a ring on stipe as well as a universal veil it was known as a rozites species for many years meanwhile french mycologist lucien quelet classified pholiota as a subgenus of dryophila in 1886 resulting in dryophila caperata being added to species synonymy worthington george smith placed it in his new genus now considered a synonym of agrocybe genetic analysis in 2000 and 2002 showed that rozites was not a discrete group and its members were nested within cortinarius gypsy mushroom was found closely related to new zealand species c meleagris and c both also formerly of rozites hence it has once more been placed within cortinarius within genus it is classified in subgenus cortinarius common names include gypsy mushroom gypsy and wrinkled rozites an unusual common name is granny s nightcap in finland description thumb 140px left illustration by albin 1897 c caperatus has a buff to brownish ochre cap 5 10 cm 2 4 in diameter which is covered with whitish fibres surface has a wrinkled and furrowed texture it may have a lilac tinge when young it is convex initially before expanding and flattening with a boss umbo in centre stipe is 4 7 cm 1 6 2 6 in high and 1 1 5 cm 0 4 0 6 in thick and slightly swollen at base and is whitish with a whitish ring which is initially attached to cap also known as a partial veil this is a key identifying feature of mushroom clay coloured gills are free they do not reach stipe under cap spores give an ochre brown spore print and warty almond shaped spores measure 10 13 um long by 8 9 um wide flesh is cream coloured and flavor mild similar looking north american species include agrocybe praecox which lacks wrinkled cap and is found in cultivated areas and aurea which has powdery granular surface in central europe old specimens could be mistaken for highly poisonous inocybe erubescens in summer and young mushrooms for inedible cortinarius although latter is readily distinguished by its unpleasant odour distribution and habitat c caperatus is found across northern europe mainly in scandinavia where it is common although it is uncommon in denmark and iceland in british isles it is uncommon outside scottish highlands and new forest it has been classified as vulnerable in germany and great britain and endangered in netherlands c caperatus had become less common in vicinity of salzburg in austria between 1937 and 1988 thought due to picking it is widely found in northern parts of north america as far south as mendocino county on west coast it is uncommon in california c caperatus is a rare component of subarctic areas of western greenland gypsy mushroom also grows in temperate asia having been recorded growing with bilberry near oriental beech fagus orientalis and fir near in marmara region of turkey it is also found in boggy areas of taiga boreal pine forest in western siberia fruiting bodies sprout from august to october in conifer and beech woods as well as heather often close by sphagnum in scotland it is mycorrhizal but non selective in its hosts mushrooms appear from september to november in north america and july and august in alaska it prefers acidic and sandy soils and avoids chalky ones and may be found in same habitats as bay bolete badia brown paxillus and chanterelles it forms relationships with scots pine pinus sylvestris it is often found under sitka spruce picea sitchensis or near huckleberry in north america in alaska it grows with dwarf birch betula nana and american dwarf birch b glandulosa in greenland it grows in association with white birch betula pubescens edibility thumb right a plate of collected gypsy mushrooms on display in prague c caperatus is a highly regarded edible mushroom with a mild flavour it is said to mix well with stronger flavoured fungi such as chanterelles boletes brittlegills or milk caps mushroom can have a faintly bitter taste if eaten raw but a pleasant nutty flavour when cooked it can readily be dried for later use such as adding to soups and stews it is sold commercially in finland and is a popular target of foragers in many parts of europe mushrooms are often found to be infested with maggots when picked mycologist david arora recommends discarding tough stipes radioactivity and environmental contamination popularity of c caperatus across europe has led to safety concerns related to its propensity to accumulate contaminants fungi are very efficient at absorbing radioactive isotopes of caesium from soil and naturally have trace amounts of element caesium may take place of potassium which exists in high concentrations in mushrooms c caperatus bioaccumulates radioactive caesium 137cs a product of nuclear testing much more than many other mushroom species levels dramatically rose after 1986 chernobyl disaster this is a potential health issue as picking and eating wild mushrooms is a popular pastime in central and eastern europe elevated 137cs levels were also found in ruminants that eat mushrooms in scandinavia in 1990s mushrooms from reggio emilia in italy were found to have raised levels of 134cs c caperatus from various sites across poland has also been found to contain increased levels of mercury see also list of cortinarius
