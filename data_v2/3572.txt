vma performance medley track like a virgin hollywood was performed during opening of 2003 mtv video music awards on august 27 2003 where madonna was joined by britney spears christina aguilera and missy elliott performance started with spears appearing on stage on top of a giant wedding cake while wearing a wedding gown and veil she sang first few lines of like a virgin before aguilera appeared from behind cake and joined her madonna then emerged from cake wearing a black coat and a hat and started singing hollywood before proceeding to kiss spears and aguilera on lips missy elliott came out from a wedding chapel to sing her song work it halfway through performance kiss generated strong reaction from media feminist author camille paglia described moment as great she noted that kiss was like madonna saying to spears i m passing torch to you however according to her spears could not take advantage of kiss as later her career and lifestyle came under immense media scrutiny and criticism paglia said that literally from that kiss from that moment onward britney has spiraled out of control it s like madonna gave her kiss of death madonna commented on kiss i am mommy pop star and she is baby pop star and i am kissing her to pass my energy on to her this performance was listed by blender magazine as one of twenty five sexiest music moments on television history mtv listed performance as number one opening moments in history of mtv video music awards critical reception stephen thomas erlewine of allmusic felt that presence of a strong hook and a strong sense of fun was missing from compilation except for song your honesty which he declared as best track despite feeling its beats to be a little outdated he compared work of remixers as as subtle as a jackhammer whether it s on metallic flaked american life by headcleanr or 90s retro nevins mix of nothing fails on all these mixes madonna sounds as if she s out of step with music of 2003 erlewine also compared spears vocals with that of madonna s during her early days and aguilera s with that of cher s nathan brackett of rolling stone commented that release improves upon american lifes standout single love profusion but rest botches an opportunity to revive interest on its parent album fabian from daily breeze commented that remixed revisited is an amusing collection of novelties sarah crompton from boston herald proclaimed album to be more fun than her full length 2003 offering american life malay mail said that remixes from album are for true blue madonna fans a writer for miami herald was negative towards release saying that madonna s latest misstep is this pointless remixed revisited seven track ep in which she tries to resell five songs from her recent american life cd to an audience who deserve far better efforts from queen than this ricardo baca from denver post compared madonna to actress drew barrymore on cover of ep feeling that singer looked foolish and that tracks were weal attempts at spicing up already non commercial songs from american life kevin c johnson from st louis post dispatch said that with remixes madonna put some life back into songs of american life complementing your honesty and wondering why it was left from bedtime stories sessions keith caulfield of billboard was impressed with your honesty and remixes of love profusion and nobody knows me he said die hard fans even those of american life will dig this ep in his book essential rock discography martin charles strong called release as equally dispensable as its parent album commercial
