narcosis while diving also known as nitrogen narcosis inert gas narcosis raptures of deep martini effect is a reversible alteration in consciousness that occurs while diving at depth it is caused by anesthetic effect of certain gases at high pressure greek word narcosis is derived from narke temporary decline or loss of senses and movement numbness a term used by homer and hippocrates narcosis produces a state similar to drunkenness alcohol intoxication or nitrous oxide inhalation it can occur during shallow dives but does not usually become noticeable at depths less than except for helium and probably neon all gases that can be breathed have a narcotic effect although widely varying in degree effect is consistently greater for gases with a higher lipid solubility and there is good evidence that two properties are mechanistically related as depth increases mental impairment may become hazardous divers can learn to cope with some of effects of narcosis but it is impossible to develop a tolerance narcosis affects all divers although susceptibility varies widely among individuals and from dive to dive narcosis may be completely reversed in a few minutes by ascending to a shallower depth with no long term effects thus narcosis while diving in open water rarely develops into a serious problem as long as divers are aware of its symptoms and are able to ascend to manage it diving much beyond is generally considered outside scope of recreational diving in order to dive at greater depths as narcosis and oxygen toxicity become critical risk factors specialist training is required in use of various helium containing gas mixtures such as trimix or heliox these mixtures prevent narcosis by replacing some or all of breathing gas with non narcotic helium classification narcosis results from breathing gases under elevated pressure and may be classified by principal gas involved noble gases except helium and probably neon as well as nitrogen oxygen and hydrogen cause a decrement in mental function but their effect on psychomotor function processes affecting coordination of sensory or cognitive processes and motor activity varies widely effect of carbon dioxide is a consistent diminution of mental and psychomotor function noble gases argon krypton and xenon are more narcotic than nitrogen at a given pressure and xenon has so much anesthetic activity that it is a usable anesthetic at 80 concentration and normal atmospheric pressure xenon has historically been too expensive to be used very much in practice but it has been successfully used for surgical operations and xenon anesthesia systems are still being proposed and designed signs and symptoms thumb alt central area shows an lcd display clearly but it becomes increasingly out away from centre narcosis can produce tunnel vision making it difficult to read multiple gauges due to its perception altering effects onset of narcosis may be hard to recognize at its most benign narcosis results in relief of anxiety a feeling of tranquility and mastery of environment these effects are essentially identical to various concentrations of nitrous oxide they also resemble though not as closely effects of alcohol or cannabis and familiar benzodiazepine drugs such as diazepam and such effects are not harmful unless they cause some immediate danger to go unrecognized and unaddressed once stabilized effects generally remain same at a given depth only worsening if diver ventures deeper most dangerous aspects of narcosis are impairment of judgement multi tasking and coordination and loss of decision making ability and focus other effects include vertigo and visual or auditory disturbances syndrome may cause exhilaration giddiness extreme anxiety depression or paranoia depending on individual diver and diver s medical or personal history when more serious diver may feel overconfident disregarding normal safe diving practices slowed mental activity as indicated by increased reaction time and increased errors in cognitive function are effects which increase risk of a diver mismanaging an incident narcosis reduces both perception of cold discomfort and shivering and thereby affects production of body heat and consequently allows a faster drop in core temperature in cold water with reduced awareness of developing problem relation of depth to narcosis is sometimes informally known as martini s law idea that narcosis results in feeling of one martini for every below depth professional divers use such a calculation only as a rough guide to give new divers a

narcosis is related to increased solubility of gases in body tissues as a result of elevated pressures at depth henry s law modern theories have suggested that inert gases dissolving in lipid bilayer of cell membranes cause narcosis more recently researchers have been looking at neurotransmitter receptor protein mechanisms as a possible cause of narcosis breathing gas mix entering diver s lungs will have same pressure as surrounding water known as ambient pressure after any change of depth pressure of gases in blood passing through brain catches up with ambient pressure within a minute or two which results in a delayed narcotic effect after descending to a new depth rapid compression potentiates narcosis owing to carbon dioxide retention a divers cognition may be affected on dives as shallow as but changes are not usually noticeable there is no reliable method to predict depth at which narcosis becomes noticeable or severity of effect on an individual diver as it may vary from dive to dive even on same day significant impairment due to narcosis is an increasing risk below depths of about corresponding to an ambient pressure of about most sport scuba training organizations recommend depths of no more than because of risk of narcosis when breathing air at depths of an ambient pressure of about narcosis in most divers leads to hallucinations loss of memory and unconsciousness a number of divers have died in attempts to set air depth records below because of these incidents guinness world records no longer reports on this figure narcosis has been compared with altitude sickness regarding its variability of onset though not its symptoms its effects depend on many factors with variations between individuals thermal cold stress heavy work fatigue and carbon dioxide retention all increase risk and severity of narcosis carbon dioxide has a high narcotic potential and also causes increased blood flow to brain increasing effects of other gases increased risk of narcosis results from increasing amount of carbon dioxide retained through heavy exercise shallow or skip breathing or because of poor gas exchange in lungs narcosis is known to be additive to even minimal alcohol intoxication and also to effects of other drugs such as cannabis which is more likely than alcohol to have effects that last into a day of abstinence from use other sedative and analgesic drugs such as opiate narcotics and benzodiazepines add to narcosis mechanism thumb illustration of a lipid bilayer typical of a cell membrane showing hydrophilic heads on outside and hydrophobic tails inside alt representation of tall molecules lined up in two rows one above other top ends of molecules in upper row coloured red as are bottom ends of those in bottom row precise mechanism is not well understood but it appears to be direct effect of gas dissolving into nerve membranes and causing temporary disruption in nerve transmissions while effect was first observed with air other gases including argon krypton and hydrogen cause very similar effects at higher than atmospheric pressure some of these effects may be due to antagonism at nmda receptors and potentiation of gabaa receptors similar to mechanism of nonpolar anesthetics such diethyl ether or ethylene however their reproduction by very chemically inactive gas argon makes them unlikely to be a strictly chemical bonding to receptors in usual sense of a chemical bond an indirect physical effect such as a change in membrane volume would therefore be needed to affect ligand gated ion channels of nerve cells trudell et al have suggested non chemical binding due to attractive van der waals force between proteins and inert gases similar to mechanism of ethanol s effect increase of gas dissolved in nerve cell membranes may cause altered ion permeability properties of neural cells lipid partial pressure of a gas required to cause a measured degree of impairment correlates well with lipid solubility of gas greater solubility less partial pressure is needed an early theory meyer overton hypothesis suggested that narcosis happens when gas penetrates lipids of brain s nerve cells causing direct mechanical interference with transmission of signals from one nerve cell to another more recently specific types of chemically gated receptors in nerve cells have been identified as being involved with anesthesia and narcosis however basic and most general underlying idea that nerve transmission is altered in many diffuse areas of brain as a result of gas molecules dissolved in nerve cells fatty membranes remains largely unchallenged management and diagnosis management of narcosis is simply to ascend to shallower depths effects then disappear within minutes in event of complications or other conditions being present ascending is always correct initial response should problems remain then it is necessary to abort dive decompression schedule can still be followed unless other conditions require emergency assistance symptoms of narcosis may be caused by other factors during a dive ear problems causing disorientation or nausea early signs of oxygen toxicity causing visual disturbances or hypothermia causing rapid breathing and shivering nevertheless presence of any of these symptoms should imply narcosis alleviation of effects upon ascending to a shallower depth will confirm diagnosis given setting other likely conditions do not produce reversible effects in rare event of misdiagnosis when another condition is causing symptoms initial management ascending closer to surface is still essential prevention thumb alt a panel on wall is connected to diving cylinders by hoses nearby are several much larger cylinders some painted brown and others black narcosis while deep diving is prevented by filling dive cylinders with a gas mixture containing helium helium is stored in brown cylinders most straightforward way to avoid nitrogen narcosis is for a diver to limit depth of dives since narcosis becomes more severe as depth increases a diver keeping to shallower depths can avoid serious narcosis most recreational dive schools will only certify basic divers to depths of and at these depths narcosis does not present a significant risk further training is normally required for certification up to on air and this training should include a discussion of narcosis its effects and cure some diver training agencies offer specialized training to prepare recreational divers to go to depths of often consisting of further theory and some practice in deep dives under close supervision scuba organizations that train for diving beyond recreational depths may forbid diving with gases that cause too much narcosis at depth in average diver and strongly encourage use of other breathing gas mixes containing helium in place of some or all of nitrogen in air such as trimix and heliox because helium has no narcotic effect use of these gases forms part of technical diving and requires further training and certification while individual diver cannot predict exactly at what depth onset of narcosis will occur on a given day first symptoms of narcosis for any given diver are often more predictable and personal for example one diver may have trouble with eye focus close accommodation for middle aged divers another may experience feelings of euphoria and another feelings of claustrophobia some divers report that they have hearing changes and that sound their exhaled bubbles make becomes different specialist training may help divers to identify these personal onset signs which may then be used as a signal to ascend to avoid narcosis although severe narcosis may interfere with judgement necessary to take preventive action deep dives should be made only after a gradual training to test individual diver s sensitivity to increasing depths with careful supervision and logging of reactions scientific evidence does not show that a diver can train to overcome any measure of narcosis at a given depth or become tolerant of it equivalent narcotic depth end is a commonly used way of expressing narcotic effect of different breathing gases national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa diving manual now states that oxygen and nitrogen should be considered equally narcotic standard tables based on relative lipid solubilities list conversion factors for narcotic effect of other gases for example hydrogen at a given pressure has a narcotic effect equivalent to nitrogen at 0 55 times that pressure so in principle it should be usable at more than twice depth argon however has 2 33 times narcotic effect of nitrogen and is a poor choice as a breathing gas for diving it is used as a drysuit inflation gas owing to its low thermal conductivity some gases have other dangerous effects when breathed at pressure for example high pressure oxygen can lead to oxygen toxicity although helium is least intoxicating of breathing gases at greater depths it can cause high pressure nervous syndrome a still mysterious but apparently unrelated phenomenon inert gas narcosis is only one factor influencing choice of gas mixture risks of decompression sickness and oxygen toxicity cost and other factors are also important because of similar and additive effects divers should avoid sedating medications and drugs such as cannabis and alcohol before any dive a hangover combined with reduced physical capacity that goes with it makes nitrogen narcosis more likely experts recommend total abstinence from alcohol for at least 12 hours before diving and longer for other drugs abstinence time needed for cannabis is unknown but owing to much longer half life of active agent of this drug in body it is likely to be longer than for alcohol prognosis and epidemiology narcosis is potentially one of most dangerous conditions to affect scuba diver below about except for occasional amnesia of events at depth effects of narcosis are entirely removed on ascent and therefore pose no problem in themselves even for repeated chronic or acute exposure nevertheless severity of narcosis is unpredictable and it can be fatal while diving as result of illogical behavior in a dangerous environment tests have shown that all divers are affected by nitrogen narcosis though some experience lesser effects than others even though it is possible that some divers can manage better than others because of learning to cope with subjective impairment underlying behavioral effects remain these effects are particularly dangerous because a diver may feel they are not experiencing narcosis yet still be affected by it history thumb alt graph with logarithmic scales showing a close inverse correlation between potency of anesthetic drug and olive oil gas partition coefficient for 17 different agents both meyer and overton discovered that narcotic potency of an anesthetic can generally be predicted from its solubility in oil minimum alveolar concentration is an inverse indicator of anaesthetic potency french researcher victor t junod was first to describe symptoms of narcosis in 1834 noting functions of brain are activated imagination is lively thoughts have a peculiar charm and in some persons symptoms of intoxication are present junod suggested that narcosis resulted from pressure causing increased blood flow and hence stimulating nerve centers walter moxon 1836 1886 a prominent victorian physician hypothesized in 1881 that pressure forced blood to inaccessible parts of body and stagnant blood then resulted in emotional changes first report of anesthetic potency being related to lipid solubility was published by hans h meyer in 1899 entitled zur theorie der two years later a similar theory was published independently by charles ernest overton what became known as meyer overton hypothesis may be illustrated by a graph comparing narcotic potency with solubility in oil in 1939 albert r behnke and o d yarborough demonstrated that gases other than nitrogen also could cause narcosis for an inert gas narcotic potency was found to be proportional to its lipid solubility as hydrogen has only 0 55 solubility of nitrogen deep diving experiments using hydrox were conducted by arne between 1943 and 1945 jacques yves cousteau in 1953 famously described it as l des grandes or rapture of deep further research into possible mechanisms of narcosis by anesthetic action led to minimum alveolar concentration concept in 1965 this measures relative concentration of different gases required to prevent motor response in 50 of subjects in response to stimulus and shows similar results for anesthetic potency as measurements of lipid solubility noaa diving manual was revised to recommend treating oxygen as if it were as narcotic as nitrogen following research by christian j lambertsen et al in 1977 and 1978 see also footnotes references notes sources external
