calshot castle is an artillery fort constructed by henry viii on calshot spit hampshire england between 1539 and 1540 it formed part of king s device programme to protect against invasion from france and holy roman empire and defend southampton water as it met solent castle had a keep at its centre surrounded by a curtain wall and a moat initially heavily armed it had a garrison of 16 men and as many as 36 artillery guns castle continued in use for many years surviving english civil war intact and being extensively modernised in 1770s during 19th century calshot castle was used by coastguard as a base for combating smuggling in 1894 however fresh fears of a french invasion led to it being brought back into use as an artillery fort a large coastal battery was constructed alongside older castle and a boom built across southampton water controlled from castle during first world war calshot castle was primarily used as a base for seaplanes deployed on anti submarine patrols in english channel its guns were removed before end of war probably for use in france air base by then called raf calshot grew in size during inter war years hosting schneider trophy air races with outbreak of second world war calshot was re armed in face of a possible german invasion station continued in use after war but as military seaplanes became obsolete it was finally closed in 1961 after a short period of use by coastguard castle was opened to public by english heritage in 1980s restored to its pre 1914 appearance castle received 5 751 visitors in 2010 historic england considers calshot a well preserved example of king henry s device forts history 16th century construction thumb a 1539 depiction of castle calshot castle was built as a consequence of international tensions between england france and holy roman empire in final years of reign of king henry viii traditionally crown had left coastal defences to local lords and communities only taking a modest role in building and maintaining fortifications and while france and empire remained in conflict maritime raids were common but an actual invasion of england seemed unlikely modest defences based around simple blockhouses and towers existed in south west and along sussex coast with a few more impressive works in north of england but in general fortifications were limited in scale in 1533 henry broke with pope paul iii over annulment of his long standing marriage to catherine of aragon catherine was aunt of charles v holy roman emperor who took annulment as a personal insult this resulted in france and empire declaring an alliance against henry in 1538 and pope encouraging two countries to attack england an invasion of england appeared certain in response henry issued an order called a device in 1539 giving instructions for defence of realm in time of invasion and construction of forts along english coastline calshot castle was designed to protect solent a body of water that led from english channel to naval base at portsmouth and through southampton water to important port of southampton castle was one of four forts that william fitzwilliam lord admiral and william paulet decided to build to improve defences along solent others were at east and west cowes and hurst calshot was constructed on narrow calshot spit overlooking deep water channel running through into southampton temporary earthwork defences and gun batteries were erected as an interim measure but castle itself was built quickly and finished by end of 1540 it probably reused stone and lead from and netley abbeys which had recently been closed during dissolution of monasteries castle initially had a garrison of eight gunners five soldiers and a lieutenant under command of a captain in late 1540s it was heavily armed by standards of time with 36 pieces of artillery in 1580s castle caught fire and timber needed for repairs required 127 trees to be sent from new forest work was carried out in 1584 prompted by threat of a spanish invasion but by that time its garrison had shrunk to eight men 17th 19th centuries thumb diagram of castle and gun battery depicted in 1901 key a 16th century castle

during english civil war of 1640s calshot was held by parliamentary forces against king charles i and protected with a 15 strong garrison at an annual cost of parliament considered fortress important and kept it supplied with ammunition unlike several other local forts parliament kept castle operational probably because of its ongoing role in defending southampton water during early 18th century war of spanish succession it was equipped with up to 25 guns castle was modernised in 1770s with a new parapet around central keep alterations to gun embrasures around outer wall and an expansion of gatehouse with an additional set of rooms for castle s captain reports in 1793 however showed castle s guns to be in a poor condition and complained that fortification was under command of an infirm elderly master gunner improvements were probably made at start of revolutionary wars that year but in 1809 geographer james playfair described castle as merely a blockhouse with a garrison in 1804 castle was used to store munitions for sea fencibles fishing boats used as volunteer naval vessels to counter threat of a french invasion seven guns were added to castle s arsenal to protect against french attack with end of napoleonic wars in 1815 government coastguard took control of castle using it as a base to combat smuggling taking advantage of water behind calshot spit as a good location to position their waiting interception vessels by middle of century two officers and forty two men were stationed there by 1850s there was renewed military interest in site and several proposals were made to redevelop it to mount as many 32 artillery guns plans were not taken forward and it was noted that presence of 16th century stone keep would create dangerous splinters in event of any enemy artillery fire landing there in 1887 castle yacht club was established just beside castle along spit during 1880s concerns were raised that southampton might be vulnerable to french attack using small ships armed with torpedoes as a result in 1894 war office took castle back from coastguard building a boom across southampton water which was moved using three gunboats 16th century castle was too small to host a gun battery to protect boom so a larger battery was built south of old castle in 1895 armed with two and four 12 pounder 5 4 kg quick firing guns supported by three searchlights mounted on older castle walls boom was managed from two towers called dolphins one just beside castle and other on far side of water each with two 12 pounder quick firing guns of their own in turn supported by machine guns creation of these defences ultimately forced nearby yacht club to move to southern end of spit 1900 45 thumb first floor barracks in keep restored to their 1910 appearance in first years of 20th century calshot castle s defensive role continued unchanged castle s keep was redesigned in 1907 to allow it to house two of castle s quick firing guns on its roof a new lighter ladder boom across southampton water was installed in 1907 but within two years this approach had been replaced by a plan to block southampton water with a boom made up of floating hulks a 1910 plan proposed that castle would be garrisoned in wartime by 10 officers and 154 men 75 of whom would have to be housed nearby rather than in fort itself additional naval personnel would also have been needed to man support vessels for boom a royal naval air station was built alongside castle in 1913 to house twelve experimental seaplanes which were intended to support royal naval fleet operating along channel calshot was particularly suitable for seaplanes as surrounding waters and coastline were relatively quiet and calm first world war broke out in 1914 when military opinions on utility of calshot castle had shifted considerably decision was taken to rely primarily on gun batteries at two entrances to solent rather than at calshot and southampton water at start of conflict boom was removed and replaced by anti submarine nets further up coast two of calshot s guns were removed following year to protect new nets airbase was used for training purposes until 1916 when it took on anti submarine patrols over channel where german raids had started to inflict critical damage almost 3 500 hours were flown by aircraft from calshot that year with over 3 500 being flown in 1917 and over 9 000 in just three months of 1918 subordinate air stations were created in bembridge newhaven and portland a cabin was built on top of keep to oversee air operations castle yacht club was taken over for use as officers mess and air station spread out across calshot spit including occupying 1895 battery calshot s remaining guns were removed and probably dispatched to front line in france

narrow gauge railway constructed along spit parts of castle moat were concreted over to provide parking for planes calshot twice hosted schneider trophy air races over solent last two in sequence of popular international events designed to encourage development of new high speed technology empire air day events were also held at calshot attracting 1 000 visitors in 1935 during second world war calshot castle was initially defended by troops from hampshire regiment and a barge equipped with two anti aircraft guns and a bofors gun air raid shelters were constructed in castle s moat with five boats from base taking part in dunkirk evacuation threat of german invasion increased however and defences were expanded in 1940 with two 12 pounder quick firing guns placed on keep s roof supported by searchlights two additional subordinate batteries bungalow and were built following year on other side of southampton water and further south west along coast castle was not damaged during war and by 1943 was placed on a care and maintenance basis acting as a way station for passing aircraft 1945 21st century thumb a 12 pounder 5 4 kg quick firing gun on keep s roof overlooking southampton

command in 1953 southampton harbour board built a coastguard lookout tower at castle in 1952 and following year they began to construct a signal station tower on top of keep complete with radar and radio facilities which opened in 1958 by then military seaplanes had become obsolete and raf station was finally closed in 1961 hampshire county council leased site from crown estates in 1964 castle itself passed into guardianship of state and hangars were used as an activity centre a royal national lifeboat institution station opened in 1971 alongside castle with a tall replacement coastguard tower constructed two years later english heritage took over management of castle in 1983 and stripped back 20th century additions to present it as it might have appeared in 1914 including demolishing
