was released four years before he began voice work was title and i often admit this that brought me back to watching anime and started me on a long road to wow i wonder what might happen if i moved to houston themes and cameos at 1994 anime america convention nagai talked about contrast between honey and dark cosplay city i thought well what would honey chan do if she appeared in a dark futuristic city like in batman in movie batman everything is dark dark background and dark characters however in case of honey chan she s super cheerful and sunny she really stands out due to dark background he believed that new cutie honey differed from other anime that focus on settings and characters expositions and that honey instead makes her own moves and she carries whole story on relative weakness of male characters in series he said honey chan is like a mother and she loves to protect weak men their existence is her reason to live like oh i have to fight to protect you honey pays homage to some of nagai s other creations such as mazinger and devilman series first two episodes alone include many cameos first shows mayor light and chokkei in a picture with characters from nagai s harenchi gakuen and while devilman titular character appears as a gargoyle in second a scene in a downtown market in cosplay city has cameos from godzilla from harenchi gakuen and abashiri from abashiri family

he was really impressed with production values of this show and called it quite a bit of fun especially for those looking for fan service with a bit more intelligence and style than some of other offerings out there two reviews of honey on website anime jump greatly diverged site maintainer mike toole rated series 3 5 out of 5 stars and called it tons of fun a light tasty action comedy that s spirited and silly and tongue in cheek and praised its character designs as letter perfect to go nagai s original quite appealing character designs jason carter praised calvello s voice work in his review of 2004 adv release but rated it 1 5 out of 5 stars said that much of cosplay city goes back and forth between looking like an ordinary modern metropolis and resembling some sort of smurf town built of polluted marshmallows and concluded characters are largely annoying plot is hackneyed nudity is absurd fighting is rarely more than average and whole thing is ultimately pointless as series later attempts at developing honey as a person make all too clear sandra dozier of dvd verdict was also unimpressed with honey i can see why it is popular glossy animation well endowed chicks scant clothing if that isn t your thing however there is very little to draw you to this series reviewers have noticed go nagai s influence on new cutie honey several considered it among best anime based on his works while others preferred different series dozier said that nagai is recognized in anime world as an influential artist and storyteller who is known for preferring extra of nudity and violence in his work and that such influence definitely comes through in series carlos ross of them anime gave earlier nagai anime bad ratings but called honey another go nagai based anime that common logic should dictate that them rate harshly except that we actually enjoyed it immensely while calling its awfully ugly backdrops and weird looking characters standard go nagai beveridge says he greatly preferred honey over other nagai offerings but that it really doesn t rise up too much higher than thinly veiled fan service with something of a story scott green of ain t it cool news praised nagai s tasteless sense of strangeness as series highpoint saying its bright american style superhero design with kaleidoscopic oddity humorously gratuitous nudity and violence make it amusing nonsense in his negative review carter said devilman based devil lady was a more entertaining anime with a similar impressively built woman fighting monsters premise many reviewers also contrasted its portrayal of main character honey as a powerful figure with how it also shows off her body through her nude transformation sequences susan j napier author of anime from akira to princess mononoke distinguished series from more pornographic anime such as wicked city twin dolls and la blue girl napier thought that series sends mixed messages because even though honey has great strength and heroism her transformations are very sexual in nature she wrote that presumably male viewer is invited in to participate in and clothing of her nude body while both male and female viewer alike are allowed vicarious participation in ecstatic transformation process but quickly added despite regressive and voyeuristic aspects of her characterization she is still clearly film s hero one worthy of admiration and emulation in film s several violent scenes she more than holds her own dozier did not share that sentiment she said honey does have some appeal as a fighter and as someone who cares very much about people who are important to her but her android past and her family life aren t explored too deeply mostly she s too busy getting into compromising situations and fighting evil both dozier and yuricon president erica friedman wrote about sexual nature of honey including lesbian desire of jewel princess one of honey s enemies for her in second episode friedman who had looked for such implied yuri in cutie honey manga called princess s appearance just what i was hoping for and praised honey s change to her s m queen form in response ross said about series it s seemingly exploitative it s incredibly sexist and female members of my household you d expect them to be indignant but no they were laughing their butts off because it was so blatant and yet honey was actually never objectified in whole series he further writes honey kisaragi is an extremely strong character who is no damsel in distress if anyone needs help in this series it s guys toole said that jessica calvello gives character a growling tough girl charm that was conspicuously absent from original version while dozier said that calvello captured combination of innocence and bravado of honey that is both so confusing and yet so appropriate beveridge said fight sequences are pretty well done and provide some fun moments watching honey battle various demonic forms but concluded that honey main goal is to showcase lead heroine s changes oh lets face it it s all about half to completely naked transformation sequences they re see also fan service wild 1997 another ova directed by nagaoka notes
