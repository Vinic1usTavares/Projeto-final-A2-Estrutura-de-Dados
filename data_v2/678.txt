galvanize southern and western republican support while neglecting industrial northern states eventually becoming one of goldwater s primary opponents in race for republican party s nomination in 1964

moderates in party particularly new york governor nelson rockefeller who was also speculated to run for president he cast goldwater as an opponent of civil rights and an isolationist who wanted to withdraw from united nations he vowed to stop goldwater from running at all costs there were concerns that goldwater and more moderate rockefeller could divide republican party harming its chances of winning general election goldwater was perceived leader of a grassroots movement in american southern southwestern and western states staged by more conservative wing of party rockefeller on other hand disagreed with most of fiscal and social positions held by goldwater advocating a more progressive mainstream approach to government for republican platform news of rockefeller s marriage in may 1963 eighteen months after he divorced his first wife to a woman with whom he d had a relationship for over five years spread quickly throughout nation initially rockefeller s divorce received little media fanfare however news of his remarriage prompted a considerably negative reaction among many rockefeller who had been leading in polls over other republican candidates by a comfortable margin just weeks previously saw a significant decrease in support for his candidacy in july 1963 he made an attempt to regain lost support by taking aim at what he viewed as extremist groups targeting goldwater specifically goldwater responded by accusing rockefeller of blurring line separating republican and democratic parties in attacking goldwater s politics and advocating his own more progressive agenda rockefeller said to voters americans will not and should not respond to a political creed that cherishes past solely because it offers an excuse for shutting out hard facts and difficult tasks of present changing dynamics dynamic of race changed in november 1963 when president kennedy was assassinated and succeeded by vice president lyndon johnson goldwater began to receive hate mail for creating a climate of hate and reconsidered his run for presidency he privately remarked that he was relieved he had not committed to forming a campaign since a major loss to johnson could have damaged conservative movement as a southerner johnson would appeal to rural protestant bloc that goldwater hoped to gain against northern roman catholic kennedy word that goldwater could possibly decide against running caused grassroots supporters to fill his mailboxes with supportive letters a reluctance on goldwater s part could have greatly demoralized movement and caused proponents to grow bitter after conclusion of official mourning period for president kennedy goldwater went on attack against new president accusing johnson of playing politics with christmas by twisting arms of congressmen to pass a foreign aid bill on christmas eve goldwater still led among other potential republican candidates but his support had dropped to 25 percent goal for goldwater and implication of who would receive nomination for republican party which faced a slim chance of victory in 1964 following kennedy s assassination was a possible shift in control of party itself from liberal eastern wing of this goldwater told his aides first let s take over party then we ll go from there shortly after assassination of president john kennedy lyndon johnson defined goal of his administration as continuing those of kennedy administration in front of congress this among passages of other controversial bills included proposal of civil rights act of 1964 goldwater strongly

conscience or of political position that could possibly offer to american people a clear choice in next presidential election he emphasized need for a federal government that is limited and balanced and against ever increasing concentrations of authority in washington that encourages personal responsibility among american citizens while pledging his candidacy to victory for principle and to presenting an opportunity for american people to choose he promised a choice not an echo in election and positioned himself to right of nelson rockefeller who had announced his candidacy two months

johnson was compelled to continue programs of kennedy administration against his own desires goldwater would later directly discuss assassination of kennedy and remarked that communism was to blame in a head to head match up with johnson goldwater trailed 20 percent to 75 percent and his lead over rockefeller tightened later in january goldwater came under fire for a few of his comments first while criticizing president johnson s plans to cut funding to manned bombers he claimed that long range missiles were not dependable defense secretary robert mcnamara blasted remark and accused goldwater of damaging national security general curtis lemay backed goldwater s claims and congressional hearings would later be conducted on missile reliability next rockefeller took exception to goldwater s suggestion that it was not beneficial for united states to remain in united nations in wake of its admittance of communist china rockefeller challenged goldwater to a debate though goldwater felt that debating rockefeller would be more like debating a member of new frontier than another republican despite criticism goldwater refused to alter his political beliefs opting to remain consistent with his conservative ideology nevertheless polls at end of january marked an eight point decrease in goldwater s new hampshire lead from two months previous he led rockefeller 54 percent to 46 percent in

outline to maintain peace that included encouragement of communist eviction from positions of control in world and maintenance of american strength to keep soviet union in check later goldwater embarked on a four day tour of new hampshire his last appearance in state before his final campaign run ahead of primary during trip he publicly wondered why rockefeller family wants to do business with communist countries and remarked that he would fire defense secretary mcnamara for his insistence that long range missiles were more accurate than manned bombings he referred to this as stupidest statement he ever heard from a defense secretary early primaries and state conventions at end of february goldwater began to downplay importance of new hampshire primary commenting that any result above 35 percent would be a strong showing due to overabundance of candidates such as senator margaret chase smith he projected that june 2 california primary would be a better test of strength of primary field ahead of national convention in july he attended oklahoma and north carolina state conventions to campaign for delegates in first of several crucial state conventions while in north carolina goldwater claimed that in order to win election gop nominee must carry south he argued that none of his opponents understood problems of south and were therefore un viable general election candidates goldwater won 22 delegates from oklahoma but gained none from north carolina despite winning convention s endorsement however state s 26 delegates were likely to back goldwater as new hampshire primary neared rockefeller began to attack goldwater claiming he supported a voluntary social security plan that would bankrupt nation goldwater denied charge he campaigned in new hampshire until primary vote spending approximately 150 000 as opposed to 250 000 by rockefeller voters grew wary of goldwater s stances on social security cuba military and role of federal government and were likewise turned off by rockefeller s very public divorce as a result electorate sought out other candidates surprisingly ambassador to south vietnam henry cabot lodge jr won primary with 35 5 percent as a write in candidate while still serving in vietnam and without making any public appearances in new hampshire goldwater finished in second with 22 3 percent followed by rockefeller with 21 0 percent neither won any delegates from primary chairman of florida gop attributed defeat to a divided campaign which he also witnessed in his state where party leaders such as congressman william c

endorsement of 14 000 member california gop at party s annual convention goldwater won backing of party at convention increasing number of volunteers to his california campaign rockefeller was angered by result and declared that convention had been overrun by radicals at end of march goldwater traveled to detroit and continued to criticize defense secretary mcnamara calling him an all time loser

april goldwater himself traveled to oregon and made several campaign stops noting psychological importance of state s primary due to its proximity to california during a press conference he announced plans to utilize television to spread his message and attacked his opponent rockefeller for labeling campaign as extremist but he refused to use his opponent s recent divorce for political purposes and rockefeller eased his direct criticism praising goldwater for his willingness to discuss his views with american people both men spoke before republican women s conference in washington in early april rockefeller set his sights on goldwater and warned of extremism in republican party but goldwater instead criticized johnson administration for its policies on communism and called for republicans to just fight democrats rather than other republicans ahead of illinois primary goldwater traveled to chicago and announced that he would change campaign s media policy to avoid overexposure to press which he believed was reporting negatively on his campaign he won illinois primary with 64 percent of vote and gained most of state s 48 delegates but victory was overshadowed by 25 percent performance by long shot candidate margaret smith goldwater s total was lower than 80 percent that was expected however result showed that goldwater could win in a populous northern state though a survey of newspaper publishers predicted that most of goldwater delegates would end up switching to still undecided nixon goldwater remained confident that he would win nomination but continued to feel that overcoming nixon would be his last hurdle later in april president johnson offered foreign policy briefings to each major presidential candidate which goldwater flatly rejected calling it an offhand political gesture goldwater also continued his criticism of johnson administration over missile accuracy as a senate committee declared that missiles were reliable though advocated increased spending for a manned bombing project goldwater also affirmed his support for increased military action in north vietnam to cut off supply lines from china goldwater gained a total of three delegates after finishing in second and fourth place respectively in massachusetts and pennsylvania primaries which were won by favorite son candidates henry cabot lodge jr and governor

oregon primary drew near rockefeller s campaign depended on a victory rumors spread that former president eisenhower wanted a more moderate choice than goldwater but he did not insert himself in campaign likewise attempts to draft nixon or lodge appeared fruitless senator jacob javits attempted to rally a movement to prevent goldwater s nomination but as convention neared likelihood of goldwater s nomination grew further he purchased time on network television and spoke directly to american people during a half hour segment highlighting his political positions appearance was unprecedented no previous presidential candidate had addressed a national audience before winning his party s nomination goldwater hoped for further episodes but was stalled by limited campaign funds at time goldwater had secured 274 delegates of 655 needed to win nomination well ahead of 61 won all in pennsylvania by second place william scranton rockefeller stood at fourth with only eight delegates goldwater won primaries in texas nebraska and indiana but lost oregon and its 18 delegates to rockefeller he labeled defeat as a victory for radical left after primary goldwater predicted that rockefeller would join with lodge campaign in a last ditch effort to prevent his nomination with focus on june 2 california primary goldwater refused to engage in what he called personal vindictiveness and smear and commented that republicans should instead focus on defeating president johnson at end of may goldwater appeared to be faltering a bit a rally planned at phoenix municipal stadium drew only 2 000 supporters although 8 000 were expected and candidate came under fire for mentioning that low grade atomic bombs could be used to expose supply of communists in vietnam
