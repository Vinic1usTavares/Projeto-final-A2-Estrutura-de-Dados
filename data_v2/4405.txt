teams were beginning to replace ox teams in ploughing work in britain because of their greater speed strength and agility particularly on lighter soils in heavier soils ox teams retained an advantage both because they pulled more steadily albeit more slowly and because they could work despite being fed by grazing alone while horse collar which allows a horse greater freedom to pull heavy loads had been used in western europe by 10th century and may be shown in bayeux tapestry of 11th or 12th century use of horse teams in britain was made possible in part because of an increase in farming of

laws relating to breeding and export of horses in an attempt to improve british stock under which it was forbidden to allow uncastrated male horses to be turned out in fields or on common land they
