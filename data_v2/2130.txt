artificial food slipping away from visiting party broadhead attempts to get inside one of large domes dominating skyline quatermass later finds him dying covered in a poisonous black slime shot at by guards as he exits quatermass rushes to inspector lomax explaining that he believes that complex is indeed making food but not for human consumption its purpose is to provide a suitable living environment for small alien creatures being housed inside huge domes lomax attempts to alert his superiors but when he meets commissioner of police he notices that he too is sporting v shaped mark aliens have taken control of government quatermass and lomax then turn to journalist jimmy hall sid james who is skeptical of their story but asks to visit winnerden flats at local community centre

believable report on all that s happened more pointedly quatermass questions just how final will that report be production first quatermass film had been a major success for hammer and eager for a sequel they purchased rights to nigel kneale s follow up before bbc had even begun transmission of new serial for this adaptation nigel kneale himself was allowed to write first draft of screenplay although subsequent drafts were worked on by director val guest plot is a condensed but largely faithful retelling of original television serial main difference between two versions is at climax in television version quatermass blasts off in a rocket to confront aliens in outer space whereas in film rocket is fired unmanned to destroy aliens asteroid base returning director val guest once again employed many cinema verite techniques to present fantastic elements of plot with greatest degree of realism nigel kneale was critical of final film mainly on account of return of brian donlevy in lead role kneale was unhappy with donlevy s interpretation of character and also claimed actor s performance was marred by his alcoholism a claim denied by val guest although quatermass 2 was financially successful its box office performance was eclipsed by massive success of another hammer film curse of frankenstein which was to be first of their many gothic horror films as a result it would be ten years before hammer adapted next quatermass serial for cinema with quatermass and pit in 1967 quatermass 2 was however first film for which hammer pre sold distribution rights in united states a financial model that would quickly become norm for subsequent hammer productions origins writing nigel kneale had been unhappy with hammer s adaptation of quatermass experiment partly because he received no extra remuneration from sale of film rights and partly because of changes made in film to his original television script murray p 37 kinsey p 32 in wake of his dissatisfaction kneale exerted pressure on bbc to allow him to be more involved in sale of rights to his work murray p 55 despite being in final months of his bbc contract kneale was allowed to collaborate with hammer on adaptation of quatermass ii first draft of screenplay was written by kneale with input from producer anthony hinds hearn rigby p 7 subsequent drafts were worked on by director val guest as he had done before on quatermass xperiment hearn barnes p 19 guest recalled of kneale s script that there was lots of philosophising and very down to earth thinking but it was too long it would not have held so again i had to tailor it and sharpen it and hopefully not ruin it guest kneale dvd commentary script was submitted to british board of film censors bbfc in april 1956 hearn rigby p 11 bbfc reader audrey field commented there should be customary general caution that sky is not limit either in sights or sounds kinsey p 48 bbfc s main objection was to a scene in which a guard from winnerden flats complex murders a family having a picnic kinsey p 50 this scene was omitted from final film although it is present in original television presentation murray p 57 as with quatermass xperiment screenplay for quatermass 2 condenses many of events of original most significant change is at climax in television version quatermass and his assistant pugh use quatermass s rocket to travel to asteroid to take on aliens on their home turf whereas in film rocket is fired unmanned at asteroid to destroy it hearn rigby p 6 several characters from television version do not appear in film most notably quatermass s daughter paula and his assistant leo pugh warren p 342 conversely character of inspector lomax reappears in film version having previously been in quatermass xperiment but does not appear in television version character of sheila barmaid also appears only in film version casting thumb sid james jimmy hall brian donlevy quatermass and john longden lomax in a scene from quatermass 2 brian donlevy as professor bernard quatermass donlevy reprised his role as eponymous professor much to despair of nigel kneale who had heavily criticised his interpretation of role in quatermass xperiment kinsey p 7 as had been case on quatermass xperiment donlevy s alcoholism presented challenges for production nigel kneale recalled visiting set one day he donlevy was so full of whiskey he could hardly stand up he staggered over to set and looked around they held up an idiot board with his lines on and he said what s this movie called and they said well it s called quatermass 2 he said i ve got to say all that there s too much talk cut down some of talk he tried to read it and he had to have go after go after go so crippled with drink he hardly knew who he was murray p 56 val guest has denied kneale s claims saying so many stories have been concocted since about how he was a paralytic it s absolute balls because he was not paralytic he wasn t stone cold sober either but he was a pro and he knew his lines weaver p 110 guest also recalled by after lunch he would come to me and say give me a breakdown of story so far where have i just been before this scene we used to feed him black coffee all morning but then we discovered he was lacing it but he was a very professional actor and very easy to work with brosnan p 77 john longden as inspector lomax role of lomax had originally been played by jack warner in quatermass xperiment when warner proved unavailable for sequel role was recast and part given to john longden longden had been a major star of british silent films and had also appeared in several early alfred hitchcock films including blackmail 1929 elstree calling 1930 and skin game 1931 hearn rigby p 10 nigel kneale greatly preferred longden s authoritative take on character to jack warner s more comedic breezy sergeant in first film sid james credited as sydney james as jimmy hall at time james was known as a character actor specialising mainly in tough guy roles with credits in films such as no orchids for miss blandish uncredited 1948 lavender hill mob 1951 and hell drivers 1957 james plays character of jimmy hall in a much more comedic manner than roger delgado s interpretation of equivalent journalist character hugh conrad in television version guest cast james in order to lighten story a bit he later went on to enjoy widespread fame in many comedy roles including hancock s half hour 1956 60 carry on series of films and sitcoms such as george and dragon 1966 two in clover 1969 70 and bless this house 1971 76 bryan forbes as marsh forbes had appeared in a number of supporting roles in films including small back room 1949 an inspector calls 1954 and colditz story 1955 however he later became better known as a director with films such as whistle down wind 1961 l shaped room 1962 and stepford wives 1975 among his best known credits forbes later recalled of film i was one of people attacked by alien pods this pod exploded and i ended up with what was supposed to be a terrible alien growth on my face come lunchtime and we all went off to pub of course i couldn t take this stuff off makeup was too complex landlord refused to serve me mckay p 15 william franklyn as brand franklyn later became well known for his voiceovers for a series of advertisements for schweppes tonic water in 2004 he took over from late peter jones as voice of book in radio version of hitchhiker s guide to galaxy he died in 2006 vera day as sheila vera day was first spotted by val guest in musical wish you were here at london hippodrome other actors appearing in film include charles lloyd pack tom chatto john van percy herbert and michael ripper kinsey p 49 filming val guest who had directed quatermass xperiment returned for quatermass 2 guest once again sought to create a film that felt as real as possible using many cinema verite techniques such as hand held cameras he was assisted in this respect by moody overcast cinematography of director of photography gerald gibbs who also made extensive use of day for night photography for film s climactic scenes guest planned each day s shooting carefully creating meticulous storyboards detailing all shots he wanted to make that day kinsey p 54 filming took place between 28 may and 13 july 1956 film s budget at ps92 000 was much larger than that of quatermass xperiment bigger budget was achieved by advance sale of distribution rights in united states to united artists united artists contributed some ps64 000 towards production of film as well as brian donlevy s 25 000 fee and his airfare to london from us larger budget allowed for greater use of location filming in making of film than had been possible for its predecessor key location used was oil refinery at shell haven in stanford le hope essex on thames estuary which represented secret winnerden flats complex hearn rigby p 14 this was exactly same location as used in bbc television production of story despite its size plant was run by a relatively small number of personnel which made guest s job of making plant appear eerily deserted easier guest was also surprised at how relaxed plant s management were about allowing him to stage climactic gun battle at such a potentially flammable location focus puller harry oakes recalled however that a newman sinclair clockwork camera had to be used for some scenes because of danger posed by sparks from electrical equipment kinsey p 53 scenes of vincent broadhead emerging from one of domes covered in noxious black slime were particularly difficult to realise necessitating many retakes tom chatto playing broadhead whose wife was a leading casting director joked after scene was finally completed remind me to talk to my wife about casting me in this shell haven location was further enhanced by use of matte paintings created by special effects designer les bowie to add giant domes within which aliens were incubated other locations used included real life new town of hemel hempstead hertfordshire which was under construction at time and doubled for fictional new town of winnerden flats other scenes were shot in london including trafalgar square where police agreed to hold up traffic for just two minutes to allow guest to take shots of trucks ferrying equipment through london to winnerden flats and in foyer of house of lords for scene where quatermass first meets vincent broadhead climactic scenes of hurricane caused by explosion of winnerden flats complex were shot on south downs near brighton a minor mishap occurred during filming of this scene when wind machines blew brian donlevy s toupee off his head and crew had to chase after it as well as shooting on location guest and his crew made use of stages 2 and 5 of new elstree studios first hammer production to shoot there this was production designer bernard robinson s first film for hammer he went on to become their regular set designer working on many hammer films hearn barnes p 44 reception quatermass 2 received its first public screening at a trade show on 22 march 1957 its official premiere was held two days later at london pavilion on 24 may 1957 kinsey p 85 hearn barnes p 20 it went on general release with supporting feature and god created woman on 17 june 1957 film received an x certificate from bbfc it was released in us under title enemy from space quatermass 2 received mixed reviews in daily telegraph found film all good grisly fun if this is sort of thing you enjoy reviewer in times remarked that writer of original story mr nigel kneale and director mr val guest between them keep things moving at right speed without digressions film has an air of respect for issues touched on and this impression is confirmed by acting generally hearn rigby p 15 on other hand harman of london evening news wrote science fiction hokum can be convincing exciting or just plain laughable quatermass ii fails on all these scores i am afraid hearn rigby p 14 15 similarly reviewer in daily herald felt whole thing is daft and full of stilted dialogue at end a detective says how am i going to make a report on all this i felt same way legacy although commercially successful quatermass 2 s release was largely overshadowed by box office record breaking performance of hammer s curse of frankenstein which was also released in may 1957 hearn p 19 upon this success hammer made its priority production of gothic horror films for this reason although nigel kneale had written a new quatermass serial for bbc quatermass and pit broadcast december 1958 to january 1959 hammer did not acquire rights until 1961 and film version did not appear until 1967 hearn barnes p 116 quatermass 2 is notable however for being first film hammer pre sold to a major us distributor in this case united artists this new finance and distribution deal would become norm for subsequent hammer films and led to them eventually winding down their own distribution arm exclusive films in mid 1960s critical opinion of quatermass 2 in years since its release remains divided writing in science fiction in cinema john baxter found film a faithful but ponderous adaptation of kneale s tv sequel there are effective sequences director guest and cameraman gerald gibbs shooting with light lancing up through shadows in a manner reminiscent of jacques tourneur s night or curse of demon otherwise film is indifferent baxter p 96 similarly john brosnan in his book primal screen wrote that quatermass 2 isn t as good as first one despite a bigger budget again theme is possession all four quatermass stories are variations on same theme with kneale again cleverly mixing sf with supernatural alien invasion may be sf but it is presented with trappings of traditional horror such as v shaped mark of devil that all possessed people display brosnan p 75 on other hand bill warren in keep watching skies found quatermass 2 to be one of best science fiction films of 1950s it is not notably better than quatermass xperiment but story idea is more involving production is livelier and there are more events in unfolding of story warren p 339 kim newman in 1986 praised film as extraordinary and comparing it to invasion of body snatchers 1956 newman notes that while don siegel s film is a general allegory about and conformity quatermass 2 is a specific attack on conservative government of time down to inclusion of several characters obviously based on real political figures jack sullivan ed penguin encyclopedia of horror and supernatural 1986 viking p341 42 341 league of gentlemen s mark gatiss mentions on dvd commentary for first series that a scene where two workmen who have been abducted by tubs and edward escape covered in tar was inspired by
