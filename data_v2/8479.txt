planning map for grand rapids area freeways from 1955 alt map development of a freeway along modern day i 296 us 131 corridor was proposed in 1950s 1955 general location of national system of interstate highways an early platform for what would become interstate highway system contained an inset of proposed freeways in and around grand rapids area including a north south freeway near downtown area designated as part of interstate highway system in 1957 i 296 s construction was funded by federal government us 131 freeway was officially opened at 10 a m on december 17 1962 between

later flipped west of grand rapids m 37 was relocated in grand rapids to utilize i 96 around northeast side of town instead of i 296 us 131 in 1969 at end of 1970s mdot took part in a fhwa backed initiative called positive guidance demonstration project and two agencies audited signage practices in vicinity of i 96 m 37 and i 296 us 131 interchange in walker mdot determined that usage of i 296 designation was a potential source of confusion for motorists fhwa agreed with department s proposal to eliminate all signage and public map references to designation in april 1979 mdot then petitioned american association of state highway and transportation officials aashto on june 22 1979 for their permission to make change saying it is felt that i 296 designation serves no useful

references to i 296 fhwa granted permission on december 3 1979 on condition that mdot would continue to use designation on official documents approval explicitly retained highway in interstate system
