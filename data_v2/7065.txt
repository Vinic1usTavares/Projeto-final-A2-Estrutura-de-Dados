talbot tagora is an executive car developed by chrysler europe and produced by peugeot societe anonyme psa tagora was marketed under talbot marque after psa took over chrysler s european operations in 1979 psa presented first production vehicle in 1980 and launched it commercially in 1981 tagora fell short of sales expectations described as a showroom flop just a year after its launch and psa cancelled model two years later fewer than 20 000 tagora models were built all of them at former simca factory in poissy near paris france development chrysler europe began development of tagora in 1976 under code name c9 with goal of replacing unsuccessful chrysler 180 series following same development pattern as with horizon and alpine models responsibility for tagora s technical development remained in france while styling was devised at chrysler s design centre in united kingdom an early proposal for name of car was simca 2000 design original c9 prototype was a modern styled saloon with a low beltline and large interior dimensions made possible by long wheelbase british design team initially proposed some stylistic features inspired by citroen sm including a front glass panel between headlights to accommodate number plate round front wheelarches and rear spats however chrysler management in united states deemed these features too extravagant so design of c9 became more conventional front and rear wheelarches were squared off and spats lost and license plate was placed on front bumper as on most cars to better balance tall silhouette beltline was raised over course of development c9 also lost its vertical taillights in favour of more fashionable horizontal ones engine dilemma main competitors in executive vehicle market offered engines bigger than biggest 2 0 litre straight 4 used by chrysler europe and a six cylinder engine was generally expected consequently company had to seek a new engine for tagora one candidate was a straight six manufactured by mitsubishi but it proved unsuitable for a car of this class other proposal was douvrin v6 engine prv a joint development of psa renault and volvo since tagora would be in direct competition with psa models that used prv it seemed unlikely that chrysler would be able to procure that engine sales projections thumb tagora sx was line up s flagship featuring 2 6 litre engine and alloy wheels chrysler corporation approved development of model on assumption that chrysler europe would sell 60 000 c9 models per year which translated into a projected 5 percent share of executive car market this estimate seemed achievable because chrysler had a 7 percent market share in europe overall projected sales would have covered car s tooling costs with development costs accounted for separately as part of an independent annual budget psa takeover during development of c9 management of bankruptcy threatened chrysler corporation decided to divest itself of its debt ridden european operations buyer was french psa group formed in 1976 after peugeot took over citroen deal was finalised in 1978 in which buyer paid us 1 00 for entirety of chrysler europe and its obligations take over was effective as of 1 january 1979 while c9 project was well advanced psa already had a crowded lineup in large vehicle segment including renowned citroen cx slow selling peugeot 604 and newly launched peugeot 505 but with so much having already been invested in project psa decided to press ahead and complete development of c9 albeit with modifications to allow use of shared parts with other psa models simca double wishbone front suspension gave way to macpherson struts adopted from peugeot 505 and 604 and rear axle was replaced with that of 505 much narrower than one originally planned as it was designed with respect to 505 body width c9 front end was extended to accommodate optional prv engine now that model belonged to psa using prv presented no problems short market life following renaming of chrysler europe s models to talbot marque c9 was christened talbot tagora and first batch of cars rolled out of former simca plant in poissy in 1980 same year psa presented tagora at salon de l automobile in paris following a hands on demonstration of model to press in morocco in march 1981 car went on sale in france in april and in united kingdom in may british billboard advertising campaign boasted new talbot tagora luxury and performance redefined tagora was priced to overlap with high end peugeot 505 and low end citroen cx models while slotting in beneath peugeot 604 its pricing was also comparable to renault 20 30 and ford granada tagora was in 20 000 30 000 deutschmark bracket in germany prices in germany on 1 august 1982 during first fifteen months of car s existence in 1980 81 a mere 16 169 tagoras were produced which was only one quarter of chrysler s initial projections sales proved insufficient even for this production level and volumes plummeted by more than 80 percent in 1982 in 1983 sales figures prompted psa to cancel model altogether by time tagora was discontinued only about 20 000 had been built by comparison over 116 000 peugeot and 74 000 citroen were made in 1981 alone in december 2010 practical classics reported that 99 09 percent of all uk registered tagoras were no longer on roads last uk registered tagora on road has been declared on a statutory off road notice since 2016 powertrains and models thumb right alt talbot tagora interior interior of a tagora sx 2 6 as with most large cars of its time tagora was a rear wheel drive vehicle with a longitudinally mounted engine there were three engine choices mated to four and five speed manual transmissions or an optional three speed automatic in case of four cylinder engines available models were 2 2 litre 2 155 cc type 180 ohc i4 double barrel solex base engine was a version of older simca type 180 2 0 litre with increased displacement as also featured in matra murena it was unrelated to either american chrysler k or psa douvrin 2 2 litre engines available trim levels were designated gl and gls gl was only model to feature four speed manual transmission and have power steering as an option as opposed to standard it was first to be dropped for 1983 model year 2 3 litre 2 304 cc turbodiesel i4 this peugeot developed turbodiesel was primarily used in peugeot 505 and 604 diesel powered version of tagora was designated dt 2 7 litre 2 664 cc prv ohc v6 two triple barrel weber carburettors v6 model which was actually badged 2 6 came in top sx trim level loaded with extras but was not available with automatic transmission prv engine used in tagora was different from one used in contemporary peugeot vehicles in that it was fitted with triple barrel weber carburettors rather than fuel injection resulting in a higher power rating this made it most powerful french car of its time nevertheless only 1 083 v6 tagora models were made tagora presidence tagora presidence was a concept car designed by stylist sunny atri at talbot design studio in whitley coventry concept was created to generate interest in employing high end tagoras as chauffeur driven limousines by users such as business executives and government officials donor model for presidence was 2 6 sx which had an interior appointed with connolly leather upholstery and brass highlights plus a host of electronics including a telephone dictaphone text message receiver and television with vcr originally valued at ps25 000 presidence now resides at a car museum in poissy critical appraisal tagora was not greeted with much acclaim by british motoring press autocar reviewed tagora in its 2 2 litre gls iteration and summed it up as excellent if not a great advance l j k setright of car magazine asked who could want one given crowded market into which it came concluding a group test in car tagora was described as a problematic newcomer that did not exceed standard set by winner of group test volvo 244 gle however motor sport considered tagora a usefully effortless uncomplicated simple to drive and very comfortable car recurring theme of published tests was tagora s lack of clear advantages or of a competitive edge in comparing car to its likely competitors verdict was that new talbot is highly comparable with others and deserves to sell as any of them although it does not come out with any startling advantages which you might expect of latest appearance on scene those cars against which tagora 2 2 gls was compared were ford granada 2 3 gl opel rekord 2 0s renault rover 2300 and volvo 244 gl of these cars tagora was second most expensive but did not have a superiority among significant attributes of speed acceleration interior room or chassis design out of comparison group tagora had second highest top speed was third fastest to 60 mph though it had best overall mpg by 0 7 mpg in terms of interior room it had fourth best front rear motor sport also noted car s modest competence in comparison with rover 2300 launched 1976 saying that tagora had more leisurely acceleration ljk setright noted cars s overall adequacy going on to say that if fitted with correct type of tyre he would still opt for a peugeot 604 instead car judged chassis design to be one area where tagora does not show comparative youth of its design tagora s handling was deemed on good side wrote autocar and performance was described as good but not outstanding as such car lay uneasily close to being listed as under engined though authors conceded that generally tagora did not feel under engined when in use ljk setright dissented saying tagora was as refined in its ride as should be expected of it and that car also has a good deal more road holding and cornering than might be expected however in december 1981 car magazine judged car 2 2 gls model to be prone to untidy handling tending to under steer first followed by excessive over steer magazine made a particular note of advantage in handling and grip enjoyed by older live volvo 244 underlining point about tagora s lack of advantage in terms of road manners regarding interior seats drew praise for their comfort and detail design however again car provided a counterpoint to effect that volvo was as roomy despite its shorter wheelbase steering wheel was criticized in same review for being too close to driver s legs ventilation temperature control was not satisfactory due to an response at cool end of dial there was no fan blown cold air cold air was by ram effect nor an option for cool air to be directed to face at same time as warmth being directed into according to car ventilation fell down badly on account of its awkward controls accommodation was disappointment lacking a self setting stay opening bonnet was heavy work and boot while large had demerit of an unusual locking method boot is locked before being shut by pushing in a red handle set in inside of lid in summary main competencies of tagora were its spacious cabin though it was not class leading its comfortable seating its fuel economy in 2 2 gls form and size of its luggage compartment 572 litres but fact that a car launched in 1974 volvo 244 gle could offer better seats disc brakes all round better headlights better ventilation and better handling for only slightly more than talbot was charging for their car indicated that tagora had come to market with a vehicle that was uncompetitive in too many major respects nearly a decade after tagora had ceased production view of car in automotive press was that it was merely average though there was little actively wrong with car view was that tagora had advantage of refinement good manners and in v6 form good performance rust was identified as single biggest problem for surviving cars usually around rear suspension mountings buckley suggested that car might attain collectible status by 2003 reasons for commercial failure market situation and image thumb rear view of 1981 2 2 gls tagora in terms of engineering tagora had no major flaws except perhaps for poor cabin ventilation 1979 energy crisis however dealt a blow to european automotive market large car segment contracted significantly making chrysler s initial sales projections unrealistic tagora was ultimately launched under talbot brand which was not established in marketplace and had a confused pedigree putting car at an immediate disadvantage in an executive car market dominated by well established offerings such as ford granada in view of martin buckley talbot did not advertise car effectively so people did not know about car design as british magazine what car opined tagora has such a complete blandness of style as to disqualify it instantly in a market where character and status count for so much design of tagora was focused on practicality providing exceptional cabin space at expense of style steep windscreen formed a quite strange angle with relatively short wedge shaped bonnet car was wider and taller than most of its competitors and buyers were unaccustomed to such proportions psa sourced axles had very narrow tracks relative to width of body which provided an awkward look especially at rear nor did plain plastic dashboard stir enthusiasm among reviewers and prospective customers references external links top gear
