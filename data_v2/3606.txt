lessons from darin collaborator roger kellaway to give an accurate portrayal of singer bobby was a man i found very compelling driven ambitious and complicated he challenged himself and never sat back on his laurels it s sad that he didn t live longer but i don t think his life was tragic i view his life as inspiring kevin spacey spacey also kept close relations with darin family as a means to know he would treat film with respect he sent letters to that effect to sandra dee and son dodd steve blauner who is portrayed by john goodman in film also served as a historical consultant dodd originally

dee spacey finding epperson script to be overtly dark and morbid began to rewrite beyond sea incorporating info from 1987 lewis colick script spacey acknowledged he portrayed darin too sympathetically and decided not to depict darker side of darin s life centrally other scripts made bobby darin a rather unlikable figure he explained i was not interested in making a conventional biopic as you can see from results i was interested in making an exuberant celebration of an entertainer in a way that would be uplifting for an audience by making biopic dodd darin and spacey acknowledged similar career experiences between darin and spacey a lot of people doubted my dad s abilities and kevin s had doubters and naysayers dodd commented but both men were willing to take risks and both were very resilient my dad would always try new things you could never pin him down kevin s career is similar david evanier author of roman candle life of bobby darin said you can put kevin s obsessiveness about getting film made right up there with bobby s obsessiveness he s also ideal person to play bobby he has an uncanny physical resemblance to him and he also has bobby s intensity and dark side also there s connection with his mother bobby s mother s belief in him sent him soaring kevin s mother wanted him to make this film kevin sees film as an act of devotion to his mother i think movie is about mothers and sons spacey said referring to darin s relationship with his mother polly and sister nina spacey s mother kathleen fowler died of brain cancer just before production started i made

average score of 5 2 10 its consensus states kevin spacey s bio of singer bobby darin is either a fearless piece of showmanship or an embarrassing vanity project according to critics metacritic calculated a weighted average score of 46 100 based on 35 reviews i m very happy with way film turned out kevin loves my dad and he wanted to do a tribute my mother who never remarried after her split from darin was speechless for a while after she saw it it was emotional for her there was a lot of truth and grit but she couldn t be happier dodd darin sandra dee dodd darin jimmy scalia and steve blauner responded enthusiastically to spacey s work on film mick lasalle of san francisco chronicle felt that spacey looked too old to portray darin convincingly and called film one of most embarrassing spectacles of 2004 and jaw droppingly awful a misbegotten and ill conceived vanity project desson thomson from washington post praised actor s work but also felt spacey did not convincingly portray darin in his early music career internet reviewer james berardinelli found storyline to be overtly cliched but added despite choppy narrative and inappropriate casting of spacey beyond sea managed to keep me entertained roger ebert gave a largely positive review stating kevin spacey believes he was born to play bobby darin i believe he was born to play more interesting characters in his own best work spacey has achieved genius he is better as an actor than darin ever was as a singer stephen holden of new york times felt that with beyond sea spacey crawls back from his doomed quest to be a tom hanks like everyman to his niche on underbelly of hollywood s pantheon movie s a mess and at 45 spacey is far too old to play darin yet star captures his desperation his braggadocio and yes his magnetism peter travers writing in rolling stone magazine believed spacey could not prevent movie from groaning under weight of biopic cliches but actor forges a bond with his
