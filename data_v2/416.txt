mahanoy creek is a u s geological survey national hydrography dataset high resolution flowline data national map accessed august 8 2011 tributary of susquehanna river in northumberland and schuylkill counties pennsylvania there are at least 35 sources of acid mine drainage in creek s watershed anthracite was mined in upper part of mahanoy creek watershed in 19th and 20th centuries mahanoy creek s tributaries include schwaben creek zerbe run little mahanoy creek shenandoah creek and north mahanoy creek little mahanoy creek and schwaben creek are two streams in watershed that are unaffected by acid mine drainage schwaben creek has a higher number and diversity of fish species than main stem there are two passive treatment systems in mahanoy creek watershed by mahanoy creek watershed association coal mining has been done in watershed since 19th century and continues to some extent in 21st century watershed is in western middle anthracite coal field course thumb left mahanoy creek in girardville thumb mahanoy creek in east cameron township northumberland county mahanoy creek s source is in strip mines in eastern part of schuylkill county near buck mountain it heads west for a short distance before crossing under pennsylvania route 54 and entering mahanoy city where it picks up tributary north mahanoy creek mahanoy creek continues westward heading into mahanoy township again and goes through more strip mines it begins paralleling bear ridge for several miles passing communities of st nicholas and boston run before entering gilberton in gilberton creek passes under pennsylvania route 924 and goes through by former mahanoy plane upon leaving mahanoy township creek enters butler township soon after entering this township creek passes through girardville picking up shenandoah creek it parallels pennsylvania route 54 for some distance into ashland upon leaving ashland creek stops paralleling pennsylvania route 54 and turns south through a gap in ashland mountain leaving behind strip mines at gordon it picks up little mahanoy creek and then turns west again meandering out of butler township creek then briefly meanders through barry township before passing into eldred township it flows on northern side of a mountain in weiser state forest upon leaving eldred township creek enters northumberland county mahanoy creek enters northumberland county in east cameron township it flows westward for a number of miles through a valley with line mountain to south and mahanoy mountain to north creek passes under pennsylvania route 125 in this valley creek passes into west cameron township flowing west and goes through township for several miles it then flows into little mahanoy township after a short distance it leaves behind line mountain mahanoy mountain valley and picks up zerbe run mahanoy creek then turns southwest and passes by dornsife before cutting through a gap between little mountain and line mountain and exiting little mahanoy township at this point creek enters jackson township and picks up schwaben creek its last tributary after some distance mahanoy creek then meanders west to its mouth on susquehanna river north of herndon and ten miles south of sunbury tributaries mahanoy creek s tributaries include little mahanoy creek schwaben creek shenandoah creek waste house run north mahanoy creek and zerbe run there are also several unofficially named tributaries with local names such as big run and big mine run only schwaben creek and little mahanoy creek are unaffected by acid mine drainage north mahanoy creek starts in unpolluted springs on locust mountain and meets main stem in mahanoy city there are strip mines in this tributary s watershed shenandoah creek whose tributaries include run and lost creek

discharge of acid mine drainage in creek ranges from 0 to 17 2 cubic feet per second in 2001 discharge was typically found to be higher in march than in august while there are sewage treatment plants in larger communities in mahanoy creek watershed there are also leaky sewage disposal systems that discharge sewage into stream s tributaries creek experiences atmospheric disposition a type of runoff geology and geography thumb left mahanoy creek in east cameron township watershed of mahanoy creek is in ridge and valley appalachians lower part of creek s watershed is in northern shale valleys and slopes ecoregion mahanoy creek watershed is part of a that runs from northeast to southwest running between hunter and shenandoah rock formations in watershed include pottsville group and llewellyn formation these are found on northern side of creek s valley there are 24 coal beds from pennsylvanian subperiod which are part of llewellyn formation and pottsville formation coal beds are to thick mining of these coal beds has been done at depths of over underground there are significant silt deposits on creek downstream of ashland in watershed there are a number of close to parallel ridges and valleys these tend to be oriented in same direction as creek itself east to west highest elevation in mahanoy creek watershed is above sea level in eastern part of watershed not far from delano lowest elevation in watershed is at mouth elevations of ridges tend to be between and above sea level while valleys are between and lower stream bed of mahanoy creek has an iron crust near girardville but some fish live in that area minerals in acid mine drainage areas of mahanoy creek watershed include goethite amorphous aluminum quartz muscovite kaolinite and gypsum red shale of mauch chunk formation is found in a substantial part of watershed main rock types in watershed are interbedded sedimentary rock which occupies 70 percent of watershed and sandstone which occupies 30 percent a number of seeps boreholes and mine tunnels contribute water to mahanoy creek throughout large sections of watershed mined areas in upper part of watershed have been said to resemble a moonscape there are numerous large spoil piles in upper one third of watershed some buildings mahanoy creek valley are damaged by subsidence due to underground mining watershed thumb mahanoy creek near dornsife gap thumb

columbia county 42 square miles 109 square kilometers are located in western middle anthracite field there are at least 35 sources of acid mine drainage in watershed watershed has a population of close to 45 000 people as of july 2009 a tract of land in mahanoy creek watershed has been converted by mahanoy creek watershed association into a wetland known as swamp it serves as a passive treatment system this organization has also performed cleanups of creek at ashland girardville and helfenstein main stem of creek is divided into several basins one basin is upper basin which is drained by mahanoy creek and its tributaries upstream of shenandoah creek it has an area of 21 8 square miles another basin is ashland basin which is drained by mahanoy creek and its tributaries between shenandoah creek and big run not including little mahanoy creek watershed ashland basin has an area of 17 7 square miles next basin downstream is middle basin which drains area where creek

downstream of zerbe run this basin has an area of 42 7 square miles mahanoy creek watershed is 66 percent forested land 21 percent agricultural land 9 percent barren mined land and 4 percent developed land however upper part of mahanoy creek is 50 percent forested land 44 percent mined land 5 percent developed land and less than 1 percent agricultural land there are six boroughs in upper part of watershed there are a total of 28 municipalities in watershed eastern edge of mahanoy creek watershed is marked by locust mountain and vulcan hill southern edge is formed by broad mountain fisher ridge and line mountain northern edge is formed by little mountain locust mountain and mahanoy mountain drainage system of watershed is a trellis pattern a pattern or an angular drainage pattern streams in mahanoy creek watershed tend to meander relatively little but main creek meanders somewhat between gordon and lavelle and near its mouth mahanoy creek s headwaters are close to edge of susquehanna river watershed near schuylkill river watershed history early history and naming mahanoy creek s name comes from a corruption of delaware indian word or former word means lick area was owned by iroquois before european settlers arrived community of mahanoy city is named after mahanoy creek modern history nathan beach and several other people filed an application for 34 lots at headwaters of mahanoy creek in 1794 danville and pottsville railroad had a terminus in girardville a community of mahanoy creek by 1834 mahanoy creek navigation company formed on march 22 1827 mahanoy creek canal ran from susquehanna river to coal mines in upper part of mahanoy creek a canal running from chester county and lancaster county to pittsburgh with a course going through mahanoy creek was planned by 1832 in late 19th century a company piped waste from production of illuminating gas for gas lighting into mahanoy creek in gilberton mahanoy creek used to be underground but surfaced before 1940 anthracite was mined in upper part of mahanoy creek watershed from 1840 until 1950 however farming was also done in western part of watershed in early 20th century most of deep mines ceased operation by 1960 surface mines instead continued mining operations in watershed a total of 12 million short tons of anthracite were mined in creek s watershed in 1917 this was 12 of anthracite yield of state of pennsylvania in that year in 1910s there were 40 washeries and collieries that drained into creek large amounts of culm also flowed into it during this time layer of coal silt on banks of creek was by 1940 several mines remain active in 21st century but they mostly reprocess coal waste at least one covered bridge crosses mahanoy creek it is called mahanoy creek bridge it was built in 1940 in northumberland county and is in length two passive treatment systems have been installed in creek s watershed by mahanoy creek watershed association they are mahanoy creek aerobic wetlands which were created in 2000 and property wetlands which were created in 2006 biology in fall of 2000 twelve species of fish were observed during electrofishing they included eastern blacknose dace northern suckers shiners smallmouth bass and rock bass an october 2001 survey of mahanoy creek identified two species of fish each at ashland and girardville there were 20 individuals at latter location and 22 at former there were also 13 species and 134 individuals at gowen city and 14 species and 545 individuals at creek s mouth additionally 1003 individuals and 20 species of fish were observed at mouth of tributary schwaben creek white suckers were found at each of aforementioned sites other fish species found on mahanoy creek and schwaben creek include swallowtail shiner shiner river chub banded darter and shield darter brown trout longnose dace and eastern blacknose dace have also been observed in watershed historically deer came to creek to consume salt there are second growth forests near run a tributary of mahanoy creek recreation pennsylvania state game land number 84 is located immediately south of mahanoy creek between helfenstein and dornsife sen james j rhoades nature trail is a walking trail along creek in barry township it was dedicated to james j rhoades on may 8 2010 catch and release fishing of smallmouth bass and largemouth bass is permitted on
