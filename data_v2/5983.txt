professor at university of toronto and was active in canadian socialist movement during 1930s in 1960s and 1970s he served as chair of classics departments at both harvard and yale although he was trained in turn of 20th century oxbridge tradition of classical studies which saw greek intellectual history as an unbroken chain of related ideas havelock broke radically with his own teachers and proposed an entirely new model for understanding classical world based on a sharp division between literature of 6th and 5th centuries bc on one hand and that of 4th on other much of havelock s work was devoted to addressing a single thesis that all of western thought is informed by a profound shift in kinds of ideas available to human mind at point that greek philosophy converted from an oral to a literate form idea has been very controversial in classical studies and has been rejected outright both by many of havelock s contemporaries and modern classicists havelock and his ideas have nonetheless had far reaching influence both in classical studies and other academic areas he and walter j ong who was himself strongly influenced by havelock essentially founded field that studies transitions from orality to literacy and havelock has been one of most frequently cited theorists in that field as an account of communication his work profoundly affected media theories of harold innis and marshall mcluhan havelock s influence has spread beyond study of classical world to that of analogous transitions in other times and places education and early academic career born in london on 3 june 1903 havelock grew up in scotland where he attended greenock academy before enrolment at leys school in cambridge england at age of 14 he studied there with w h a classicist to whom havelock

been identified still controversially at time by milman parry as an oral poet but cornford and other scholars of these early philosophers saw practice as a fairly insignificant convention left over

from religion to philosophy a study in origins of western speculation originally published 1912 reprinted princeton princeton university press 1991 41 havelock eventually came to conclusion that poetic aspects of early philosophy were matters not of style but of substance literate revolution quoted in swearingen 141 and that such thinkers as heraclitus and empedocles actually have more in common even on an intellectual level with homer than they do with plato and aristotle however he did not publicly break from cornford until many years later in 1926 havelock took his first academic job at acadia university in nova scotia canada he married ellen parkinson in 1927 and moved on to victoria college at university of toronto in 1929 havelock s scholarly work during this period focused on latin poetry particularly catullus far from early greek philosophy he had worked on at cambridge while in canada havelock became increasingly involved in politics with his fellow academics frank

alt underside of a painted cup attic cup inscribed with greek alphabet havelock argued that simplicity and spacing of alphabet was crucial to development of literate culture at same time that he was becoming increasingly vocal and visible in politics havelock s scholarly work was moving toward concerns that would occupy him for bulk of his career first questions he raised about relationship between literacy and orality in greece concerned nature of historical socrates which was a long debated issue havelock s position drawn from analyses of xenophon and aristophanes as well as plato himself was that plato s presentation of his teacher was largely a fiction and intended to be a transparent one whose purpose was to represent indirectly plato s own ideas havelock eric alfred evidence for teaching of socrates transactions and proceedings of american philological association vol 65 1934 282 95 283 he argued vociferously against idea associated with john burnet which still had currency at time that basic model for theory of forms originated with socrates havelock s argument drew on evidence for a historical change in greek philosophy plato he argued was fundamentally writing about ideas of his present not of past teaching of socrates 287 most earlier work in field had assumed that since plato uses socrates as his mouthpiece his own philosophical concerns must have been similar to those debated in athens of his youth when socrates was his teacher havelock s contention that socrates and plato belonged to different philosophical eras was first instance of one that would become central to his work that a basic shift in kinds of ideas being discussed by intellectuals and methods of discussing them happened at some point between end of fifth century bc and middle of fourth in 1947 havelock moved to cambridge massachusetts to take a position at harvard university where he remained until 1963 he was active in a number of aspects of university and of department of which he became chair he undertook a translation of and commentary on aeschylus prometheus bound for benefit of his students he published this translation with an extended commentary on prometheus and myth s implications for history under title crucifixion of intellectual man and then changed it back to prometheus when book was republished in 1960s saying that earlier title had come to seem a bit pretentious havelock prometheus seattle university of washington press 1968 6 during this time he began his first major attempt to argue for a division between platonic or aristotelian philosophy and what came before his focus was on political philosophy and in particular beginnings of greek liberalism as introduced by democritus in his book liberal temper in greek politics he argued that for democritus and liberals political theory was based on an understanding of behaviour of man in a cosmic and historical setting liberal temper in greek politics quoted in larsen j a o liberalism in greek politics philosophical review vol 68 no 1 1959 103 09 105 that is humanity defined as poets would define it measured through its individual actions plato and aristotle were interested in nature of humanity and in particular idea that human actions might be rooted in inherent qualities rather than consisting of individual choices in arguing for a basic heuristic split between plato and contemporaries of democritus havelock was directly contradicting a very long tradition in philosophy that had painstakingly assembled innumerable connections between plato and pre socratics to reinforce position that plato as his own dialogues imply was primarily informed by his teacher socrates and that socrates in turn was a willing participant in a philosophical conversation already several hundred years old again with a seeming endorsement from plato who shows a young socrates conversing with and learning from pre socratics parmenides and zeno in his dialogue parmenides a historical impossibility that might represent figuratively an intellectual rather than direct conversation idea that plato uses dialogues to place himself within existing philosophical lines has been much discussed before and after havelock for discussion of or line see mitchell h miller plato s parmenides conversion of soul princeton princeton university press 1986 28 32 book was intriguing to many philosophers but was poorly received among some classicists with one reviewer calling havelock s argument for basic difference between plato and pre socratics a failure and his analysis of plato

thumb alt engraving showing men arguing over a silhouette in a cave a seventeenth century illustration of plato s allegory of cave liberal temper makes argument for division between plato and early greek philosophy without a fully realised account of havelock s theory of greek literacy which he was still developing throughout this period havelock says in introduction to preface to plato that he arrived at his understanding of plato s view of oral poetry relatively late preface to plato see major works x rather than attempting once again to explain his distinction between 5th and 4th century bc thought in terms of a dissection of earlier school havelock turned in his 1963 preface to plato to 4th century bc philosophy itself he was interested principally in plato s much debated rejection of poetry in republic in which his fictionalised socrates argues that poetic mimesis representation of life in art is bad for soul havelock s claim was that republic can be used to understand position of poetry in history of greek mind preface to plato 15 book is divided into two parts first an exploration of oral culture and what havelock thinks of as oral thought and second an argument for what havelock calls necessity of platonism title of part 2 intimate relationship between platonic thought and development of literacy instead of concentrating on philosophical definitions of key terms as he had in his book on democritus havelock turned to greek language itself arguing that meaning of words changed after full development of written literature to admit a self reflective subject even pronouns he said had different functions result was a universal shift in what greek mind could imagine we confront here a change in greek language and in syntax of linguistic usage and in overtones of certain key words which is part of a larger intellectual revolution which affected whole range of greek cultural experience our present business is to connect this discovery with that crisis in greek culture which saw replacement of an orally memorised tradition by a quite different system of instruction and education and which therefore saw homeric state of mind give way to platonic preface to plato 198 for havelock plato s rejection of poetry was merely realisation of a cultural shift in which he was a participant two distinct phenomena are covered by shift he observed in greek culture at end of 5th century content of thought in particular concept of man or of soul and organisation of thought in homer havelock argues order of ideas is associative and temporal epic s units of meaning are linked to form an episode but parts of episode are greater than whole preface to plato 185 for plato on other hand purpose of thought is to arrive at significance of whole to move from specific to general havelock points out that plato s syntax which he shares with other 4th century writers reflects that organisation making smaller ideas subordinate to bigger ideas thus platonic theory of forms in itself havelock claims derives from a shift in organisation of greek language and ultimately comes down to a different function for and conception of noun preface to plato 269 70 preface to plato had a profound impact almost immediately after publication but an impact that was complex and inconsistent early reviews ranged from that of friedrich solmsen who concludes that havelock play s fast and loose with evidence american journal of philology 87 1 1966 105 to robert wellman s view that book is an excellent example of how historical scholarship not only informs history of philosophy but

in which those fields were growing further apart and reaction to preface from each of them was starkly different among classicists response ranged from indifference to derision with majority simply

greek orality and literacy journal of history of ideas vol 53 no 1 1992 148 63 148 philosophy particularly platonic scholarship was moving in a different direction at time and havelock neither engages nor was cited by principal movers in that field however book was embraced by literary theorists students of transition to literacy and others in fields as diverse as psychology and anthropology halverson 149 there have been affirmations and criticism of havelock s methods his account of orality is based almost entirely on homer but history of homeric text is not known which forces havelock to make claims based on assumptions that cannot fully be tested halverson 152 works of milman parry on homer were instrumental in developing orientation to his work and breakthrough sustained research which havelock prepared parry lord thesis was introduced by rosalind thomas to clarify import of this approach some later classicists argue that poetic nature of homer s language works against very arguments havelock makes about intellectual nature of oral poetry what he asserts as a definitive use of language can never be conclusively demonstrated not to be an accident of metrical convenience halverson 157 like platonists found book to be less than useful for precise work of their own discipline many classicists rejected outright havelock s essential thesis that oral culture predominated through 5th century robert b complains in a review of book of havelock s rapid dismissal of evidence of earlier writing and feels that present work will meet with even less acceptance than author s

central to havelock s account of greek culture in general was his conception of greek alphabet as a unique entity he wrote in 1977 invention of greek alphabet as opposed to all previous systems

there is announced a revolution which was destined to change nature of human culture preliteracy 378 it is this larger point about differences between oral and literate culture that represents

these ideas were sketched out in preface to plato but became central to havelock s work from prologue to greek literacy 1971 onward in latter part of his career havelock s relentless pursuit of his unvarying thesis led to a lack of interest in addressing opposing viewpoints in a review of havelock s greek concept of justice a book that attempts to ascribe most significant ideas in greek philosophy to his linguistic research philosopher alasdair macintyre accuses havelock of a brusque refusal to recognize substance of case he has to defeat macintyre alasdair review of greek concept of justice from its shadow in homer to its substance in plato american historical review vol 85 no 3 1980 605 as a result of this refusal havelock seems to have been caught in a conflict of mere contradiction with his opponents in which without attempt at refutation he simply asserts repeatedly that philosophy is fundamentally literate in nature and is countered only with a reminder that as macintyre says socrates wrote no books macintyre 605 in his last public lecture which was published posthumously havelock addressed political implications of his own scholarly work delivered at harvard on 16 march 1988 less than three weeks before his death lecture is framed principally in opposition to university of chicago philosopher leo strauss strauss had published a detailed and extensive critique of havelock s liberal temper in greek politics in march 1959 as liberalism of classical political philosophy in journal review of metaphysics strauss died 14 years later in 1973 same year in which havelock retired havelock s 1988 lecture claims to contain a systematic account of plato s politics havelock argues that plato s idealism applies a mathematical strictness to
