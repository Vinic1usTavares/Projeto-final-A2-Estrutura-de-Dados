wilson produced every other episode except closing time where denise paul produces and wilson is credited as series producer production designer edward thomas was replaced by michael pickwoad lead writer and executive producer steven moffat stated that purpose of previous series was to reassure audience that show was same despite many production changes however he wanted this series to be more of a ghost train and worry audience series is much more serialised than previous ones arc driven nature was inspired by positive reactions from fans when doctor from fifth series finale big bang appeared in earlier episode flesh and stone moffat decided to rest doctor s arch enemies daleks for series as being most frequent enemies of show made them most reliably enemies in universe series continues to build mystery of silence which had been introduced in fifth series moffat did not wish to end arc in previous series as he felt it would be more fun to continue it moffat had planned revelation about river song for a long time when creating amy s character he chose pond for her last name to create a link moffat intended for answer to be as complicated as question moffat informed kingston of secrets of her character at end of previous series and she was not allowed to tell anyone smith gillan and darvill were unaware of identity of her character song s identity was kept in top secrecy script read at read through of a good man goes to war had a false ending and only a select few were issued real script writing matthew graham was not able to write an episode as he was slated to for fifth series because he did not believe he would have enough time moffat then asked him to write two part episode rebel flesh almost people neil gaiman had written doctor s wife for previous series but due to budget constraints it was replaced with lodger this necessitated changes to script including addition of rory as a companion during production process order of third fourth and ninth episodes was changed curse of black spot was swapped with night terrors because moffat felt that second half of series was too dark this necessitated minor changes for episodes to fit into storyline most notably in night terrors moffat wanted to start series with a two parter that had gravity and a wider scope in plot he also aimed to make them some of darkest episodes in contrast following episode curse of black spot would allow characters to kick back and have some fun gaiman s episode was based around tardis and allowing doctor and tardis to speak to each other graham s two parter was intended to lead into a good man goes to war mid series finale but have a main plot about avatars that rebel graham took moffat s pitch and added many of his own aspects such as monastery setting and flesh then in addition to revealing who river song is a good man goes to war presented situation of doctor who was typically a pacifist being provoked enough to assemble an army moffat described ending as game changing cliffhanger and split series in two because such a climax could not be done at end of a series as it would be too long before it came back mid series premiere let s kill hitler was intended to be opposite of grim and dark tone of series premiere mark gatiss wrote night terrors to be a scary episode surprised that dolls had not been used in doctor who before girl who waited is a doctor lite episode an episode in which actor playing doctor is not required for much of shooting which allowed tom macrae to explore amy and rory s characters and relationship concept of god complex was originally pitched by toby whithouse for fifth series but it was pushed back as moffat felt that it was too similar to stories in that series penultimate episode closing time is a sequel to series five s lodger and allows doctor to have some fun while building up to finale writer gareth roberts also wanted to bring back cybermen there were no other returning monsters in series and he thought there should be a sense of history about doctor s final battle to save earth before he heads off to meet his death finale was described by moffat as a big roller coaster ride of doctor who madness and concludes doctor s death arc though it intentionally leaves some mysteries filming night terrors was first episode of series to be filmed in september 2010 it was mainly filmed on a council estate in bristol with some scenes filmed in dyrham park production of doctor s wife also occurred in september with some in october two part opening story was partially filmed in united

with show calling it more visually impressive and more narratively rewarding than anything we ve had before guardian dan martin was positive towards first six episodes despite calling curse of black spot a wasted opportunity and noting that it would be a risk to serialise story too much he particularly praised way amy rory and doctor had developed since last series sam mcpherson of zap2it said that despite a few duds sixth series was strongest since doctor who revival in 2005 despite disliking finale as a conclusion independent neela debnath praised character development seen in series as well as cinematic quality she also was positive to dynamic between doctor amy and rory as it was different from other characters seen previously on show and continuing with same character allowed series to feel more multi layered charlie jane anders of io9 described it as of most unusual and structurally ambitious eras in doctor who history and praised way story revolved around doctor anders commented in a review of dvd release that inventiveness and cleverness was an integral part of sixth series and episodes such as doctor s wife and god complex would be considered classics she praised moffat s writing while commenting on fact that series primary storylines including amy s pregnancy river song s childhood and assassination plot on doctor were not satisfying enough when re watching series anders stated that amy and river were not so much considered plausible characters dvd talk s john sinnott gave series four out of five stars feeling that it didn t quite hit heights of fifth series but was still pretty good and light years past any other sf show currently in production despite finding solution witty unpredictable and very satisfying he stated that subplots were a bit convoluted and potentially confusing and they seem to drop mystery of person in space suit for a large part of season and focus on other odd events he also noted that plots of consecutive episodes night terrors girl who waited and god complex were similar reviewing whole series sfx ian berriman was more critical giving it three and a half out of five stars he criticised story arc finding it too complicated and solution unsatisfying and noted that it lacked emotional impact anders felt that story arc especially finale suffered from amy and river not being portrayed as believable characters digital spy named doctor who eighth best show of 2011 feeling that series was something of a mixed bag with episodes of varying quality but generally praised acting of cast matt smith was firing on all cylinders there s a confidence that comes with knowing you re a hit with viewers while arthur darvill s rory excelled in his first year as a series regular gavin fuller of daily telegraph wrote that wedding of river song was an uneven ending to a slightly uneven series which at times has been in danger of itself but still has been one of most creative and distinctive series on television series was also criticised by viewers and press for being too scary for young children too complicated and running risk of alienating casual viewers arnold t blumburg of ign stated that sixth series inspired seriously divided reactions in fandom and in his opinion show has never been more unevenly written or emotionally distant awards and nominations year award category nominee s result 2011
