merchant shipping another cruise into atlantic was conducted from 7 july to 1 august during which preussen stopped in el ferrol spain on way back to germany high seas fleet was received by british royal navy in spithead later that year admiral henning von holtzendorff became fleet commander holtzendorff s tenure as fleet commander was marked by strategic experimentation owing to increased threat latest underwater weapons posed and fact that new s were too wide to pass through kaiser wilhelm canal accordingly fleet was transferred from baltic sea port of kiel to north sea port of wilhelmshaven on 1 april 1910 thumb i foreground and ii squadrons background in kiel in may 1910 fleet conducted training maneuvers in kattegat these were in accordance with holtzendorff s strategy

to avoid exposing fleet during period of heightened tension with britain and france on 30 january 1913 holtzendorff was relieved as fleet commander owing in large part due to wilhelm ii s displeasure with his strategic vision ingenohl took holtzendorff s place and kadm reinhard scheer in turn replaced ingenohl as ii squadron commander on 4 february in late august squadron steamed through kaiser wilhelm canal at start of autumn maneuvers to reach island of helgoland voyage through canal was notable because canal had been closed for over a year while it was enlarged to allow passage of larger

baltic seas in 1911 after outbreak of war in august 1914 german command deployed ii squadron in german bight to defend germany s coast from a major attack from royal navy that germans presumed was imminent preussen and her squadron mates were stationed in mouth of elbe to support vessels on patrol duty in bight once it became clear that british would not attack high seas fleet germans began a series of operations designed to lure out a portion of numerically superior british grand fleet and destroy it by achieving a rough equality of forces german navy could then force a decisive battle in southern portion of north sea first such operation in which high seas fleet participated was raid on scarborough hartlepool and whitby on 15 16 december 1914 main fleet acted as distant support for kadm franz von hipper s battlecruiser squadron while it raided coastal towns on evening of 15 december fleet came to within of an isolated squadron of six british battleships however skirmishes between rival destroyer screens in darkness convinced ingenohl who was now german fleet commander that entire grand fleet was deployed before him under orders from wilhelm ii to avoid battle if victory was not certain ingenohl broke off engagement and turned battlefleet back towards germany at end of month scheer was replaced by kadm felix funke scheer going on to command iii battle squadron on 14 march 1915 preussen went to kiel for periodic maintenance and she was replaced as squadron flagship by battleship latter vessel held position for remainder of squadron s existence with exceptions of 19 september to 16 october 1915 25 february to 7 april 1916 in september that year and from 22 january to 10 february 1917 during each of these periods preussen temporarily resumed

returned to elbe though she was transferred back to straits on 21 may remaining there until 8 june as a result she missed battle of jutland fought on 31 may 1 june in north sea her sister ship lothringen also missed battle as she had been deemed to be in too poor a condition to participate in fleet sortie jutland proved to scheer who was now fleet commander that pre dreadnought battleships were too vulnerable to take part in a major fleet action and so he detached ii squadron from high seas fleet as a result preussen remained in service only as a guard ship she saw further stints in danish straits from 30 june to 23 july and from 15 to 31 august on 13 march 1917 preussen left elbe and steamed to baltic where she was temporarily used as an icebreaker to clear a path to swinemunde

was converted into a parent ship for f type minesweepers at kriegsmarinewerft in wilhelmshaven in 1919 ship was disarmed and platforms for holding minesweepers were installed preussen was commissioned with reichsmarine to support minesweeping effort though she proved to be too top heavy to serve as an effective mothership and she was soon replaced by old light cruiser preussen was placed in reserve and was left out of service until 1929 when she was stricken from naval register on 5 april reichsmarine sold her to ship breakers on 25 february 1931 for 216 800 reichsmarks preussen was subsequently
