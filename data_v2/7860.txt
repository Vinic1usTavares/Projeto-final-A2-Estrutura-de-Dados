and vali by axel 1846 1908 1982 theories have been proposed that vidarr s silence may derive from a ritual silence or other abstentions which often accompany acts of vengeance as for example in voluspa and baldrs draumar when vali conceived for sole purpose of avenging baldr s death abstains from washing his hands and combing his hair until he brought baldr s adversary to funeral pyre lindow 2001 312 313 parallels have been drawn between chapter 31 of tacitus 1st century ce work germania where tacitus describes that members of chatti a germanic tribe may not shave or groom before having first slain an enemy lindow 2001 311 dumezil georges dumezil theorized that vidarr represents a cosmic figure from an archetype derived from proto indo europeans lindow 2001 314 referencing dumezil georges 1965 le dieu vidarr collected in revue de l histoire des religions 168 pages 1 13 dumezil stated that he was aligned with both vertical space due to his placement of his foot on wolf s lower jaw and his hand on wolf s upper jaw and horizontal space due to his wide step and strong shoe and that by killing wolf vidarr keeps wolf from destroying cosmos and cosmos can thereafter be restored after destruction resulting from ragnarok dumezil thus conceives of vidarr as a spatial god dumezil substantiates his claim with text of lokasenna in which vidarr trying to mediate dispute with loki urges other aesir to grant loki his space at feasting table dumezil argues that this play on vidarr s spatiality would have been understood by an audience familiar with god an interpretation further warranted by his reading of lokasenna as being in significant part a book of puns and word plays about different aesir dumezil also suggests that vidarr s spatiality is seen in vishnu of vedic traditions both etymologically vi root and mythologically citing story of bali and vishnu in this legend vishnu in form of vamana tricks malevolent king bali who has secured dominion over whole earth by making bali promise to grant vamana all land he can cover in three paces vamana turns himself into a giant and strides across all of heaven and earth taking bali s head and granting him immortality in lieu of taking last pace dumezil theorizes that these myths of fenrir vs vidarr and bali vs vishnu may have a common origin in an indo european god of spatiality similar but distinct from
