thumb 380px a typical interface for querying a tablebase an endgame tablebase is a computerized database that contains exhaustive analysis of chess endgame positions it is typically used by a computer chess engine during play or by a human or computer that is retrospectively analysing a game that has already been played tablebase contains game theoretical value win loss or draw of each possible move in each possible position and how many moves it would take to achieve that result with perfect play thus tablebase acts as an oracle always providing optimal moves typically database records each possible position with certain pieces remaining on board and best moves with white to move and with black to move tablebases are generated by retrograde analysis working backwards from a checkmated position by 2005 all chess positions with up to six pieces including two kings had been solved by august 2012 tablebases had solved chess for every position with up to seven pieces positions with a lone king versus a king and five pieces were omitted because they were considered to be rather obvious website solutions have profoundly advanced chess community s understanding of endgame theory some positions which humans had analyzed as draws were proven to be winnable tablebase analysis could find a mate in more than five hundred moves far beyond horizon of humans and beyond capability of a computer during play for this reason they have also called into question 50 move rule since many positions are now seen to exist that are a win for one side but would be drawn because of 50 move rule tablebases have enhanced competitive play and facilitated composition of endgame studies they provide a powerful analytical tool while endgame tablebases for other board games like checkers website of about creation of a tablebases for 8x8 and 10x10 checkers chess com examples of long endings for gothic chess or nine men s morris exist when a game is not specified it is assumed to be chess background physical limitations of computer hardware aside in principle it is possible to solve any game under condition that complete state is known and there is no random chance strong solutions i e algorithms that can produce perfect play from any position are known for some simple games such as tic tac toe noughts and crosses draw with perfect play and connect four first player wins weak solutions exist for somewhat more complex games such as checkers with perfect play on both sides game is known to be a draw but it is not known for every position created by less than perfect play what perfect next move would be other games such as chess from starting position and go have not been solved because their game complexity is far too vast for computers to evaluate all possible positions to reduce game complexity researchers have modified these complex games by reducing size of board or number of pieces or both computer chess is one of oldest domains of artificial intelligence having begun in early 1930s claude shannon proposed formal criteria for evaluating chess moves in 1949 in 1951 alan turing designed a primitive chess playing program which assigned values for material and mobility program played chess based on turing s manual calculations levy newborn pp 25 38 however even as competent chess programs began to develop they exhibited a glaring weakness in playing endgame programmers added specific heuristics for endgame for example king should move to center of board levy newborn pp 129 30 however a more comprehensive solution was needed in 1965 richard bellman proposed creation of a database to solve chess and checkers endgames using retrograde analysis stiller p 84 instead of analyzing forward from position currently on board database would analyze backward from positions where one player was checkmated or stalemated thus a chess computer would no longer need to analyze endgame positions during game because they were solved beforehand it would no longer make mistakes because tablebase always played best possible move in 1970 thomas published a doctoral also with analysis of following classes of endgame and in 1977 thompson s kqkr database was used in a match versus grandmaster walter browne ken thompson and others helped extend tablebases to cover all four and five piece endgames including in particular and levy newborn p also lewis stiller published a thesis with research on some six piece tablebase endgames in 1995 stiller pp 68 also more recent contributors have included following people eugene nalimov after whom popular nalimov tablebases are named eiko bleicher who has adapted tablebase concept to a program called freezer see below guy haworth an academic at university of reading who has published extensively in journal and elsewhere marc bourzutschky and yakov konoval who have collaborated to analyze endgames with seven pieces on board peter karrer who constructed a specialized seven piece tablebase for endgame of kasparov versus world online match vladimir and victor zakharov from moscow state university who completed 4 3 dtm tablebases 525 endings including in july 2012 tablebases are named lomonosov tablebases next set of 5 2 dtm tablebases 350 endings including was completed during august 2012 high speed of generating tablebases was because of using a supercomputer named lomonosov top500 size of all tablebases up to seven man is about 140 tb tablebases of all endgames with up to seven pieces are available for free download and may also be queried using web interfaces see external links below nalimov tablebase requires more than one terabyte of storage space generating tablebases metrics depth to conversion and depth to mate before creating a tablebase a programmer must choose a metric of optimality in other words they must define at what point a player has won game every position can be defined by its distance i e number of moves from desired endpoint two metrics are generally used depth to mate dtm a checkmate is only way to win a game depth to conversion dtc stronger side can also win by capturing material thus converting to a simpler endgame for example in kqkr conversion occurs when white captures black rook haworth has discussed two other metrics namely depth to zeroing move dtz and depth by rule dtr a zeroing move is a move which resets move count to zero under fifty move rule i e mate a capture or a pawn move these metrics support fifty move rule but dtr tablebases have not yet been computed 7 man dtz tablebases were made publicly available in august 2018 difference between dtc and dtm can be understood by analyzing diagram at right how white should proceed depends on which metric is used metric play dtc dtm dtc 1 qxd1 2 qd2 kb8 3 qd8 1 3 dtm 1 2 2 2 according to dtc metric white should capture rook because that leads immediately to a position which will certainly win dtc 1 but it will take two more moves actually to checkmate dtm 3 in contrast according to dtm metric white mates in two moves so dtm dtc 2 this difference is typical of many endgames usually dtc is smaller than dtm but dtm metric leads to quickest checkmate exceptions occur where weaker side has only a king and in unusual endgame of two knights versus one pawn then dtc dtm because either there is no defending material to capture or capturing material does no good indeed capturing defending pawn in latter endgame results in a draw unless it results in immediate mate step 1 generating all possible positions once a metric is chosen first step is to generate all positions with a given material for example to generate a dtm tablebase for endgame of king and queen versus king computer must describe approximately 40 000 unique legal positions levy and newborn explain that number 40 000 derives from a symmetry argument black king can be placed on any of ten squares a1 b1 c1 d1 b2 c2 d2 c3 d3 and d4 see diagram on any other square its position can be considered equivalent by symmetry of rotation or reflection thus there is no difference whether a black king in a corner resides on a1 a8 h8 or h1 multiply this number of 10 by at most 60 legal remaining squares for placing white king and then by at most 62 squares for white queen product 37 200 several hundred of these positions are illegal impossible or symmetrical reflections of each other so actual number is somewhat smaller levy newborn pp 140 43see also stiller 1995 93 98 for each position tablebase evaluates situation separately for white to move and black to move assuming that white has queen almost all positions are white wins with checkmate forced in no more than ten moves some positions are draws because of stalemate or unavoidable loss of queen each additional piece added to a pawnless endgame multiplies number of unique positions by about a factor of sixty which is approximate number of squares not already occupied by other pieces endgames with one or more pawns increase complexity because symmetry argument is reduced since pawns can move forward but not sideways rotation and vertical reflection of board produces a fundamental change in nature of position best calculation of symmetry is achieved by limiting one pawn to 24 squares in rectangle a2 a7 d7 d2 all other pieces and pawns may be located in any of 64 squares with respect to pawn thus an endgame with pawns has a complexity of 24 10 2 4 times a pawnless endgame with same number of pieces step 2 evaluating positions using retrograde analysis tim krabbe explains process of generating a tablebase as follows idea is that a database is made with all possible positions with a given material note as in preceding section then a is made of all positions where black is mated then one where white can give mate then one where black cannot stop white giving mate next move then one where white can always reach a position where black cannot stop him from giving mate next move and so on always a ply further away from mate until all positions that are thus connected to mate have been found then all of these positions are linked back to mate by shortest path through database that means that apart from equi optimal moves all moves in such a path are perfect white s move always leads to quickest mate black s move always leads to slowest mate retrograde analysis is only necessary from checkmated positions because every position that cannot be reached by moving backwards from a checkmated position must be a draw figure 1 illustrates idea of retrograde analysis white can force mate in two moves by playing 1 kc6 leading to position in figure 2 there are only two legal moves for black from this position both of which lead to checkmate if 1 kb8 2 and if 1 kd8 2 figure 3 figure 3 before white s second move is defined as mate in one ply figure 2 after white s first move is mate in two ply regardless of how black plays finally initial position in figure 1 is mate in three ply i e two moves because it leads directly to figure 2 which is already defined as mate in two ply this process which links a current position to another position that could have existed one ply earlier can continue indefinitely each position is evaluated as a win or loss in a certain number of moves at end of retrograde analysis positions which are not designated as wins or losses are necessarily draws step 3 verification after tablebase has been generated and every position has been evaluated result must be verified independently purpose is to check self consistency of tablebase results for example in figure 1 above verification program sees evaluation mate in three ply kc6 it then looks at position in figure 2 after kc6 and sees evaluation mate in two ply these two evaluations are consistent with each other if evaluation of figure 2 were anything else it would be inconsistent with figure 1 so tablebase would need to be corrected captures pawn promotion and special moves a four piece tablebase must rely on three piece tablebases that could result if one piece is captured similarly a tablebase containing a pawn must be able to rely on other tablebases that deal with new set of material after pawn promotion to a queen or other piece retrograde analysis program must account for possibility of a capture or pawn promotion on previous move stiller pp 99 100 tablebases assume that castling is not possible for two reasons first in practical endgames this assumption is almost always correct however castling is allowed by convention in composed problems and studies second if king and rook are on their original squares castling may or may not be allowed because of this ambiguity it would be necessary to make separate evaluations for states in which castling is or is not possible same ambiguity exists for en passant capture since possibility of en passant depends on opponent s previous move however practical applications of en passant occur frequently in pawn endgames so tablebases account for possibility of en passant for positions where both sides have at least one pawn using a priori information according to method described above tablebase must allow possibility that a given piece might occupy any of 64 squares in some positions it is possible to restrict search space without affecting result this saves computational resources and enables searches which would otherwise be impossible an early analysis of this type was published in 1987 in endgame where black bishop moves on dark squares see example position at right in this position we can make following a priori assumptions if a piece is captured we can look up resulting position in corresponding tablebase with five pieces for example if black pawn is captured look up newly created position in white pawn stays on a2 capture moves are handled by 1st rule black pawn stays on a3 capture moves are handled by 1st rule result of this simplification is that instead of searching for 48 47 2 256 permutations for pawns locations there is only one permutation reducing search space by a factor of 2 256 facilitates a much quicker calculation bleicher has designed a commercial program called freezer which allows users to build new tablebases from existing nalimov tablebases with a priori information program could produce a tablebase for positions with seven or more pieces with blocked pawns even before tablebases for seven pieces became available applications correspondence chess in correspondence chess a player may consult a chess computer for assistance provided that etiquette of competition allows this a six piece tablebase kqqkqq was used to analyze endgame that occurred in correspondence game kasparov versus world players have also used tablebases to analyze endgames from over board play after game is over competitive players need to know that some tablebases ignore fifty move rule according to that rule if fifty moves have passed without a capture or a pawn move either player may claim a draw fide changed rules several times starting in 1974 to allow one hundred moves for endgames where fifty moves were insufficient to win in 1988 fide allowed seventy five moves for kbbkn knnkp and with pawn on seventh rank because tablebases had uncovered positions in these endgames requiring more than fifty moves to win in 1992 fide canceled these exceptions and restored fifty move rule to its original standing thus a tablebase may identify a position as won or lost when it is in fact drawn by fifty move rule in 2013 iccf changed rules for correspondence chess tournaments starting from 2014 a player may claim a win or draw based on six man tablebases introduction of table base claims by eric ruch iccf president in this case fifty move rule is not applied and number of moves to mate is not taken into consideration haworth has designed a tablebase that produces results consistent with fifty move rule however most tablebases search for theoretical limits of forced mate even if it requires several hundred moves computer chess knowledge contained in tablebases affords computer a tremendous advantage in endgame not only can computers play perfectly within an endgame but they can simplify to a winning tablebase position from a more complicated endgame for latter purpose some programs use bitbases which give game theoretical value of positions without number of moves until conversion or mate that is they only reveal whether position is won lost or draw sometimes even this data is compressed and bitbase reveals only whether a position is won or not making no difference between a lost and a drawn game for example used by shredder program are a type of bitbase which fits all three four and five piece bitbases in 157 mb this is a mere fraction of 7 05 gb that nalimov tablebases require some computer chess experts have observed practical drawbacks to use of tablebases in addition to ignoring fifty move rule a computer in a difficult position might avoid losing side of a tablebase ending even if opponent cannot practically win without himself knowing tablebase adverse effect could be a premature resignation or an inferior line of play that loses with less resistance than a play without tablebase might offer another drawback is that tablebases require a lot of memory to store many thousands of positions nalimov tablebases which use advanced compression techniques require 7 05 gb of hard disk space for all five piece endings six piece endings require approximately 1 2 tb seven piece lomonosov tablebase requires 140 tb of storage space lomonosov endgame tablebases http chessok com page id 10 june 2017 some computers play better overall if their memory is devoted instead to ordinary search and evaluation function modern engines analyze far enough ahead conventionally to handle elementary endgames without needing tablebases i e without suffering from horizon effect it is only in more complicated endgames that tablebases will have any significant effect on an engine s performance syzygy tablebases were developed by ronald de man released in april 2013 in a form optimized for use by a chess program during search this variety consists of two tables per endgame a smaller wdl table win draw loss which contains knowledge of 50 move rule and a larger dtz table distance to zero ply i e pawn move or capture wdl tables were designed to be small enough to fit on a solid state drive for quick access during search whereas dtz form is for use at root position to choose game theoretically quickest distance to resetting 50 move rule while retaining a winning position instead of performing a search syzygy tablebases are available for all 6 piece endings and are now supported by many top engines including komodo deep fritz houdini and stockfish since august 2018 all 7 piece syzygy tables are also available current status of tablebases is summarized in

on creating an eight piece tablebase is ongoing it is assumed that a 1000 move mate in one of 8 man endgames may be found although this is unlikely to happen before 2020 during an interview at google in 2010 garry kasparov said that maybe limit will be 8 pieces because start position of chess is ultimate endgame of 32 pieces he claimed that there is no chance that chess can be solved by computers endgame theory in contexts where fifty move rule may be ignored tablebases have answered longstanding questions about whether certain combinations of material are wins or draws following interesting results have emerged kbbkn bernhard horwitz and josef kling 1851 proposed that black can draw by entering a defensive fortress but tablebases demonstrated a general win with maximum dtc 66 or 67 and maximum dtm 78 also see pawnless chess endgame knnkp maximum dtc dtm 115 moves knights win in 62 5 percent of positions with maximum dtm 85 moves despite equality of material player to move wins in 67 74 of positions maximum dtc is 92 and maximum dtm is 117 in both this endgame and kqqkqq first player to check usually wins nunn p 379 384 krnknn and krbknn friedrich had analyzed these two endgames in 1900s stiller p 81 krnknn and krbknn are won for strongest side in 78 and 95 of cases respectively stiller s dtc tablebase revealed several lengthy wins in these endgames longest win in krbknn has a dtc of 223 and a dtm of 238 moves not shown even more amazing is position at right where white wins starting with 1 stiller reported dtc as 243 moves and dtm was later found to be 262 moves stiller pp 102 8 for some years a mate in 200 position first diagram below held record for longest computer generated forced mate otto had composed a mate in 292 moves problem in 1889 albeit from an illegal

twice as long as stiller s maximum and almost 200 moves beyond previous record of a 330 dtc for a position of 1001 bourzutschky wrote this was a big surprise for us and is a great tribute to complexity of chess later when lomonosov 7 piece tablebase was being completed a position was found with a dtm of 546 third diagram below net who wins from this puzzle a chess position with a mate in 546 answer presented as a puzzle and discussion many positions are winnable although at first sight they appear to be non winnable for example position in middle diagram is a win for black in 154 moves white pawn is captured at around 80 moves six man endgame server in august 2006 bourzutschky released preliminary results from his analysis of following seven piece endgames and endgame studies since many composed endgame studies deal with positions that exist in tablebases their soundness can be checked using tablebases some studies have been proved unsound by tablebases that can be either because composer s solution does not work or else because there is an equally effective alternative that composer did not consider another way tablebases cook studies is a change in evaluation of an endgame for instance endgame with a queen and bishop versus two rooks was thought to be a draw but tablebases proved it to be a win for queen and bishop so almost all studies based on this endgame are unsound nunn pp 367 68 for example erik composed study at right with white to play and win his intended main line was 1 ne3 rxh2 2 0 0 0 a tablebase discovered that 1 h4 also wins for white in 33 moves even though black can capture pawn which is not best move in case of capturing pawn black loses in 21 moves while kh1 g2 loses in 32 moves incidentally tablebase does not recognize composer s solution because it includes castling while tablebases have cooked some studies they have assisted in creation of other studies composers can search tablebases for interesting positions such as zugzwang using a method called data mining for all three to five piece endgames and pawnless six piece endgames a complete list of mutual has been tabulated and published there has been some controversy whether to allow endgame studies composed with tablebase assistance into composing tournaments in 2003 endgame composer and expert john roycroft summarized debate n ot only do opinions diverge widely but they are frequently adhered to strongly even vehemently at one extreme is view that since we can never be certain that a computer has been used it is pointless to attempt a distinction so we should simply evaluate a study on its content without reference to its origins at other extreme is view that using a mouse to lift an interesting position from a ready made computer generated list is in no sense composing so we should outlaw every such position roycroft himself agrees with latter approach he continues one thing alone is clear to us distinction between classical composing and computer composing should be preserved for as long as possible if there is a name associated with a study diagram that name is a claim of authorship mark dvoretsky an international master chess trainer and author took a more permissive stance he was commenting in 2006 on a study by harold van der heijden published in 2001 which reached position at right after three introductory moves drawing move for white is 4 and not 4 based on a mutual zugzwang that may occur three moves later dvoretsky comments here we should touch on one delicate question i am sure that this unique endgame position was discovered with help of thompson s famous computer database is this a flaw diminishing composer s achievement p yes computer database is an instrument available to anyone nowadays out of it no doubt we could probably extract yet more unique positions there are some chess composers who do so regularly standard for evaluation here should be result achieved thus miracles based upon complex computer analysis rather than on their content of sharp ideas are probably of interest only to certain aesthetes play chess with god on bell labs website ken thompson once maintained a link to some of his tablebase data headline read play chess with god regarding stiller s long wins tim krabbe struck a similar note a grandmaster wouldn t be better at these endgames than someone who had learned chess yesterday it s a sort of chess that has nothing to do with chess a chess that we could never have imagined without computers stiller moves are awesome almost scary because you know they are truth god s algorithm it s like being revealed meaning of life but you don t understand one word nomenclature originally an endgame tablebase was called an endgame data base or endgame database this name appeared in both eg and icca journal starting in 1970s and is sometimes used today according to haworth icca journal first used word tablebase in connection with chess endgames in 1995 according to that source a tablebase contains a complete set of information but a database might lack some information haworth prefers term endgame table and has used it in articles he has authored roycroft has used term oracle database throughout his magazine eg for example in nonetheless mainstream chess community has adopted endgame tablebase as most common name books john nunn has written three books based on detailed analysis of endgame tablebases tables seven piece endgames attacking pieces defending chess plt45 svgfile chess plt45 svgfile chess rdt45 svgfile chess bdt45
