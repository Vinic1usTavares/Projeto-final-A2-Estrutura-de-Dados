with producer and musician matthew herbert songs were first released through three extended plays and were then compiled into a studio album album often samples sounds made by everyday objects and actions including cosmetics brass mice dancing and ornaments it mixes electronic music for which moloko was known with jazz and pop styles ruby blue received positive reviews from music critics and peaked at number 88 on uk albums chart album spawned two singles if we re in love and sow into you background murphy and mark brydon ended their romantic relationship but were still contractually obligated to record another album which became moloko s 2003 album statues when she finished touring she found herself alone and had to re evaluate friendships she had built during this time she got to know matthew herbert whom she had met when he remixed several of moloko s songs murphy had wanted to work with him again commenting that it felt very natural because matthew makes things seem quicker and easier during first day of recording with herbert he had her bring an unspecified object so that they could hit it against a microphone and record sound it made herbert s approach was that for murphy to go solo album should revolve around her and sounds that surround her they wanted to carry out recording and audio mixing in one room so herbert invested in a studio there herbert recorded murphy s voice without accompaniment so that she could better hear how her voice naturally sounded on occasion two added instruments to a track by having her hire an instrumentalist sometimes to play an unusual instrument such as a hammered dulcimer after pair had recorded a few songs murphy found that she enjoyed working with herbert and her label let her work freely without any deadline when she presented them album they found it odd and did not hear any songs that would make successful singles a r division suggested that murphy make some changes to make it more radio friendly murphy refused stating that she wanted it to be as pure as possible label later came to support her songs on ruby blue were gradually released on limited edition 12 inch vinyl eps titled sequins 1 sequins 2 and sequins 3 in january february and may 2005 respectively cover art for ruby blue was painted by simon henwood murphy met henwood in a pub and henwood who was known for his simplified paintings of teenagers thought that she would be a good subject for a painting henwood came to murphy s house next week and while they were looking through her wardrobe decided to have her dressed in sequins murphy positioned her body in abstract shapes for henwood to paint she developed a character which henwood described as a disco electro pop diva with a 1940s look his canvases were displayed at hospital in london and murphy purchased them for her kids so they can see what she once looked like three eps and both singles used henwood s paintings in cover and he later directed music videos for singles composition ruby blue is an avant pop jazz and glitch album that mixes electronica with early 20th century vocal jazz an interest of herbert s instruments primarily brass and woodwinds are layered over sampled noises such as alarm clocks a water cooler hairspray and helmets murphy s vocals were described as a combination of a less pained billie holiday and a less sheltered doris day she cited outkast s 2003 double album love below as an influence stating that it was experimental it was soulful and funky album s lyrics are based on her romantic relationships with brydon and then with henwood opening track leaving city slowly builds up during introduction and uses out of tune instrumentation and a repetitive chorus following sinking feeling which uses a beat constructed from clicking sounds is night of dancing flame which combines synthesisers with 1920s jazz it is written in waltz time and was compared to stevie wonder s work during his peak after opening with noises such as rustling and coughing longest track through time proceeds into a ballad that was compared to those by carole king fifth track sow into you was released as album s second single song uses a metaphor of rain and harvests to describe love and sex atop a baroque pop brass arrangement dear diary is a torch song mixing northern soul with disco music with sounds of doorbells and telephones ringing seventh track if we re in love was released as album s lead single it is a downtempo song featuring a boogie swing rhythm and sharp brass parts opening with phased vocals and closing with a call and response between brass and keyboard parts ramalama bang bang eighth track contains a chorus of onomatopoeic lyrics delivered over a tribal rhythm title track uses overdriven guitar parts and layers of overdubbed vocals its lyrics caution a woman who has become out of control and its title was chosen to contrast feelings of passion and melancholy off on it a more experimental song with an unsteady rhythm precedes prelude to love in making an excerpt of less than one minute taken from love in making on sequins 2 album closes with closing of doors a cabaret style ballad driven by piano critical reception left thumb murphy performing at 2005 glastonbury festival ruby blue received positive reviews from music critics garry mulholland of observer called it kind of ambitious avant pop hybrid that gets bjork rapturous acclaim heather phares of allmusic wrote that murphy keeps alluring sensuality and unpredictable quirks that made moloko unique without sounding like she s rehashing where she s already been edward oculicz of stylus magazine said album happily represents something of a midpoint between downright oddity of moloko s early albums and mix of disco sensibility and wrenching balladry of their swansong dan raper of popmatters praised album as one of best examples of production shaping but not overwhelming artist s vision guardians john burgess agreed stating that because of herbert s production murphy sounded sonically enticing and varied at times sultry rude powerful and tender across white noise waltz time signatures and jazz sass but was mixed on album overall adding that pair often let their noodling eclipse songs leaving few you ll actually be able to sing back to anyone pitchforks mark richardson remarked that it s hard to imagine anyone not ranking this is best thing murphy has ever done and that when songwriting is on ruby blue seems perfect ultimate combination of human warmth and technological know how website placed album at number
