bombing of tan son nhut air base occurred on april 28 1975 just two days before fall of saigon bombing operation was carried out by vietnam people s air force vpaf quyet thang squadron using captured republic of vietnam air force rvnaf a 37 dragonfly aircraft flown by vpaf pilots and rvnaf defectors led by nguyen thanh trung who had bombed presidential palace in saigon on 8 april 1975 in 1973 by time paris peace accords were concluded south vietnam possessed fourth largest air force in world despite their size however rvnaf operations were severely curtailed due to cutbacks in u s military aid furthermore rvnaf were prevented from undertaking reconnaissance and ground support missions due to threat posed by formidable anti aircraft weapons deployed by north vietnam when north vietnamese military renewed their offensive early in 1975 rvnaf was handicapped and many of their aircraft were either lost or captured as formations of people s army of vietnam pavn swept through central highlands of south vietnam background strategic situation although paris peace accords of 1973 were supposed to end war in vietnam fighting continued between south vietnam and north vietnam and viet cong vc despite a pledge of support from u s president richard nixon military aid to south vietnam was sharply reduced by end of 1972 rvnaf was fourth largest air force in world with 2 075 aircraft and over 61 000 personnel however rvnaf operations were severely affected by cutbacks in military aid flying hours had to be reduced by 51 and bomb loads on fighter aircraft halved from four to two pieces of ordnance north vietnam continued to build up its combat units in south vietnam with threat of u s airpower removed north vietnamese military moved anti aircraft units into south vietnam and deployed a sophisticated air defence network that included long range sa 2 surface to air missile system radar guided anti aircraft guns and sa 7 grail shoulder launched missile strong presence of north vietnamese anti aircraft units which covered much of northern provinces of south vietnam forced rvnaf reconnaissance and fighter aircraft to fly at higher altitudes to avoid being hit by surface to air missiles consequently when north vietnam went on offensive again in 1975 rvnaf was severely handicapped ho chi minh campaign ho chi minh campaign commenced on 9 march 1975 and by mid march army of republic of vietnam arvn had withdrawn from central highlands rvnaf 6th air force division had been given only 48 hours to evacuate its aircraft and personnel from pleiku air base leaving 64 aircraft intact including 36 aircraft in flyable storage and no attempt were made to put those aircraft into commission on 27 march with south vietnamese forces of i corps facing imminent defeat brigadier general nguyen duc khanh commander of rvnaf 1st air force division was ordered to evacuate all flyable aircraft from hue and da nang on 28 march pavn forces closed in on da nang and they subjected da nang air base to heavy artillery bombardment under adverse conditions rvnaf was able to fly about 130 aircraft out of city but they had to abandon 180 aircraft including 33 a 37 due to chaos confusion poor discipline and breakdown of airfield security on 29 march pavn captured da nang followed by quy nhon on 1 april and tuy hoa and nha trang on 2 april at phan rang air base rvnaf 2nd air division continued to battle pavn troops for two days after ground units of arvn had given up fight elements of arvn airborne division were also committed into fight but they were overwhelmed by pavn and phan rang was captured on april 16 attack on presidential palace thumb right 250px red circle marks impact point of one of lt trung s bombs on roof of presidential palace thumb flown by nguyen thanh trung on 8 april a formation of three rvnaf f 5e tiger fighter bombers lined up at bien hoa air base each armed with four 250 pound bombs for an attack on pavn positions in binh thuan province before second aircraft took off first lieutenant nguyen thanh trung who piloted third f 5 reported his aircraft was experiencing afterburner problems when second aircraft departed trung also took off but flew towards saigon instead of joining formation at around 8 30am trung dived on presidential palace and dropped two bombs first bomb landed on palace grounds and caused some damage but second bomb failed to explode trung climbed to over before making a second pass this time both bombs exploded causing minor structural damage but no casualties after attack trung flew out of saigon and landed at petroleum storage facility at nha be on outskirts of city where he removed ammunition for 20mm cannon shortly afterwards trung took off again and flew out to phuoc long province which was occupied by provisional revolutionary government since pavn troops had captured it earlier in year and he was warmly received by pavn soldiers north vietnamese claimed that trung had been a vc agent since 1969 and was infiltrated into rvnaf where he served with fighter squadron of 3rd air force division trung later revealed that he was originally from ben tre province in mekong region where his father had served as district secretary of people s revolutionary party in 1963 trung s father was killed and his body was mutilated by south vietnamese police angered by death of his father trung vowed to take revenge on south vietnamese government so in 1969 he secretly joined vc after he had been accepted into rvnaf battle preparation for mission thumb right 250px captured a 37 fighter bombers were selected to be basis of vpaf quyet thang squadron in 1975 for their attack on tan son nhut air base prior to bombing of presidential palace north vietnamese general van tien dung and his field commanders had been discussing possibility of deploying units of vpaf to attack high value south vietnamese targets in support of pavn use of soviet mig 17 fighter was considered as vpaf pilots already had significant combat experience with type however moving migs from their bases in north vietnam was problematic south vietnamese defenses were falling much faster than anticipated there was simply little time in which to deploy migs in support of north vietnamese units encircling saigon as north vietnamese had captured a large number of u s made aircraft from rvnaf at pleiku and da nang air bases it was decided to use captured aircraft instead decision to use captured aircraft presented a challenge for vpaf because they lacked experience in flying u s made aircraft furthermore vpaf pilots were not proficient in english language most had trained on soviet equipment using russian language upon receiving news of trung s actions on 8 april general dung decided that trung would provide conversion training so that a group of vpaf pilots would be able to fly a 37 dragonfly type selected for an upcoming operation trung was sent out to da nang air base where he was joined by lieutenants tran van on and tran van xanh both former rvnaf pilots captured when da nang capitulated on 29 march trung xanh and on were tasked with translating manuals from english to vietnamese language as well as translating instructions on board a 37 into vietnamese on 19 april vpaf command was ordered to prepare for an operation in south vietnam so a group of pilots from 4th squadron of vpaf fighter regiment was selected to undertake conversion training in da nang and form a new squadron for operation selected group was led by upper captain nguyen van luc along with tu de tran cao thang han van quang and hoang mai vuong together with former rvnaf pilots trung and on group would form quyet thang determined to win squadron on 22 april vpaf pilots arrived at da nang air base and they began training on two a 37 aircraft that were restored to flying condition with support from trung on xanh and a few captured south vietnamese technicians in just five days vpaf pilots were able to independently fly a 37 without support from former rvnaf pilots as vpaf pilots were completing final phases of their conversion training vpaf command chose to attack tan son nhut air base in saigon on afternoon of 27 april pilots were flown out to phu cat air base in binh dinh province where major general le van tri commander of vpaf briefed them on upcoming operation tri also instructed pilots to ensure that their bombs should not hit civilian areas in saigon from original group of trainees luc de quang vuong trung and on were selected to take part in attack meanwhile on and xanh were also instructed to test fly five captured a 37 bombers which would be mainstay of quyet thang squadron on morning of 28 april quyet thang squadron became operational with luc as squadron s commander when it was transferred to phan rang air base attack at phan rang ab luc submitted squadron s plan of attack to vpaf command trung would lead formation in first aircraft because he was familiar with skies over saigon de would be positioned behind trung in second aircraft followed by luc in third vuong and on together in fourth and quang would pilot last aircraft in formation at around 16 05 on 28 april five a 37 bombers of quyet thang squadron each armed with four 250 pound bombs took off from phan rang and each aircraft flew between and apart from each other five aircraft formation flew at a height of just their first navigation point was vung tau from where formation would turn towards tan son nhut when squadron flew over bien hoa air base two rvnaf a 1 skyraiders were sighted conducting bombing sorties near area but they were not allowed to engage shortly after 17 00 formation was able to approach tan son nhut air base unchallenged as they were still wearing south vietnamese code numbers from about above target trung dived down on target but his bombs could not be released from pylons so trung was forced to pull his aircraft up again next in line was de who was able to drop his entire bomb load on target luc dived on target but he too experienced problems with weapons release system so only two bombs were dropped after last two aircraft piloted by vuong quang and on had successfully hit their targets they strafed aircraft on ground with gunfire trung and luc made another pass but again their bombs could not be released from pylon by that stage south vietnamese had already responded by firing their anti aircraft guns so luc ordered squadron to withdraw as trung made one final attempt at dropping his load using emergency mode several rvnaf force f 5s were scrambled to pursue attackers but they escaped without any damage on return trip quang led formation followed by luc de and vuong and on trung who had flown back for third bombing attempt was trailing rest of group as they flew over phan thiet they had to fly at a lower altitude to avoid mistakenly being hit by pavn anti aircraft weapons when formation came within of phan rang ab de was granted permission to land first because he only had about of fuel left squadron commander luc was next to land followed by vuong and on then quang trung who had led attack during mission was last aircraft to arrive back at base by 18 00 on 28 april all pilots of vpaf quyet thang squadron had landed at phan rang after completing north vietnam s first successful air attack against saigon during entire vietnam war aftermath attack on tan son nhut temporarily closed airport but it was soon returned to operation true extent of damage is unknown north vietnamese claimed that 24 aircraft had been
