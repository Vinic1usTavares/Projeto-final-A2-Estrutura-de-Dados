upsilon andromedae u andromedae abbreviated upsilon and u and is a binary star located approximately 44 light years from earth in constellation of andromeda system consists of an f type main sequence star designated u andromedae a officially named titawin and a smaller red dwarf four extrasolar planets designated upsilon andromedae b c d and e first three named saffar samh and majriti respectively are believed to orbit u andromedae a all four are likely to be jovian planets that are comparable in size to jupiter this was both first multiple planet system to be discovered around a main sequence star and first multiple planet system known in a multiple star system nomenclature u andromedae latinised to upsilon andromedae is system s bayer designation under rules for naming objects in binary star systems two components are designated a and b under same rules first planet discovered orbiting u andromedae a should be designated u andromedae ab though this more formal form is occasionally used to avoid confusion with a secondary star u andromedae b it is more commonly referred to as u andromedae b other planets discovered were designated u andromedae c d and e in order of their discovery in july 2014 international astronomical union iau launched a process for giving proper names to certain exoplanets and their host stars nameexoworlds an iau worldwide contest to name exoplanets and their host stars iau org 9 july 2014 process involved public nomination and voting for new names nameexoworlds process in december 2015 iau announced winning names were titawin for u andromedae a and saffar samh and majriti for three of its planets b c and d respectively final results of nameexoworlds public vote released international astronomical union 15 december 2015 winning names were those submitted by vega astronomy club of morocco star is named after berber form of name of in northern morocco medina old town of which is a unesco world heritage site planets honour 10th and 11th century astronomers ibn al saffar ibn al samh and maslama al majriti of muslim spain nameexoworlds approved names in 2016 iau organized a working group on star names wgsn to catalog and standardize proper names for stars in its first bulletin of july 2016 wgsn explicitly recognized names of exoplanets and their host stars approved by executive committee working group public naming of planets and planetary satellites including names of stars adopted during 2015 nameexoworlds campaign this star is now so entered in iau catalog of star names in chinese meaning heaven s great general refers to an asterism consisting of upsilon andromedae gamma andromedae phi 51 andromedae 49 andromedae chi andromedae tau andromedae 56 andromedae beta trianguli gamma trianguli and delta trianguli consequently chinese name for upsilon andromedae itself is activities of exhibition and education in astronomy tian wen jiao yu zi xun wang 2006 nian 7 yue 10 ri stellar system upsilon andromedae is located fairly close to solar system parallax of upsilon andromedae a was measured by hipparcos astrometry satellite as 74 12 milliarcseconds corresponding to a distance of 13 49 parsecs 44 light years upsilon andromedae a has an apparent magnitude of 4 09 making it visible to naked eye even under moderately light polluted skies about 10 degrees east of andromeda galaxy catalog of components of double and multiple stars and washington double star catalog wds both list two companion stars magnitude 12 6 263 110 away listed as component b and magnitude 10 3 f2 star tyc 2822 1 280 away listed as component c a fainter and closer star discovered in 2002 is confusingly referred to in discovery paper as u andromedae b even though that designation is also used for a different companion this 13th magnitude red dwarf is 55 from u andromedae a and is believed to be only one of companions physically associated at same distance and a projected separation of 750 au it has been added to wds as component d upsilon andromedae a upsilon andromedae a is a yellow white dwarf of spectral type similar to sun but younger more massive and more luminous according to its entry in geneva copenhagen survey star is around 3 1 billion years old and has a similar proportion of iron relative to hydrogen to sun at around 1 3 solar masses it will have a shorter lifetime than sun amount of ultraviolet radiation received by any planets in star s habitable zone would be similar to ultraviolet flux earth receives from sun x ray emission of upsilon andromedae a is low for a star of its spectral class this means that star may be moving or move soon out of main sequence and expand its radius to become a red giant star this is consistent with upper limits on age of this star upsilon andromedae a was ranked 21st in list of top 100 target stars for nasa s cancelled terrestrial planet finder mission red dwarf red dwarf companion has a spectral type m4 5v and is located at a projected separation of 750 au from primary star true separation between two stars is unknown because displacement along line of sight between earth and upsilon andromedae stars is unknown so this value is a minimum separation based upon its motion through space this is a common proper motion companion to primary it was discovered in 2002 in data collected as part of two micron all sky survey star is less massive and far less luminous than sun and its age seems to be consistent with that of system planetary system star rotates at an inclination of degrees relative to earth innermost planet of upsilon andromedae system was discovered in 1996 and announced in january 1997 together with planet of tau bootis and innermost planet of 55 cancri discovery was made by geoffrey marcy and r paul butler both astronomers at san francisco state university planet designated upsilon andromedae b was discovered by measuring changes in star s radial velocity induced by planet s gravity because of its closeness to parent star it induced a large wobble which was detected relatively easily planet appears to be responsible for enhanced activity in chromosphere of its star thumb right artist s conception of planets of upsilon andromedae even when first planet was taken into account there still remained significant residuals in radial velocity measurements and it was suggested there might be a second planet in orbit in 1999 astronomers at both san francisco state university and harvard smithsonian center for astrophysics independently concluded that a three planet model best fit data two outer planets were designated upsilon andromedae c and upsilon andromedae d in order of increasing distance from star both of these planets are in more eccentric orbits than any of planets in solar system including pluto web version upsilon andromedae d resides in system s habitable zone orbital parameters of this three planet system have been fully determined system is not coplanar with each other or with stellar rotation as in our solar system simulations shows that measured configuration of planets produces indeed stable orbits for at least 100 million years where planets b and d remain roughly coplanar general relativity is expected to have strong effects on planet b because it orbits at a distance of just 0 05 au from parent star apsides of planet c and d instead oscillates with time orbit of upsilon andromedae c thus returns to a nearly circular state every 9 000 years eccentricity of those planets may have arisen from a close encounter between outer planet and a fourth planet with result that third planet was ejected from system or destroyed such a mechanism could have been triggered by perturbations on orbit of companion star which arise from close encounters with other stars and from tidal field of milky way orbits of two inner planets seems to be shaped by tidal interactions while evolution of c and d orbits is secular existence of further planets too small or distant to detect has not been ruled out though presence of jupiter mass planets as close as 5 au from upsilon andromedae a would make system unstable however a fourth planet upsilon andromedae e was discovered in 2010 this planet seems to be in a 3 1 resonance with upsilon andromedae d other authors while confirming evidence for a fourth planet challenge values found since they use a data set inconsistent with others upsilon andromedae does not appear to have a circumstellar dust disk similar to kuiper belt in solar system this may be result of perturbations from companion star removing material from outer regions of upsilon andromedae a system see also 51 pegasi kepler 56 list of extrasolar planets psr 1257 12 notes references external links hr 0458 4125 category f type main
