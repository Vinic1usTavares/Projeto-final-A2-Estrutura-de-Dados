in 1896 by beginning of twentieth century however upstart american league al was looking to rival supremacy of nl and in 1901 lajoie and dozens of former national league players joined american league national league clubs contested legality of contracts signed by players who jumped to other league but eventually lajoie was allowed to play for connie mack s athletics during season lajoie set all time american league single season mark for highest batting average 426 one year later lajoie went to cleveland bronchos where he would play until 1915 season when he returned to play for mack and athletics while with cleveland lajoie s popularity led to locals electing to change club s team name from bronchos to napoleons naps for short which remained until after lajoie departed cleveland and name was changed to indians team s present day name lajoie led al in batting average five times in his career and four times recorded highest number of hits during several of those years with naps he and ty cobb dominated al hitting categories and traded batting titles with each other most notably coming in 1910 when league s batting champion was not decided until well after last game of season and after an investigation by american league president ban johnson lajoie in 1914 joined cap anson and honus wagner as only major league players to record 3 000 career hits he led nl or al in putouts five times in his career and assists three times he has been called best second baseman in history of baseball and most outstanding player to wear a cleveland uniform cy young said lajoie was one of most rugged players i ever faced he d take your leg off with a line drive turn third baseman around like a swinging door and powder hand of left fielder he was elected to national baseball hall of fame in 1937 early life lajoie was born on september 5 1874 in woonsocket rhode island to jean baptiste and lajoie elder lajoie was french canadian and had emigrated to united states upon arrival to u s he first settled in rutland vermont but then moved to woonsocket where lajoie youngest of eight surviving children was born throughout his childhood lajoie received little formal education elder lajoie who worked as a teamster and laborer died not long into younger lajoie s childhood which forced him and his siblings to work to support family lajoie dropped out of school to work in a textile mill he also began playing semi professional baseball for local woonsocket team under alias sandy because his parents did not approve of their son playing baseball he earned money as a taxi driver with a horse and buggy and locally was called slugging cabby when i told my father i had decided to take job he was very angry he shouted that ball players were bums and that nobody respected them but i was determined to give it a try at least one season lajoie later said he also received nickname larry from a teammate who had trouble pronouncing lajoie lajoie admired baseball players such as king kelly and charles radbourn when word of lajoie s baseball ability spread he began to play for other semi professional teams at 2 to 5 per game to in current dollar terms he also worked as a teamster he left woonsocket and his 7 50 per week in current dollar terms working as a taxi driver and joined class b new england league s fall river indians in 1896 lajoie played as a center fielder first baseman and catcher earning 25 weekly in current dollar terms he recorded 163 hits in 80 games and led team in batting average doubles triples home runs and hits lajoie was widely regarded as an outstanding prospect and indians owner charlie marston rejected an offer from pittsburgh pirates for lajoie in exchange for 500 in current dollar terms he was also scouted by philadelphia phillies and boston beaneaters major league career philadelphia phillies and athletics philadelphia phillies of mlb s national league nl purchased lajoie and teammate phil geier from fall river for 1 500 in current dollar terms on august 9 phillies manager billy nash originally went to fall river intending to sign geier only but obtained lajoie when team agreed to include him in their asking price author david jordan wrote a legend later grew up that geier was main target of nash s pursuit and that marston threw in lajoie in order to get phillies to pay 1 500 asking price this is hardly likely while geier was considered a good prospect lajoie was banging ball at a 429 clip in his first professional season was a fine fielder and had already been sought by several big league clubs nap lajoie clearly represented a financial asset to marston who did not give him away price phillies paid was a substantial sum for two minor leaguers in 1896 against washington senators on august 12 1896 lajoie made his major league debut he played first base and recorded a single ed delahanty was being considered to play first base position after dan brouthers retired delahanty however wanted lajoie to play first so he could return to his natural position of left field delahanty said to lajoie look sonny you tell boss you re a first baseman and you and me are gonna get along lajoie became team s first baseman and by end of season he and delahanty were roommates later in 1898 new manager george stallings moved lajoie to second base commenting that lajoie would have made good no matter where i positioned him lajoie hit 363 and led nl in slugging percentage in 1897 and doubles and rbis in 1898 he had a 378 batting average in 1899 though he played only 77 games due to an injury in 1900 he missed five weeks due to a broken thumb suffered in a fistfight with teammate elmer flick john rogers described as a penny pinching majority owner of phillies assured lajoie that he would make same salary as delahanty however lajoie discovered that while he was earning 2 600 in current dollar terms delahanty earned 3 000 in current dollar terms contracts for nl players were not allowed to surpass 2 400 rogers increased lajoie s pay by 200 but damage had already been done because i felt i had been cheated i was determined to listen to any reasonable american league offer lajoie said in 1901 newly created american league had attracted several of top players in competing national league to join its ranks rogers declined lajoie s request for an increase in salary and as a result lajoie jumped to crosstown philadelphia athletics owned by former phillies part owner benjamin shibe and managed by connie mack frank hough offered lajoie contract on behalf of mack hough offered me 24 000 in current dollar terms for four years you can bet i signed in a hurry lajoie said lajoie was considered first superstar to join newly formed al he was also first player whose yearly salary was for 4 000 in current dollar terms phillies opened their season and drew 6 000 fans a week later when we opened there were 16 000 in stands american league was here to stay lajoie later said lajoie s batting average that year was 426 it was originally recorded at 405 later changed to 422 before finally revised again to 426 batting average mark became all time al record after number was revised previously ty cobb and george sisler had been credited with having al s all time mark that same year in a game against chicago white sox clark griffith lajoie became second major leaguer to be intentionally walked with bases loaded in an 11 7 game after abner dalrymple in 1881 for 1901 season lajoie led majors in doubles 48 and led majors in hits 232 batting average 426 runs 145 on base 463 and slugging percentage 643 and total bases 350 his 125 rbis led al and his 14 home runs were a career best and his 48 doubles are a philadelphia athletics record mack said of lajoie he plays so naturally and so easily it looks like lack of effort author robert kelly writes 422 batting average of lajoie still stands as an al record to some degree however it is tainted 1901 season was first for al and level of competition was presumably evolving such questions however in no way cast doubt on extraordinary batting ability of second baseman thumb left lajoie c 1908 in april 1902 supreme court of pennsylvania overruled an earlier decision by court of common pleas and upheld reserve clause in contracts between players and nl clubs president of chicago national league club jim hart said state supreme court s decision had dealt a fatal blow to rival league and nl clubs have won a great victory phillies rogers obtained an injunction barring lajoie from playing baseball for any team other than his team however a lawyer discovered injunction was only enforceable in state of pennsylvania courts ruled reserve clause was not valid for players who signed with an al team mack responded by trading lajoie and bill bernhard to then moribund cleveland bronchos whose owner charles somers had provided considerable financial assistance to a s in early years lajoie was also pursued by charles comiskey owner of chicago white sox cleveland bronchos naps lajoie nicknamed frenchman and considered baseball s most famous player at time arrived in cleveland on june 4 and his play was immediately met with approval from fans bronchos drew 10 000 fans to league park in lajoie s first game bronchos record at time lajoie and fellow athletics teammate bill bernhard joined was 11 24 and improved to 12 24 after team s inaugural game with their new players a 4 3 win over boston americans team went on to finish 69 67 fifth in al for franchise s first winning record since al began as a league after his first season with bronchos lajoie s 378 average led all al players new york giants manager john mcgraw was rumored to want to sign lajoie but lajoie stated his intentions when he said for i intend to stick to cleveland for remainder of 1902 and most of 1903 lajoie and flick traveled separately from rest of team needing to avoid entering pennsylvania so as to avoid a subpoena only team they could legally play with inside state limits was phillies when naps went to play in philadelphia lajoie and bernhard would go to nearby atlantic city to help pass time issue was finally resolved when leagues made peace through national agreement in september 1903 which also brought formation of world series to begin 1903 season club changed its name from bronchos to naps in honor of lajoie after a readers poll result was released by cleveland press team was officially blues in their inaugural al season but changed to bronchos for 1902 season bronchos finished season 77 63 and lajoie finished his first full season with club again al s batting champion with a 344 average he also led league in slugging percentage 518 finished second in doubles 41 third in rbis 93 and tied for fifth in home runs 7 in off season he contracted pleurisy during 1904 lajoie received a suspension after he spat tobacco juice in an umpire s eye he later informally replaced bill armour as team s manager armour submitted his resignation on september 9 but as team captain lajoie had already been acting as naps field manager after season had concluded lajoie was officially named manager he still managed to lead majors with a 376 batting average as he recorded his second consecutive league batting title he also led majors in hits 208 doubles 49 rbis 102 and slugging percentage 546 lajoie forbade card playing and gambling from his players during regular season as a manager lajoie was also described as much too lenient with his players lajoie contracted sepsis from an untreated spike injury after a game in july 1905 dye from lajoie s stockings entered his bloodstream and led to blood poisoning a rule was put into place requiring white socks to be worn underneath a player s colored socks injury worsened and lajoie eventually came to games in a wheelchair amputation of affected leg was also discussed injury and illness kept lajoie out until august 28 when he began play again and returned as team s first baseman before season was over he also sustained an injury to his ankle from a foul tip during an at bat and missed remainder of season he continued to manage from bench he finished season having only appeared in 65 games a career low other than his rookie season when he was not called up until well after season had begun naps finished with a 76 78 record baseball historian bill james wrote of lajoie s higher than normal career putout total and importance to cleveland nap lajoie was not only team s superstar after 1905 he was also manager he was more than that hell team was actually called naps in his honor as if lajoie was team if lajoie was in habit of covering second base every play shortstop certainly wasn t going to tell him not to lajoie led majors in 1906 in hits 214 and doubles 48 and naps finished third in al again with a winning record 89 64 lajoie finished second in al to george stone in batting average slugging and on base percentage in 1906 he married myrtle smith and couple moved to a small farm outside cleveland in june of 1907 season lajoie s 296 average an average even now that scores of players would be glad to accept put him at risk for hitting below 300 for first time in his career he also missed 15 games due to a recurrence of sepsis which he contracted during 1905 season lajoie and naps first baseman george stovall got into an argument in a hotel lobby and stovall broke a chair over lajoie s head george didn t mean anything by it lajoie said and two maintained a working relationship he finished season with an average of 299 naps owner charles somers received a trade offer from detroit tigers for naps elmer flick and tigers ty cobb tigers manager hughie jennings called somers and told him he was offering trade because cobb was not getting along with several teammates somers decided to retain flick saying we ll keep flick maybe he isn t as good a batter as cobb but he s much nicer to have on team naps finished regular season in second place to tigers with a 90 64 record a half game behind tigers who finished 90 63 and were not forced to make up a rained out game in accordance with league rules lajoie was partly blamed for naps second place finish author fred described an instance during season between naps catcher nig clarke and lajoie clarke was newly married and asked lajoie for a day off so that he could go home lajoie refused clarke sulked and walked over to warm up pitcher addie joss on first pitch he stuck out a finger and ball broke it cleanly with blood streaming from his hand clarke waved it defiantly in front of lajoie now can i go home asked clarke he was out five weeks and cleveland lost pennant to detroit by half a game lajoie finished season tied for third most in hits 168 while cobb s batting average slugging and on base percentages and hit total led american league baseball historians have suggested managerial duties lajoie took on affected his offensive numbers lajoie s dissatisfaction with naps play worsened you can t win in major leagues unless you have players who know game we don t have time to teach and train youngsters up here our job is to win pennants not run schools he said franklin lewis sports writer and author wrote lajoie in spite of his marvelous fielding and tremendous batting was not exactly a darling of grandstand as a manager lajoie recommended to somers on august 17 1909 he find team a new manager although he wanted to remain on club as a player somers responded to lajoie by giving him more time to finalize his decision but when lajoie came back days later and announced same decision somers acted quickly to find a replacement lajoie later described decision to take on added duties as a player manager as biggest mistake of his career as he felt it negatively affected his play highest paid player in league he also offered a 10 000 in current dollar terms reduction in salary somers promoted naps coach deacon jim mcguire to manager team finished 71 82 while lajoie s 324 average was third in al and 33 doubles second naps finished 1910 71 81 but lajoie had one of his better seasons statistically as he led majors with a 384 average and 227 hits both categories bettered only in lajoie s 1901 campaign his 51 doubles a career high and 304 total bases led majors fourth and final time in his career he would lead majors in latter category lajoie missed significant parts of back to back seasons first in 1911 when he appeared in just 90 games stovall former naps first baseman replaced mcguire as club s manager and naps finished 80 73 lajoie was forced to sit out six weeks of 1912 season when he sprained his back in may during a practice session in chicago he played in 117 games on season an increase of 90 he played in one season before but cleveland who had hired joe birmingham as team s fifth manager since lajoie gave up role in 1909 finished 75 78 lajoie and joe jackson tied for team lead with 90 rbis he finished fourth in al with a 368 batting average in 1913 birmingham and lajoie had arguments in open including one incident in june when lajoie cursed birmingham openly to reporters after being benched during a batting slump lajoie hit 335 on year last time he would hit over 300 in his career only two other major league players had attained 3 000 career hits until lajoie hit a double on september 27 1914 and so joined cap anson and honus wagner in 3 000 hit club lajoie recorded hit off yankees pitcher marty mchale in a 5 3 naps win his 258 batting average for season however was lowest since he had joined majors in 1896 naps finished in last place in american league standings with a 51 102 record their worst record since joining league and franchise s lowest winning percentage 333 lajoie requested that somers trade him and club obliged selling lajoie to athletics for waiver price and in so doing lajoie returned to philadelphia philadelphia athletics following season 1915 lajoie returned to athletics when mack signed him to a contract in his first season back with athletics he finished with a 280 batting average but team ended season in last place with a 43 109 record 1916 season would be lajoie s last in majors in his final major league game he hit a triple to help athletics pitcher joe bush win his no hitter lajoie aged 41 years played in 113 games and finished with a 246 average philadelphia s season record was worse than previous season s franchise low record and finished in last place again with a 36 117 record athletics winning percentage 235 is franchise s worst winning percentage through 2012 season minor leagues and retirement in 1917 lajoie joined toronto maple leafs of international league as manager at age of 42 lajoie won league s batting title with batting average of 380 he appeared in 151 of 156 games and for first time in his career played on a team that won a pennant he later was signed by brooklyn dodgers for 3 000 in current dollar terms in march 1918 but contract was annulled by commissioner s office and made a free agent to which lajoie was well pleased later that same year he joined indianapolis indians of american association as player manager he helped lead team to a third place finish but season was impacted due to u s s involvement in world war i lajoie made his services available to draft board but they rejected his offer on december 27 1918 lajoie announced his retirement from baseball several years after his retirement a story in milwaukee sentinel talked of lajoie s ability to any pitcher lajoie faced pitcher red donahue who avoided pitching fastballs to lajoie after seeing him go 4 for 4 against a fellow pitching mate donahue instead made pitches on outside corner to which lajoie reached over and hit them with ease donahue then proceeded to aim a pitch at lajoie s head and he proceeded to hit a home run that s kind i eat he said rivalry with ty cobb right thumb nap lajoie on a 1911 american tobacco company baseball card for first part of 20th century lajoie and cobb s statistics rivaled each other like few other players in american league in 1908 honus wagner and lajoie recorded their 2 000th career hit baseball historian david anderson wrote nap lajoie reached milestone later in summer with even less hoopla in an age when individual records received little attention from press and were generally scorned by many players players overly worried about their individual stats were often unpopular with teammates modesty of wagner and lajoie over their achievements contrasted sharply with cobb s ambition and overriding interest in his individual numbers lajoie cobb rivalry reached a peak in 1910 when hugh chalmers of chalmers auto company a direct predecessor to modern day chrysler promised a chalmers 30 roadster to season s batting champion public became fascinated with daily statistics of lajoie and cobb in what became known as chalmers race sports bettors who by this time followed sport attentively also followed daily reports with interest cobb took final two games a doubleheader off against chicago white sox confident that his average was safe and would allow him to win al batting title unless lajoie had a near perfect final day going into final game of season cobb s average led lajoie s 383 to 376 lajoie and naps faced a doubleheader against st louis browns in sportsman s park cleveland s final two games of season after a sun hindered fly ball went for a stand up triple and another batted ball landed for a cleanly hit single lajoie had five subsequent hits bunt singles dropped in front of rookie third baseman red whose normal position was shortstop who was playing closer to shallow left field on orders it has been suggested of manager jack o connor in his second at bat of second game lajoie reached base on another bunt but runner on first base advanced according to rules of that time hit was scored a sacrifice and thus lajoie did not record an official at bat he finished doubleheader a perfect 8 for 8 and his batting average increased to 384 001 greater than cobb s mark although al office had not officially announced results lajoie began to receive congratulations from fans and players including eight of cobb s detroit tigers teammates most players in league preferred lajoie s personality to that of cobb s coach harry howell is reported to have said to game s official scorer e v parish to do well by lajoie howell was reported to have offered a bribe to parish which described in al stump s biography of cobb was a 40 in current dollar terms suit parish refused offer and resulting uproar ended in o connor and howell being banned from major leagues by al president ban johnson johnson had matter investigated and after having cobb s september 24 doubleheader statistics re checked discovered only first game of cobb s statistics had been scored but not second game in which he went 2 for 3 this put cobb s suggested actual batting average at 385 again ahead of lajoie s in end johnson ruled that lajoie s sacrifice bunt should have been recorded as a hit which would have allowed him to go 9 for 9 but that cobb s batting average was greater recording 196 hits in 509 at bats to lajoie s 227 hits in 591 at bats johnson asked chalmers if his company would award an automobile to each player to which he agreed initially lajoie refused car but eventually relented and accepted it cobb said i am glad that i won an automobile and am especially pleased that lajoie also gets one i have no one to criticize i know games were on square and i am greatly pleased to know that affair has ended so nicely lajoie said i am quite satisfied that i was treated fairly in every way by president johnson but i think scorer at st louis made an error in not crediting me with nine hits however i am glad that controversy is over i have greatest respect for cobb as a batter and am glad of his success sporting news published an article written by paul macfarlane in its april 18 1981 issue where historian pete palmer had discovered that while cobb s september 24 doubleheader was not correctly tabulated perhaps purposefully according to correct date second game s statistics were in fact included in next day s ledger thus incorrectly recording a second 2 for 3 performance from cobb which meant lajoie s average was greater author james vail wrote in 2001 to date it seems that no one knows for certain who won that 1910 batting title total baseball which is now official major league record lists both men at 384 in its seasonal section but its player register has lajoie at same number and cobb at 383 so even various editors of that source do not or cannot agree jon wertheim wrote in sports illustrated 100 years after event statistics for detroit players had been crossed out and nullified every detroit player that is except one ty cobb it takes something less than a detective to arrive at conclusion that at some point johnson or someone in league office anyway realized error and decided to conceal it legacy right thumb nap lajoie s plaque at national baseball hall of fame and museum lajoie ended his career with a lifetime 338 batting average his career total of 3 243 hits was second most in mlb history at time of his retirement behind only honus wagner s total 3 420 lajoie s 2 522 hits in american league was that league s record until cobb surpassed his mark he was among second group of players elected to hall of fame in 1937 and was later inducted on june 12 1939 when hall opened that same year lajoie obtained greatest number of votes as he led induction mates tris speaker 165 votes and cy young 153 with 168 votes 83 6 percent of ballots from baseball writers association of america lajoie led all second basemen in nl in putouts 1898 and al four times in his career 1901 1903 1906 and 1908 from 1906 1908 he led al in assists amongst second basemen he also led league in double plays six times in his career baseball historian william mcneil rates lajoie as game s greatest second baseman when combining both offensive and defensive impact bill james argues in last 20 years several statistical analysts have credited lajoie with immense defensive value this analysis is incorrect he was a competent fielder even a good fielder he was not a defensive superstar during spring training before 1928 season lajoie commented on 1927 new york yankees of course you could see a lot of loafing going on but if that club is greatest of all times you just know that we had a lot of clubs in my time who were world champions and didn t know it he died in daytona beach florida on february 7 1959 at age of 84 from complications associated with pneumonia he had fallen in autumn of 1958 and fractured his arm his wife had died earlier in 1951 in 1999 he ranked number 29 on sporting news list of 100 greatest baseball players and was a nominee for major league baseball all century team lajoie is mentioned in poem line up for yesterday by ogden nash footnotes major league baseball has not revised cobb s batting average which would then designate lajoie as 1910 batting champion sporting news wrote of statistical evidence showing cobb s 1910 season statistics had been tampered with and he was given two extra base hits but mlb commissioner bowie kuhn declined to announce lajoie winner both
