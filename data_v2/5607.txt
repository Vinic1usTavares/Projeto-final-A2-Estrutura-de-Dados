arthur treacher as clarence phelps butler e e clive as coroner s photographer production universal studios head carl laemmle jr was eager for james whale fresh from his great success with bride of frankenstein to direct dracula s daughter whale was idle waiting for irene dunne to finish work on magnificent obsession so she could begin work on whale s show boat wary of directing two horror films in a row whale instead convinced laemmle to buy rights to a mystery novel called hangover murders whale argued that same sort of audiences who went to horror films also went to mystery films and pointed to hit metro goldwyn mayer film thin man as evidence that a picture based on novel would be a success curtis p 254 laemmle agreed to buy rights for 5 000 only after extracting a promise from whale that he would direct dracula s daughter next curtis p 255 thumb left revelers drink champagne from a tureen with straws production code administration urged universal to curtail amount of drinking in film production code administration which had gone into effect just weeks after release of thin man and which restricted drinking of alcohol on screen disapproved of project even before a script was written pca head joseph breen forbade use of word hangover in title laemmle agreed and in mid august temporarily retitled project wild night before settling on remember last night in response to a survey of exhibitors curtis p 258 breen dispatched two representatives to meet with whale laemmle and studio censor harry zehner in an effort to reduce or eliminate film s reliance on drinking two men realized that most of alcohol use was required for plot and thus allowable under production code and whale promised to keep novel s ending in which tony and carlotta agree to quit drinking harry and doris malloy put together a 34 page treatment which laemmle approved in april pair completed their draft on may 20 1935 whale had dan totheroh re write dialogue and draft was ready for submission to pca on july 15 curtis p 256 when breen reviewed draft his objections centered on excessive alcohol use we take this opportunity of pointing out to you in regard to matter of treatment of drinking in this story that generally speaking it is presented in a light facetious acceptable amusing and desirable mode of behavior it is upon this that we feel rejection may be reasonably based breen quoted in curtis p 256 a revised script with drinking toned down slightly was submitted on july 24 same day whale started shooting remember last night was budgeted at 385 000 whale inserted lines that made fun of horror pictures a genre with which he no longer wished to be associated carlotta is shown jumping on a diving board flapping a towel and exclaiming look i m dracula s daughter and in another scene she says i feel like bride of frankenstein curtis p 257 shooting wrapped on september 14 whale was nine days over schedule and 75 000 over budget release and reception remember last night was cleared by pca on september 24 1935 and following previews in october opened on november 4 financially film was a failure that according to laemmle lost money for studio curtis p 259 critical reception was mixed hollywood reporter called film a murder mystery to kid all murder mysteries and a riot of comedy spots superimposed on a riot of crime detecting quoted in curtis p 258 whale reviewer found let himself go in a riotous directorial although less effusive new york times praised film as good minor fun and noted likeable pairing of young and cummings ed brophy edward arnold and arthur treacher were also singled out for praise however times concluded that remember last night should be enjoyed in moderation as halfwit behavior of in film may make viewer come away with feeling that one or two additional murders among madcap principals would have made long island a still better place to live in variety was strongly disapproving of film women are more than men and two of wives are on make it s all faintly unwholesome local censorship boards made numerous cuts to film long drinking party scene was cut as was part of a 30 second kiss between tony and carlotta that opened film censors also cut a line of dialogue delivered by louise henry in response to carlotta s declaration that marines had landed there ll be atrocities i want to be first film was never re released has never been released in any home video format and is rarely shown on television modern critical response has therefore been light although tom milne of time out new york dubbed film a delightful screwball parody of detective thriller whale s use of non sequiturs and unexpected stresses creates what is virtually a blueprint for style developed by robert altman in and after mash los angeles times reviewing film for a 1999 retrospective of whale s work found it to be an amusing trifle tossed off with considerable wit and skill by whale and pretty good fun if you re
