neighborhoods is sixth studio album by american rock band blink 182 released september 27 2011 through dgc records and interscope records their first album of new material in eight years longest gap between albums to date its recording followed band s breakup and later reconciliation due to conflicts within trio band entered an indefinite hiatus in 2005 and members explored various side projects after two separate tragedies regarding band and their entourage members of band decided to reunite in late 2008 with plans for a new album and tour it is last studio album to feature enema of state era lineup of band as founding member tom delonge was terminated from group in january 2015 band s studio autonomy tours managers and personal projects stalled recording process which lasted from shortly after band s february 2009 reunion to july 2011 band developed neighborhoods in separate studios and regrouped at various periods to record band s numerous delays in recording process resulted in band canceling a european tour and label setting a deadline for album to be due trio wrote lyrics regarding such subjects as isolation confusion and death band infused inspiration from each member s various musical tastes to form a unique sound that recalled their separate upbringings leading trio to compare album to separate neighborhoods neighborhoods was released to mixed reviews from critics some felt it was a natural evolution from band s previous releases while others found it stale and disjointed album debuted at number two on billboard 200 and up all night and after midnight were released as singles with both attracting modest success on billboard s alternative songs chart despite this neighborhoods did not sell as well as earlier releases and band would depart from interscope following fall group would later look back on their comeback album with divided feelings delonge would admit that recording methods perhaps created less unity within group background thumb right 250px following barker s near fatal plane crash delonge mailed barker this 2003 photo of trio aboard a submarine in middle east reminding him of who we were blink 182 announced on february 22 2005 that they would be going on an indefinite hiatus decision in reality a break up of group stemmed from internal band tension which had arisen in late 2004 during band s european tour guitarist and vocalist tom delonge expressed his desire to take a half year respite from touring in order to spend more time with family bassist and vocalist mark hoppus and drummer travis barker were dismayed by his decision which they felt was an overly long break following 2004 indian ocean earthquake delonge agreed to perform at music for relief s concert for south asia a benefit show to aid victims further arguments ensued during rehearsals rooted in band members increasing paranoia and bitterness toward one another delonge felt his priorities were mad different and breakdown in communication led to heated exchanges resulting in his exit from group during hiatus delonge formed space rock band angels airwaves while barker and hoppus continued playing together in 44 two events in late 2008 would lead to band s eventual reformation death of longtime producer jerry finn who suffered a cerebral hemorrhage and a near fatal plane crash involving barker and collaborator dj am immediately two incidents raised rumors of a possible blink 182 reunion hoppus was alerted about barker s accident by a phone call in middle of night and jumped on next flight to burn center delonge learned of crash via tv news at an airport while waiting to board a flight he landed and mailed a letter and two photographs to barker a photo of blink aboard a submarine in middle east and another of himself and his two kids one was do you remember who we were and other was this is who i am now delonge said delonge also commented that no matter what happened between himself and barker in past none of it matters when it comes down to somebody getting hurt hoppus first spoke on matter in a blog post in november 2008 writing that he hadn t had it in him to post adding that these past two months have been hardest times i can remember he also revealed that he delonge and barker had all spoken in aftermath barker quashed reunion rumors in december but noted that they had been getting along talk of a reunion commenced weeks after trio began speaking again after a two hour phone conversation between delonge and hoppus an arrangement was made for trio to meet up at hoppus and barker s los angeles studio in october 2008 delonge was first to approach subject of reuniting trio had in hoppus s words two gnarly heart to hearts during which three opened up tom had just kind of come out to los angeles for day recalled hoppus i remember he said so what do you guys think where are your heads at and i said i think we should continue with what we ve been doing for past 17 years i think we should get back on road and back in studio and do what we love doing eventually band appeared for first time on stage together in nearly five years as presenters at 51st grammy awards on february 8 2009 band s official website was updated with a statement to put it simply we re back we mean really back picking up where we left off and then some in studio writing and recording a new album preparing to tour world yet again friendships reformed 17 years deep in our legacy recording and production band began recording demos of new material in 2009 all three members brought song ideas that they worked on for years as band got back together barker said that trio immediately got inspired by practicing their old songs and listening to them again and they decided to record demos there were four demos done and only one was near completion up all night trio wanted to release it as a single then but quickly they realized that it was too ambitious to complete it before their reunion tour began in july sessions were stalled by summer 2009 reunion tour during which band reconnected musically and emotionally during tour barker got phone call that dj am had overdosed and died in new york which heavily affected him in addition to tragedy regarding dj am delonge was diagnosed with skin cancer following year but it eventually was cleared band did a large amount of writing before leaving on tour but upon completion of tour they took time off to take a couple of months and chill and do other stuff with intentions to regroup in 2010 in june and july 2010 band spent time at their rehearsal spot and their intention was to wrap up touring by september and stay in studio for rest of year until album was finished album sessions were to be partially documented in which was scrapped in 2012 left thumb barker later accused delonge seen here in 2011 of not caring about album or listening to its final mixes recording and release of neighborhoods was delayed multiple times recording s delay was due to way band chose to work in bits and pieces alone and together in a pair of california studios in addition to each member s busy schedules album was recorded at both delonge s studio in san diego and in los angeles by hoppus and barker recording in separate studios was delonge s idea and ideas were exchanged via e mail various engineers met up in person to trade files on hard drives although three musicians were rarely in same room while recording opting to work on their parts individually delonge asserted that method of recording was a more efficient way of working considering schedules not due to a lack of unity within band in addition barker was releasing a solo record delonge was involved in angels airwaves and hoppus had to fly to new york city once a week to film his television show hoppus on music record was band s first to be self produced due to death of long time producer jerry finn in 2008 not only did finn helm their last three studio albums but he served as an invaluable member of band part adviser part impartial observer he helped smooth out tensions and hone their sound i honestly still feel like he s in studio with us because for me personally everything that was about recording and being in a studio i learned from jerry said hoppus instead of a producer each band member had their own dedicated sound engineer with hoppus and delonge receiving help from longtime co production partners chris holmes and critter respectively delonge who was against using a producer after self producing most of his angels airwaves records described band situation as very democratic noting that he learned during recording process to let go and be okay with not being able to control everything hoppus attributed album s delay to band learning to work by themselves without finn and both delonge and hoppus expressed frustration during sessions at band s cabal of publicists managers and attorneys which delonge described as absolute diarrhea of bureaucracy a result of band s split was each members hiring his own attorney and during sessions of neighborhoods band had four managers later it was revealed that delonge and hoppus would go months without direct communication only speaking through their managers hoppus moved to london with his family late in recording process also complicating matters under pressure band released a statement in april that effectively rescheduled all european tour dates due to album s prolonged recording decision a hugely expensive one was protested by delonge but pushed forward by barker who felt trio had made commitments to only tour with new material biggest argument of recording process ensued which resulted in geffen records setting a july 31 deadline for record amid concerns about volatility of band explaining there would be penalties if album was not turned in on time delonge joked that we ll probably actually drive it to geffen president s house at two in morning and hand it through his bedroom window at last possible minute band as a whole only entered studio for one or two weeks following release of statement in spring with only three days dedicated to writing recording lasted through may and into summer and by time of july 31 deadline record was near completion and finally completed over august composition music and lyrics thumb right upright bassist vocalist mark hoppus shortly before album s release i couldn t write a happy song for this record he remarked stylistically neighborhoods has been described as alternative rock and pop punk pre release album was described by band as ambitious weird and expansive music of album was inspired by each musician s tastes delonge s contributions bear hints of arena and stadium rock barker infuses hip hop into his drum tracks and hoppus felt compelled by weird indie rock hoppus stated early on that a goal for album was to try many new things but to remain a catchy and poppy sensibility lyricism of album was influenced by heavy events in each member s lives during latter part of decade elements considered dark by hoppus band made sure to produce a few throwback songs recalling their sound in mid 90 s though delonge hoped to retain angst present in band s past work he wanted to deliver it in a package that s very modern using and formulas to launch you into different places with music that is not just three chord pop punk with riffs he later felt album was not progressive as he had wished i m thinking why don t we do this why don t we create these landscapes i think we should have been pushing ourselves and trying to push genre forward likewise barker felt delonge wanted their music to be derivative of groups such as u2 or coldplay commenting for us we were always like blink is blink man we want to sound like fucking blink 182 hoppus wrote lyrics dealing with breakdowns in communication and trust and tackled with themes of isolation and confusion but these lyrics were not specific to any of band s history hoppus struggled with writing upbeat happy songs for album and attributed to dark lyricism to heavy events occurring shortly before reunion mtv news called neighborhoods bleakest thing blink have ever done haunted by both real depression addiction loss and imagined noting constant lyrical mention of death in many tracks album mixes electronic flourishes of 44 and laser light grandeur of angels airwaves into what mtv news called a sound that recalls nothing so much as dark streets and black expanses mostly of suburban variety packaging and title title neighborhoods evolved out of trio discovering that each bring a very different aesthetic to band each like different neighborhoods in a city everybody in world thinks of something unique unto themselves when they hear word neighborhoods said hoppus to some it is a big city others a small town others suburbia everything world is wide exciting and very different that s what neighborhoods means to me album artwork for record was revealed on august 4 2011 featuring band name written atop a city skyline neighborhoods sleeve contains many names close to band including chloe delonge s pet labrador retriever ava and jon delonge s daughter ava elizabeth and son jonas rocket jack hoppus son landon alabama and ati barker s son daughter and step daughter g mike giant designer of cover and lastly a memorial to dj am 10 things you need to know about new blink album kerrang august 2011 p 6 songs ghost on dance floor opens album and is specifically about hearing a song you shared with someone that s passed track resonated with barker who called delonge one night because song affected him while listening to it because of death of dj am natives first arose from a tribal beat barker created in studio and song s title changed multiple times before settling on simplicity up all night is album s oldest song and dates to just after band s 2009 reunion when they grouped together and produced demos band returned to it multiple times over recording process each time making it heavier than before after midnight was one of four new songs birthed from a last minute writing session after band canceled their european tour barker s favorite track and originally titled travis beat was written in separate studios but composed and recorded together snake charmer initially titled genesis as a reference to book of genesis is based on biblical story of adam and eve it pre dates band s reunion and was a guitar riff delonge kept around to expand upon in future song s coda was composed by barker and engineer chris holmes hoppus composed two versions of heart s all gone one fast and one slow and ended up liking both so slower version serves as an interlude on album s deluxe edition wishing well was solely created by delonge and is what hoppus describes as epitome of album it s very catchy but lyrics are really really dark and a little depressing kaleidoscope arose when hoppus woke up with song s opening lyrics in his head which he expanded into a descendents ish classic punk song mentality behind it is being a slacker in 2011 hoppus said 20s and 30s malaise that is america right now it was also inspired by album s lengthy recording process and transformation of band this is home was originally titled scars to blame but changed considerably when hoppus took chorus and bridge and combined it with new lyrics written by delonge morphing it into what he described as an anthem for youthful abandon thumb 200px left drummer travis barker also recorded a solo album while making neighborhoods mh 4 18 2011 was a working title for a song that was to be named hold on and represents a combination of hoppus initials and date he wrote song however delonge convinced hoppus to keep original title because he thought it sounded cool likening it to a virus song was inspired by one occasion in which hoppus was idle at a stoplight when a helicopter flew over ahead casting a large shadow he began to think of war torn countries and impoverished areas in which circling helicopters are a way of life and wrote song to capture that mentality song is notable for being recorded without delonge s involvement with hoppus recording all of guitars in addition to his usual bass and vocals love is dangerous arose from a minimalist electronic ballad but gradually took on a heavier sound when combined with guitars hoppus described fighting gravity as a very strange song and highlighted its production he ran a drum machine through his bass amp and when volume was turned up it shook entire building causing a light fixture in control room to start shaking hoppus and holmes mic ed up fixture creating rattling heard near beginning even if she falls is an upbeat catchy love song that hoppus viewed as a positive note to end record on release and promotion thumb right wishing well uk radio promotional cd expectations for neighborhoods were described by alternative press as truly gigantic both within music industry and record buying mainstream mtv news called neighborhoods one of most anticipated albums of 2010 when album was scheduled for that year and then again as one of most anticipated rock albums of 2011 kerrang also called it one of most anticipated releases of 2011 and it was also featured on a list of spin 26 fall albums that matter most album title and release date were officially announced in july 2011 in preparation of deluxe edition band compiled ten tracks as well as three extras deluxe edition tracks are sequenced differently from standard version up all night was released as album s lead single on july 14 and band began streaming another new song heart s all gone through a dedicated website on august 4 second single from neighborhoods titled after midnight premiered on bbc radio 1 on september 6 2011 wishing well was released november 21 2011 as a promotional single to alternative radio exclusively in uk album leaked two weeks before its release despite being under a very high level of security hoppus commented to nme that he was surprised it took so long to leak and was relieved rather than annoyed that it had reading warm comments about album online blink 182 returned to interscope records to distribute album but found music industry landscape dramatically different since band s last effort label itself has no resources or capital to do what they used to delonge said in an interview with billboard they just have you locked up on a contract interscope since band s break up had greatly pared down its rock department in contrast to other labels blink 182 broke up at a heightened popularity period for pop punk but neighborhoods was released in an era for genre in which billboard described as lacking exciting mainstream representation in addition to falling sales for peer bands band approached sponsorships song releases and social media incorporation during rollout of neighborhoods social media such as facebook and twitter were present throughout each stage of album which hoppus believed allowed more direct access and control over band s music although delonge s revenue sharing online service was not involved in promotion of record band s personal business projects were integrated such as macbeth footwear and famous stars and straps retailers such as hot topic and interpunk com carried different colored vinyl editions of neighborhoods that included mp3 download cards band partnered with at t in order to promote album appearing in a national spot for htc status band also partnered with best buy which sold a uniquely colored htc status preloaded with band s music television ads through networks such as espn were explored week of release in addition hoppus and delonge appeared in a film festival for fan montage video of up all night honoring various internet fans through tongue in cheek categories critical reception neighborhoods received generally positive reviews from contemporary music critics at metacritic which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics album received an average score of 69 based on 18 reviews which indicates generally favorable reviews a pre release review from nme regarded neighborhoods band s best album calling it bravely progressive and noting dark lyricism and random experimentation mike diver of bbc music described album as unexpectedly great and while agreeing recording process gave some tracks a dislocated feel he concluded that neighborhoods could easily have been a disaster that it s not and actually a very successful endeavour is worthy of substantial praise chad grischow of ign called neighborhoods a startlingly great rock album in which band hits an artistic growth spurt summarizing it as most mature rewarding and best album of their career james montgomery of mtv news called long awaited decidedly dark comeback album a new transition for band calling neighborhoods a deep dark downright auto biographical effort absolutepunk staff writer thomas nassiff called neighborhoods a great record while awarding a score of nine out of ten he noted album s bleak and dark lyricism while describing album s sound as containing elements of trio s various side projects as well as a natural progression from their 2003 album nitsuh abebe of new york magazine deemed record one of those albums on which a group reunites as professionals and equals each having gone off and collected his own interests via side projects and then negotiates a sound that brings it all to bear no nonsense modern rock serious but unpretentious ambitious but full of same easy hooks as ever writing for allmusic stephen thomas erlewine remarked that neighborhoods is a different beast than any of cheerfully snotty early blink 182 albums as band picks up gloomy thread left hanging on its eponymous 2003 album yet it s far better to hear blink 182 grapple with adolescent angst via perspective of middle age than vainly attempting to re create their youth perhaps blink could stand to sharpen their words but it s better that they concentrated on their music creating a fairly ridiculous yet mildly compelling prog punk spin on suburbs here mikael wood of spin called album surprisingly and refreshingly low key but its self examination comparatively adrift with sound of their past commercial performance neighborhoods debuted at number two on billboard 200 with 151 000 copies sold in its first week album dropped to position 10 in its second week and fell out of top 20 soon afterward album also debuted at number one on both magazine s alternative albums and top rock albums charts number two on digital albums chart and number four on tastemaker albums internationally album performed best in canada and australia where album also debuted in number two position in new zealand album peaked at number three and album debuted at number six on uk albums chart and in germany despite this sales were not as smooth as group s label interscope had hoped according to billboard despite extended hiatus between albums neighborhoods failed to connect on same scale as earlier releases as of may 2016 it had sold 353 000 units in us in united kingdom album went silver certifying sales of 60 000 units and it was certified gold in australia for sales of 35 000 copies touring and aftermath thumb right

still suffers a fear of flying did not attend brooks wackerman drummer of bad religion at time filled in for barker s position for australian tour band has looked back on neighborhoods more recently with a divided reaction in 2012 delonge would concede that recording method originally his idea led to a loss of unity noting that e mails dictated majority of recording of record due to hectic schedules of band there s some songs on there that i love but for most part it was disconnected barker recalled it was like you do this part in your studio and then you re gonna play on it and send it back to me when we re not in studio together you don t have opportunity to gel off each other in addition barker was still recovering from his 2008 plane crash which made things difficult in studio dude i was still healing he told rolling stone i had scabs all over my body and was like a bloody mess it was just way too soon in 2015 following delonge s departure barker claimed delonge didn t even
