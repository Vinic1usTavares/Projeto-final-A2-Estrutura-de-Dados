her life if spider man gives him his marriage spider man and his wife mary jane watson agree and this part of their history is erased so that effectively they have never been married additionally demon erases world s collective memory of spider man s secret identity which had been exposed in civil war 2 storyline set stage for a restructuring of spider man titles resulting in cancellation of friendly neighborhood spider man and sensational spider man with amazing spider man revamped as a thrice monthly publication widely considered as worst spider man story of all time decision to abruptly end peter parker and mary jane s marriage generated outrage from fans and critics alike causing a heavy downward shift of sales from readership events of one more day were heavily panned upon series conclusion although artwork received praise publication history marvel comics editor in chief joe quesada felt dissolving peter parker and mary jane marriage and returning spider man to his roots was necessary to preserve longevity of character for next 20 or 30 years quesada said he and other previous editors in chief had long been seeking an opportunity to begin a new methodology in which to tell spider man stories but had not found a reasonable way to do so quesada said it s very easy to un marry a character or fix something like that you just do a huge universal retcon and say a few events in history didn t happen but that s really not way we do it here at marvel quesada found an opportunity to address this in events of 2007 civil war mini series which resulted in unmasking of spider man s identity to public thomas john rhett 2008 in english genies bottles one more day for spider man interview with joe quesada featured in spider man one more day by straczynski j michael quesada joe hardcover ed new york city marvel comics quesada knew j michael straczynski was planning to end his run as a marvel writer so he personally approached straczynski to propose one more day as his final project arrant chris 2008 in english one more day six amazing years a spider man storyteller interview with j michael straczynski featured in spider man one more day by straczynski j michael quesada joe hardcover ed new york city marvel comics ideas for one more day began to develop almost two years before its release at one of marvel s creative summits for creators and editors quesada straczynski brian michael bendis mark millar jeph loeb tom brevoort and axel alonso developed concept between them and ed brubaker and dan slott added more at next summit one more day was announced as concluding storyline of straczynski s run on amazing spider man in early 2007 and quesada was named as artist for storyline although quesada had become more selective in choosing projects to do as an artist since becoming editor in chief he felt compelled to do art for one more day because he felt very close to story and because since he had been talking about project for so long he felt he needed to put my money where my mouth is while no plot details were given marvel issued a promotional image in february that consisted solely of line what would you do with one more day against a background of spider webbing at a panel at san diego comic con in june 2007 joe quesada gave few details about story but described it as a peter mj story at same panel marvel editor tom brevoort announced that amazing spider man would become sole main spider man title and would be published three times a month due to quesada s known dislike of mary jane and peter parker s marriage fans began to speculate he intended to dissolve their marriage in one form or another quesada felt that 1987 s wedding story happened due to an editorial decision and that jim shooter mirrored events stan lee had planned for spider man comic strip in order to maximize any publicity generated straczynski surprised many when he publicly revealed there s a lot that i don t agree with and i made this very clear to everybody within shouting distance at marvel especially joe quesada there was a point where i made decision and told joe that i was going to take my name off last two issues of omd arc eventually joe talked me out of that decision because at end of day i don t want to sabotage joe or marvel and i have a lot of respect for both of those quesada explained this disagreement with straczynski stating that their rift was primarily over methodology of how to erase peter and mary jane s marriage but straczynski was on board with editorial mandate of undoing parkers marriage various marvel writers including brian michael bendis mark millar ed brubaker and incoming amazing spider man writer dan slott had a hand in developing story during course of story s development quesada claims that he and straczynski made plans to resurrect gwen stacy alongside harry osborn in final chapter this plot twist was discarded after numerous marvel editors and writers lobbied for character to remain dead according to quesada straczynski s original script for storyline s fourth issue involved changes to continuity going as far back as 1971 peter would have helped harry osborn get into rehab for his drug addiction immediately which would have allowed a number of rewrites mary jane would have remained in a relationship with harry gwen would not have been killed and ultimately peter s marriage to mary jane would not have taken place quesada realized that these changes would have far reaching consequences for both historical and forthcoming storylines so he made decision to change straczynski s story while peter and mary jane were to have remained a couple for purposes of back story they were simply not a married couple quesada also described one more day as an emotional climax of sorts and resolution for relationship between peter parker and tony stark who had developed a father son like bond during civil war storyline however quesada hinted paths of two characters could cross again in future due to planned storylines for iron man thumb left 180px co writer j michael straczynski straczynski disagreed with direction series ultimately took quesada answering questions for comic book resources said every story that happened in spider man canon still counted with only change being that due to world s newly revised memories peter and mary jane did not marry due to some unknown incident and official unmasking of his identity to public during 2007 civil war mini series has been forgotten a back and forth developed between quesada and j michael straczynski in separate interviews and messages with straczynski outlining some of his original plans for retcon and conversations he had with quesada about storyline quesada said we re committed to preserving as much of these stories as is humanly possible but he added changing of certain elements is inevitable for example he sees storyline in which mary jane was pregnant as never having happened also spider man lost organic webshooters that he gained in avengers disassembled storyline and other spider like powers that he gained in 2005 2006 storyline other quesada commented that in removing those powers and bringing back spider man s mechanical webshooters he was returning an element that he felt needed to be brought back into peter s world and that mechanical webshooters demonstrate peter s ingenuity and overall smarts quesada sees peter s making a deal with devil as a villain mephisto taking advantage of someone at his weakest moment this he feels is a better resolution than peter and mary jane getting divorced which would indicate they gave up on their love that their life in love together was so awful so stressful so unfulfilling that they had to raise a red flag and walk away from it they quit on their marriage and even more tragic they quit on each other instead we had them make a deal with devil cause that isn t as bad quesada went on to say peter and mj didn t quit on their love they sacrificed it to save a life that to me is a pretty heroic story release and delays four issues that comprised one more day were originally scheduled to ship weekly in august 2007 story encountered delays due to quesada s art duties conflicting with his job as editor in chief sensational spider man vol 2 41 was rescheduled for release in late october and

daughter but she will never exist because of their decision this future daughter is may mayday parker mayday is baby that peter parker and mary jane had at end of clone saga from 1990s and would grow

wakes up alone in bed once again living with aunt may he attends a party being held for his best friend harry osborn previously thought to have died in spectacular spider man 200 who introduces lilly hollister and carlie cooper peter glimpses mary jane sadly leaving party guests all toast to a brand new day reception one more day was panned by fans and critics ign reviewer jesse schedeen described amazing spider man 545 as undoubtedly worst comic marvel published in 2007 and a deus ex machina of highest order he did admit that writer straczynski had a great handle on peter mary jane dynamic making their potentially final moments mean something and that quesada s artistic style made sense given dark tone however he also dismissed story as infuriating and downright disrespectful to anyone who has come to love spider man comics over years ign published two additional take reviews for amazing spider man 545 bryan joel said that he d been a vocal supporter of brand new day but summarized omd story as flip weightless and painfully brief richard george stated that one more day could prove to be best example of editorial influence gone horribly horribly wrong and in trying to preserve appeal of peter parker joe quesada has actually managed to fundamentally undermine character both joel and george agreed with their colleague in complimenting quesada s artwork tim marchman of wall street journal stated that having spider man make a deal with devil like mephisto is rough equivalent of having z movie director uwe boll film a studio funded prequel to martin scorsese s taxi driver marchman tim may 25 2012 worst comic book ever while superheroes dominate box office medium that birthed them has moved on wall street journal spider man co creator stan lee praised storyline and what he perceived as courage its creators showed in so drastically changing a popular and well established character lee said changes are needed to keep a series fresh and compared criticism from fans to backlash marvel comics received when peter parker and mary jane watson married in first place spider man newspaper strip adopted one more day retcon in its version of brand new day along with wedding one of just three stories to appear in both spider man comic book and newspaper strip but reader reaction to erasing of peter and mary jane s marriage was so negative that lee who wrote strip opted to conclude story by revealing that it was in fact a bad dream as such peter remains married to mary jane in newspaper strip continuity in a roundtable review at newsarama j caleb agreed that spider man was easier to relate to while young and single but that retconning marriage of spider man was unnecessary due to existence of titles such as ultimate spider man and marvel adventures spider man he found story confusing wondering how this retcon made sense in larger marvel universe as spider man played important roles in new avengers and civil war kevin claimed you can feel editorial mandate dripping from this and called story utterly ridiculous while lucas siegel criticized quesada s decision to have heroic peter parker make a deal with devil for selfish reasons richard renteria felt that story s conclusion was a missed opportunity to add a new layer of guilt to peter s already rocky life by allowing may to finally have send off she deserves while troy brownfield felt that storyline damaged marvel continuity and spider man s decision was selfish and childish not to mention a big middle finger to idea of marriage in comics he speculated preferable endings to story before concluding as it stands peter mj may and readers all got a raw deal a more positive view came from brandon thomas who felt that one more day was an incredibly well told story he praised writing in particular morally ambiguous decision peter has to make and way he and mary jane deal with it together as well as quesada s art which he felt set tone of guilt regret and despair in regards to change made in spider man canon he said peter parker being married really isn t a vital component of mythos and that it allowed marvel to make big sweeping changes to bring things slightly more into focus and back on message thumb left joe quesada co writer and penciller wizard felt his artistic decisions enhanced series wizard praised artwork specifically way quesada differentiated visually between dark and light tones before and after retcon however they felt entire set up and execution just doesn t make sense and failed to empathize with characters and their decisions they criticized use of magic in a largely science based book calling it biggest cheat since dallas they also felt that concept of making spider man more accessible was undermined by new and unfamiliar characters in their coverage of storyline uk television s channel 4 news also compared reaction to one more day to that of dallas claiming this controversial issue of comic has been flying off shelves but reaction from readers has been venomous channel 4 speculated that reason for storyline was to make comics more similar to financially successful films and merchandise comic book historian peter sanderson criticized story for using a supernatural element to retcon marriage and not maturely dealing with issue of divorce arguing writers had forgotten stories where spider man dealt with his causing death of uncle ben drugs and child abuse he wrote i expect there are people who are professional comics writers and editors and people who will someday become professional comics writers and editors who are outraged that marvel had spider man make a deal with devil and these present and future writers and editors will be determined to undo it we shall see whether it takes twenty years this time or much less he found story better than clone saga in respect that it altered an aspect of canon instead of erasing it entirely he also criticized idea of a hero making a deal with one as evil as mephisto effectively devil direct sales estimates for initial month of publication for first issue of storyline amazing spider man 544 was 146 215 putting it in second place after world war hulk this dropped to 110 405

entitled spider man new status quo which established new continuity of spider man retcon brings back harry osborn from dead in this new continuity instead of having been dead he had been living in europe for many years and explains that although spider man unmasked himself during events of civil war storyline no one remembers who was behind mask although quesada would initially take position that changes to timeline did not have to be explained since they were result of magic subsequent writers would in short order provide detailed in continuity explanations for changes in 2010 quesada wrote a sequel storyline one moment in time this story established that only actual change mephisto wrought upon timeline was allowing a criminal to escape custody causing a butterfly effect that prevented peter and mary jane s marriage as peter was delayed in reaching wedding prompting peter and mj to reconsider marriage revealing secrets of spider man s marriage ign april 18 2010 storyline also established that may was saved by doctor strange despite strange saying during one more day that it was beyond his power to save her who also worked with iron man and mister fantastic to create a mass mind wipe across globe to protect peter s identity using extremis as a dispersal system to simultaneously erase spider man s identity and establish a psychic blindspot that prevents anyone from realising that peter parker is spider man regardless of evidence they might discover unless peter is unmasked in front of them although this blindspot was lost during events of spider island storyline in which peter used his powers publicly peter explained this by saying that he was one of many people infected with a virus that gave them spider man s powers strange noting that this loophole means that people can now deduce peter s identity even if they won t remember peter s prior unmasking 2015 miniseries amazing spider man renew your vows which ties into secret wars storyline depicts spider
