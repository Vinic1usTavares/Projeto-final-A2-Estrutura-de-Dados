groening prefers that animals in cartoons act realistically santa s little helper s initial appearance on simpsons was in first episode of series simpsons roasting on an open fire which aired on dec 17 1989 since then he has become a recurring character simpsons creator matt groening told tv guide in 2000 that we staff painted ourselves into a corner with our christmas episode once we wrote dog into show we were stuck with him name santa s little helper was chosen because according to writer al jean in same tv guide article we needed a name that would inspire homer to bet on him an omen a christmas name since he was betting on christmas eve but at that point nobody was thinking long term we weren t considering what might happen in ten years when we ve got to use this name name is also a spoof of rolling stones song mother s little helper although simpsons roasting on an open fire was first episode of series to air on tv it was eighth episode produced by staff it was chosen to air first because there were animation problems with others jean told houston chronicle in 2001 that after first episode was broadcast and next seven didn t have dog people wondered why he also said in 2003 that staff enjoyed first episodes that centered on him particularly simpsons roasting on an open fire which is reason that more episodes about him were written writer john swartzwelder has noted that staff members of show write character homer in same way that they write santa s little helper both are loyal both have same emotional range and both will growl and possibly snap if you try to take their food although animals in cartoons often behave with semi human awareness groening said on dvd audio commentary for episode two dozen and one greyhounds that he prefers animals in cartoons to behave exactly way they do in real life as a result santa s little helper is depicted in this way on show there have however been some exceptions for gags but most of time staff of simpsons tries to keep animals acting realistically several journalists have commented on greyhound s lack of intelligence in an article that compared simpsons to animated series family guy todd camp of fort worth

skittish fans of real life breed will paint a different picture of dogs that are peaceful affectionate and not given to drooling panting some ideas for episodes featuring santa s little helper come from reality plot of dog of death was based on swartzwelder s experiences with his own dog which had also suffered from bloat however unlike events in episode swartzwelder s dog did not receive treatment as operation was too expensive and dog was too old gold coast bulletins ryan ellem commented in 2005 that simpson family s dilemma with cost of veterinary procedure is a realistic dilemma faced by many families who own dogs other episode ideas come from popular culture for example santa s little helper fathering 25 puppies in two dozen and one greyhounds is a parody of disney film one hundred and one dalmatians and mr burns technique of brainwashing him into an attack dog in dog of death parodies a clockwork orange susan mchugh who teaches theories of animals literature and culture at university of new england wrote in her 2004 book dog that remaining loyal to his unlikely saviours boy bart and his father homer this greyhound has prompted satires of contemporary dog culture from barbara woodhouse s authoritarian training methods in bart s dog gets an f to lassie s flawless service to status quo in canine mutiny sounds thumb upright dan castellaneta currently voices santa s
