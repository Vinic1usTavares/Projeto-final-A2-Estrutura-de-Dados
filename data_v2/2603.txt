round ribbontail ray taeniura meyeni is a species of stingray in family dasyatidae found throughout nearshore waters of tropical indo pacific as well as off islands in eastern pacific it is a bottom dwelling inhabitant of lagoons estuaries and reefs generally at a depth of reaching across this large ray is characterized by a thick rounded pectoral fin disc covered by small tubercles on top and a relatively short tail bearing a deep ventral fin fold in addition it has a variable but distinctive light and dark mottled pattern on its upper surface and a black tail generally nocturnal round ribbontail ray can be solitary or gregarious and is an active predator of small benthic molluscs crustaceans and bony fishes it is aplacental viviparous with embryos sustained by yolk and later histotroph uterine milk secreted by mother up to seven pups are born at a time although not aggressive if provoked round ribbontail ray will defend itself with its venomous tail spine and it has been responsible for at least one fatality it is valued by ecotourist divers and recreational anglers this slow reproducing species is threatened by commercial fishing both targeted and as bycatch and habitat degradation across much of its range as a result international union for conservation of nature iucn has assessed it as vulnerable taxonomy and phylogeny as taeniura meyeni round ribbontail ray was described by german biologists johannes peter muller and friedrich gustav jakob henle in their 1841 systematische beschreibung der plagiostomen based on two syntypes collected from mauritius however this species is better known under name taeniura or which was applied by dutch ichthyologist pieter bleeker to a juvenile specimen from java in a 1953 volume of scientific journal natuurkundig tijdschrift voor nederlandsch indie other common names for round ribbontail ray include black spotted ray black blotched stingray black spotted stingray fantail ray fantail stingray giant reef ray blotched fantail ray and speckled stingray in australia it is one of several species referred to as bull ray a minority of authors place this species with river stingrays in family potamotrygonidae preliminary morphological examination has suggested that round ribbontail ray is more related to dasyatis and indo pacific himantura than to congeneric bluespotted ribbontail ray t lymma which is closer to amphi american himantura h pacifica and h schmardae and river stingrays description thumb upright 1 2 left alt overhead view of a stingray on reef showing its nearly circular shape characteristic features of round ribbontail ray are its rounded thick disc and mottled coloration round ribbontail ray has a thick pectoral fin disc wider than it is long with a smoothly rounded outer margin eyes are of medium size and are followed by larger spiracles there is a short and broad curtain of skin between oval nostrils with a finely fringed trailing margin mouth is wide and curved with faint furrows at corners there is a row of seven papillae on floor with outermost pair smaller and set apart from others there are 37 46 tooth rows in upper jaw and 39 45 tooth rows in lower jaw teeth are small with a deep groove across crown and are arranged in a dense quincunx pattern into flattened surfaces thumb camouflaged round ribbontail ray showing granules and tubercles on upper surface pelvic fins are small and narrow tail is relatively short not exceeding width of disc and bears one rarely two long serrated stinging spine on upper surface base of tail is broad past spine tail rapidly thins and bears a deep ventral fin fold that runs to tail tip upper surface of disc and tail are roughened by a uniform covering of small widely spaced granules there is also a midline row of sharp tubercles on back with two shorter rows alongside first of these tubercles develop at a length of around over shoulders and in single midline row dorsal coloration is light to dark gray brown gray or purplish becoming most intense towards fin margins with a highly variable pattern of irregular darker mottling and white speckles or streaks tail past spine including fin fold is uniformly black while underside is creamy white with darker fin margins and additional dots young rays are more plain in coloration than adults one of largest stingray species round ribbontail ray can grow to across long and in weight distribution and habitat thumb alt a stingray swimming over coral rubble and sand round ribbontail ray frequents sandy patches near coral reefs round ribbontail ray has a wide distribution in indo pacific region it is found from kwazulu natal in south africa northward along east african coast to red sea including madagascar and mascarenes from there its range extends eastward through indian subcontinent to southeast asia and micronesia occurring as far north as korea and southern japan and as far south as australia where it is found from at least reef off western australia to stradbroke island off queensland including lord howe island in easternmost portion of its range it has been reported from cocos island and galapagos islands with individuals possibly dispersing as far as central america bottom dwelling in nature round ribbontail ray is typically found close to shore at a depth of though it has been reported anywhere from surf zone to a depth of it favors sand or rubble bottoms in shallow lagoons or near coral and rocky reefs and may also enter estuaries biology and ecology thumb upright 1 2 left alt side view of a stingray resting on a patch of sand beneath a coral ledge round ribbontail ray is relatively inactive during day often resting on sand near reef structures round ribbontail ray has nocturnal habits and rests motionless for much of day often near vertical structures in caves or under ledges it may be solitary or form small to large groups this ray is frequently shadowed by one or more jacks or cobia these smaller fishes may feed on food stirred up by ray s activities or use ray s body as cover for approaching their own prey round ribbontail ray hunts for bivalves crabs shrimps and small bony fishes on bottom when feeding it adopts a characteristic posture in which it presses margin of its disc against bottom and takes in water through its spiracles which it blows through its mouth to uncover prey buried in sediment this species may fall prey to larger fishes such as sharks and marine mammals when threatened it raises its tail over its back so that spine faces forward and waves it back and forth known parasites of this species include monogenean spinosum dendromonocotyle and n and nematode echinocephalus overstreeti little information is available on life history of round ribbontail ray like other stingrays it is aplacental viviparous unborn embryos are initially sustained by yolk which is later supplemented by histotroph uterine milk containing proteins lipids and mucus produced by mother reproductive aggregations numbering in hundreds have been observed at cocos island shortly after onset of la nina which brings cooler temperatures during these periods a single female may be pursued by dozens of males females bear litters of up to seven pups each measuring across and long off south africa birthing may take place in summer males attain sexual maturity at a disc width of maturation size of females is unknown human interactions thumb alt overhead view of a stingray swimming just beneath surface in very shallow water close to a beach a round ribbontail ray in maldives where it is a valuable ecotourist draw round ribbontail ray is not aggressive and has been known to approach and investigate divers however if harassed it can inflict a severe wound with its venomous tail spine this species has been responsible for at least one recorded fatality of a diver who was stabbed while attempting to ride ray round ribbontail ray is popular with ecotourist divers because of its size and spectacular appearance although displayed in public aquariums it is not hardy and 81 days is longest one has been kept in captivity international union for conservation of nature iucn has assessed round ribbontail ray as vulnerable it cannot withstand heavy fishing pressure due to its low reproductive rate and there is widespread degradation of its coral reef habitat including from agricultural runoff and destructive fishing practices such as blast fishing this species is caught by commercial and fisheries throughout its range using line gear and trawls one region where it is heavily pressured is in indonesian waters where it and other large rays are taken intentionally and otherwise by tangle longliners and trawlers operating off java bali new guinea and lombok all landed individuals are brought to market for human consumption off south africa round ribbontail ray is captured incidentally by prawn trawlers on offshore banks but is not utilized because of its size and strength it is also prized by sport anglers who usually release it unharmed south africa sets a recreational bag limit of one ray per species per person per day and does not allow spearfishing for this species in australian waters this ray has been assessed as of least concern although it is caught and discarded by prawn trawlers this mortality has been reduced by mandatory installation of turtle excluder devices teds furthermore a portion of its australian range lies within great barrier reef marine park this species has also been listed under least concern in maldives where due to tourist value of rays government has created protected marine reserves and banned export of rays in 1995 and ray skins in 1996 references external links taeniura meyeni round ribbontail ray at
