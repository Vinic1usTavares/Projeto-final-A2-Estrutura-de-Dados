commented her first or second day of shooting was opening sequence when others watched oceanic 815 fall out of sky when she first met actor matthew fox they briefly introduced themselves but most of their initial conversation was in regard to script and their characters mitchell found this helpful while shooting premiere s scenes since then they knew other as their characters and not as matthew and elizabeth scene in which jack yells at juliet and she responds no jack i think you re stubborn was used as her audition scene one of others amelia was played by elderly julie adams who was protagonist in creature from black lagoon previous guest actors william mapother julie bowen m c gainey brett cullen and john terry made brief appearances in episode premiere marked first appearances

michelle rodriguez ana lucia cortez and cynthia watros libby were no longer credited as main characters after each of their characters were written out at end of previous season writing co creators and executive producers damon lindelof and j j abrams wrote premiere s teleplay based upon a story by lindelof episode was abrams first lost writing credit since pilot they laid out third season with idea of us versus them carlton cuse a showrunner explained and who is us and who is them i mean i think we all tend to objectify people who we don t know much about and i think that s audience s view of others right now they are bad they are malevolent force on island but over course of stories we re going to be telling this season on show we expect audience s view of others to change a lot opening sequence of episode was meant to replicate same idea of season 2 s premiere man of science man of faith where what seems to be a flashback is instead set on a new part of island director jack bender questioned what jack s goal was when he pulled on chain but lindelof told him not to worry because fox will sell it and he did lindelof described when jack attacks his father at aa meeting as pot committed it basically means you put so much money on bluff you can t fold your cards scene with kate in a dress was inspired by raiders of lost ark where gives a dress for marion to wear and was intended to make tom boyish kate feel vulnerable title inspired by charles dickens eponymous novel refers to reveal of another city on island with place where others live in addition to castaways beach camp episode has only three characters of second season s main cast jack kate and sawyer lindelof later described this limited scope as a mistake when audience is away from show for that long they want to see everybody causing following season openers to have scenes with most of main characters in episode tom tells kate that she is not his type this comment resulted in online discussion in regard to tom s sexual orientation and lindelof and cuse hinted that a lost character would later be outed gainey joked if kate s not your type you re gay and began playing character as such elliot preston steve morrison 2007 02 22 preston and steve show retrieved on 2008 12 26 after broadcast of meet kevin johnson lindelof and cuse confirmed that line from third season premiere is an allusion to tom s sexuality but felt that it needed to be explicitly confirmed in show although lindelof noted that confirmation scene in meet kevin johnson was not subtle to say least beginning of episode featured a scene where juliet and amelia discuss ben s feelings for juliet which was shot but deleted this scene was later made into twelfth lost missing pieces envelope filming exterior of hydra was shot in an abandoned theme park which art director andrew murdock thought it fit as a location for kind of blocky 80 s style architecture where everything was aged industrial and a little bit larger and a little bit unusual opening sequence features petula clark s downtown a song that would later be used in another third season episode featuring juliet another song heard in premiere moonlight serenade by glenn miller was first used in season two episode long con lindelof has stated songs they choose for lost were often inspired from his childhood when his mother would vacuum to music on

flashbacks writing previously jack has been written as white knight and reluctant hero who everyone looked to in their time of need more chinks they show in jack s armor better more human he becomes he called juliet a promising new character who will hopefully add a new dimension to others this season and concluded his review by calling episode a solid season opener robert bianco from usa today praised opening scene and called episode a fine start for a great series but with reservations bianco wished jack would win one again for team and was fearful that lost could eventually become like alias a series that became so entranced by its puzzle and its villains that it let main characters vanish behind them on a list of lost episodes los angeles times ranked a tale of two cities number 66 out of 113 episodes explaining it was not bad introduction of juliet is a killer and jack raging against others is fun but many of big revelations ben s name for example aren t very well handled on a similar list ign ranked episode at number 38 they called opening one of show s characteristic fake outs and jack s flashbacks not nearly as interesting as his first encounters with juliet matthew fox
