hd 217107 b is an extrasolar planet approximately 65 light years away from earth in constellation of pisces fish planet was discovered orbiting star hd 217107 approximately every seven days classifying planet as a hot jupiter because of planet s somewhat eccentric orbit scientists were able to confirm another planet within system hd 217107 c discovery it was found by detecting small variations in radial velocity of star it orbits caused by tug of its gravity a study of radial velocity of hd 217107 carried out in 1998 revealed that its motion along line of sight varied over a 7 1 day cycle period and amplitude of this variation indicated that it was caused by a planetary companion in orbit around star with a minimum mass slightly greater than that of jupiter planet s mean distance from star is less than one fifth of mercury s distance from sun indication of second planet while most planets with orbital periods of less than 10 days have almost circular orbits hd 217107 b has a somewhat eccentric orbit and its discoverers hypothesized that this could be due to gravitational influence of a second planet in system at a distance of several astronomical units au confirmation of existence of a second planet hd 217107 c followed in 2005 see also hd 217107 hd 217107 c references external links category exoplanets discovered in 1998 category exoplanets category giant planets category hot jupiters category pisces constellation category exoplanets detected by radial velocity
