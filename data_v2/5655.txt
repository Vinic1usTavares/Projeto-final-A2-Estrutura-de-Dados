leader was a class of experimental 0 6 0 0 6 0 articulated steam locomotive produced in united kingdom to design of innovative engineer oliver bulleid leader was an attempt to extend life of steam traction by eliminating many of operational drawbacks associated with existing steam locomotives it was intended as a replacement for ageing fleet of m7 class tank engines still in operation on southern railway sr design work began in 1946 and development continued after nationalisation of railways in 1948 under auspices of british railways br leader project was part of bulleid s desire to modernise steam locomotive based on experience gained with southern railway s fleet of electric stock bulleid considered that attitudes towards labour intensity of steam operation had changed during post war period favouring dieselisation and electrification in an effort to demonstrate continued potential of steam bulleid pushed forward boundaries of steam power allowing it to compete with diesel and electric locomotives in terms of labour saving and ease of operation design incorporated many novel features such as use of thermic siphons bogies and cabs at each end of locomotive resulting in its unique for a steam locomotive modern diesel like appearance several of its innovations proved to be unsuccessful however partly accounting for project s cancellation in early 1950s five leader locomotives were begun although only one was completed operational locomotive was trialled on former southern railway network around brighton problems with design indifferent reports on performance and political pressure surrounding spiralling development costs led to all locomotives of class being scrapped by 1951 background basis of leader originated from a 1944 review of southern railway s steam locomotive fleet resulting in a southern railway design brief which called for a high powered locomotive requiring little maintenance to replace ageing fleet of m7 class tank engines brief also stipulated that locomotive would be used on both passenger and freight trains requiring high route availability bulleid proposed an initial design based on his sr q1 class locomotive which had proved easy to maintain in service day lewis 1964 leader locomotive as proposal progressed bulleid saw that certain tasks required with conventional steam locomotives could be eliminated by adopting some of features of contemporary southern electric locomotives however one of subsequent designs of a 0 4 4 0 wheel arrangement had an unacceptably high axle loading of which increased risk of damaging southern railway s track by developing proposal further bulleid settled for a 0 6 0 0 6 0 design of tank locomotive which spread weight more evenly over rails and reduced axle loading design thumb alt a line diagram of an 0 6 0 0 6 0 tank steam locomotive showing side and front profiles it includes principal dimensions and weights left 350px works diagram of leader a series of initial ideas were presented to southern railway management by bulleid that incorporated double ended running giving locomotive driver maximum visibility in either direction without a boiler or tender obscuring his view need for a turntable to turn locomotive was therefore eliminated although initial designs were rejected by operating department because of problems with welding technique section 4 accepted design included two 0 6 0 steam bogies with weight saving sleeve valves and chains to couple driving axles boiler was offset to provide space for a communication corridor allowing driver to access both cabs without leaving locomotive an arrangement which led to later problems firebox near centre of locomotive was fed by fireman from a third cab linked to both driving cabs by communication corridor entire ensemble was placed on a common frame and thus often referred to as an 0 6 6 0 tank engine even though actual notation is 0 6 0 0 6 0 since both engine units pivoted as on a garratt double fairlie or

railways and harbours magazine august 1943 p 592 leader prototype was constructed at brighton railway works work beginning in 1946 an initial order for five locomotives was placed straight from drawing board in 1946 and a further 31 were ordered in 1947 although with nationalisation looming this was merely a gesture latter order was cancelled after southern railway was taken into public ownership to allow trials to be carried out on prototype bogie and cylinder design each of two bogies had three cylinders with driving wheels connected by chains enclosed in an oil bath based upon bulleid s chain driven valve gear on his pacific locomotives valve gear used unusual sleeve valve arrangement that was also tested on ex lb scr h1 class hartland point in parallel with construction of first leader locomotive leader was first steam locomotive to use a form of sleeve valve since cecil paget s locomotive of 1908 and concurrent testing of principle on hartland point hints at rushed nature of locomotive s conception locomotive sat on unusual bulleid firth brown wheels which were lighter yet stronger than spoked equivalent use of sleeve valves and oil baths to lubricate moving parts of engine units was inspired by contemporary internal combustion engine practice this included oscillating gear that gave a 25 degree axial movement to sleeves allowing even lubrication of moving parts however this resulted in an over complicated mechanism that was difficult to maintain perpetuating seizures it was meant to eradicate this feature was removed from both bogies of prototype as trials progressed another innovative feature of steam bogie assembly was ability to interchange them when faults occurred an easy operation for maintenance staff when compared to complexities of overhauling a regular steam locomotive s motion three cylinders of each bogie were cast in mono block format each surrounded by two annular inlet steam chests and a single large outlet steam chest these had added function of keeping cylinder heated by hot steam to maintain temperature and pressure of steam entering cylinders however these castings were difficult to machine accurately steam sealing arrangements needed for this system were also complex with each of six cylinders and valve sleeves requiring 24 sealing rings boiler firebox smokebox and casing design thumb

was a prolific steam raiser all leader boilers were constructed at eastleigh and proved to be least problematic area of entire design boiler pressure was set at and each was fitted with four thermic siphons within firebox both to increase rate of evaporation and improve water circulation these had been used previously to great effect on bulleid s merchant navy and west country and battle of britain class designs leader had a dry lining firebox it was not surrounded on top and sides by a jacket of water as in normal practice but was constructed of welded steel and used firebricks instead of water for insulation a novel but troublesome solution using firebricks reduced grate area from to and concentrated fire in a smaller area firehole door was offset to left of boiler which created difficulties for fireman when adding coal to fire firebox was not initially equipped with a firebrick arch although one was retro fitted during summer of 1950 arch was problematic because it led to a tendency for flames to enter cab at high outputs a situation made worse by narrowing of firebox area smokebox had an inherent problem in maintaining a constant vacuum this was a result of another bulleid labour saving innovation a sliding hatch controlled from front cab that enabled ash to be cleaned out via a chute onto track when locomotive was on move problem lay with ash gathering around edges of slide allowing air to leak into smokebox thereby reducing overall efficiency of locomotive fierce blast from exhaust also meant that ash and embers were ejected into atmosphere creating a potential lineside fire hazard for ease of maintenance boiler firebox and smokebox were encased in steel sheeting which meant that engine s shape resembled that of a modern diesel locomotive that was a major departure from traditional steam locomotive design allowing engine to be cleaned using a carriage washing plant locomotive was designed to carry 4 tons 4 06 tonnes of coal and of water and coal bunker was covered by a tarpaulin to prevent water ingress into fireman s cab entry into locomotive was by way of ladders leading up to sliding doors although due to bogie design climb into fireman s cab necessitated over casing construction construction of first five leader locomotives began at southern railway s brighton railway works in july 1947 british railways inherited leader project upon nationalisation in 1948 which was far enough advanced to continue constructing prototype as bulleid was still chief mechanical engineer of newly formed southern region of british railways although work on other four locomotives stalled prototype leader emerged from brighton as locomotive no 36001 in june 1949 other four members of initial order made by southern railway nos 36002 5 were at varying stages of construction by end of development period no 36002 was almost complete no was without its outer casing and nos 5 were little more than sets of frames although most of their major components had been constructed at eastleigh and brighton and were stored ready for fitting with no prospect of further money being allocated by railway executive for their completion unfinished locomotives were put into store at various depots around former southern railway network pending a decision on their future operation with a calculated tractive effort of leader came with british railways class 5 power band this was considerably lower than contemporary wc bb pacifics which were rated as class 7 and this meant that leader had to be able to have an axle loading that would allow it to operate over secondary routes and on branch lines where double ended design would be of most benefit something that was not likely with weight inherent in design on completion no 36001 was immediately put into service trials using empty passenger carriage stock in south east of england official trial records kept at brighton works reported varying degrees of success and failure on runs undertaken however results of trials as reported to british railways headquarters at marylebone were conspicuous by absence of praise for strengths of leader namely boiler braking system and total adhesion provided by two bogies several theories have been put forward regarding this state of affairs most plausible being that more conservative members of railway workforce at brighton and railway executive felt that leader was too revolutionary and were keen to maintain status quo performance of no 36001 thumb alt a picture of an 0 6 0 0 6 0 steam locomotive under construction cuboid box

bogies at brighton may 1949 casing allowed locomotive to be put through a carriage washing plant following trials that lasted over a year no 36001 was shown to have several flaws including heavy coal and water consumption mechanical unreliability untenable working conditions for both fireman and driver loss of steam through cylinder rings and uneven weight distribution on bogies after renewing cylinder assembly it was tested around brighton and eastleigh using an lner dynamometer car where good running was experienced at high costs in fuel and effort on part of fireman for a period of two weeks leader was tested against performance of a u class locomotive which indicated that brake release was too slow in service for use on tight schedules despite brake application being noted as best used on a bulleid design these trials were interrupted by breakage of crank axles these being replaced by axles from 36002 only for these to break in turn at approximately same mileage as originals throughout no 36001 s trials firebrick lining provided a constant problem by continually collapsing into fire firebricks were then replaced with cast iron substitutes that melted in intense heat of firebox which were in turn replaced by thicker firebricks some of firemen allotted to leader complained about cramped conditions in centre cab of locomotive a situation made worse by flames entering cab from firebox at high outputs it was an enclosed space that was constantly hot and single fireman s entrance door on side of locomotive was left open during travel to promote ventilation door into fireman s cab also attracted criticism as it would have been blocked in event of locomotive overturning on that side preventing fireman s escape so that members of railway trade union aslef threatened to stop their crews from operating leader measurements in fireman s cab showed temperatures could reach earning locomotive nickname of chinese laundry due to heat and humidity during work on crank axles at eastleigh works opportunity was taken to place locomotive on weighbridge which showed that offset boiler and coal bunker caused locomotive s centre of gravity to be shifted to one side experiments had to be undertaken to balance locomotive by filling linking corridor with large quantities of scrap metal replaced in a re design by a raised floor covering weighted material these modifications resulted in engine exceeding total weight limit of 150 tons 151 tonnes severely limiting design s route availability during testing a related problem was that despite being a tall locomotive at cab ceilings were relatively low cab at smokebox end of locomotive suffered from same excessive heat as did fireman s cab to circumvent this problem locomotive was used in reverse as rear cab was next to water tank and coal chute and therefore away from hot gases circulating inside smokebox despite its problems locomotive displayed outstanding steaming characteristics and total traction from two power bogies on its trial runs when properly fired leader was capable of keeping up with schedules even running ahead on occasions however operational difficulties when stopping for water tended to lose any time advantages gained and affected published performance figures despite hauling test trains over central section of former southern railway leader prototype was never used on a revenue earning service because of risk of failure of valve gear and adverse publicity this would cause for british railways livery and numbering southern railway when project was under auspices of southern railway no 36001 would have been numbered cc101 bulleid advocated a continental style of locomotive nomenclature based upon his experiences at french branch of westinghouse electric before first world war southern railway number followed an adaptation of uic classification system where c refers to number of driving axles in this case three on each bogie since design has six driving axles numbering would have been cc101 for initial batch final number being locomotive identifier british railways leader 36001 outside brighton works in 1949 thumb right operational livery was ex works photographic grey with red and white lining british railways cycling lion crest was also used though after works photograph this was painted over without explanation numbering was british railways standard system in 36001 series if class had gone into full production locomotives would have been painted in british railways mixed traffic freight black livery with red grey and cream lining 36001 was initially painted in this livery but this preceded official works photograph and was subsequently repainted in photographic grey livery operational assessment production of leader demonstrated inherent unsuitability of encasing a steam boiler in an enclosed superstructure environment inside was highly unsuitable weight was prohibitive and necessary maintenance such as boiler washouts could only be achieved by a major dismantling of locomotive despite high expectations attached to leader it was not motive power revolution that bulleid intended it to be no part of leader design was perpetuated on british railways standard class locomotives by robert riddles nor did it find favour internationally with garratt articulated locomotives providing a similar function for less maintenance whole concept was quietly dropped in 1951 after bulleid left british railways to become chief mechanical engineer of eireann where he produced cie no a peat burning locomotive to a similar design and all five were scrapped culmination of project was a ps178 865 5s 0d equivalent to ps as of bill for taxpayer though when press reported story as late as 1953 it was claimed that ps500 000 equivalent to ps as of was wasted on project sunday dispatch 18 january 1953 r g jarvis who was placed in charge of project after bulleid s departure insisted that locomotive required an entire re design to solve problems of original concept after problems during trials in 1950 in november of that year 36001 and four other leader locomotives then in various stages of assembly were all cut up for scrap no members of leader class survived and only numberplates of no 36001 and no 36002 are known to exist numberplate for no 36001 is in national railway museum a locomotive builder s
