a b and wrote positively of scully s portrayal noting really this works best as a scully episode i prefer darin morgan s version of character but i doubt that version could support a full episode about god in same way that this more searching and lost scully does however handlen was critical of some of religious aspects of episode noting that if there s a christian god in x files universe doesn t that trump just about everything else that mulder and scully have spent their time on there are too many implications here for show to support and while it doesn t destroy episode it does make it difficult for me to back it as fully as i d like to john keegan from critical myth gave episode a 7 out of 10 rating noting overall this episode highlights scully and her faith and in process manages to presage many of future plot developments for series and her character spiritual war at foundation of series mythology is reflected in a situation that speaks directly to scully and her upbringing and though some of religious metaphors are heavy handed it works well enough entertainment weekly gave episode a b and wrote positively of episode s inventiveness which derives from its choice of most mainstream of all christianity review also wrote positively of mulder scully role reversal calling change always welcome paula vitaris from cinefantastique gave episode a moderately positive review and awarded it two and a half stars out of four she noted that scully s search to reconcile her religious beliefs and her scientific training makes for powerful drama and gillian
