archimyrmex is an extinct genus of ant in subfamily myrmeciinae described by palaeoentomologist theodore cockerell in 1923 genus contains four described species archimyrmex rostratus archimyrmex piatnitzkyi archimyrmex smekali and archimyrmex wedmannae archimyrmex is known from a group of middle eocene fossils which were found in north america south america and europe genus was initially placed in subfamily ponerinae but it was later placed in myrmeciinae it is now believed to be ancestor of extant primitive genus myrmecia from australia despite this archimyrmex is not a member to any tribe and is regarded as incertae sedis within myrmeciinae however some authors believe archimyrmex should be assigned as incertae sedis within formicidae these ants can be characterised by their large mandibles and body length ranging from they also have long thin legs and an elongated mesosoma thorax and petiole history and classification when described genus archimyrmex was known from a solitary fossil preserved as an impression in fine shale of green river formation in colorado fossil was recovered in july 1922 from station 1 fossil site near top of ute trail by entomologist porter cockerell one side of a rostratus holotype is currently deposited in university of colorado paleontology collections while counterpart is in us national museum and an additional eleven fossils were known as of 2002 holotype was first studied by palaeoentomologist theodore dru alison cockerell of university of colorado and his 1923 type description of new genus and species was published in entomologist specific epithet rostratus is a reference to beak like outline of mandibles seen in type specimen cockerell placed genus into subfamily ponerinae he noted similarities between archimyrmex and myrmecia and prionomyrmex suggesting archimyrmex to be an intermediate between two other genera genus was re described in 1928 by palaeoentomologist william wheeler who moved genus from ponerinae to myrmicinae this placement was not challenged until a 2003 paper by russian palaeoentomologists g m dlussky and k s perfilieva who moved genus again this time to primitive subfamily myrmeciinae based on close similarity between archimyrmex and prionomyrmex in 1957 an additional species of fossil ant was described from middle eocene ventana formation in rio region of argentina by m j viana and j a haedo rossi they placed species into a new genus ameghinoia as ameghinoia piatnitzkyi as with archimyrmex genus was first placed in ponerinae it was subsequently moved to myrmeciinae by r r snelling in 1981 a second ventana formation ant species was described in 1981 by e rossi de garcia and placed into another new genus polanskiella as p smekali recovered from an outcrop of ventana formation in rio limay area rossi de garcia distinguished new species from a piatnitzkyi based on characteristics of wing venation and because of difference in size of two type specimens a series of fossils from three genera were examined by dlussky and perfilieva and based on very notable similarities between three species they synonymized three genera under archimyrmex treating both ameghinoia and polanskiella as junior synonyms a fourth species a wedmannae was described by dlussky in 2012 based on fossils found in middle eocene messel pit site of germany specific epithet was chosen by dlussky to honour sonja before archimyrmex was placed into subfamily myrmeciinae wheeler classified genus as incertae sedis latin for of uncertain placement within ant subfamily myrmicinae as it could not be confidently placed into any ant tribe even after its placement within myrmeciinae it was still classified as incertae sedis however cesare baroni urbani of university of basel switzerland classified genus as incertae sedis within family formicidae baroni urbani justifies his decision by stating characters of ant are similar to those of an insect from lower cretaceous that was once placed in myrmeciinae but is now incertae sedis within subclade aculeata archimyrmex also shares a similar structure to other ants and insects within order hymenoptera key diagnostic traits synapomorphies of myrmeciinae ants cannot be observed although described species have elongated scapes first segment of antenna a key diagnostic trait for formicidae a 2012 report describing new fossils accepted classification of archibald and colleagues while disregarding baroni urbani s comments following cladogram generated by archibald and colleagues show possible phylogenetic position of archimyrmex among some ants of subfamily myrmeciinae it is possible that archimyrmex may be ancestor of myrmecia description in general archimyrmex individuals have a head capsule that bears a set of enlarged mandibles with either a rectangular or triangular outline mandibles have a mixed arrangement of teeth and denticles smaller teeth on inside margin gynes have long legs and long an elongated petiole a narrow waist between mesosoma and gaster which is usually smooth in profile on upper surface petiole structure in combination with little to no constriction between abdominal segments iii and iv is unique to genus and separates it from other myrmeciinae genera a piatnitzkyi thumb right a piatnitzkyi holotype a piatnitzkyi is reported from three specimens giving a body length between holotype recovered from ventana formation of neuquen basin in argentina is currently preserved at bernardino rivadavia natural sciences museum collection head capsule is slightly ovoid being a little longer than it is wide and having elongated mandibles that are notably shorter than head as with a smekali mesosoma is massive being between 1 7 1 8 times as long as it is tall legs are like those of other species being long and thin unlike other species petiole of a piatnitzkyi does not have a constricted post petiole a rostratus thumb right a rostratus holotype type specimen numbers are uc no and usnm no for part and counterpart females of type species a rostratus have a body length estimated to be between with a small gaster that is shorter than mesosoma and sporting a short thick sting length of head when excluding mandibles is mesosoma is and middle femur is around preserved specimens from green river formation are brown and upper area of head and gaster is black which is similar to myrmecia nigriceps head capsules have antennae borne on a scape which is long and passes edge of occipital margin of head short thickened mandibles have several larger teeth interspersed with small denticles and are about 50 of length of head capsule scape is believed to be long and thin and its mesosoma is narrow and long width of scutum is greater than its length legs are noticeably elongated and thin and a narrow stalk that connects mesosoma with abdomen is slightly convex a smekali a smekali was recovered from ventana formation in argentina lectotype numbered nmw no 1972 1574 9 is housed in museum of natural history lectotype female has an estimated body length of with an mesosoma that is described as relatively massive being only 1 7 to 1 9 times as long as tall and an oval shaped gaster there is a notable constriction in post petiole abdominal segment not seen in other species head capsule has mandibles which are about 70 as long as head capsule and have four to five large teeth each antennal scape is longer than occipital margin and antenna is composed of an estimated twelve segments legs are elongated and narrow propodeum is weakly convex and petiole does not have a node a segment between mesosoma and gaster a smekali can be distinguished from other species by its massive size constriction in post petiole and absence of node it was previously thought ant had an eight segmented antennae but lectotype has seven segments dlussky also mentions that original description provided by elsa rossi de garcia does not match description he provided a wedmannae a wedmannae from germany is described from a single gyne that is approximately found in messel formation fossil is believed to be 47 million years old mesosoma measures length of head is scape is diameter of eyes are and forewings are species has a head which is shorter than it is wide but has mandibles about as long as head which are triangular in outline eyes are oval shaped as with three other species antennal scape is long one third of scape length protrudes past occipital margin of head pronotum in profile is either straight or weakly concave and petiole is weakly rounded with no node present propodeum has small denticles and is weakly convex and legs are long gaster has a well developed and long sting this species can be distinguished from other archimyrmex ants by its long mandibles shape of petiole is almost same as a smekali but their mandibles are much shorter and mesosoma is more compact propodeum s dorsal surface is also more convex references external links
