cornish people or cornish are a celtic ethnic group native to or associated with cornwall and a recognised national minority in united kingdom which can trace its roots to ancient britons who inhabited southern and central great britain before roman conquest many in cornwall today continue to assert a distinct identity separate from or in addition to english or british identities cornish identity has been adopted by migrants into cornwall as well as by emigrant and descendant communities from cornwall latter sometimes referred to as cornish diaspora although not included as an explicit option in uk census numbers of those claiming cornish ethnic and national identity are officially recognised and recorded ian saltern cornish national minority report 2 2011 throughout classical antiquity ancient britons formed a series of tribes cultures and identities in great britain dumnonii and cornovii were celtic tribes who inhabited what was to become cornwall during iron age roman and post roman periods name cornwall and its cornish are derived from celtic cornovii tribe anglo saxon invasion and settlement of britain in 5th to 6th centuries restricted romano british culture and language gradually into north and west of great britain whilst inhabitants of southern and eastern britain became english cornish people who shared brythonic language with welsh and bretons across sea were referred to in old english language as westwalas meaning west welsh battle of deorham between britons and anglo saxons is thought to have resulted in a loss of landlinks with people of wales in this period however land travel was far more difficult than travel by sea cornish people and their brythonic cornish language experienced a process of anglicisation and attrition during medieval and early modern period by 18th century and following creation of kingdom of great britain cornish language and identity had faded largely replaced by english language albeit cornish influenced west country dialects and anglo cornish and or british identity a celtic revival during early 20th century enabled a cultural self consciousness in cornwall that revitalised cornish language and roused cornish to express a distinctly celtic heritage cornish language was granted official recognition under european charter for regional or minority languages in 2002 and in 2014 cornish people were recognised and afforded protection by uk government under framework convention for protection of national minorities in 2011 census population of cornwall including isles of scilly was estimated to be 532 300 cornish self government movement has called for greater recognition of cornish culture politics and language and urged that cornish people be accorded greater status exemplified by call for them to be one of listed ethnic groups in united kingdom census 2011 form classification thumb right union and cornish flags alt union and cornish flags fluttering in wind against a grey cloudy sky both geographic and historical factors distinguish cornish as an ethnic group further supported by identifiable genetic variance between populations of cornwall neighbouring devon and england as published in a 2012 oxford university study throughout medieval and early modern britain cornish were at some points accorded same status as english and welsh and considered a separate race or nation distinct from their neighbours with their own language society and customs a process of anglicisation between 1485 and 1700 led to cornish adopting english language culture and civic identity a view reinforced by cornish historian a l rowse who said they were gradually absorbed into mainstream of english life although decidedly modern and largely retrospective in its identity politics cornish and celtic associations have advanced notion of a distinct cornish national and ethnic identity since late 20th century in united kingdom census 2001 despite no explicit cornish option being available approximately 34 000 people in cornwall and 3 500 people elsewhere in uk a combined total equal to nearly 7 per cent of population of cornwall identified themselves as

cornish have been described as a special case in england with an ethnic rather than regional identity structural changes to politics of united kingdom particularly european union and devolution have been cited as main stimulus to a growing interest in cornish identity and distinctiveness in late 20th century britain british are citizens of united kingdom a people who by convention consist of four national groups english northern irish scots and welsh in 1990s it was said that notion that cornish are to be classified as a nation comparable to english irish scots and welsh has practically vanished from popular consciousness outside cornwall and that despite a real and substantive identity cornish struggle for recognition as a national group distinct from english however in 2014 after a 15 year campaign uk government officially recognised cornish as a national minority under council of europe s framework convention for protection of national minorities giving cornish same status as welsh scots and irish within uk inhabitants of cornwall may have multiple political allegiances adopting mixed dual or hyphenated identities such as cornish first and british second cornish and british and european or like phil vickery a rugby union prop for england national rugby union team and british and irish lions describe themselves as cornish and english meanwhile another international rugby union player josh describes himself as cornish fijian and cornish not english a survey by plymouth university in 2000 found that 30 of children in cornwall felt cornish not english a 2004 survey on national identity by finance firm morgan stanley found that 44 of respondents in cornwall saw themselves as cornish rather than british or english a 2008 university of exeter study conducted in 16 towns across cornwall found that 59 felt themselves to be cornish and 41 felt more cornish than english while for over a third of respondents cornish identity formed their primary national identity genealogy and family history were considered to be chief criteria for being cornish particularly among those who possessed such ties while being born in cornwall was also held to be important a 2008 study by university of edinburgh of 15 and 16 year old schoolchildren in cornwall found that 58 of respondents felt themselves to be either fairly or very much cornish other 42 may be result of in migration to area during second half of twentieth century a 2010 study by university of exeter into meaning of contemporary cornish identity across cornwall found that there was a west east distance decay in strength of cornish identity study was conducted amongst farming community as they were deemed to be socio professional group most objectively representative of cornishness all participants categorised themselves as cornish and identified cornish as their primary ethnic group orientation those in west primarily thought of themselves as cornish and british celtic while those in east tended to think of themselves as cornish and english all participants in west cornwall who identified as cornish and not english described people in east cornwall without hesitation as equally cornish as themselves those who identified as cornish and english stressed primacy of their cornishness and a capacity to distance themselves from their englishness ancestry was seen as most important criterion for being categorised as cornish above place of birth or growing up in cornwall this study supports a 1988 study by mary mcarthur that had found that meanings of cornishness varied substantially from local to national identity both studies also observed that cornish were less materialistic than english cornish generally saw english or city people as being less friendly and more aggressively self promoting and insensitive cornish saw themselves as friendly welcoming and caring in november 2010 british prime minister david cameron said i think cornish national identity is very powerful and that his government would devolve a lot of power to cornwall that will go to cornish unitary authority 2011 uk census thumb upright a poster in cornwall telling people how to describe

stone between them traditional accounts of cornish ancestry teach that they are descended from celts making them distinct from english many but not all of whom are descended from anglo saxons who colonised great britain from their homelands in northern europe and drove celts to britain s western and northern fringes however some dna research investigating genetic history of british isles suggests that three quarters of contemporary y chromosomes of british people including cornish originate from hunter gatherers who settled in atlantic europe during paleolithic era after melting of ice caps but before land broke away from mainland and divided into islands archaeological evidence supports pre historic human habitation in cornwall at least as early as lower paleolithic although there was a separation of british isles from continental europe as a consequence of last ice age genetic evidence indicates that people of great britain broadly share a common ancestry with basque people who live in basque country by pyrenees on this basis geneticist stephen oppenheimer suggests that first settlers of great britain were unlikely to have spoken one of celtic languages but rather an ancient tongue related to basque language next historical immigration to great britain occurred during neolithic period interpreted by bryan sykes professor of human genetics at university of oxford as arrival of celts from iberian peninsula and origin of britain s and ireland s celtic tribes it is these people who are considered progenitors of cornish a study by wellcome trust led by sir walter bodmer and published on channel 4 s faces of britain in april 2007 showed that cornish people have a particular variant of melanocortin 1 receptor gene identifying them as celts more closely related to welsh than to english within areas of uk studied this gene appeared in 26 per cent of population of orkney 23 per cent of devon 21 per cent of wales 16 per cent of cornwall 13 per cent of kent and 11 per cent of north east england according to a dna survey carried out for royal society and published in 2012 by peter donnelly professor of statistical science at oxford university and director of wellcome trust genetics centre cornish people along with welsh and people of devon were found to be among most genetically distinct groups in britain others in england and britain were found to have a greater range of genetic ancestries with people from cornwall being distinct from those elsewhere in england and neighbouring population of devon though overall still very closely related to english possibly due to their stronger genetic links to tribes that arrived after last ice age however a more recent study by oxford university geneticist professor peter donnelly suggests that cornish have dna that is more similar to that of other english groups than to welsh or scots both cornish and have similar but distinct genetic profiles which show less continental german influence and more northern french material than english and scots all showing a similar portion of nordic material suggesting idea of a uniform celtic genetic race is false upright thumb left an 18th century map of great britain based on accounts from anglo saxon chronicle showing alt british isles appear on a pale and yellowed map isles are divided into political territories throughout classical antiquity celts spoke celtic languages and formed a series of tribes cultures and identities notably picts and gaels in north and britons in south britons were themselves a divided people although they shared brythonic languages they were tribal and divided into regional societies and within them sub groups examples of these tribal societies were brigantes in north and ordovices silures and in west in extreme southwest what was to become cornwall were dumnonii and cornovii who lived in kingdom of dumnonia roman conquest of britain in 1st century introduced romans to britain who upon their arrival initially recorded dumnonii but later reported on cornovii who were possibly a sub group of dumnonii although romans colonised much of central and southern britain dumnonia was virtually unaffected by conquest roman rule had little or no impact on region meaning it could flourish as a semi or fully independent kingdom which evidence shows was sometimes under dominion of kings of britons and sometimes to have been governed by its own monarchy either by title of duke or king this petty kingdom shared strong linguistic political and cultural links with brittany a peninsula on continental europe south of cornwall inhabited by britons cornish and breton languages were nearly indistinguishable in this period and both cornwall and brittany remain dotted with dedications to same celtic saints sack of rome in year 410 prompted a complete roman departure from britain and cornwall then experienced an influx of celtic christian missionaries from ireland who had a profound effect upon early cornish people their culture faith and architecture ensuing decline of roman empire encouraged anglo saxon invasion of britain angles jutes and saxons germanic peoples from northern europe established petty kingdoms and settled in different regions of what was to become england and parts of southern scotland progressively defeating britons in battle saxons of kingdom of wessex in particular were expanding their territory westwards towards cornwall cornish were frequently embattled with west saxons who used their germanic word modern english welsh meaning stranger or foreigner to describe their opponents later specifying them as westwalas west welsh or cornish conflict continued until king athelstan of england determined that river tamar be formal boundary between west saxons and cornish in year 936 making cornwall one of last retreats of britons encouraging development of a distinct cornish identity brittonic culture in britain became confined to cornwall parts of devon north west england south west scotland and wales although a treaty was agreed anglo saxon political influence stretched westwards until some time in late 10th century when cornwall was definitively incorporated into kingdom of england anglicisation and rebellion thumb right european nations in ad 998 norman conquest of england which began with an invasion by troops of william duke of normandy later king william i of england in 1066 resulted in removal of anglo saxon derived monarchy aristocracy and clerical hierarchy and its replacement by normans scandinavian vikings from northern france and their breton allies who in many cases maintained rule in brittonic speaking parts of conquered lands shires of england were progressively divided amongst companions of william i of england who served as england s new nobility english would come to absorb normans but cornish vigorously resisted their influence at time of conquest cornwall was under governance of of cornwall last earl of cornwall to be directly descended from ancient monarchy of cornwall earldom of cornwall had held devolved semi sovereignty from england but in 1067 was granted to robert count of mortain king william i s half brother and ruled thereafter by an anglo norman aristocracy in domesday book record of great survey of england completed in 1086 virtually all landowners in cornwall had english names making it impossible to be sure who was cornish and who was english by race however there was a persistent and continuing differentiation between english and cornish peoples during middle ages as evidenced by documents such as 1173 charter of truro which made explicit mention of both peoples as distinct earldom of cornwall passed to various english nobles throughout high middle ages but in 1337 earldom was given status of a duchy and edward black prince first son and heir of king edward iii of england became first duke of cornwall as a means for prince to raise his own capital large parts of cornwall were owned by edward 1st duke of cornwall and successive english dukes of cornwall became largest landowners in cornwall monarchy of england established two special administrative institutions in cornwall first being duchy of cornwall one of only two in kingdom of england other being duchy of lancaster from 1354 and second being cornish stannary courts and parliaments which governed cornwall s tin industry these two institutions allowed ordinary cornish people to believe that they had been granted a unique constitutional status to reflect their unique cultural identity however duchy of cornwall gradually lost its political autonomy from england a state which became increasingly centralised in london and by early tudor period cornish had begun to see themselves as a conquered people whose culture liberties and prosperity had been downgraded by english this view was exacerbated in 1490s by heavy taxation imposed by king henry vii of england upon impoverished cornish to raise funds for his military campaigns against king james iv of scotland and perkin warbeck as well as henry vii s suspension of privileges of cornish stannaries having provided more than their fair share of soldiers and sailors for conflict in northern england and feeling aggrieved at cornwall s status as england s poorest county a popular uprising out of cornwall ensued cornish rebellion of 1497 rebellion was initially a political march from st to london led by thomas and michael an gof motivated by a mixture of reasons to raise money for charity to celebrate their community to present their grievances to parliament of england but gathered pace across west country as a revolt against king thumb 300px alt a colour coded map of cornwall surrounded by a blue sea cornwall is

shift between 1300 and 1750 with cornish people gradually adopting english as their common language cornish was most widely spoken language west of river tamar until around mid 1300s when middle english began to be adopted as a common language of cornish people as late as 1542 andrew an english traveller physician and writer wrote that in cornwall there were two languages and but that there may be many men and women in cornwall who could not understand english while norman language was in use by much of english aristocracy cornish was used as a lingua franca particularly in remote far west of cornwall many cornish landed gentry chose mottos in cornish language for their coat of arms highlighting its socially high status however in 1549 and following english reformation king edward vi of england commanded that book of common prayer an anglican liturgical text in english language should be introduced to all churches in his kingdom meaning that latin and celtic customs and services should be discontinued prayer book rebellion was a militant revolt in cornwall and parts of neighbouring devon against act of uniformity 1549 which outlawed all languages from church services apart from english and is specified as a testament to affection and loyalty cornish people held for cornish language in rebellion separate risings occurred simultaneously in bodmin in and sampford courtenay in devon which would both converge at exeter laying siege to region s largest protestant city however rebellion was suppressed thanks largely to aid of foreign mercenaries in a series of battles in which hundreds were killed effectively ending cornish as common language of cornish people anglicanism of reformation served as a vehicle for anglicisation in cornwall protestantism had a lasting cultural effect upon cornish by way of linking cornwall more closely with england while lessening political and linguistic ties with bretons of brittany english civil war a series of armed conflicts and political machinations between parliamentarians and royalists polarised populations of england and wales however cornwall in english civil war was a staunchly royalist enclave an important focus of support for royalist cause cornish soldiers were used as scouts and spies during war for their language was not understood by english parliamentarians peace that followed close of war led to a further shift to english language by cornish people which encouraged an influx of english people to cornwall by mid 17th century use of cornish language had retreated far enough west to prompt concern and investigation by antiquarians such as william scawen as cornish language diminished people of cornwall underwent a process of english enculturation and assimilation becoming

celtic cornish identity developed during cornwall s celtic revival industrial revolution had a major impact upon cornish people cornwall s economy was fully integrated into england s and mining in cornwall always an important source of employment and stability of cornish experienced a process of industrialisation resulting in 30 per cent of cornwall s adult population being employed by its mines during this period efforts were made by cornish engineers to design steam engines with which to power water pumps for cornish mines thus aiding extraction of mineral ore industrial scale tin and copper mining operations in cornwall melded cornish identity with engines and heavy industry and cornwall s leading mining engineer richard trevithick became as much a part of cornwall s heritage as any legendary giant from its celtic past trevithick s most significant success was a high pressure steam engine used to pump water and refuse from mines but he was also builder of first full scale

cornishman self declared messiah who in 19th century led last battle to be fought on english soil known as battle of wood while not akin to cornish rebellions of past he did attract some cornish support as well as mostly kentish labourers although his support was primarily of religious followers in latter half of 19th century cornwall experienced rapid deindustrialisation with closure of mines in particular considered by cornish to be both an economic and cultural disaster this coupled with rise of romantic nationalism in europe inspired and influenced a celtic revival in cornwall a social linguistic and artistic movement interested in cornish medieval ethnology this revivalist upsurge investigated cornwall s pre industrial culture using cornish language as principal badge of cornish nationality and ethnic kinship first effective revival of cornish began in 1904 when henry jenner a celtic language enthusiast published his book handbook of cornish language his orthography unified cornish was based on cornish as it was spoken in 18th century although his pupil robert morton nance later steered revival more towards middle cornish that had been used in 16th century before

kernow in 1951 increased interest and communication across celtic nations in celtic languages and culture during 1960s and 1970s spurred on popularisation of cornish self government movement since devolution in scotland wales and northern ireland enthusiasts for cornish culture have pressed for cornish language to be taught formally in cornish schools while cornish nationalists have demanded

settling in north america or else amongst ports and plantations of caribbean in first half of 19th century cornish people were leaders in tin and copper smelting while mining in cornwall was people s major occupation increased competition from australia british malaya and bolivia coupled with depletion of mineral deposits brought about an economic decline for cornish mining lasting half a century and prompting mass human migration from cornwall in each decade from 1861 to 1901 around 20 of cornish male population migrated abroad three times that of average of england and wales and totalling over a quarter of a million people lost to emigration between 1841 and 1901 there was a displacement of skilled cornish engineers farmers merchants miners and tradesmen but their commercial and occupational expertise particularly in hard rock mining was highly valued by communities they met within great britain cornish families were attracted from cornwall to north east england particularly on teesside to partake in coal mining as a means to earn wealth by using their mining skill this has resulted in a concentration of cornish names on and around teesside that persists into 21st century large numbers of 19th century cornish emigrants eventually returned to cornwall whilst rate of emigration from cornwall declined after world war i however global connections of remaining cornish

to emigrate to australia following demise of cornish mining in 19th century a vigorous recruiting campaign was launched to encourage cornish to aid with mining in australia because of their experience and expertise free passage to south australia in particular was granted to hundreds of cornish miners and their families so much so that a large cornish community gathered in australia s copper coast
