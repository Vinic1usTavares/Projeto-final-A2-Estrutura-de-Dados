thumb a nazi era anti smoking ad titled chain smoker reading he does not devour it it devours him from anti tobacco publication reine luft 1941 23 90 in early 20th century german researchers made advances in linking smoking to health harms which strengthened anti tobacco movement in weimar republic and led to a state supported anti smoking campaign early anti tobacco movements grew in many nations from middle of 19th century 1933 1945 anti tobacco campaigns in nazi germany have been widely publicized although stronger laws than those passed in germany were passed in some american states uk and elsewhere between 1890 and 1930 fifteen states prohibited sale or use of cigarettes at various times between 1890 and 1930 as a result of activities of anti cigarette league of america after 1941 anti tobacco campaigns were restricted by nazi government german movement was most powerful anti smoking movement in world during 1930s and early 1940s however tobacco control policy was incoherent and ineffective with uncoordinated and often regional efforts by many actors obvious measures were not taken and existing measures were not enforced some nazi leaders condemned smoking and several of them openly criticized tobacco consumption but others publicly smoked and denied that it was harmful there was much research on smoking and its effects on health during nazi rule and it was most important of its type at that time but a directly supported tobacco research institute produced work of only marginal scientific importance adolf hitler s personal distaste for tobacco and nazi reproductive policies were among motivating factors behind nazi campaigns against smoking nazi anti tobacco campaign included banning smoking in trams buses and city trains promoting health education limiting cigarette rations in wehrmacht organizing medical lectures for soldiers and raising tobacco tax nazis also imposed restrictions on tobacco advertising and smoking in public spaces and regulated restaurants and coffeehouses these measures were widely circumvented or ignored movement did not reduce number of smokers tobacco use increased rapidly in early years of nazi regime between 1933 and 1939 number of smokers increased from 1939 to 1945 but cigarette consumption declined rationing towards end of war and post war poverty meant that increasing numbers of smokers could not buy as many cigarettes even by end of 20th century anti smoking movement in germany had not attained influence of nazi anti smoking campaign germany has some of weakest tobacco control measures in europe and german tobacco research has been described as muted prelude thumb an 1898 cartoon of a train in bavaria woman smoking isn t allowed in this compartment it clearly says for non smokers outside smoker but we aren t smoking outside we re smoking inside anti smoking measures have a long history in german speaking areas for instance in 1840 prussian government re instated a ban on smoking in public places 1880s invention of automated cigarette making machinery in american south made it possible to mass produce cigarettes at low cost and smoking became common in western countries this led to a backlash and a tobacco prohibition movement which challenged tobacco use as harmful and brought about some bans on tobacco sale and use german empire also had anti tobacco sentiment in early 20th century critics of smoking organized first anti tobacco group in country named deutscher zum der german tobacco opponents association for protection of non smokers established in 1904 this organization existed for only a brief period next anti tobacco organization bund deutscher tabakgegner federation of german tobacco opponents was established in 1910 in bohemia other anti smoking organizations were established in 1912 in cities of hanover and dresden after world war i anti tobacco movements continued in german weimar republic against a background of increasing medical research german researchers were heavily involved with early research into tobacco harms in 1920s and 1930s weimar republic was at cutting edge of tobacco research in 1920 a bund deutscher tabakgegner in der tschechoslowakei federation of german tobacco opponents in czechoslovakia was formed in prague after czechoslovakia was separated from austria at end of world war i a bund deutscher tabakgegner in federation of german tobacco opponents in german austria was established in graz in 1920 these groups published journals advocating nonsmoking first such german language journal was der tabakgegner tobacco opponent published by bohemian organization between 1912 and 1932 deutscher tabakgegner german tobacco opponent was published in dresden from 1919 to 1935 and was second journal on this subject anti tobacco organizations were often also against consumption of alcoholic beverages reasons hitler s attitude towards smoking thumb left hitler encouraged his close associates to quit smoking adolf hitler was a heavy smoker in his early life he used to smoke 25 to 40 cigarettes daily but gave up habit concluding that it was a waste of money in later years hitler viewed smoking as decadent and wrath of red man against white man vengeance for having been given hard liquor lamenting that so many excellent men have been lost to tobacco poisoning he was unhappy because both eva braun and martin bormann were smokers and was concerned over hermann goring s continued smoking in public places he was angered when a statue portraying a cigar smoking goring was commissioned hitler is often considered to be first national leader to advocate nonsmoking however james vi and i king of scotland and england was openly against smoking 330 years prior hitler disapproved of military personnel s freedom to smoke and during world war ii he said on 2 march 1942 it was a mistake traceable to army leadership at time at beginning of war he also said that it was not correct to say that a soldier cannot live without smoking he promised to end use of tobacco in military after end of war hitler personally encouraged close friends not to smoke he even began to offer a gold watch to any of his inner circle who could quit however hitler s personal distaste for tobacco was only one of several catalysts behind anti smoking campaign economic and xenophobic reasons in twenties many german cigarette firms went bankrupt and market was increasingly dominated by a few large highly automated manufacturers by 1933 with high unemployment nazi party was attacking tobacco industry for having foreign and jewish connections and for competing with nazi party s own cigarette company reproductive and health policies nazi reproductive policies were a significant factor behind their anti tobacco campaign nazi leadership wanted german women to have as many children as possible articles and a major medical book published in 1930s observed an association between smoking in both men and women and lower fertility including more miscarriages idea that male fertility was also affected by smoking was not a new one at that time an article published in a german gynecology journal in 1943 stated that women smoking three or more cigarettes per day were more likely to remain childless compared to nonsmoking women a prominent physician during third reich said that smoking by pregnant women resulted in a higher rate of stillbirths and miscarriages a claim supported by modern research for nicotine using mothers fathers and their offspring this view was also promoted in a 1936 book by well known female racial agnes bluhm women who smoked were viewed as unsuitable to be wives and mothers in a german family werner of nazi party s amt office of racial politics said that a smoking mother s breast milk contained nicotine a claim that modern research has proven correct smoking women were also considered to be vulnerable to premature aging and loss of physical attractiveness smoking s effects on skin were studied at time smoking does make skin age faster and was known by 1940 to be linked to earlier death there was also concern that mutations caused by cigarette smoking would have irreversible long term effects on genetics of population tobacco was described as a genetic poison see epigenetic effects of smoking for modern research in nazi rhetoric these concerns were connected to racist theories about german germ plasm measures protecting non smokers especially children and mothers from passive smoking were tied to nazi s desire for healthy young soldiers and workers they were tied to concepts of volksgesundheit people s health and gesundheitspflicht duty to be healthy physical fitness was promoted and tobacco use was discouraged as incompatible with physical fitness antismoking campaigns were accompanied by other health campaigns such as discouraging consumption of alcohol especially during pregnancy and encouraging eating of fruit vegetables and whole wheat bread research research on tobacco s effects on population health were more advanced in germany than in any other nation by time nazis came to power while a link between smoking and cancers had been observed as early as 1700s first good statistical evidence that linked smoking to lung cancer and other illnesses was published in germany and eastern europe before nazi takeover though some say that link between lung cancer and tobacco was first proven in nazi germany physicians were also aware that smoking was responsible for cardiac diseases which were considered to be most serious disease resulting from smoking use of nicotine was sometimes considered to be responsible for increased reports of myocardial infarction in country in later years of world war ii researchers considered nicotine a factor behind coronary heart failures suffered by a significant number of military personnel in eastern front a pathologist of heer examined thirty two young soldiers who had died from myocardial infarction at front and documented in a 1944 report that all of them were enthusiastic smokers he cited opinion of pathologist franz buchner that cigarettes are a coronary poison of first order term passive smoking was coined in nazi germany by fritz lickint a researcher purged from his public position by nazis in 1934 for political reasons while in private practice lickint continued his research in 1935 he published der der bronchial cancer in smokers a follow up to his 1930 review tabak und als des tobacco and tobacco smoke as factors in carcinoma 1935 review attributed rapidly rising rates of cancers of airway to smoking in 1939 lickint published tabak und tobacco and body a book that ran to over 1200 pages giving a definitive review of existing research into physiological effects of tobacco it described smoking as a cause of cancers cardiovascular diseases changes in blood composition lowered fertility and mutations it described nicotine use as an addiction likening it to alcoholism and suggesting similar treatments it also suggested anti smoking public health measures including measures against passive smoking lickint was in military service from 1939 1945 he survived and continued his research after war further observational studies were done in nazi germany and wartime netherlands nazi germany supported epidemiological research on harmful effects of tobacco use hitler personally gave financial support to wissenschaftliches institut zur erforschung der tabakgefahren scientific institute for tobacco hazards research at university of jena in thuringia headed by karl astel established in 1941 it was most significant anti tobacco institute in nazi germany however it never had its own buildings or staff nor regular funding and overall its research into dangers of tobacco was limited and only of marginal scientific significance and repute further research into effects of tobacco on health was carried out with nazi funding in 1939 franz h muller a member of national socialist motor corps or nskk and nazi party published a study reporting a higher prevalence of lung cancer among smokers study had serious weaknesses in its methodology but study design problems were better addressed in subsequent studies dietrich eberhard also used case control epidemiological methods to study lung cancer among smokers in 1943 due to research institute and local political support including from fritz sauckel gauleiter of thuringia and leonardo conti reich health leader thuringia became a test bed for anti smoking measures most of which were never implemented elsewhere after 1941 nazi tobacco research was deliberately slowed along with other restrictions on anti tobacco publications at end of war fates of those involved in supporting and carrying out research varied kurt astel who was heavily involved in mass murder and research practices which would probably have seen him tried as a war criminal killed himself fritz sauckel was executed for crimes against humanity leonardo conti killed himself while awaiting trial for his involvement in mass murder of ill people hans reiter reich health office president was interned for two years and spent rest of his career in private practice others worked in field after war pharmacologist gustav continued work similar to that begun with funding from astel s institute with funding from cigarette company reemtsma fritz lickint was appointed to public hospital and teaching posts again after war many wartime research publications were never shipped abroad and after war pre war and wartime publications on nicotine were ignored even within germany post war researchers were unaware of earlier non english language studies they therefore duplicated case control studies showing association with illness before doing prospective cohort studies that established causality in 1950s there is a popular belief that american and british scientists first discovered health harms of tobacco in 1950s measures thumb upright right reine luft main journal of anti tobacco movement used puns and cartoons in its propaganda such as stating that smoking was a thing of devil a there was never a coherent nazi policy to impede smoking mostly measures were based on pre existing policies although in some places some stern measures were taken tobacco control policy was incoherent and ineffective and obvious measures were not taken tobacco controls were often not enforced smoking bans were widely ignored measures reached their peak in 1939 1941 after which some were rolled back or actively prevented there was great regional variation in tobacco policies making it possible to find wildly contradictory individual examples almost no anti smoking efforts were made in nazi austria for instance in jena thuringia very strong anti smoking measures were enacted due to power of karl astel there and his support from fritz sauckel gauleiter of thuringia and leonardo conti reich health leader these measures included first 20th century university campus smoking ban there were many small local anti tobacco measures which were often unapproved and indeed viewed negatively by nazi party nazi anti tobacco policies were not free of contradictions for example volksgesundheit people s health and gesundheitspflicht duty to be healthy policies were enforced in parallel with active distribution of cigarettes to people who nazis saw as deserving groups e g frontline soldiers members of hitler youth on other hand undeserving and stigmatized groups jews war prisoners were denied access to tobacco propaganda nazis used several public relations tactics to convince general population of germany not to smoke and gave variable support to non officially approved propaganda national and local government organizations party controlled organizations voluntary organizations and medical organizations were all involved messages differed propaganda by nazi party organizations generally described tobacco as harmful to women or young people while publications by medical professionals tended to describe health hazards of smoking in 1941 propaganda ministry issued orders to completely cease any anti tobacco propaganda in public with minor exceptions which had to be submitted for censorship public health office issued repeatedly made precise public statements about health harms of smoking under both gerhard wagner and his successor leonardo conti reich health office also issued warnings and reich bureau against dangers of alcohol and tobacco was founded in 1939 a bureau against dangers of alcohol and tobacco was formed anti smoking campaign undertaken by nazis also included health education deutsche government monopoly union also ran anti smoking campaigns an anti smoking speech by its head met with official disapproval anti smoking messages were sent to people in their workplaces often with help of hitler jugend hj and bund deutscher bdm well known health magazines like gesundes volk healthy people volksgesundheit people s health and gesundes leben healthy life also published warnings about health consequences of smoking and posters showing harmful effects of tobacco were displayed some anti smoking posters were unapproved and indeed censured by government editorials discussing issue of smoking and its effects were published in newspapers articles advocating nonsmoking were also published in magazines die recreational stimulants auf der wacht on guard and reine luft clean air out of these magazines reine luft was main journal of anti tobacco movement karl astel s institute for tobacco hazards research at jena university purchased and distributed hundreds of reprints from reine luft magazine was published by tobacco control activists it was later in 1941 ordered by propaganda ministry to moderate its tone and submit all material for pre approval restrictions were imposed on advertisement of tobacco products enacted on 7 december 1941 and signed by heinrich president of advertising council advertisements trying to depict smoking as harmless or as an expression of masculinity were banned ridiculing anti tobacco activists was also outlawed as was use of advertising posters along rail tracks in rural regions stadiums and racing tracks advertising by loudspeakers and mail was also prohibited a ban on tobacco advertising was decided against by max amann hitler s secretary reich leader for press and leader of party publishing company eher verlag however advertising restrictions remained in place even after 1941 and there was a plan to tighten them although proposals to restrict tobacco ads to statements of manufacturer brand and price were explicitly rejected by party nichtraucherschutz protection of non smokers nichtraucherschutz protection of non smokers from passive smoking was principle behind some bans in 1941 tobacco smoking in trams was outlawed in sixty german cities in 1944 smoking in buses and city trains was made illegal on personal initiative of hitler who feared female ticket collectors might be victims of passive smoking smoking was also banned not only in health care institutions but also in several public offices and in rest homes midwives were restricted from smoking while on duty smoking was also outlawed in bomb shelters however some shelters had separate rooms for smoking in 1939 nazi party outlawed smoking in all of its offices premises and heinrich himmler then chief of schutzstaffel ss restricted police personnel from smoking while they were on duty in 1938 reichspost imposed a ban on smoking women and children special care was taken to discourage pregnant women and youth from smoking president of medical association in germany announced german women don t smoke pregnant women and women below age of 25 and over age of 55 were not given tobacco ration cards during world war ii restrictions on selling tobacco products to women were imposed on hospitality and food retailing industry though restrictions on women smoking in restaurants were officially rejected by nazi party anti tobacco films aimed at women were publicly shown some local measures were quite strict for instance one district department of national socialist factory cell organization announced that it would expel female members who smoked publicly some women working in arms factories however were given special cigarette rations smoking was also banned inside many schools in july 1943 public smoking for persons under age of 18 was outlawed although under 18s were still allowed to purchase and privately smoke tobacco us and uk had less lenient regulations military regulations thumb left a wehrmacht soldier smokes in a trench in romania 1944 restrictions on smoking were also introduced in wehrmacht soldiers were not issued with more than six free cigarettes per day extra cigarettes were often sold to soldiers especially when there was no military advance or retreat in battleground however these were restricted to 50 for each person per month non smokers could receive alternative rations such as food and chocolate teenaged soldiers serving in 12th ss panzer division hitlerjugend composed of hitler youth members were given confectionery instead of tobacco products although other hitler youth members were given cigarettes wehrmacht s female auxiliary personnel were not given cigarette rations medical lectures were arranged to persuade military personnel to quit smoking in 1938 luftwaffe imposed a ban on smoking in 1939 heinrich himmler then chief of schutzstaffel ss restricted police personnel and ss officers from smoking while they were on duty jama also reported that hermann goering had banned soldiers from smoking when on streets on marches or only briefly off duty economic pressures thumb nazi sturmabteilung was funded by royalties from its own cigarette company with which it is strongly associated in this ad nazi paramilitary sa was funded by cigarette royalties after night of long knives reemtsma cigarette company paid a fixed fee a quarter million marks for first year to produce sa s permitted cigarettes a plan to establish a state tobacco monopoly was not carried out efforts were made to keep cigarettes freely available in inter war period cigarettes were made with tobacco from greece bulgaria and turkey pipe tobacco and cigar tobacco often came from overseas so war disrupted their availability tobacco industry worked closely with occupying forces in crimea where forced labour including child labour was used to harvest tobacco forced labour was used in cigarette manufacture with prison camps set up at some locations more cigarettes were made with less tobacco to stretch supply demand was also controlled undeserving groups were forbidden to enter and later from buying tobacco an ordinance enacted on 3 november 1941 raised tobacco taxes by approximately 80 95 of retail price it would be highest rise in tobacco taxes in germany until more than 25 years after collapse of nazi regime by 1941 tobacco taxes made up about a twelfth of state income and antismoking efforts were being discouraged despite these efforts in 1942 there was a shortage of tobacco and 2 3 of all german tobacco factories were shut down some to be converted into armaments factories tobacco went on ration smokers were not allowed to buy more than a limited amount cigarette consumption stopped rising rapidly and fell rapidly although number of smokers continued to rise countermeasures and obstacles thumb left cigarettes are present as propaganda minister joseph goebbels meets with heads of military propaganda units january 1941 later same year ministry issued orders to completely cease any anti tobacco propaganda in public with minor exceptions tobacco companies represented themselves as strong and early supporters of nazi cause they made unparalleled financial contributions to nazi causes sturmabteilung and other party organizations were repeatedly given six figure sums and hitler youth were given an aircraft one cigarette company paid over 12 3 million reichsmarks in bribes to hermann goring nazi sa founded its own cigarette company and violently promoted its own brands some senior nazi officials were opposed to anti tobacco measures hermann goering publicly smoked cigars despite hitler s opposition joseph goebbels felt that cigarettes were essential to war effort and as propaganda minister restricted anti tobacco propaganda arguing that anti smoking campaigns were incompatible with free cigarettes being issued to millions serving in military legal tobacco advertising and authority figures who smoked and denied dangers of smoking despite government regulations many women in germany regularly smoked including wives of many high ranking nazi officials for instance magda goebbels smoked even while she was being interviewed by a journalist eva braun also smoked tobacco industry worked to counter government campaign to prevent women from smoking and used smoking models in their advertisements fashion illustrations displaying women with cigarettes were often published in prominent publications such as beyers mode fur alle beyers fashion for all cover of popular song lili featured singer lale andersen holding a cigarette cigarette manufacturing companies in germany made several attempts to weaken scientific credibility of anti tobacco campaign they tried to depict anti tobacco movement as fanatic and unscientific they published new journals with titles such as chronica nicotiana and der tabak wissenschaftliche zeitschrift der internationalen gesellschaft or tobacco scientific journal of international tobacco scientific society one industry funded tobacco counter research institute was shut down by reich health leader leonardo conti another such academy was called academia nicotiana internationalis while some cigarette ads had been banned from nazi party publications due to jewish ownership publications lost money and early party needed money for election campaigning in june 1932 hitler personally made a deal for half a million marks worth of cigarette advertising effectiveness early anti smoking campaign was considered a failure and from 1933 to 1937 there was a rapid increase in tobacco consumption in germany rate of smoking in nation increased faster even than in neighboring france where anti tobacco movement was tiny and far less influential between 1932 and 1939 per capita cigarette consumption in germany increased from 570 to 900 per year while corresponding numbers for france were from 570 to 630 after 1938 war prevented publication of sales figures tobacco consumption rose until 1942 when tobacco went on ration due to supply shortages number of smokers continued to rise but smokers could not buy as many cigarettes so total tobacco consumption fell free and subsidized branded cigarettes were distributed to soldiers on both sides during world war ii as part of rations smoking rates rose more rapidly during war than in peacetime including among women serving in military participating in military deployments and physical and mental disability all make people more likely to smoke generally people who are already stressed anxious depressed or otherwise suffering from poor moods become addicted more easily and find quitting more difficult this is thought to be because nicotine withdrawal worsens mood in smokers with a nicotine hit briefly bringing mood back to baseline if due to pre existing mood problems baseline is lower then withdrawal is worse still per year in germany us year 1930 1935 1940 states1 039 smoking was common in wehrmacht a 1944 survey found that 87 of servicemen smoked 10 of servicemen had begun smoking while in military and only seven servicemen of thousand surveyed 0 7 had given it up however as in general population number of smokers rose while number of cigarettes smoked fell as a result of anti tobacco measures implemented in wehrmacht supply restriction taxes and propaganda total tobacco consumption by soldiers decreased between 1939 and 1945 average tobacco consumption per person among military personnel declined by 23 4 compared to immediate pre world war ii years number of servicemen who smoked 30 or more cigarettes per day well above theoretical maximum military ration of 7 7 cigarettes per day declined from 4 4 to 0 3 association with antisemitism and racism apart from public health concerns nazis were heavily influenced by ideology specifically movement was influenced by concepts of racial hygiene and bodily purity some nazi leaders believed that it was wrong for master race to smoke and that tobacco consumption was equal to racial degeneracy tobacco caused infertility and hereditary damage described in now obsolete terms as corrupt ion of germ plasm were considered problematic by nazis on grounds that they harmed german racial hygiene nazi anti tobacco activists often tried to depict tobacco as a vice of degenerate negroes nazis claimed that jews were responsible for introducing tobacco and its harmful effects seventh day adventist church in germany announced that smoking was an unhealthy vice spread by jews during opening ceremony of aforementioned wissenschaftliches institut zur erforschung der tabakgefahren in 1941 johann von leers editor of welt nordic world proclaimed that jewish capitalism was responsible for spread of tobacco use across europe he said that first tobacco on german soil was brought by jews and that they controlled tobacco industry in amsterdam principal european entry point of nicotiana after world war ii thumb at end of wwii a dutch child celebrates liberation by smoking a cigarette after collapse of nazi germany at end of world war ii illegal smuggling of tobacco became prevalent and anti smoking campaign started by nazis ceased to exist after fall of third reich in 1949 approximately 400 million cigarettes manufactured in united states entered germany illegally every month in 1954 nearly two billion swiss cigarettes were smuggled into germany and italy as part of marshall plan united states paid to send tobacco to germany free of charge amount of tobacco shipped into germany in 1948 was 24 000 tons and was as high as 69 000 tons in 1949 post war consumption in germany remained initially low due to poverty per capita yearly cigarette consumption in post war germany steadily rose from 460 in 1950 to 1 523 in 1963 nazi related rhetoric associating anti smoking measures with fascism has been fairly widely used in nicotine marketing except in germany where such comparisons have brought strong reactions historical research has been quoted in a selective manner which has been criticized by quoted historians in early 21st century this nazi rhetoric may be being supplanted by taliban related rhetoric associating anti smoking measures with theocracy it has been argued that nazi anti tobacco campaigns delayed effective nicotine addiction reduction measures by decades at end of 20th century anti tobacco campaign in germany was unable to approach level of nazi era climax in years 1939 41 and german tobacco health research was described by robert n proctor as muted modern germany has some of europe s least restrictive tobacco control policies and more germans both smoke and die of it in consequence which also leads to higher public health costs see also animal welfare in nazi germany health effects of tobacco
