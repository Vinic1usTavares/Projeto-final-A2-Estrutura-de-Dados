thumb pali aike pali aike volcanic field is a volcanic field in argentina which straddles border with chile it is part of a province of back arc volcanoes in patagonia which formed from processes involving collision of chile rise with peru chile trench it lies farther east than austral volcanic zone volcanic arc which forms andean volcanic belt at this latitude pali aike formed over a jurassic basin starting from late miocene as a consequence of regional tectonic events and local extension it consists of an older plateau basalt formation and younger volcanic centres in form of pyroclastic cones scoria cones maars and associated lava flows these vents often form local alignments along lineaments or faults volcanic field is noteworthy for presence of large amounts of xenoliths in its rocks and because maar laguna potrok aike is located here field was active starting from 3 78 million years ago latest eruptions occurred during holocene as indicated by burial of archeological artifacts laguna azul maar formed about 3 400 years before present geology and structure regional pali aike volcanic field spans border between argentina and chile northwest of strait most of field lies in argentina within santa cruz province chilean part is part of commune of san gregorio chile cities of rio gallegos and punta arenas lie northeast and southwest of pali aike respectively rio gallegos is about away from field and closest vent is only away from town vents are easily observed from town in addition national route 3 passes through field pali aike is part of patagonian back arc a province of plateau lavas of cenozoic age these plateau lavas are of alkaline to tholeiitic composition hawaiite trachyandesite and trachyte are present in smaller amounts from south to north these plateau lavas include pali aike itself meseta meseta de la muerte gran meseta central meseta buenos aires cerro pedrero meseta de pino and buta their activity began 16 million years ago when chile rise collided with peru chile trench and thus caused a tear in subducting slab and formation of a slab window beneath patagonia later it was suggested that slab rollback might instead be mechanism by which volcanism is triggered in pali aike region age trends of volcanism has been interpreted as indicating either a southward migration or a northeastward one in case of plateau lavas following movement of triple junction to north in that case pali aike would be an exception probably due to local tectonic effects however some older plateau lavas in north formed in response to an earlier ridge subduction event in eocene and paleocene farther west from pali aike lies actual andean volcanic arc in form of austral volcanic zone a chain of stratovolcanoes and one volcanic field this volcanic field fueguino is south america s southernmost volcano 2 9 2 5 million years old aike volcanic field is northwest and morro chico volcano about west of pali aike local pali aike volcanic field covers a surface area of and extends over from northwest to southeast it is formed by a plateau of lava flows that is up to thick in its northwestern reach and includes remnants of individual volcanic centres with an average relief of this plateau is formed by tables containing depressions and lakes and whose margins are steep dipping slopes that accumulate blocks at their feet volcanic rocks are emplaced atop tertiary sediments which are smoothened by glacial action some volcanic necks situated in west central part of field may be underground components of now eroded volcanic edifices among these volcanic necks are cuadrado domeyko gay and philippi hills which conspicuously stick out of surrounding plains alt a deep crater with brown coloured rocks thumb a vent close to laguna azul over 450 different monogenetic volcanoes are emplaced on lava plateau at elevations of above sea level and include maars tuff rings and scoria cones some of these are heavily eroded while southeastern part of field features fresh looking centres where they form basaltos del diablo these various centres rise between above surrounding terrain nested craters breached craters and fissure vents are common among various vents as well as lava flows but there has been little research on scoria cones pyroclastic cones in pali aike include aymond colorado dinero fell and negro vent cerro del diablo a pyroclastic cone is youngest volcano in field and emitted both aa lava and pahoehoe lava which have a fresh appearance and no soil cover vents are origins of lava flows which sometimes breach vents some flows are older and covered with soil while younger ones are not such young lava flows also have surface features including lava tunnels tumuli and a rugose surface individual volcanoes are subdivided into three groups which are referred to as u2 older centres and u3 for more recent vents plateau lavas are hence called u1 alt a blue lake within a crater like depression in landscape thumb laguna azul lake maars are depressions in ground which are encircled by a ring of sediment that rises above surrounding terrain they typically form where frozen or liquid water interacts with rising magma in pali aike there are about 100 of them with diameters ranging from to about periglacial ground is rich in ice and water which might explain why there are so many maars in pali aike notable among these lakes is laguna azul a crater lake which is located within a pyroclastic ring at side of a scoria cone this maar formed during three stages in three separate craters and is also source of a lava flow laguna potrok aike in comparison is much larger crater diameter of its rim is barely recognizable and appears to be more akin to a maar additional maars in southwestern part of field are so called west maar and east maar which contain lakes laguna salsa and laguna del respectively bismarck carlota los laguna salida laguna ana and lake a number of vents form various alignments usually along northwest southeast and east northeast west southwest lines some older centres show a north south pattern such alignments occur when local lineations act as a pathway for magma to ascend to crust and control not only position of vents but also shape of volcanoes forming on top of vents these lines match strike of magallanes fagnano fault zone and older patagonian austral rift faults within field have been active in tertiary and a graben in southwestern part of field has diverted lava flows rio gallegos and its tributary rio ci aike cross volcanic field from west to east and from southwest to northeast respectively terrain of field is highly permeable to water which later forms wetlands that attract a number of birds and springs that are used as a source of water maars are not only water bodies within field glacial lakes and lakes formed by wind deflation also exist some of these water bodies dry up late in summer allowing wind to remove sediments from their lakebeds which thus become origin of long dune fields active growth of such windstreaks has been observed in pali aike windstreaks are an uncommon occurrence on earth they are much more common on mars geology at southern end of south america antarctic plate subducts beneath south america at a rate of in peru chile trench this subduction process has caused adakitic volcanism on western margin of southernmost south america forming austral volcanic zone patagonia is a region where four tectonic plates antarctic plate nazca plate scotia plate and south america plate interact starting 4 million years ago chile rise collided with peru chile trench this collision originally occurred west of tierra del fuego but has since moved northward towards peninsula farther south interaction between scotia and south america plates gave rise to deseado and magallanes fagnano faults this fault system has since about 6 8 million years ago been subject to lateral spreading most likely volcanism was possible at pali aike only after this tectonic change composition pali aike volcanic field is mainly made up of basalt and basanite which form a sodium rich alkaline suite hawaiite is rare most important phase is olivine which also appears as xenocrysts other minerals include clinopyroxene diopside and plagioclase groundmass has a similar composition with addition of augite feldspar and magnetite and occasionally ilmenite and nepheline pali aike rocks typically contain ultramafic xenoliths containing augite dunite eclogite garnet harzburgite lherzolite peridotite phlogopite pyroxenite spinel and composition of these xenoliths indicates that they originated in both crust and mantle in addition rocks from pali aike contain inclusions of fluids consisting of carbon dioxide elemental composition is typical for alkaline intraplate basalts and has a strongly primitive magma signature various isotope ratios are typical for so called patagonian back arc basalts which are remote from andean volcanic belt and resemble ocean island basalts geochemistry of pali aike rocks has been interpreted as originating from melting of mantle peridotite along with fractionation of olivine and with residual garnet there is no trace of geochemical influence of adjacent andean volcanic belt and associated subduction zone slab window generated by chile rise s subduction passed at latitudes of pali aike about 4 5 million years ago volcanic activity commenced soon afterwards but time difference was enough for any subduction influenced mantle to be displaced by fresher mantle moving through window an older oceanic lithosphere which was emplaced during proterozoic paleozoic in area is also involved in magma genesis large amounts of xenoliths and primitiveness of magmas suggest that once they had formed they very quickly rose through crust to surface geologic record basement beneath pali aike contains magallanes basin of jurassic age which formed during breakup of gondwana and was later filled by volcanic and sedimentary rocks partly neoproterozoic deseado massif lies north of pali aike and may extend beneath field to tierra del fuego although there is no evidence that a precambrian basement exists in pali aike area during oligocene a marine transgression deposited patagonia formation and during miocene fluvial sediments formed santa cruz formation sedimentation ceased in region 14 million years ago probably because by that time rain shadow of andes was effective in area pali aike area was glaciated during middle pleistocene and glaciers eroded lava flows from that time in part on basis of dates of these lava flows it was established that older and larger glaciation bella vista glaciation occurred between 1 17 and 1 02 million years ago last glaciation cabo virgenes rio and vi i was less extensive but reached atlantic ocean at times this glaciation ended before 760 000 years ago there is no evidence of last glacial maximum glaciation glaciers in area climate and vegetation climate in region is windy and cold with mild winters owing to oceanic influence and dry bordering on semi desert with precipitation ranging this pattern is owing to closeness of antarctica and cold humboldt current and falklands current ocean currents as well as rain shadow of andes some maars and craters in pali aike have been site of research in form of sediment core analysis such as laguna azul laguna potrok aike and magallanes maar thumb landscape of pali aike regional vegetation is a grassland vegetation which also features shrubs dominant species are festuca in drier east and festuca pallescens in wetter west highly permeable basalts intercept precipitation forming active aquifers that feed into wetlands vegetation is not free of human influences in form of invasive european weeds and sheep farming eruptive history potassium argon dating has been used to constrain volcanic activity to between 3 78 and 0 17 million years ago spanning late pliocene to holocene a miocene volcanic stage basaltos bella vista crops out at northwestern end of volcanic field and is heavily eroded age of laguna potrok aike is not known with certainty but its minimum age on basis of sediment core data is 240 000 years before present volcanic deposits have covered archeological artifacts at pali aike cave indicating volcanic activity between 10 000 5 000 years before present global volcanism program mentions an eruption 5 550 2 500 bce sediment cores from laguna azul give an approximate age of 3 400 years before present suggesting that this vent formed during late holocene unusually for argentine volcanoes pali aike vents are fairly close to modern urban areas rio gallegos is only away archeology and human history early humans inhabited pali aike region especially various caves such as fell cave pali aike cave and de burro volcanic landscape has a reliable supply of water and offered refuge to these people they left petroglyphs and rock carvings behind even some ancient burials have been found availability of water and shelter may have drawn people to volcanic field in turn they might have settled rest of wider region starting from pali aike also weathered volcanic rocks from pali aike volcanic field were used as red pigments sheep farming occurs today in volcanic field pali aike volcanic field today is part of pali aike national park on chilean side and a few volcanic centres have been investigated as possible references external links category andean volcanic belt category volcanic fields category
