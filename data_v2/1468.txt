barton fink is a 1991 american independent period psychological thriller film written produced edited and directed by coen brothers set in 1941 it stars john turturro in title role as a young new york city playwright who is hired to write scripts for a film studio in hollywood and john goodman as charlie meadows insurance salesman who lives next door at run down hotel earle coens wrote screenplay for barton fink in three weeks while experiencing difficulty during writing of miller s crossing they began filming former soon after miller s crossing was finished film is influenced by works of several earlier directors particularly roman polanski s repulsion 1965 and tenant 1976 barton fink had its premiere at cannes film festival in may 1991 in a rare sweep it won palme d or as well as awards for best director and best actor turturro although film was a box office disappointment only grossing 6 million against its 9 million budget it received positive reviews and was nominated for 3 academy awards prominent themes of barton fink include writing process slavery and conditions of labor in creative industries superficial distinctions between high culture and low culture and relationship of intellectuals with common man diverse elements of film have led it to defy efforts at genre classification with work being variously referred to as a film noir a horror film a kunstlerroman and a buddy film it contains various literary allusions and religious overtones as well as references to many real life people and events most notably writers clifford odets and william faulkner of whom characters of barton fink and w p mayhew respectively are often seen as fictional representations several features of film s narrative particularly an image of a woman at beach which recurs throughout have sparked much commentary with coens acknowledging some intentional symbolic elements while denying an attempt to communicate any single message in film plot in 1941 up and coming broadway playwright barton fink turturro accepts a contract from capitol pictures in hollywood to write film scripts for a thousand dollars per week upon moving to los angeles fink settles into cheap hotel earle his room s only decoration is a small painting of a woman on beach arm raised to block sun fink is assigned to a wrestling film by his new boss jack lipnick lerner but he finds difficulty in writing for unfamiliar subject he is distracted by sounds coming from room next door and he phones front desk to complain his neighbor charlie meadows goodman is source of noise and visits fink to apologize as they talk fink proclaims his affection for common man and meadows describes his life as an insurance salesman thumb upright left coen brothers wrote role of charlie meadows for actor john goodman in part because of warm and friendly image that he projects for viewer still unable to proceed beyond first lines of his script fink consults producer ben geisler shalhoub for advice irritated frenetic geisler takes him to lunch and orders him to consult another writer for assistance fink accidentally meets novelist william mayhew mahoney in bathroom they briefly discuss movie writing and arrange a second meeting later in day fink later learns from mayhew s secretary audrey taylor davis that mayhew suffers from alcoholism and that taylor most of his scripts with one day left before his meeting with lipnick to discuss movie fink phones taylor and begs her for assistance taylor visits him at earle and they apparently have sex barton then confesses to meadows they did so fink awakens next morning to find that taylor had been violently murdered horrified he summons meadows and asks for help meadows is repulsed but disposes of body and orders fink to avoid contacting police after fink has a meeting with an unusually supportive lipnick meadows announces to fink that he is going to new york for several days and asks him to watch over a package he is leaving behind soon afterward fink is visited by two police detectives who inform him that meadows s real name is karl madman mundt mundt is a serial killer whose modus operandi is beheading his victims stunned fink places box on his desk without opening it and he begins writing feverishly fink produces entire script in one sitting and he goes out for a night of celebratory dancing fink returns to find detectives in his room who inform him of mayhew s murder and accuse fink of complicity with mundt as hotel is suddenly engulfed in flames mundt appears and kills detectives with a shotgun after which he mentions that he had paid a visit to fink s parents and uncle in new york fink leaves still burning hotel carrying box and his script shortly thereafter he attempts to telephone his family but there is no answer in a final meeting with lipnick fink s script is lambasted as a fruity movie about suffering and he is informed that he is to remain in los angeles although fink will remain under contract capitol pictures will not produce anything he writes until he grows up a little dazed fink wanders onto a beach still carrying package he meets a woman who looks just like one in picture on his wall at earle and she asks about box he tells her he does not know what it contains nor who owns it she then assumes pose from picture cast john turturro as barton fink john goodman as charlie meadows michael lerner as jack lipnick judy davis as audrey taylor john mahoney as w p mayhew tony shalhoub as ben geisler jon polito as lou breeze steve buscemi as chet david as garland stanford richard as detective christopher murney as detective deutsch production background and writing in 1989 film makers joel and ethan coen began writing script for a film eventually released as miller s crossing many threads of story became complicated and after four months they found themselves lost in process bergan pp 114 115 although biographers and critics later referred to it as writer s block see for example rowell p 104 and rita kempley s review in washington post coen brothers rejected this description it s not really case that we were suffering from writer s block joel said in a 1991 interview but our working speed had slowed and we were eager to get a certain distance from miller s crossing ciment and niogret p 172 they went from los angeles to new york and began work on a different project bergan p 115 thumb left coen brothers said of writing barton fink we didn t do any research actually at all allen p 60 in three weeks coens wrote a script with a title role written specifically for actor john turturro with whom they d been working on miller s crossing new film barton fink was set in a large seemingly abandoned hotel this setting which they named hotel earle was a driving force behind story and mood of new project while filming their 1984 film blood simple in austin texas coens had seen a hotel which made a significant impression we thought wow motel hell you know being condemned to live in weirdest hotel in world quoted in bergan p 140 writing process for barton fink was smooth they said suggesting that relief of being away from miller s crossing may have been a catalyst they also felt satisfied with overall shape of story which helped them move quickly through composition certain films come entirely in one s head we just sort of out barton fink quoted in bergan p 130 as a number of critics and journalists have noted joel and ethan sometimes finish each other s sentences actress kelly macdonald said in a featurette on dvd of no country for old men that they seem like one person with two heads thus many quotes in bergan biography are attributed to coens while writing coens created a second leading role with another actor in mind john goodman who had appeared in their 1987 comedy raising arizona his new character charlie was barton s next door neighbor in cavernous hotel even before writing coens knew how story would end and wrote charlie s final speech at start of writing process ciment and niogret p 177 script served its diversionary purpose and coens put it aside barton fink sort of washed out our brain and we were able to go back and finish miller s crossing quoted in bergan p 115 note singular brain despite plural possessive pronoun once production of first film was finished coens began to recruit staff to film barton fink turturro looked forward to playing lead role and spent a month with coens in los angeles to coordinate views on project i felt i could bring something more human to barton joel and ethan allowed me a certain contribution i tried to go a little further than they expected quoted in bergan p 131 as they designed detailed storyboards for barton fink coens began looking for a new cinematographer since their associate barry sonnenfeld who had filmed their first three films was occupied with his own directorial debut addams family coens had been impressed with work of english cinematographer roger deakins particularly interior scenes of 1988 film stormy monday after screening other films he had worked on including sid and nancy and s island they sent a script to deakins and invited him to join project his agent advised against working with coens but deakins met with them at a cafe in notting hill and they soon began working together on barton fink ciment and niogret p 180 bergan pp 138 139 filming thumb right restaurant scenes set in new york at start of barton fink were filmed inside rms queen mary ocean liner bergan p 130 filming began in june 1990 and took eight weeks a third less time than required by miller s crossing and estimated final budget for film was us 9 million bergan pp 140 141 coens worked well with deakins and they easily translated their ideas for each scene onto film there was only one moment we surprised him joel coen recalled later an extended scene called for a tracking shot out of bedroom and into a sink drain plug hole in adjacent bathroom as a symbol of sexual intercourse shot was a lot of fun and we had a great time working out how to do it joel said after that every time we asked roger to do something difficult he would raise an eyebrow and say don t be having me track down any plug holes now quoted in bergan p 139 three weeks of filming were spent in hotel earle a set created by art director dennis gassner film s climax required a huge spreading fire in hotel s hallway which coens originally planned to add digitally in post production when they decided to use real flames however crew built a large alternative set in an abandoned aircraft hangar at long beach a series of gas jets were installed behind hallway and wallpaper was perforated for easy penetration as goodman ran through hallway a man on an overhead catwalk opened each jet giving impression of a fire racing ahead of charlie each take required a rebuild of apparatus and a second hallway sans fire stood ready nearby for filming pick up shots between takes final scene was shot near zuma beach as was image of a wave crashing against a rock coens edited film themselves as is their custom we prefer a hands on approach joel explained in 1996 rather than sitting next to someone and telling them what to cut ciment and niogret p 191 because of rules for membership in film production guilds they are required to use a pseudonym roderick jaynes is credited with editing barton fink yuan jada roderick jaynes imaginary oscar nominee for no country new york entertainment january 22 2008 new york magazine retrieved on november 20 2008 introduction to screenplay book for barton fink was written by roderick jaynes in a satirical preview it calls plot crushingly tedious only a few filmed scenes were removed from final cut including a transition scene to show barton s movement from new york to hollywood in film this is shown with a wave crashing against a rock several scenes representing work in hollywood studios were also filmed but edited out because they were too conventional ciment and niogret pp 179 180 setting thumb right peeling wallpaper in barton s room was designed to mimic pus dripping from charlie s infected ear there is a sharp contrast between fink s living quarters and polished pristine environs of hollywood especially home of jack lipnick spooky inexplicably empty feel of hotel earle was central to coens conception of film we wanted an art deco stylization joel explained in a 1991 interview and a place that was falling into ruin after having seen better days ciment and niogret p 179 barton s room is sparsely furnished with two large windows facing another building coens later described hotel as a ghost ship floating adrift where you notice signs of presence of other passengers without ever laying eyes on any in film residents shoes are an indication of this unseen presence another rare sign of other inhabitants is sound from adjacent rooms rowell p 113 palmer pp 124 125 joel said you can imagine it peopled by failed commercial travelers with pathetic sex lives who cry alone in their rooms heat and moisture are other important elements of setting wallpaper in barton s room peels and droops charlie experiences same problem and guesses heat is cause coens used green and yellow colors liberally in designing hotel to suggest an aura of putrefaction atmosphere of hotel was meant to connect with character of charlie as joel explained our intention moreover was that hotel function as an of character played by john goodman sweat drips off his forehead like paper peels off walls at end when goodman says that he is a prisoner of his own mental state that this is like some kind of hell it was necessary for hotel to have already suggested something infernal peeling wallpaper and paste which seeps through it also mirror charlie s chronic ear infection and resultant pus rowell p 124 when barton first arrives at hotel earle he is asked by friendly bellhop chet steve buscemi if he is a trans or a res transient or resident barton explains that he isn t sure but will be staying indefinitely coen and coen p 14 dichotomy between permanent inhabitants and guests reappears several times notably in hotel s motto a day or a lifetime which barton notices on room s stationery this idea returns at end of film when charlie describes barton as a tourist with a typewriter his ability to leave earle while charlie remains is presented by critic erica rowell as evidence that barton s story represents process of writing itself barton she says represents an author who is able to leave a story while characters like charlie cannot thumb left coens chose to set barton fink at time of attack on pearl harbor to indicate that world outside hotel was finding itself on eve of apocalypse in contrast offices of capitol pictures and lipnick s house are pristine lavishly decorated and extremely comfortable company s rooms are bathed in sunlight and ben geisler s office faces a lush array of flora barton meets lipnick in one scene beside an enormous spotless swimming pool this echoes his position as studio head as he explains you can t always be honest not with sharks swimming around this town if i d been totally honest i wouldn t be within a mile of this pool unless i was cleaning it coen and coen p 92 in his office lipnick showcases another trophy of his power statues of atlas titan of greek mythology who declared war on gods of mount olympus and was severely punished rowell p 131 barton watches dailies from another wrestling film being made by capitol pictures date on clapperboard is december 9 two days after attack on pearl harbor later when barton celebrates completed script by dancing at a uso show he is surrounded by soldiers rowell p 130 in lipnick s next appearance he wears a colonel s uniform which is really a costume from his company lipnick has not actually entered military but declares himself ready to fight little yellow bastards coen and coen p 128 originally this historical moment just after united states entered world war ii was to have a significant impact on hotel earle as coens explained w e were thinking of a hotel where lodgers were old people insane physically handicapped because all others had left for war further script was developed more this theme got left behind but it had led us in beginning to settle on that period ciment and niogret pp 172 173 picture thumb right ethan coen said in a 1991 interview that woman on beach in barton s room above was meant to give feeling of consolation one critic calls her presence in final scene below a parody of form rowell p 109 picture in barton s room of a woman at beach is a central focus for both character and camera he examines it frequently while at his desk and after finding audrey s corpse in his bed he goes to stand near it image is repeated at end of film when he meets an identical looking woman at an identical looking beach who strikes an identical pose after complimenting her beauty he asks her are you in pictures she blushes and replies don t be silly coen and coen pp 132 133 coens decided early in writing process to include picture as a key element in room our intention joel explained later was that room would have very little decoration that walls would be bare and that windows would offer no view of any particular interest in fact we wanted only opening on exterior world to be this picture it seemed important to us to create a feeling of isolation ciment and niogret pp 174 175 later in film barton places into frame a small picture of charlie dressed in a fine suit and holding a briefcase juxtaposition of his neighbor in uniform of an insurance salesman and escapist image of woman on beach leads to a confusion of reality and fantasy for barton critic michael dunne notes v can only wonder how real charlie is in film s final shot viewers must wonder how real woman is question leads to others how real is fink lipnick audrey mayhew how real are films anyway dunne pp 308 309 picture s significance has been subject of broad speculation washington post reviewer desson howe said that despite its emotional impact final scene feels more like a punchline for punchline s sake a trumped up coda howe desson barton fink washington post august 23 1991 washington post company retrieved november 20 2008 in her book length analysis of coen brothers films rowell suggests that barton s fixation on picture is ironic considering its low culture status and his own pretensions toward high culture speeches to contrary notwithstanding she further notes that camera focuses on barton himself as much as picture while he gazes at it at one point camera moves past barton to fill frame with woman on beach this tension between objective and subjective points of view appears again at end of film when barton finds himself in a sense inside picture rowell p 112 critic m keith booker calls final scene an enigmatic comment on representation and relationship between art and reality he suggests that identical images point to absurdity of art which reflects life directly film transposes woman directly from art to reality prompting confusion in viewer booker asserts that such a literal depiction therefore leads inevitably to uncertainty booker pp 144 145 many critics noted that law of non contradiction an episode of coen produced tv series fargo based on their eponymous 1996 film features a reference to picture as episode s main character gloria sits at beach in shot and position similar to picture s episode s themes were also compared to barton fink s genre coens are known for making films that defy simple classification although they refer to their first film blood simple 1984 as a relatively straightforward example of detective fiction coens wrote their next script raising arizona 1987 without trying to fit a particular genre they decided to write a comedy but intentionally added dark elements to produce what ethan calls a pretty savage film ciment and niogret pp 159 168 their third film miller s crossing 1990 reversed this order mixing bits of comedy into a crime film yet it also subverts single genre identity by using conventions from melodrama love stories and political satire rowell p 99 this trend of mixing genres continued and intensified with barton fink 1991 coens insist film does not belong to any genre ethan has described it as a buddy movie for 90s allen p 56 it contains elements of comedy film noir and horror but other film categories are present rowell p 106 actor turturro referred to it as a coming of age story while literature professor and film analyst r barton palmer calls it a kunstlerroman highlighting importance of main character s evolution as a writer palmer p 119 critic donald lyons describes film as a retro surrealist vision lyons p 85 because it crosses genres fragments characters experiences and resists straightforward narrative resolution barton fink is often considered an example of postmodernist film in his book postmodern hollywood booker says film renders past with an impressionist technique not a precise accuracy this technique he notes is typical of postmodern film which views past not as prehistory of present but as a warehouse of images to be raided for material booker p 144 in his analysis of coens films palmer calls barton fink a postmodern pastiche which closely examines how past eras have represented themselves he compares it to hours 2002 a film about virginia woolf and two women who read her work he asserts that both films far from rejecting importance of past add to our understanding of it he quotes literary theorist linda hutcheon kind of postmodernism exhibited in these films does not deny existence of past it does question whether we can ever know that past other than through its remains palmer p 107 emphasis is in palmer he does not indicate if it is original or added certain elements in barton fink highlight veneer of postmodernism writer is unable to resolve his modernist focus on high culture with studio s desire to create formulaic high profit films resulting collision produces a fractured story arc emblematic of postmodernism palmer p 108 coens cinematic style is another example when barton and audrey begin making love camera pans away to bathroom then moves toward sink and down its drain rowell calls this a postmodern update of notorious sexually suggestive image of a train entering a tunnel used by director alfred hitchcock in his film north by northwest 1959 rowell p 117 style thumb upright left influence of film maker alfred hitchcock appears several times in movie in one scene barton s eyeglasses reflect a wrestling scene this echoes a shot from hitchcock s film notorious 1946 rowell p 129 barton fink uses several stylistic conventions to accentuate story s mood and give visual emphasis to particular themes for example opening credits roll over hotel earle s wallpaper as camera moves downward this motion is repeated many times in film especially pursuant to barton s claim that his job is to plumb depths while writing his first experiences in hotel earle continue this trope bellhop chet emerges from beneath floor carrying a shoe which he has presumably been polishing suggesting real activity is underground although barton s floor is presumably six floors above lobby interior of elevator is shown only while it is descending these elements combined with many dramatic pauses surreal dialogue and implied threats of violence create an atmosphere of extreme tension coens explained that whole movie was supposed to feel like impending doom or catastrophe and we definitely wanted it to end with an apocalyptic feeling bergan p 44 style of barton fink is also evocative and representative of films of 1930s and 1940s as critic michael dunne points out fink s heavy overcoat his hat his dark drab suits come realistically out of thirties but they come even more out of films of thirties dunne p 306 style of hotel earle and atmosphere of various scenes also reflect influence of pre world war ii film making even charlie s underwear matches that worn by his filmic hero jack at same time camera techniques used by coens in barton fink represent a combination of classic with original careful tracking shots and extreme close ups distinguish film as a product of late 20th century dunne pp 306 307 from start film moves continuously between barton s subjective view of world and one which is objective after opening credits roll camera pans down to barton watching end of his play soon we see audience from his point of view cheering wildly for him as he walks forward he enters shot and viewer is returned to an objective point of view this blurring of subjective and objective returns in final scene rowell pp 107 109 shifting point of view coincides with film s subject matter film making film begins with end of a play and story explores process of creation this approach is emphasized by camera s focus in first scene on barton who is mouthing words spoken by actors offscreen not on play he is watching as rowell says t hough we listen to one scene we watch another separation of sound and picture shows a crucial dichotomy between two views of artifice world created by protagonist his play and world outside it what goes into creating a performance rowell p 111 film also employs numerous foreshadowing techniques signifying probable contents of package charlie leaves with barton word head appears 60 times in original screenplay rowell p 116 in a grim nod to later events charlie describes his positive attitude toward his job of selling insurance fire theft and casualty are not things that only happen to other people rowell p 115 symbolism much has been written about symbolic meanings of barton fink rowell proposes that it is a figurative head swelling of ideas that all lead back to artist proximity of sex scene to audrey s murder prompts lyons to insist sex in barton fink is death lyons p 128 others have suggested that second half of film is an extended dream sequence ciment and niogret p 175 coens however have denied any intent to create a systematic unity from symbols in film we never ever go into our films with anything like that in mind joel said in a 1998 interview there s never anything approaching that kind of specific intellectual breakdown it s always a bunch of instinctive things that feel right for whatever reason allen p 94 coens have noted their comfort with unresolved ambiguity ethan said in 1991 barton fink does end up telling you what s going on to extent that it s important to know what isn t crystal clear isn t intended to become crystal clear and it s fine to leave it at that allen p 58 regarding fantasies and dream sequences he said homoerotic overtones of barton s relationship with charlie are not unintentional although one detective demands to know if they had some sick sex thing their intimacy is presented as anything but deviant and cloaked in conventions of mainstream sexuality charlie s first friendly overture toward his neighbor for example comes in form of a standard pick up line i d feel better about damned inconvenience if you d let me buy you a drink rowell p 129 she notes that barton s reply is also sexual okay a quick one wrestling scene between barton and charlie is also cited as an example of homoerotic affection we consider that a sex scene joel coen said in 2001 allen p 179 sound and music many of sound effects in barton fink are laden with meaning for example barton is summoned by a bell while dining in new york city its sound is light and pleasant by contrast eerie sustained bell of hotel earle rings endlessly through lobby until chet silences it rowell p 123 nearby rooms of hotel emit a constant chorus of guttural cries moans and assorted unidentifiable noises these sounds coincide with barton s confused mental state and punctuate charlie s claim that i hear everything that goes on in this dump applause in first scene foreshadows tension of barton s move west mixed as it is with sound of an ocean wave crashing an image which is shown onscreen soon thereafter thumb right coen brothers were contacted by aspca or some animal thing before filming began they d gotten hold of a copy of script and wanted to know how we were going to treat mosquitoes i m not kidding allen p 59 another symbolic sound is hum of a mosquito although his producer insists that these parasites don t live in los angeles since mosquitos breed in swamps this is a desert coen and coen p 69 its distinctive sound is heard clearly as barton watches a bug circle overhead in his hotel room later he arrives at meetings with mosquito bites on his face insect also figures prominently into revelation of audrey s death barton slaps a mosquito feeding on her corpse and suddenly realizes she has been murdered high pitch of mosquito s hum is echoed in high strings used for film s score rowell p 121 in an elaborate dissection she suggests that mosquito helps convey congenital of reality in fiction she also notes a similarity to unlikely presence of flies in a businessman s airtight office in raising arizona during filming coens were contacted by an animal rights group who expressed concern about how mosquitoes would be treated score was composed by carter burwell who has worked with coens since their first film unlike earlier projects however irish folk tune used for miller s crossing and an american folk song as basis for raising arizona burwell wrote music for barton fink without a specific inspiration ciment and niogret p 189 score was released in 1996 on a compact disc combined with score for coens film fargo 1996 several songs used in film are laden with meaning at one point mayhew stumbles away from barton and audrey drunk as he wanders he hollers folk song old black joe 1853 composed by stephen foster it tells tale of an elderly slave preparing to join his friends in a better land mayhew s rendition of song coincides with his condition as an oppressed employee of capitol pictures and it foreshadows barton s own situation at film s end rowell pp 126 127 when he finishes writing his script barton celebrates by dancing at a united service organizations uso show song used in this scene is a rendition of down south camp meeting a swing tune its lyrics unheard in film state git ready sing here they come choir s all set these lines echo title of barton s play bare ruined choirs as celebration erupts into a melee intensity of music increases and camera zooms into cavernous hollow of a trumpet this sequence mirrors camera s zoom into a sink drain just before audrey is murdered earlier in film sources inspirations and allusions inspiration for film came from several sources and it contains allusions to many different people and events for example title of barton s play bare ruined choirs comes from line four of sonnet 73 by william shakespeare poem s focus on aging and death connects to film s exploration of artistic difficulty lyons p 127 rowell p 125 later at one point in picnic scene as mayhew wanders drunkenly away from barton and audrey he calls out silent upon a peak in darien this is last line from john keats s sonnet on first looking into chapman s homer 1816 literary reference not only demonstrates character s knowledge of classic texts but poem s reference to pacific ocean matches mayhew s announcement that he will jus walk on down to pacific and from there i ll improvise rowell p 128 context of poem also mirrors mayhew s condition as a silent artist unable or unwilling to write for a variety of reasons other academic allusions are presented elsewhere often with extreme subtlety for example a brief shot of title page in a mayhew novel indicates publishing house of swain and pappas this is likely a reference to marshall swain and george pappas philosophers whose work is concerned with themes explored in film including limitations of knowledge and nature of being rowell p 125 one critic notes that barton s fixation on stain across ceiling of his hotel room matches protagonist s behavior in flannery o connor s short story enduring chill allen p xv critics have suggested that film indirectly references work of writers dante alighieri through use of divine comedy imagery and johann wolfgang von goethe through presence of faustian bargains booker p 143 see also dunne p 310 confounding bureaucratic structures and irrational characters like those in novels of franz kafka appear in film but coens insist connection was not intended i have not read him since college admitted joel in 1991 when i devoured works like metamorphosis others have mentioned castle and in penal colony but i ve never read them ciment and niogret pp 176 177 clifford odets character of barton fink is loosely based on clifford odets a playwright from new york who in 1930s joined group theatre a gathering of dramatists which included harold clurman cheryl crawford and lee strasberg their work emphasized social issues and employed s system of acting to recreate human experience as truthfully as possible several of odets plays were successfully performed on broadway including awake and sing and waiting for lefty both in 1935 when public tastes turned away from politically engaged theatre and toward familial realism of eugene o neill odets had difficulty producing successful work so he moved to hollywood and spent 20 years writing film scripts palmer pp 114 116 thumb left upright resemblance of clifford odets to actor john turturro is striking according to critic r barton palmer palmer pp 119 120 coens wrote with odets in mind they imagined barton fink as a serious dramatist honest politically engaged and rather naive ciment and niogret p 173 as ethan said in 1991 it seemed natural that he comes from group theater and decade of thirties like odets barton believes that theatre should celebrate trials and triumphs of everyday people like barton odets was highly egotistical rowell p 125 she notes that odets purportedly proclaimed to new york times that he was most talented dramatist in film a review of barton s play bare ruined choirs indicates that his characters face a brute struggle for existence in most squalid corners this wording is similar to comment of biographer gerald that odets characters struggle for life amidst petty conditions lines of dialogue from barton s work are reminiscent of odets play awake and sing for example one character declares i m awake now awake for first time another says take that ruined choir make it sing quoted in palmer p 119 however many important differences exist between two men joel coen said both writers wrote same kind of plays with proletarian heroes but their personalities were quite different odets was much more of an extrovert in fact he was quite sociable even in hollywood and this is not case with barton fink although he was frustrated by his declining popularity in new york odets was successful during his time in hollywood several of his later plays were adapted by him and others into films one of these big knife 1955 matches barton s life much more than odets in it an actor becomes overwhelmed by greed of a film studio which hires him and eventually commits suicide palmer pp 116 117 another similarity to odets work is audrey s death which mirrors a scene in deadline at dawn 1946 a film noir written by odets in that film a character awakens to find that woman he bedded night before has been inexplicably murdered bergan p 137 odets chronicled his difficult transition from broadway to hollywood in his diary published as time is ripe 1940 journal of clifford odets 1988 diary explored odets philosophical deliberations about writing and romance he often invited women into his apartment and he describes many of his affairs in diary these experiences like extended speeches about writing are echoed in barton fink when audrey visits and seduces barton at hotel earle palmer pp 115 116 turturro was only member of production who read odets journal however and coen brothers urge audiences to take account of difference between character and man william faulkner thumb right upright actor john mahoney was selected for part of w p mayhew because of his resemblance to william faulkner pictured some similarities exist between character of w p mayhew and novelist william faulkner like mayhew faulkner became known as a preeminent writer of southern literature and later worked in film business like faulkner mayhew is a heavy drinker and speaks contemptuously about hollywood faulkner s name appeared in hollywood 1940s history book city of nets which coens read while creating barton fink ethan explained in 1998 i read this story in passing that faulkner was assigned to write a wrestling picture that was part of what got us going on whole barton fink thing allen p 122 faulkner worked on a wrestling film called flesh 1932 which starred wallace beery actor for whom barton is writing bergan p 134 dunne p 306 focus on wrestling was fortuitous for coens as they participated in sport in high school however coens disavow a significant connection between faulkner and mayhew calling similarities superficial as far as details of character are concerned ethan said in 1991 mayhew is very different from faulkner whose experiences in hollywood were not same at all unlike mayhew s inability to write due to drink and personal problems faulkner continued to pen novels after working in film business winning several awards for fiction completed during and after his time in hollywood jack lipnick lerner s academy award nominated character of studio mogul jack lipnick is a composite of several hollywood producers including harry cohn louis b mayer and jack l warner three of most powerful men in film industry at time in which barton fink is set bergan p 133 rowell p 104 like mayer lipnick is originally from belarusian capital city minsk when world war ii broke out warner pressed for a position in military and ordered his wardrobe department to create a military uniform for him lipnick does same in his final scene warner once referred to writers as schmucks with underwoods leading to barton s use in film of an underwood typewriter ciment and niogret p 174 bergan p 134 at same time coens stress that labyrinth of deception and difficulty barton endures is not based on their own experience although joel has said that artists tend to meet up with philistines he added barton fink is quite far from our own experience our professional life in hollywood has been especially easy and this is no doubt extraordinary and unfair ethan has suggested that lipnick like men on which he is based is in some ways a product of his time i don t know that that kind of character exists anymore hollywood is a little more bland and corporate than that now allen p 145 cinema coens have acknowledged several cinematic inspirations for barton fink chief among these are three films by polish french film maker roman polanski repulsion 1965 cul de sac 1966 and tenant 1976 these films employ a mood of psychological uncertainty coupled with eerie environments that compound mental instability of characters barton s isolation in his room at hotel earle is frequently compared to that of in his apartment in tenant allen p 56 palmer p 110 ethan said regarding genre of barton fink i t is kind of a polanski movie it is closer to that than anything else rowell p 122 by coincidence polanski was head of jury at cannes film festival in 1991 where barton fink premiered this created an awkward situation obviously joel coen said later we have been influenced by his films but at this time we were very hesitant to speak to him about it because we did not want to give impression we were sucking up ciment and niogret p 176 other works cited as influences for barton fink include film shining 1980 produced and directed by stanley kubrick and comedy sullivan s travels 1941 written and directed by preston sturges allen p xv rowell pp 122 123 set in an empty hotel kubrick s film concerns a writer unable to proceed with his latest work although coens approve of comparisons to shining joel suggests that kubrick s film belongs in a more global sense to horror film genre sullivan s travels released year in which barton fink is set follows successful director john sullivan who decides to create a film of deep social import not unlike barton s desire to create entertainment for common man sullivan eventually decides that comedic entertainment is a key role for film makers similar to jack lipnick s assertion at end of barton fink that audience wants to see action adventure bergan pp 137 138 additional allusions to films and film history abound in barton fink at one point a character discusses victor soderberg name is a reference to victor sjostrom a swedish director who worked in hollywood under name victor bergan p 134 charlie s line about how his troubles don t amount to a hill of beans is a probable homage to film casablanca 1942 another similarity is that of barton fink s beach scene to final moment in la dolce vita 1960 wherein a young woman s final line of dialogue is obliterated by noise of ocean bergan p 141 unsettling emptiness of hotel earle has also been compared to living spaces in key largo 1948 and sunset boulevard 1950 themes two of film s central themes culture of entertainment production and writing process are intertwined and relate specifically to self referential nature of work as well as work within work it is a film about a man who writes a film based on a play and at centre of barton s entire opus is barton himself dialogue in his play bare ruined choirs also first lines of film some of which are repeated at end of film as lines in barton s screenplay give us a glimpse into barton s self descriptive art mother in play is named lil which is later revealed to be name of barton s own mother in play kid a representation of barton himself refers to his home six flights up same floor where barton resides at hotel earle moreover characters writing processes in barton fink reflect important differences between culture of entertainment production in new york s broadway district and hollywood rowell pp 108 110 broadway and hollywood although barton speaks frequently about his desire to help create a new living theater of and about and for common man he does not recognize that such a theater has already been created films in fact he disdains this authentically popular form on other hand world of broadway theatre in barton fink is a place of high culture where creator believes most fully that his work embodies his own values although he pretends to disdain his own success barton believes he has achieved a great victory with bare ruined choirs he seeks praise when his agent garland asks if he has seen glowing review in herald barton says no even though his producer had just read it to him barton feels close to theatre confident that it can help him create work that honors common man men and women who funded production those people as barton calls them demonstrate that broadway is just as concerned with profit as hollywood but its intimacy and smaller scale allow author to feel that his work has real value rowell p 106 palmer p 119 thumb left in film hollywood demonstrates many forms of what author nancy lynn schwartz describes as forms of economic and psychological manipulation used to retain absolute control quoted in rowell p 131 barton does not believe hollywood offers same opportunity in film los angeles is a world of false fronts and phony people this is evident in an early line of screenplay filmed but not included in theatrical is included as a deleted scene in home video editions while informing barton of capitol pictures offer his agent tells him i m only asking that your decision be informed by a little realism if i can use that word and hollywood in same breath quoted in rowell p 106 later as barton tries to explain why he is staying at earle studio head jack lipnick finishes his sentence recognizing that barton wants a place that is less hollywood assumption is that hollywood is fake and earle is genuine producer ben geisler takes barton to lunch at a restaurant featuring a mural of new york cafe a sign of hollywood s effort to replicate authenticity of east coast of united states lipnick s initial overwhelming exuberance is also a facade although he begins by telling barton writer is king here at capitol pictures in penultimate scene he insists if your opinion mattered then i guess i d resign and let you run studio it doesn t and you won t and lunatics are not going to run this particular asylum coen and coen p 128 original emphasis deception in barton fink is emblematic of hollywood s focus on low culture its relentless desire to efficiently produce formulaic entertainment for sole purpose of economic gain capitol pictures assigns barton to write a wrestling picture with superstar wallace beery in leading role although lipnick declares otherwise geisler assures barton that it s just a b picture audrey tries to help struggling writer by telling him look it s really just a formula you don t have to type your soul into it quoted in palmer p 126 this formula is made clear by lipnick who asks barton in their first meeting whether main character should have a love interest or take care of an orphaned child barton shows his iconoclasm by answering both maybe palmer pp 121 122 in end his inability to conform to studio s norms destroys barton a similar depiction of hollywood appears in nathanael west s novel day of locust 1939 which many critics see as an important precursor to barton fink palmer pp 117 119 rowell p 107 bergan p 133 set in a run down apartment complex book describes a painter reduced to decorating film sets it portrays hollywood as crass and exploitative devouring talented individuals in its neverending quest for profit in both west s novel and barton fink protagonists suffer under oppressive industrial machine of film studio palmer pp 117 119 he adds while borrowing heavily from west s ideas barton fink notably expands novelist s critique writing film contains further self referential material as a film about a writer having difficulty writing written by coen brothers while they were having difficulty writing miller s crossing barton is trapped between his own desire to create meaningful art and capitol pictures need to use its standard conventions to earn profits audrey s advice about following formula would have saved barton but he does not heed it however when he puts mysterious package on his writing desk which might have contained her head she might have been helping him posthumously in other ways rowell p 108 she writes audrey s head has become his perverse muse film itself toys with standard screenplay formulae as with mayhew s scripts barton fink contains a good wrestler barton it seems and a bad wrestler charlie who confront each other at end but in typical coen fashion lines of good and evil are blurred and supposed hero in fact reveals himself to be deaf to pleadings of his common man neighbor by blurring lines between reality and surreal experience film subverts simple morality tales and road maps offered to barton as easy paths for writer to follow rowell pp 108 109 however film makers point out that barton fink is not meant to represent coens themselves our life in hollywood has been particularly easy they once said film isn t a personal comment bergan p 131 still universal themes of creative process are explored throughout film during picnic scene for example mayhew asks barton ain t peace barton pauses then says no i ve always found that writing comes from a great inner pain coen and coen p 56 such exchanges led critic william rodney allen to call barton fink an autobiography of life of coens minds not of literal fact allen s comment is itself a reference to phrase life of mind used repeatedly in film in wildly differing contexts fascism several of film s elements including setting at start of world war ii have led some critics to highlight parallels to rise of fascism at time for example detectives who visit barton at hotel earle are named and deutsch coen and coen p 102 italian and german names evocative of regimes of benito mussolini and adolf hitler their contempt for barton is clear fink that s a jewish name isn t it i didn t think this dump was restricted coen and coen p 106 later just before killing his last victim charlie says heil hitler coen and coen p 122 jack lipnick hails originally from belarusian capital city minsk which was occupied from 1941 by nazi germany following operation barbarossa rowell p 132 i t s not forcing issue to suggest that holocaust hovers over barton fink writes biographer ronald bergan others see a more specific message in film particularly barton s obliviousness to charlie s homicidal tendencies critic roger ebert wrote in his 1991 review that coens intended to create an allegory for rise of nazism they paint fink as an ineffectual and impotent left wing intellectual who sells out while telling himself he is doing right thing who thinks he understands common man but does not understand that for many common men fascism had a seductive appeal however he goes on to say it would be a mistake to insist too much on this aspect of movie other critics are more demanding m keith booker writes for their part coens deny any intention of presenting an allegorical message they chose detectives names deliberately but we just wanted them to be representative of axis world powers at time it just seemed kind of amusing it s a tease all that stuff with charlie heil hitler business sure it s all there but it s kind of a tease in 2001 joel responded to a question about critics who provide extended comprehensive analysis that s how they ve been trained to watch movies in barton fink we may have encouraged it like teasing animals at zoo movie is intentionally ambiguous in ways they may not be used to seeing allen p 181 slavery although subdued in dialogue and imagery theme of slavery appears several times in film mayhew s crooning of parlor song old black joe depicts him as enslaved to film studio not unlike song s narrator who pines for my friends from cotton fields away rowell pp 126 128 one brief shot of door to mayhew s workspace shows title of film he is supposedly writing slave ship this is a reference to a 1937 movie written by mayhew s inspiration william faulkner and starring wallace beery for whom barton is composing a script in film symbol of slave ship is furthered by specific set designs including round window in ben geisler s office which resembles a porthole as well as walkway leading to mayhew s bungalow which resembles boarding ramp of a watercraft several lines of dialogue make clear by film s end that barton has become a slave to studio t he contents of your head lipnick s assistant tells him are property of capitol pictures coen and coen p 93 after barton turns in his script lipnick delivers an even more brutal punishment anything you write will be property of capitol pictures and capitol pictures will not produce anything you write coen and coen p 129 this contempt and control is representative of opinions expressed by many writers in hollywood at time dunne p 305 as arthur miller said in his review of barton fink only thing about hollywood that i am sure of is that its mastication of writers can never be too wildly exaggerated quoted in dunne p 309 common man during first third of film barton speaks constantly of his desire to write work which centers on and appeals to common man in one speech he declares hopes and dreams of common man are as noble as those of any king it s stuff of life why shouldn t it be stuff of theater god damn it why should that be a hard pill to swallow don t call it new theater charlie call it real theater call it our theater coen and coen p 32 original emphasis yet despite his rhetoric barton is totally unable or unwilling to appreciate humanity of common man living next door to him later in film charlie explains that he has brought various horrors upon him because you don t listen coen and coen p 124 all caps emphasis and exclamation point in original in his first conversation with charlie barton constantly interrupts charlie just as he is saying i could tell you some stories demonstrating that despite his fine words he really is not interested in charlie s experiences in another scene barton symbolically demonstrates his deafness to world by stuffing his ears with cotton to block sound of his ringing telephone dunne p 308 barton s position as screenwriter is of particular consequence to his relationship with common man by refusing to listen to his neighbor barton cannot validate charlie s existence in his writing with disastrous results not only is charlie stuck in a job which him but he cannot at least in barton s case have his story told palmer p 118 more centrally film traces evolution of barton s understanding of common man at first he is an abstraction to be lauded from a vague distance then he becomes a complex individual with fears and desires finally he shows himself to be a powerful individual in his own right capable of extreme forms of destruction and therefore feared and or respected palmer p 121 complexity of common man is also explored through oft mentioned life of mind while expounding on his duty as a writer barton drones i gotta tell you life of mind there s no road map for that territory and exploring it can be painful kind of pain most people don t know anything about coen and coen p 49 life of mind phrase does not appear in screenplay at this time but is spoken in movie screenplay does include phrase during barton s first conversation with his agent garland but it is not included in film barton assumes that he is privy to thoughtful creative considerations while charlie is not this delusion shares film s climax as charlie runs through hallway of earle shooting detectives with a shotgun and screaming look upon me i ll show you life of mind coen and coen p 120 all capital letters and multiple exclamation points are in original text charlie s life of mind is no less complex than barton s in fact some critics consider it more so palmer p 127 rowell p 135 charlie s understanding of world is depicted as omniscient as when he asks barton about two lovebirds next door despite fact that they are several doors away when barton asks how he knows about them charlie responds seems like i hear everything that goes on in this dump pipes or somethin coen and coen p 65 his total awareness of events at earle demonstrate kind of understanding needed to show real empathy as described by audrey this theme returns when charlie explains in his final scene most guys i just feel sorry for yeah it tears me up inside to think about what they re going through how trapped they are i understand it i feel for em so i try to help them out rowell p 135 coen and coen p 123 religion themes of religious salvation and allusions to bible appear only briefly in barton fink but their presence pervades story while barton is experiencing his most desperate moment of confusion and despair he opens drawer of his desk and finds a gideon bible he opens it randomly to chapter 2 in book of daniel and reads from it and king nebuchadnezzar answered and said to chaldeans i recall not my dream if ye will not make known unto me my dream and its interpretation ye shall be cut in pieces and of your tents shall be made a dunghill coen and coen p 100 this wording differs slightly from king james text this passage reflects barton s inability to make sense of his own experiences wherein audrey has been cut in pieces as well as hopes and dreams of common man nebuchadnezzar is also title of a novel that mayhew gives to barton as a little entertainment to divert you in your sojourn among philistines coen and coen p 54 mayhew alludes to story of solomon s a reference to bathsheba who gave birth to solomon after her lover david had her husband uriah killed although audrey cuts mayhew off by praising his book which audrey herself may have written reference foreshadows love triangle which evolves among three characters of barton fink rowell points out that mayhew is murdered presumably by charlie soon after barton and audrey have sex rowell p 126 another biblical reference comes when barton flips to front of bible in his desk drawer and sees his own words transposed into book of genesis this is seen as a representation of his hubris as a self conceived omnipotent master of creation or alternatively as a playful juxtaposition demonstrating barton s hallucinatory state of mind reception awards and fink premiered in may 1991 at cannes film festival beating competition which included jacques rivette s la belle noiseuse spike lee s jungle fever and david mamet s homicide coen brothers film won three awards best director best actor and top prize palme d or this sweep of awards in major categories at cannes was extremely rare and some critics felt jury was too generous to exclusion of other worthy entries rowell p 104 bergan p 143 worried that triple victory could set a precedent which would undervalue other films cannes decided after 1991 festival to limit each movie to a maximum of two awards barton fink was also nominated for three academy awards best actor in a supporting role lerner best art direction dennis gassner nancy haigh and best costume design richard hornung lerner lost to jack palance for latter s role in city slickers awards for art direction gassner and haigh won by beating themselves and costume design went to bugsy film was also nominated for prestigious grand prix of belgian syndicate of cinema critics critical fink received positive

100 based on 19 critics indicating generally favorable reviews washington post critic rita kempley described barton fink as certainly one of year s best and most intriguing films new york times critic vincent canby called it an unqualified winner and a fine dark comedy of flamboyant style and immense though seemingly effortless technique critic jim emerson called barton fink coen brothers most deliciously provocatively indescribable picture yet allen p 55 some critics disliked abstruse plot and deliberately enigmatic ending chicago reader critic jonathan rosenbaum warned of coens adolescent and comic book cynicism and described barton fink as a midnight movie gross out in sunday afternoon art house clothing in a 1994 interview joel dismissed criticism of unclear elements in their films people have a problem dealing with fact that our movies are not straight ahead they would prefer that last half of barton fink just be about a screenwriter s writing block problems and how they get resolved in real world allen p 71 talk show host larry king expressed approval of movie despite its uncertain conclusion he wrote in usa today ending is something i m still thinking about and if they accomplished that i guess it worked quoted in rowell p 104 in a 2016 interview screenwriter charlie kaufman said after being asked which film he would want with him on a deserted island a movie i really love is barton fink i don t know if that s movie i d take to a desert island but i feel like there s so much in there you could watch it again and again that s important to me especially if that was only movie i d have with me for rest of my life barton fink was ranked by greg of indiewire as coens fifth best film it was voted 11th best film of 1990s in a poll of a v club contributors
