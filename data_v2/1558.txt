thumb upright 1 4 alt marchioness after collision showing upper saloon completely missing marchioness beached on north bank of river thames after she was raised from river bed marchioness disaster was a collision between two vessels on river thames in london in early hours of 20 august 1989 which resulted in deaths of 51 people pleasure steamer marchioness sank after being hit twice by dredger bowbelle at about 1 46 am between cannon street railway bridge and southwark bridge marchioness had been hired for evening for a birthday party and had about 130 people on board four of whom were crew and bar staff both vessels were heading downstream against tide bowbelle travelling faster than smaller vessel although exact paths taken by ships and precise series of events and their locations are unknown subsequent inquiry considered it likely that bowbelle struck marchioness from rear causing latter to turn to port where she was hit again then pushed along turning over and being pushed under bowbelles bow it took thirty seconds for marchioness to sink 24 bodies were found within ship when it was raised an investigation by marine accident investigation branch maib blamed a lack of lookouts but their report was criticised by families of victims as maib had not interviewed anyone on marchioness or bowbelle but relied on police interviews government refused to hold an inquiry despite pressure from families douglas henderson captain of bowbelle was charged with failing to have an effective lookout on vessel but two cases against him ended with a hung jury a private prosecution for manslaughter against four directors of south coast shipping company owners of bowbelle and corporate manslaughter against company was dismissed because of lack of evidence a formal inquiry in 2000 concluded that basic cause of collision is clear it was poor lookout on both vessels neither vessel saw other in time to take action to avoid collision criticism was also aimed at owners of both ships as well as department of transport and port of london authority collision and subsequent reports led to increased safety measures on thames and four new lifeboat stations were installed on river background marchioness pleasure boat marchioness was built in 1923 by salter brothers of oxford for joseph mears a businessman whose interests included running pleasure launches on river thames she was long and at beam and measured 46 19 gross tons she spent most of her life on thames including when she was requisitioned during second world war by thames hospital emergency service when she was stationed in dagenham her service included being one of little ships that aided in 1940 dunkirk evacuation marchioness was sold to thames launches in 1945 when mears s company was wound up she was purchased by tidal cruises ltd in 1978 and upper works were rebuilt to form an upper and lower saloon new upper saloon obstructed vision from wheelhouse and there was later inquiry established a lack of easily accessible emergency exits particularly from lower decks marchioness had seven life rafts each of which could support twenty people and seven lifebuoys each of which could support two people registered in london she was licensed to carry 165 passengers from early 1970s there was an increase in number of boats for evening or night time parties and discos and marchioness was part of this market marchioness carried a crew of two her captain was stephen faldo mate was andrew mcgowan on night of her sinking she also carried two members of bar staff faldo and mcgowan had a business partnership top bar enterprises which provided bar staff and drink for party faldo was 29 at time of sinking he had begun working on thames at age of 17 and had earned his full waterman s river licence in june 1984 he began work at tidal cruises in 1986 and became permanent captain of marchioness in 1987 he had forgotten to renew his riverman s licence in run up to night of collision and was technically not entitled to skipper vessel that night a later inquiry considered lack of licence was a minor point because he was undoubtedly qualified to do so and could have renewed his licence by paying 50 pence mcgowan age 21 became an apprentice to a waterman in june 1986 by february 1988 he had completed courses at port of london authority for and seamanship and obtained his apprentice licence in may 1988 he joined marchioness as a crew member around same time bowbelle thumb aggregate dredger bowbelle aggregate dredger bowbelle was launched in 1964 by ailsa shipbuilding company of troon scotland she was long and at beam her deadweight tonnage was and she measured 1 474 72 gross tons bowbelle was one of six bow ships owned by east coast aggregates limited they were managed by south coast shipping company limited east coast aggregates limited eca was part of larger rmc group a concrete products company bowbelle had a crew of nine a master two mates three engineers two able seamen and a cook ship s captain douglas henderson aged 31 undertook a deep sea apprenticeship until 1978 and joined eca in november 1987 when he became second mate on in may 1989 he became master of bowbelle vessels from eca including bowbelle had previously been involved in accidents on thames in july 1981 there was a collision between bowtrader and passenger launch pride of greenwich three months later bowtrader was involved in a collision with hurlingham another pleasure cruiser owned by tidal cruises bowbelle collided with cannon street railway bridge in may 1982 and following month was nearly in a collision with a passenger boat at time of collision with marchioness bowbelle was carrying aggregate and was trimmed down at stern this along with dredging equipment limited forward vision from bridge on 19 august 1989 henderson visited several public houses over a period of three and a half hours and drank six pints 3 4 l 120 imp fl oz of lager he returned to ship at 6 00 pm for food and a short sleep one of ship s company terence blayney who acted as forward lookout that night was with henderson and drank seven pints over same period jonathan phang and antonio de vasconcellos marchioness was hired for a party for night of 19 20 august 1989 it was organised by jonathan phang a photographic agent to celebrate 26th birthday of antonio de vasconcellos who worked in a merchant bank pair were good friends and business partners in a photographic agency phang paid ps695 to hire boat from 1 00 am to 6 00 am with extra for hire of disco food and drinks many of those at party were also in their twenties some were former students and others worked in fashion journalism modelling and finance plan was for marchioness to go downriver from embankment pier near charing cross railway station to tower bridge then back to charing cross to land some of passengers marchioness would then travel down to greenwich before returning again to charing cross arriving

points night of 19 20 august 1989 was a clear one it was three days after full moon and there was good visibility there was a negligible wind it was a spring tide recorded as one of highest of year and river was at half tide at time of collision it was running upriver at a rate of three knots there are several versions of paths taken by vessels in approach to southwark bridge and beyond and no agreement on point when two ships collided much of evidence gathered in later investigations was inconsistent and any descriptions of actions of ships are based on average speeds and likely positions at 1 12 am bowbelle left her berth at nine elms pier near battersea power station and radioed her move by vhf radio to thames navigation service tns based in woolwich she reported passing vauxhall bridge at 1 20 am and waterloo bridge at 1 35 am in accordance with usual procedure tns radioed all river traffic at 1 15 am and 1 45 am advising them of bowbelles downstream passage bowbelles average speed was about over ground marchioness was supposed to leave embankment pier at 1 00 am but was delayed until 1 25 am no count was made of number of passengers but accepted number on board is either 130 or 131 faldo was in wheelhouse where he stayed until collision heading downriver just before blackfriars bridge marchioness passed her sister pleasure cruiser hurlingham which was also hosting a disco that night and was also heading in same direction marchionesss average speed was about over ground she passed through central arch of blackfriars bridge at this point she was about in front of bowbelle at some point after blackfriars bridge bowbelle overtook hurlingham and steered for central arch of southwark bridge marchioness also went through central arch but probably towards southern side thumb port side of marchioness showing point of second impact from bowbelle wooden planking on top was floor of upper saloon which was ripped off by bowbelles anchor when bowbelle was within of marchioness smaller vessel was affected by forces of interaction water being pushed ahead of large ship at about 1 46 am just after marchioness passed under southwark bridge she was hit twice by bowbelles bow first impact was from marchionesss stern which had effect of turning smaller vessel to port second impact was from stern and caused pleasure boat to pivot round bow of bowbelle and turn it on its side probably to an angle of 120deg upper superstructure of marchioness was ripped off by bowbelles anchor lower saloon was quickly flooded and lights went out weight and momentum of bowbelle pushed marchioness underwater and she sank stern first within 30 seconds of being hit mcgowan had been thrown from boat into water but climbed back on board to tie open port side door which led to dance floor to allow several people to escape one eyewitness to crash keith fawkes underwood who viewed incident from south bank of thames reported barge collided with pleasure boat hitting it in about its centre then mounted it pushing it under water like a toy boat within a matter of about 20 seconds pleasure boat had totally disappeared underneath water fawkes underwood statement to police quoted in from 130 people on board marchioness 79 survived and 51 died dead included de vasconcellos and faldo no one on bowbelle was injured vessel sank so quickly that most people were unable to locate or use life rafts buoys or jackets survival of those on marchioness depended partly on their location within vessel there were 41 people known to have been on forward deck and wheelhouse of whom 9 died and 32 survived a survival rate of 78 of 13 people known to have been in lower saloon 9 died and 4 survived a 31 survival rate one of those from lower saloon who survived was iain philpott who said in his statement to police i remember turning around to head towards windows to escape boat water started coming in boat through window i knew at this point boat was going to go down within a matter of seconds general lights went out everything was in darkness i was then thrown forward by a wall of water whole boat filled with water instantly when i surfaced i was some distance away from marchioness which was partly submerged iain philpott statement to police quoted in hurlingham was between 45 and 60 metres away from collision and those on board were in best position to be eyewitnesses george williams vessel s captain put out a call on vhf radio to thames division of metropolitan police service based in wapping woolwich police wapping police wapping police emergency pleasure boat is sunk cannon street railway bridge all emergency aid please call was also picked up by tns who misheard location as battersea bridge thames division only heard part of call so tns

reference to battersea bridge at 1 49 am henderson reported to tns i have to get underway now and proceed out through bridges i believe i have struck a pleasure craft it has sunk i am getting clear of bridges now i was distracted by flashing lights from another pleasure craft my vessel was proceeding outward bound just approaching cannon street bridge and well i just lost steerage um and i don t know after that i can t really say anything else sir over transcript of radio transmission from bowbelle 1 49 am quoted in after radio transmission bowbelle travelled downstream to gallions reach where she dropped anchor her crew did not deploy ship s lifebuoys flotation devices or lifeboat and she did not take part in attempts to rescue survivors all ships in area were instructed to go to area to assist with rescue hurlingham was already on scene and passengers and crew threw lifebuoys and buoyancy aids to those in water many of those from marchioness were swept into driftwood collection cages and hurlingham picked up several survivors passengers climbing out onto cages to help people out of water vessel then dropped all passengers and 28 survivors at nearby waterloo police pier now tower lifeboat station before it took members of emergency services back out to collision site waterloo police pier was used as landing point for all casualties and first responders from emergency services set up a treatment and processing point there police launches rescued more than half survivors from river some reached river bank themselves less than half an hour after marchioness was hit a major incident was declared with an incident room at new scotland yard police s body recovery team were also deployed and first body arrived at wapping police station where thames division were based at 6 50 am station acted as a holding area for bodies before they were taken to mortuary in westminster 7 00 am 0 00 am margaret thatcher prime minister returned home early from her holiday in austria to be briefed by michael portillo minister of state for transport his senior in department secretary of state for transport cecil parkinson also returned home early in response portillo announced that an investigation would be made by marine accident investigation branch maib but that no decision had yet been made as to whether to hold a public inquiry within 24 hours of collision decision was made that there would be no public inquiry and that maib investigation would be sufficient a port of london pla hydrographic surveyor located wreckage of marchioness and during late afternoon of 20 august work began on lifting vessel bodies of 24 party goers were found on board 12 of them in lower saloon wreckage was moored against north bank of thames while lifting operation was progressing police arrested and interviewed henderson and kenneth noble bowbelles second mate who was at wheel for collision both men were police announced soon afterwards that alcohol was not a cause of collision inquests and inquiries thumb upright 1 3 looking upstream to cannon street railway bridge scene of disaster 1989 to 1997 on day following collision paul knapman coroner for city of westminster opened and adjourned inquest into deaths in days after collision bodies were still being found and recovered from water to help with identification process knapman opted to use several methods including dental records identification of personal items and clothing descriptions from descriptions provided by families and fingerprints as part of their approach knapman decided that with those bodies which were not recovered from marchioness and which would be likely to surface only when and bloating meant that they would float following would apply a visual identification would be unreliable perhaps impossible and cause distress for relatives so that it should not be used and b in circumstances where it was impossible to take adequate fingerprints from bodies without removing hands of those bodies to fingerprint laboratory those hands should be removed during post mortem examinations 25 pairs of hands were removed no written records were kept of removal no guidelines were issued over which hands should be removed and no individual was given responsibility for making decision majority were identified through other means visual identification of face or through identification of clothing or personal items and only four of victims were identified through their fingerprints families of victims later complained that they were not told in a timely fashion that bodies had been recovered that some were denied access to view bodies of their relatives and were not told of processes that would be used including that hands would be removed one family was shown body of wrong person then given right body but without hands these were sent on later with apologies and a request not to tell other parents about need to remove them as this was a one off mistake on 24 august marchioness was taken from her mooring near southwark bridge and towed downstream to greenwich where she was broken up maib issued an interim report towards end of august with recommendations as to increasing safety on thames these included a requirement that vessels over had to have a forward lookout in contact with bridge by radio and tighter controls on passage of vessels along upper thames their investigation continued with a reconstruction of events on night of 16 17 september bowbelle took part and a pla launch was used as a stand in for marchioness this was later criticised by brian toft a disaster and risk management expert commissioned by marchioness action group mag as being unsatisfactory toft identified that there were several problems including no second pleasure cruiser no fare paying passengers and no disco lights or music included in re enactment in october 1989 companies behind bowbelle and marchioness agreed to pay up to ps6 million in compensation to families of victims without either company admitting any liability for crash sum offered was under a condition that offer stood to be withdrawn if a judge awarded a lower amount a week later a report was compiled for allan green director of public prosecutions dpp which recommended that criminal charges should not be brought against henderson that december knapman met dpp to discuss progress of inquests green agreed that first part of inquest should go ahead dealing with causes of death irrespective of other investigations of police and possibility of later criminal charges a second part of inquest establishing responsibility of crash and making safety recommendations would be discussed at a later stage when knapman re opened inquest on 23 april 1990 he was critical of dpp for taking eight months to decide on whether to bring criminal charges against anyone which meant that a full inquest could not take place in case it prejudiced any future trial inquest was in effect a series of what legal scholar hazel hartley calls mini inquests one each for each of 51 bodies on 26 april dpp stepped in to stop inquest stating that charges would now be brought against henderson because of his decision to stop inquest information on how collision occurred who was to blame or what could be done to ensure it could not be repeated was not considered henderson was charged under merchant shipping act 1988 for failing to have an effective lookout on vessel case against him opened on 4 april 1991 at old bailey and ran to 14 april jury failed to reach a decision dpp decided that a retrial would be in public interest this took place between 17 and 31 july same year it again ended with a hung jury at end of july 1991 ivor husband of one of victims began a private prosecution for manslaughter against four directors of south coast shipping company owners of bowbelle and corporate manslaughter against south coast shipping company two weeks later then transport secretary malcolm rifkind took decision to publish maib report repeating that because an appropriate body had undertaken an investigation there was no requirement to have a public inquiry families of victims were angry with move pointing out that rifkind had delayed publication of report on basis that publication could prejudice case against henderson but that publication could now jeopardise private prosecution dpp demanded that hand over papers for case stating he would take it over then drop it refused to comply stating that it was out of remit of dpp and that it was for a magistrates court to decide if case was adequate dpp withdrew and allowed case to proceed case was dismissed after magistrate stated that there was insufficient evidence thumb upright 1 25 alt diagram showing possible paths taken by two boats in lead up to collision simplified version of incident according to marine accident investigation branch investigation not to scale maib report considered that marchioness had altered her course to port which put her in line with bowbelles path report concluded that 18 3 no one in either vessel was aware of other s presence until very shortly before collision no one on bridge of bowbelle was aware of marchioness until collision occurred immediate cause of casualty was therefore failure of look out in each vessel 18 4 principal contributory factors were that visibility from wheelhouse of each vessel was seriously restricted both vessels were using middle part of fairway and centre arches of bridges across river clear instructions were not given to forward look out in bowbelle families of victims criticised maib report they pointed out that investigation had not directly interviewed anyone on marchioness or bowbelle but relied on police interviews they stated that there were errors in methodology approach and fact within report toft provided a critique of maib s work and concluded that inconsistencies contradictions confusions conjecture erroneous conclusions missing and inappropriate recommendations as well as epistemological ontological and methodological problems created by then current maritime safety culture raises serious doubts as to objectivity of investigation validity of findings judgement of department of transport in holding an inquiry of this type and as a result whether or not all appropriate lessons were uncovered during maib s inquiry into this tragedy report was handed to rifkind who again declined to open a public inquiry but commissioned a private one hayes report published in july 1992 that looked at health and safety on thames rather than sinking of marchioness in 1992 families of victims became aware that hands had been removed from many of bodies in march that year an account in mail on sunday cover up was published when knapman met two journalists to deny accusation of a cover up he advised them not to base reports on what margaret lockwood croft mother of one of victims said he described her as unhinged he also showed them photographs of victims without discussing matter with families in july knapman informed families that inquests suspended since april 1990 because of case against henderson would not be recommenced families tried to apply for a judicial review on basis that use of word unhinged and reference to a number of mentally unwell relatives betrayed an attitude of hostility however unconscious towards members of marchioness action group initially turned down by high court court of appeal then found in favour of group to allow an appeal in june 1994 knapman and his assistant were stood down and replaced by another coroner john burton he was initially dismissive of concerns of mag accused their solicitor of trying to mislead court of appeal and indicated that he was inclined not to grant any further inquests burton was told that another judicial review would be applied for if he refused to hold inquests and he subsequently announced that they would go ahead resumed inquest took place in march and april 1995 when questioned about maib report captain james de one of report s authors withdrew suggestion that marchioness had steered to port in last moments before crash saying it had never been his intention that text could be understood that way in summing up burton instructed coroner s jury that a verdict of unlawful killing could not be applied to anyone who had already been cleared by a court jury retired for four hours and returned a verdict of unlawful killing burton asked them did you understand my direction although decision stood 1997 to 2001 following 1997 election which brought labour party to power mag petitioned john prescott secretary of state for environment transport and regions and deputy prime minister to open an inquest in august 1999 he instructed lord justice clarke to undertake a non statutory inquiry into safety on thames clarke reported in february 2000 concluding i was asked to advise whether there is a case for a further investigation or inquiry into circumstances surrounding marchioness disaster and its causes on 20th august 1989 my answer to that question is yes thumb upright 1 25 alt diagram showing possible paths taken by two boats in lead up to collision simplified version of incident according to clarke inquiry not to scale prescott accepted recommendation and public inquest took place in october and november 2000 with clarke chairing proceedings report was published in march 2001 clarke concluded that basic cause of collision is clear it was poor lookout on both vessels neither vessel saw other in time to take action to avoid collision underlying causes on why neither vessel saw other were that henderson did not ensure a proper lookout on bowbelle that blayney lookout was not equipped with suitable radio equipment to inform his captain that faldo had not set up a lookout system on marchioness nor did he keep a lookout aft himself focusing on henderson clarke wrote we cannot stress too strongly how much we deprecate captain henderson s conduct in drinking so much alcohol before returning to his vessel as master clarke added but we do not think that it is shown on balance of probabilities that captain henderson would have acted differently if he had not consumed alcohol or had amount of sleep which he had captain was also criticised for his actions after collision when he did not broadcast a mayday call and did not deploy either lifebuoys or life raft in contravention of section 422 of merchant shipping act 1894 clarke also found that owners and managers of vessels held some blame for bowbelle owners must bear their share of responsibility for collision for failing properly to instruct their masters and crews and for failing thereafter to monitor them owners of marchioness gave no instructions about all round lookouts and failed to adequately instruct supervise or monitor their boats captains clarke also allotted blame to department of transport who he said were well aware of problems posed by limited visibility from steering positions on both types of vessel yet failed to deal with problem pla also failed to act in this regard and should have issued instructions for placement of lookouts on such vessels clarke found that because no individual s actions could be ascertained as single cause of collision a manslaughter charge would be bound to fail compensation thumb alt brass plaque that reads near this spot on sunday 20th august 1989 pleasure boat marchioness was in collision with another vessel and sank with loss of 51 lives memorial plaque on south bank of thames english law provides no compensation for fatal accidents other than for funeral expenses unless financial dependency at time of death can be proved in most cases families of marchioness victims received little more than cost of funeral louise christian human rights solicitor who acted for families of victims wrote that when young unmarried people die in circumstances of gross negligence as here death comes cheap and boat owners and their insurance companies suffer little in way of financial penalties civil claims for compensation were brought on behalf of victims families amounts received ranged between ps3 000 and ps190 000 eileen dallaglio mother of francesca dallaglio one of victims reported that she had been awarded ps45 000 after costs of having to go to court of appeal to obtain damages and bills for memorial and funeral service she was left with ps312 14 according to irwin mitchell solicitors who represented families amounts were modest because many of those killed were young without dependants and had no established careers under fatal accidents act 1976 damages were only paid to certain categories of people and were based on economic loss to victim aftermath thumb left alt floating lifeboat station on thames tower lifeboat station london after recommendations made in clarke report relating to improvement of river

rnli agreed to set up four lifeboat stations at gravesend tower chiswick and teddington which were opened in january following year following report prescott ordered mca to conduct a competency review into actions and behaviour of henderson this took place in december 2001 mca picked up on something that had been raised during clarke inquiry that henderson had forged certificates and testimonials of his service from 1985 1986 they stated that they deplored forgeries which henderson had used to gain his master s licence mca concluded that he should be allowed to keep his master s certificate as he met all service and medical fitness requirements they stated that agency accepted that events which occurred in 1986 have no practical relevance on his current fitness thumb upright alt black
