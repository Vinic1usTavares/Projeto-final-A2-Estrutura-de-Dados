academic writings as late as 2009 amateur historians have researched event since 1950s background in early 1860s many counties in pennsylvania were staunch supporters of democratic party while newly elected president of united states was republican abraham lincoln when a large number of men were drafted from columbia county tensions led to raids and arrests in columbia and neighboring counties as early as 1862 local press expressed outrage at a draft of 636 men mostly mechanics and laborers sauers tomasak 2012 p 38 an 1863 law requiring all men from 20 to 45 years old to be drafted increased tensions further on july 20 locals broke into district draft office and stole items inside but besides this event there was little active violence against officials of 1863 draft in response to draft law meetings in stillwater and jerseytown resolved that a war carried on contrary to rules and provisions of constitution whether it be a crusade against slavery or any other fanatical or scheme never can and never will receive our support columbia democrat also objected to new draft laws when samuel f pealer a draft officer attempted to recruit four men in stillwater one of men threatened to knock pealer s brains out unrest increased still further after a costly military campaign in virginia in early 1864 by june of that year opposition to draft was made clear when 75 percent of all people

75 men declared they were prepared to resist any military occupation of their part of columbia county these men were led by jacob schultz samuel kline and one person from orangeville kline went south to town to learn more about soldiers in bloomsburg according to an account by edward mchenry other members of resistance were told to remain at home until news arrived from bloomsburg when draft

mountains in northern columbia county from here they marched up valley of east branch fishing creek to its headwaters soldiers extensively searched mountains of northern columbia county for half a day going as far north as headwaters of east branch fishing creek in southern sullivan county where they climbed to top of north mountain in three groups at headwaters of east branch fishing creek soldiers turned south again then headed up west branch fishing creek as far as sullivan county line sauers tomasak 2012 p 56 they found some evidence that people had been in area but these appeared to have been hunting or logging camps eventually unable to find any evidence of a fort in area soldiers went back down fishing creek to bloomsburg dissatisfied with their findings soldiers conducted a search of several unfortified homes in northern columbia county they captured a number of residents of sugarloaf township on august 31 but these were soon released aftermath after returning from mountains soldiers made camp in grove and returned to bloomsburg on september 6 that day george cadwalader said of alleged uprising whole thing is a grand farce even after attempt to find fort was abandoned people held in fort mifflin were not released soldiers remained in columbia county for several months while continuing to hunt for deserters as late as november 2 newspaper star of north

democrats and took them to fort mifflin in four townships in columbia county beaver fishing creek benton and sugarloaf voter turnout was 27 to 47 lower than previous year but county still trended democratic local newspaper editors tate and jacoby blamed low turnout on local abolitionists by december 1 1864 all soldiers had left county to search for armed resistance in other parts of pennsylvania though widespread draft evasion was evidenced in columbia county there was never serious armed resistance at end of columbia county s occupation county s democrats were deeply embittered by arrests it is likely that rumor of fort originated from sightings of large piles of shingles gathered by draft evading shingle makers wooden tubs for gathering sap from sugar maples seen from a distance were likely mistaken for fort s cannons a deserters hideout on north mountain a cabin 20 feet 6 meters square and two stories high may have been subject of exaggerated claims by republicans that cabin was a fort a structure that may have once been this cabin was rediscovered on july 13 2007 in december 1864 soldiers who left columbia county went on to clearfield county to continue their search for deserters and draft evaders trials for columbia county residents held at fort mifflin were held in october and november 1864 at least three of those tried admitted to having been at a secret meeting on august 14 that many people were armed at meeting and that people at meeting intended to resist soldiers in bloomsburg however most of prisoners were released on or before january 1865 although a few were held until may 1865 sauers tomasak 2012 pp 187 190 no one was charged for murder of lieutenant robinson until 1891 when elias young was arrested and charged although young admitted to firing a gun he stated that two people in party searching for deserters had fired first court ruled that young was acting in self defense and he was declared not guilty media response contemporary coverage term fishing creek confederacy was first used by an editor in muncy on august 23 1864 this editor as well as j r cornelius of union county star and lewisburg chronicle both blamed events of fishing creek confederacy on biased stories in democrat newspapers forney s war press of philadelphia blamed events on columbia county leaders stating that leaders led people of columbia county into treason however democratic newspapers instead held abolitionists responsible for events of fishing creek confederacy for instance truman purdy editor of northumberland county democrat stated that bloomsburg s abolitionists sent for military forces to arrest unarmed farmers due to having believed exaggerated stories of shooting on july 30 however sunbury gazette stated that farmers were actually armed and prepared to resist law conflict between opposing newspapers reached its most severe level in may 1865 sauers tomasak 2012 p 126 at one point republican newspapers such as harrisburg telegraph ran stories that connected charles r buckalew with events of fishing creek confederacy sauers tomasak 2012 p 149 later media response in 1950s amateur historians first began
