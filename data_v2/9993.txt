fire in 1969 plutonium used to construct weapons fissile components can spontaneously combust at room temperatures in air additional sources of actinide contamination include inadequate pondcrete

perform independent tests of area surrounding rocky flats to determine extent of contamination this resulted in first releases of information to public that populated areas southeast of rocky flats had been contaminated other sources rockwell workers mixed hazardous and other wastes with concrete to create one ton solid blocks called pondcrete these were stored in open under tarps on asphalt pads pondcrete turned out to be weak storage an outcome that had been predicted by rockwell s own engineers relatively unprotected from elements blocks began to leak and sag nitrates cadmium and low level radioactive waste began to leach into ground and run downhill toward walnut creek and woman creek most of plutonium from rocky flats was oxidized plutonium which does not readily dissolve in

contaminated areas of rocky flats plant were diverted such that they would no longer flow directly into some of local reservoirs such as mower reservoir and standley lake also a surface water control system was built to allow runoff from contaminated creeks to collect in holding ponds and thus reduce or prevent direct runoff into standley lake proposals to remove or breach some of these dams to reduce cost of maintenance have been protested by cities downstream a 2005 report from agency for toxic substances and disease registry described presence of carbon tetrachloride at rocky flats plant

or skin exposure to beryllium dust fume mist or solutions a sensitized worker is at risk of developing cbd when inhalation exposure to beryllium has occurred chronic beryllium disease cbd is a chronic lung disease caused by inhaling airborne beryllium that occurs after being sensitized to beryllium common symptoms of cbd are shortness of breath unexplained coughing fatigue weight loss fever and night sweats there is varied progression seen in individuals with cbd in some cases after first exposure to beryllium some people may quickly develop signs and severe symptoms of disease other people may not experience signs and symptoms until months or years after first exposure even if worker is removed from contaminated environment symptoms can continue to worsen eventually cbd can progress to

outside boundaries of rocky flats to quantify amount of plutonium contamination researchers noted that plutonium contamination from plant was present but did not match wind conditions of 1969 fire 1957 fire and leaking barrels on pad 903 have since been confirmed to be main sources of plutonium contamination authors krey and hardy estimated total quantity of plutonium contamination outside of rocky flats s boundaries to be 2 6 ci while poet and martell estimated value to be 6 6 ci study also noted that plutonium levels just outside boundaries of plant were hundreds of times higher than background level caused by global fallout from nuclear testing and that contamination to north of plant was probably caused by normal operations rather than accidental releases from september 1947 to april 1969 there were 5 or more accidental surface water releases of tritium tritium a radioactive element which was found in scrap material from rocky flats was therefore directed into great western reservoir this was uncovered in 1973 and following this urine samples were taken from people living or working near broomfield who could have drunk water from reservoir findings of samples showed that those who were exposed to contaminated water had tritium concentrations near seven times higher than normal 4 300 picocuries per liter versus 600 picocuries per liter however when same group underwent urine sampling three years later their tritium concentrations had returned to standard in a 1981 study by dr carl johnson health director for jefferson county showed a 45 percent increase in congenital birth defects in denver suburbs downwind of rocky flats compared to rest of colorado moreover he found a 16 increase in cancer rates for those living closest to plant as compared to those on outer perimeter of area and he estimated 491 excess cancer cases whereas doe estimated one a 1987 study by crump and others did not find cancer rates in northwestern portion of denver to be significantly higher than other parts of city and attributed variance in cancer rates to population density of urban areas crump s conclusions were contested by johnson in a letter to journal editor in a 1992 survey of radiation risk analysis authors concluded johnson failed to describe an effective and complete model for cause of cancers and its relationship to other knowledge as crump et al have done therefore crump et al s explanation must be preferred in 1983 colorado university medical school professor john c cobb and epa reported plutonium concentrations from about 500 persons who

tracked 16 303 people who worked at rocky flats plant between 1952 and 1989 their research also found that these workers were 2 5 times more likely to develop brain tumors than other people many findings linking workers and other cancer development are muddled due to strong healthy worker effect that workers tend to have lower overall death rates than general population because those that are ill or disabled are restricted from working also standard mortality rates for cancers of stomach and rectum were found to be much higher than other studies of nuclear workers which indicates necessity for further study since inhalation of plutonium can distribute to these areas many people who were employees of rocky flats plant talk about their struggles with chronic beryllium disease and issues
