hurricane isbell was final hurricane to affect united states during 1964 season eleventh tropical storm and sixth hurricane of that season isbell developed from a dissipating cold front in southwestern caribbean sea on october 8 depression initially remained disorganized as it track northwestward but strengthened into tropical storm isbell on october 13 re curving northeastward isbell quickly strengthened further and reached hurricane status by later that day late on october 13 isbell made landfall in pinar del rio province of cuba storm continued strengthening and peaked as a category 3 hurricane on following day isbell moved northeastward and made landfall near everglades florida late on october 14 after reaching atlantic on following day storm began to weaken isbell turned northward and continued weakening before transitioning to an extratropical cyclone while located just offshore eastern north carolina on october 16 storm produced strong winds throughout western cuba hundreds of homes were destroyed as were several tobacco warehouses there was at least 20 million in damage and four deaths in cuba three of them caused by collapsing houses in guane area several tornadoes in florida caused significant damage throughout state 1 house was destroyed 33 were severely damaged and 631 suffered minor impact additionally 66 trailers were destroyed and 88 were inflicted with major damage three deaths occurred in state one due to a heart attack and two from drowning in florida keys when their shrimp boat sank because storm weakened considerably impact in north carolina was generally minor storm also spawned at least six tornadoes in state which demolished trailers and unroofed homes and other buildings in several communities damage throughout united states totaled 10 million meteorological history hurricane isbell was first identified as a weak tropical disturbance on october 7 1964 over western caribbean sea situated to south of a diffuse trough system remained weak and relatively disorganized as it moved generally northwest near honduras and nicaragua despite presence of an upper level anticyclone which promotes favorable outflow for tropical cyclones and aids in tropical cyclogenesis a lack of distinct low level inflow inhibited intensification additionally an area of warm mid tropospheric air was present within cyclone though a disheveled system it is analyzed to have become a tropical depression by 12 00 utc on october 8 following day depression skirted eastern coast of honduras operationally it was not until october 10 that weather bureau initiated advisories on depression on that date a weather reconnaissance mission into system found a weak low level circulation with a barometric pressure of 1007 3 mb hpa 29 75 inhg and winds of 20 30 mph 30 45 km h in squalls throughout october 11 and 12 depression slowly executed a tight cyclonic loop over northwestern caribbean sea it finally organized into a tropical storm and was given name isbell by 00 00 utc on october 13 after completing loop and acquiring a north northeast trajectory throughout october 13 marked intensification of cyclone occurred over a 24 hour span ending at 18 00 utc its central pressure fell from 1005 mb hpa 29 68 inhg to 979 mb hpa 28 91 inhg which was reflected in isbell s winds more than doubling from 35 mph 55 km h to 90 mph 150 km h shortly thereafter storm made landfall in extreme western cuba near guane before emerging over southeastern gulf of mexico isbell s brief stint over land did not hinder development which continued unabated until 12 00 utc on october 14 at which time it reached its maximum intensity situated to south of key west florida isbell attained winds of 125 mph 205 km h which ranks it as a category 3 hurricane on modern day saffir simpson hurricane wind scale additionally its central pressure bottomed out at 964 mb hpa 28 47 inhg around this time a new low pressure area formed to isbell s northwest over gulf in response to a powerful cold core low over mississippi valley cyclonic flow of this second system brought cool dry air from north and circulated it into hurricane this in turn caused storm to become asymmetric in structure with radar imagery indicating little to no reflectivity along western periphery of hurricane thumb surface weather analysis of hurricane isbell and nearby non tropical low over gulf of mexico at 12 00 utc on october 14 degrading structure of isbell resulted in some weakening as it accelerated toward florida at 22 00 utc on october 14 hurricane made landfall near everglades city as a category 2 with sustained winds between 100 and 110 mph 160 and 175 km h within five hours system cleared florida peninsula and emerged over western atlantic ocean north of west palm beach storm s passage over land resulted in notable weakening though isbell remained of hurricane strength during afternoon of october 15 low that had formed previous day induced a northward turn of cyclone and directed it toward north carolina a result of what is known as fujiwhara effect thereafter two systems began to intertwine as isbell began transitioning into an extratropical cyclone rapid weakening accompanied this phase isbell completed this process by 12 00 utc on october 16 as it moved onshore near morehead city north carolina on october 17 two non tropical systems merged into a single storm over outer banks isbell s remnants emerged back over atlantic ocean on october 18 near delmarva peninsula before accelerating northeast system was last noted on october 19 as it moved over atlantic canada preparations summary of warnings and watches associated with hurricane isbell for united states warning type date time changes to previous

radio broadcasts on october 15 as isbell rapidly crossed florida forecasters at charleston south carolina weather bureau warned of high tides of up to above flood stage from south carolina into north carolina owing to continued northeastward movement of storm tides ultimately did not exceed in south carolina across coastal areas of north carolina alerts for severe thunderstorms tornadoes and high tides were raised however storm greatly diminished before reaching shore and little damage materialized moderate rains along lower neuse river basin were expected to prolong flooding triggered by hurricane hilda and its remnants earlier in october small craft advisories were raised northward to provincetown massachusetts through october 18 impact thumb right 250px map of eastern united states depicting rainfall produced by hurricane isbell between 30 and 80 of rainfall in florida fell several days in advance of storm along a frontal zone cuba skirting extreme western coast of cuba on october 13 storm produced gusts estimated at in pinar del rio province highest measured sustained winds were 85 mph 140 km h in guane and 70 mph 110 km h at rancho airport in capital city of havana additionally pressures at city fell to 979 mbar hpa 28 91 inhg heavy rains caused rivers to over top their banks forcing thousands of people to evacuate three fatalities occurred in guane due to collapsing homes a fourth fatality took place elsewhere in cuba numerous homes were damaged or destroyed by storm with exact numbers unknown region s tobacco crop also sustained considerable losses with fields and warehouses destroyed damage to agriculture compounded economic losses in cuba that resulted from hurricane flora in september 1963 which devastated nation as well as impacts from hurricanes cleo and hilda earlier in 1964 combined effects of cleo hilda and isbell resulted in economic losses of approximately 100 million in country of which at least 20 million was directly attributed to isbell florida though isbell struck state as a category 2 hurricane no winds in excess of 100 mph 160 km h were reported measurements peaked at 90 mph 150 km h at both everglades city and indiantown hurricane force gusts were measured in belle glade fort lauderdale key west pompano beach and west palm beach atmospheric pressures fell to 970 7 mb hpa 28 67 inhg in dry tortugas and 977 5 mb hpa 28 87 inhg on mainland in juno beach rainfall in state was relatively limited owing to brisk movement of storm though a frontal system immediately preceding hurricane brought heavy rains to state a peak total of was measured in west palm beach though an estimated 80 of this was attributable to front amounts from hurricane itself were likely around no major storm surge was reported during isbell s passage due to greatly weaker winds in back half of storm tides in key west rose above normal throughout florida three people were killed in relation to storm and no more than 10 million in damage occurred with more than half of which was attributed to agricultural losses in addition 76 people were injured 12 of whom required hospitalization structural damage was relatively limited with only 63 homes and businesses mostly trailers being destroyed 159 other structures sustained major damage while a further 631 experienced minor damage majority of damage from isbell was not from hurricane itself but rather tornadoes spawned by its outer bands at least nine and as many as twelve tornadoes affected state with greatest effects being felt in miami metropolitan area all storm related injuries were attributed to these tornadoes as well as majority of structural damage according to national climatic data center four of these tornadoes were of f2 intensity despite close passage of storm to florida keys damage in area was light and amounted to 175 000 of this 125 000 was attributed to structural damage hurricane force winds in archipelago only lasted 15 minutes and gale force winds occurred over a 5 hour span brevity of damaging winds limited effects of storm most damage was constrained to downed trees signs and power poles two trailers were overturned however and an oil barge sank in key west harbor two people drowned after their shrimp boat was destroyed in and around strand preserve state park royal palms and royal were defoliated by hurricane s winds downed trees and power lines in collier county temporarily left many customers without phone and electrical service residents in nearby lee cypress stated that effects from isbell were worse than hurricane donna which struck region as a category 4 in september 1960 palm beach county was most affected area accounting for more than half of losses and approximately 700 000 in damage one indirect death occurred when a man suffered a heart attack in lake worth while installing storm shutters at least three tornadoes were spawned in palm beach county strongest was an f2 that struck a trailer park in briny breezes damaging numerous trailers and injuring 22 people shortly thereafter same tornado or possibly a second one struck boynton beach injuring three people and damaging several structures event lasted roughly 20 minutes and tornadoes moved along a path long another tornado in boca raton caused a number of minor injuries in west palm beach a twister that crossed intersection of state roads 802 and 809 damaged adjacent properties and injured several people throughout palm beach county 492 homes suffered damage while 36 mobile homes were demolished and 60 others were inflicted major impact additionally 33 farm buildings and 9 small businesses were severely damaged or destroyed in martin county an f2 was spawned in sound and affected area near u s route 1 about 39 homes and 13 mobile homes were damaged while two farm buildings and two businesses also received impact fourth f2 tornado was spawned in brevard county near eau gallie it caused extensive damage and injured 17 people in orange court trailer park collectively 35 homes in flagler and volusia counties were damaged carolinas and elsewhere thumb left surface analysis of hurricane isbell s extratropical remnants on october 16 over carolinas heavy rains associated with isbell and a nearby non tropical low resulted in heavy rains across carolinas on october 15 and 16 in and around columbia south carolina area of rain fell with a peak of in city itself significant flooding took place along all rivers in state broad river crested at its highest level since 1940 in blair pee dee river rose to at cheraw by october 18 roughly above flood stage cotton crop sustained greatest losses during event with damage estimated in excess of 1 million along coast tides rose to above normal in charleston harbor what little coastal flooding took place mostly resulted from wave run up rather than tidal flooding some beach erosion occurred in exposed areas much of north carolina was affected by isbell with rain extending into interior parts of state totals were generally light however and peaked at around in eastern areas some flash flooding took place in piedmont though overall effects were minimal in blue ridge mountains french broad river topped its banks and prompted evacuations in hot springs and marshall greatest impacts were felt along neuse river in kinston within lenoir county rains from isbell exacerbated ongoing floods in area resulting in heavy damage to many homes a man was swept away by swift currents near a duke energy steam plant in cliffside however it is unknown if he perished or was later rescued losses to peanut crop were extensive though no monetary value is available with storm arriving at low tide no notable coastal flooding occurred significant weakening of isbell prior to landfall also lessened effects from wind as gale force winds were mostly constrained to coastal areas a peak gust of 75 mph 120 km h was measured in elizabeth city elsewhere along east coast remnants of isbell produced generally light to moderate rain a localized maximum of around occurred in massachusetts as system began to dissipate immediately following storm an unseasonably strong cold front brought near freezing temperatures to virginia resulting in frost combination of cold air and hurricane prevented any peanut bumper crop harvesting in state see
