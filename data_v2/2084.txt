38628 huya provisional designation is a binary trans neptunian object located in kuiper belt a region of icy objects orbiting beyond neptune in outer solar system huya is as a plutino a dynamical class of trans neptunian objects with orbits in a 3 2 orbital resonance with neptune it was discovered by quasar equatorial survey team and was identified by venezuelan astronomer ignacio ferrin in march 2000 it is named after juya mythological rain god of wayuu people native to south america huya s surface is moderately red in color due to presence of complex organic compounds on its surface water ice has been suspected to be also present on its surface although water ice has not been directly detected on huya huya is considered as a mid sized trans neptunian object with an estimated diameter of about huya was considered to be a possible dwarf planet though its relatively small size and dark surface imply that it never collapsed into a truly solid body and thus may never have been in hydrostatic equilibrium huya has one known natural satellite designated s 2012 38628 1 satellite is relatively large compared to huya and is expected to have slowed down its rotation although measurements of huya s brightness variations have indicated that huya s rotation may not be synchronous with satellite s orbit history discovery huya was discovered on 10 march 2000 by a team of astronomers of quasar equatorial survey team quest led by gustavo and charles baltay at llano del hato national astronomical observatory in merida venezuela huya was first identified by venezuelan astronomer ignacio ferrin during a computer assisted search through images taken from a six hour survey of deep sky objects including quasars and supernovae using llano del hato national astronomical observatory s 1 meter schmidt telescope on night of 15 march 2000 at time of discovery huya was located in constellation of virgo subtle movement of huya was detected by quest s computer program which was designed to identify moving objects by superimposing multiple images discovery team subsequently analyzed earlier images taken from previous quest surveys conducted during same month in order to verify orbital motion of huya discovery of huya was formally announced by minor planet center in a minor planet electronic circular on 3 june 2000 it was given provisional designation which indicates its year of discovery with letters further specifying that discovery took place in first half of march last letter and numbers of its designation indicate that huya is 348th object discovered in first half of march at that time huya was thought to be one of largest minor planets in solar system due to its apparent magnitude of 20 which is relatively bright for a distant object this implied that it might be around one fourth size of pluto and comparable in size to dwarf planet baltay leader of discovery team and chairman of yale university s department of physics regarded their discovery to be significant as huya at time was thought to be largest object discovered in kuiper belt since pluto during an interview on their discovery baltay asserted after announcement of huya s discovery discovery team found precovery images of huya taken with palomar observatory s samuel oschin telescope on 9 april 1996 these precovery images of huya from palomar are earliest known observations of huya precovery images along with subsequent follow up observations in 2000 extended huya s observation arc up to four years which helped refine huya s orbit by 2002 huya was observed 303 times this was sufficient to accurately determine its orbit so was assigned minor planet number 38628 to huya on 28 march 2002 name minor planet is named after mythological figure huya juya rain god of wayuu people indigenous to guajira peninsula of northern venezuela and colombia in wayuu mythology juya is a hunter who controlled rain and was married to female figure related to wind and dry seasons juya is also associated with winter and lives in celestial altitudes beyond sun discovery team led by ferrin particularly chose name to represent venezuela s indigenous peoples that lived in region where huya was discovered ferrin presumed that huya had experienced multiple impact events during its formation which he considered analogous to rain a trait associated with juya while searching for names ferrin and his team had agreed upon a naming scheme for object which required indigenous names with traits that are associated with object s characteristics among 20 potential names considered by ferrin s team they chose name juya altered to its equivalent phonetic english spelling huya name was later submitted and proposed to international astronomical union iau which then approved name in 2003 minor planet center published naming citation on 1 may 2003 although iau s present naming convention for minor planets requires objects in orbital class of plutinos objects in 3 2 orbital resonance with neptune to be named after underworld deities such naming guidelines had not yet been imposed by iau at time of huya s naming physical characteristics size size estimates for km fit thumb artist s rendition of huya and its satellite huya is unlikely to be spherical according to grundy et al who propose that dark mid sized tnos such as huya are unlikely to be in hydrostatic equilibrium at time of discovery huya was thought to be about one fourth size of pluto or in size based on an initially measured bright absolute magnitude of 4 7 and an assumed dark albedo reflectivity of 0 04 this initial size estimate of huya made it one of largest trans neptunian objects known at that time ranking as second largest minor planet after ceres subsequent measurements of huya s thermal emission yielded higher albedo estimates for huya consequently corresponding to smaller diameter estimates photometric and thermal observations of huya in 2003 and 2005 placed an upper limit to huya s diameter at based on a minimum albedo around 0 08 early estimates for huya s diameter were calculated from its apparently high absolute magnitude brightness was later discovered to be combination of brightnesses of primary body huya and its large satellite whose existence was unknown until its discovery in 2012 by subtracting satellite s effects from huya s brightness astronomers were able to approximate huya s true diameter huya s mean diameter is estimated at based on measurements of huya s thermal emission by herschel space observatory in 2013 compared to pluto and its moon charon huya is approximately one sixth diameter of pluto and one third diameter of charon on 18 march 2019 huya occulted a bright 10 6 magnitude star briefly dimming star as huya passed in front of it stellar occultation was observed by astronomers across central europe and was detected by 22 observation sites in region successful detections of observation yielded fourteen chords from romania five chords from turkey and three chords from israel huya was shown to have an oblate shape based on a best fit elliptical model constructed from chords obtained from occultation no signs of a possible atmosphere or rings were detected during occultation possible dwarf planet status huya was considered to be a possible dwarf planet due to its presumed high brightness which corresponds to a large diameter astronomer gonzalo tancredi considered huya as a possible dwarf planet with an estimated diameter larger than suggested minimum size for icy objects to maintain a spheroidal shape however later measurements of huya s diameter yielded smaller size estimates casting doubt on possibility of huya as a dwarf planet adopting herschel s mean diameter estimate of huya is slightly larger than saturn s moon mimas which is ellipsoidal in shape and huya is slightly smaller than neptune s moon proteus which is irregular in shape based on radiometric measurements of huya s diameter michael brown considers huya to probably be a dwarf planet placing it between likely and possibly in 2019 william grundy and colleagues proposed that trans neptunian objects in size range of approximately are transitional between smaller porous and thus low density bodies and larger denser brighter and geologically differentiated planetary bodies such as dwarf planets huya is situated at lower end of size range implying that huya s interior structure is likely highly porous and undifferentiated since its formation and thus is unlikely to be in hydrostatic equilibrium despite grundy s expected notion of huya having a low density audrey thirouin and colleagues in a 2014 study suggested that minimum density of huya is a rough estimate derived from variations in brightness spectra and surface reflectance spectrum of huya appears moderately red and featureless in infrared spectrum lacking apparent absorption signatures of water ice and other volatile materials scattered disc object shares a similarly featureless spectrum with huya though their visible colors differ huya s featureless spectrum indicates that its surface is covered with a thick layer of dark organic compounds irradiated by solar radiation and cosmic rays although water ice appears to be absent in huya s infrared spectrum some astronomers have detected subtle signs of water ice in its visible spectrum in 2011 and 2017 discrepancy of presence of water ice between visible and infrared spectra of huya was interpreted as an indication of heterogeneity in huya s surface composition huya s surface is homogeneously covered with trace amounts of water ice as subtle water ice absorption features recur in multiple observations of huya s visible spectrum over course of its rotation early observations of huya s spectrum in 2000 have identified a red spectral slope at wavelengths around 0 7 mm typical of dark trans neptunian objects additional near infrared absorption features were also identified and were attributed to presence of aqueously altered silicate minerals on huya s surface red color of huya s surface results from irradiation of organic compounds by solar radiation and cosmic rays which produces dark reddish tholins that cover its surface huya s featureless spectrum indicates that its surface is covered with a thick layer of dark organic compounds irradiated by solar radiation and cosmic rays compared to large kuiper belt object which displays apparent signs of water ice huya s spectrum appears redder and featureless suggesting that its surface is covered with a thick layer of tholins concealing water ice underneath it is thought that layer of surface tholins on huya is thicker than that of varuna as a result of a more intense radiation environment best fit models for these absorption features suggest that huya s surface consists of a mixture of cometary ice tholins ice tholin ii nitrogen rich titan tholins as well as water ice spectrographic observations of huya s spectrum with very large telescope in 2001 and 2002 have tentatively identified weak absorption features at near infrared wavelengths around 0 6 0 82 mm possibly indicating presence of phyllosilicate materials on its surface 0 6 mm absorption feature in huya s spectrum resembles those in spectra of stony s type asteroids which may suggest presence of spinel group minerals albeit in trace amounts as such minerals are unlikely to be abundant in trans neptunian objects other absorption features near 0 7 mm in huya s spectrum appear akin to those in spectra of dark asteroids indicating presence of hydrous silicate minerals such as phyllosilicates which may have been aqueously altered through heating induced by impact events or radioactive decay of radionuclides in huya s interior however later observations of huya s spectrum did not find any absorption features related to aqueously altered material suggesting that they are likely concentrated in a small localized area of huya s surface brightness huya has a visual absolute magnitude h of 5 04 and a low geometric albedo of 0 083 its apparent magnitude brightness as seen from earth varies from 19 8 to 21 6 magnitudes huya comes to opposition in june of each year at a visual apparent magnitude of 19 8 at wavelengths of r band range huya appears brighter in red light with its r band apparent magnitude reaching 19 11 magnitudes at opposition at time of huya s discovery it was thought to be one of brightest trans neptunian objects known which corresponded to an initially large size estimate for huya as it appeared relatively bright for a distant object as huya comes to opposition its brightness increases as a result of an opposition surge in which its phase angle approaches zero in 2001 long term photometric observations of huya were conducted to observe effects of its opposition surge and to identify any indication of variability in huya s brightness huya was first trans neptunian object other than pluto to have its opposition surge measured photometry results showed a gradual increase in brightness near opposition indicating a low albedo huya was shown to display very little variability in brightness with an estimated light curve amplitude of less than 0 097 magnitudes rotation rotation period of huya is unknown due to flat appearance of its light curve displaying very little variability in brightness preliminary photometric observations of huya in 2000 have reported no indication of variability greater than three percent of its brightness over a period of 1 25 hours follow up photometric observations of huya at opposition in 2001 yielded a similarly flat light curve with an estimated amplitude of less than 0 097 magnitudes small amplitude of huya s light curve suggests that it may be oriented in a pole on configuration with its rotational axis pointing toward earth discovery of a large satellite around huya implies that it could be tidally locked to its satellite although satellite s orbit is unknown while huya s rotation is expected to slow down on a timescale that is short compared to age of solar system through mutual tidal forces with its satellite several photometric observations of huya indicate a variability of several hours suggesting that huya may not be tidally locked to its satellite in 2002 ortiz and colleagues obtained a fragmentary rotation period of hours for huya along with other alternative periods of and hours their inferred rotation period was derived from data sets of short term photometry taken separately in february and march 2002 their mean solution of for huya s rotation period appeared consistent with previous photometric observations with an amplitude less than 0 1 magnitudes however rotation period determined by ortiz was later determined to be an alias of huya s brightness variability in 2014 thirouin suggested a shorter fragmentary rotation period of 5 28 hours tentatively determined from short term photometric observations conducted in 2010 through 2013 like former rotation period inferred by ortiz latter period obtained by thirouin was based on fragmentary photometric data and may be erroneous by a factor of 30 percent or more orbit thumb upright polar view of huya s orbit around sun with outer planets orbits shown for comparison huya is in a 2 3 mean motion orbital resonance with neptune meaning that huya completes two orbits around sun for every three orbits completed by neptune due to its 2 3 orbital resonance with neptune huya is classified as a plutino a dynamical class of objects with orbits similar to that of pluto huya orbits sun at an average distance of taking 251 years to complete a full orbit huya s orbit is inclined to ecliptic by 15 5 degrees slightly less than pluto s orbital inclination of 17 degrees it has an elongated orbit with an orbital eccentricity of 0 28 due to its eccentric orbit its distance from sun varies over course of its orbit ranging from 28 5 au at perihelion closest distance to 51 1 au at aphelion farthest distance like pluto its resonance with neptune prevents close approaches between huya and giant planets minimum orbit intersection distance moid between huya and neptune is 1 62 au but due to resonance two never come closer than 21 au of each other huya is currently near its perihelion having passed it in 2015 and is now moving away from sun approaching aphelion by 2149 huya is approximately 28 7 au from sun located in direction of constellation ophiuchus simulations by deep ecliptic survey des show that huya can acquire a perihelion distance as small as 27 27 au over next 10 million years exploration in a study published by ashley gleaves and colleagues in 2012 huya was considered as a potential target for an orbiter mission that would be launched on an atlas v 551 or delta iv rocket for an orbiter mission to huya spacecraft would have a launch date in november 2027 and use a gravity assist from jupiter taking 20 to 25 years to arrive gleaves concluded that huya and were most feasible targets for orbiter as trajectories required least amount of maneuvers for orbital insertion around either for a flyby mission to huya planetary scientist amanda zangari calculated that a spacecraft could take just under 10 years to arrive at huya using a jupiter gravity assist based on a launch date of 2027 or 2032 huya would be approximately 31 to 37 au from sun when spacecraft arrives by 2040 alternative trajectories using gravity assists from jupiter saturn or uranus have been also considered a trajectory using gravity assists from jupiter and uranus could take at least 20 years based a launch date of 2038 or 2039 whereas a trajectory using a gravity assist from saturn could take over 16 years based on a later launch date of 2040 using these alternative trajectories for spacecraft huya would be approximately 37 to 38 au from sun when spacecraft arrives before 2060 satellite s 2012 38628 1 is provisional designation for only known satellite of huya it was discovered by a team led by keith noll in hubble space telescope observations obtained on 6 may 2012 and confirmed in reexamination of archival hubble space telescope imagery from 30 june and 1 july 2002 discovery was reported to international astronomical union and was announced on 12 july 2012 assuming same albedo as huya satellite is estimated to be about in diameter from hubble images of huya satellite s separation distance from primary is estimated to be at least characteristics satellite is 1 4 magnitudes dimmer than huya hv 5 04 giving a visual absolute magnitude of 6 44 for satellite satellite is relatively large compared to huya being slightly larger than half primary s diameter of size ratio of satellite to primary is 0 525 large size ratio is analogous to pluto charon binary system in which pluto s large moon charon is large and massive enough such that center of mass barycenter is located in space between charon and pluto huya system may be in a similar case although no information about its barycenter is known with a large size compared to huya satellite is expected to have slowed down huya s rotation such that both components become mutually tidally locked although several photometric observations of huya indicate a rotation period of several hours suggesting that huya may not be tidally locked to its satellite if huya is not tidally locked to its satellite this implies that satellite could have a very low density of around which would result in a longer time for both components to become mutually tidally locked orbit of satellite is poorly known due to small number of resolved observations of huya s satellite consequently a definitive mass and density estimate for huya cannot be derived from satellite s orbit based on archival hubble images of huya taken in 2002 satellite s angular separation distance from huya is approximately 60 to 80 arcseconds corresponding to an approximate distance of astrometry of satellite s changing position around huya from two hubble images taken one day apart in 2002 indicates a rough orbital period estimate of about 3 2 days notes references external
