of maria anna schicklgruber baptismal register did not show name of his father and alois initially bore his mother s surname schicklgruber in 1842 johann georg hiedler married alois s mother maria anna alois was brought up in family of hiedler s brother johann nepomuk hiedler in 1876 alois was legitimated and baptismal register changed by a priest to register johann georg hiedler as alois s father recorded as georg hitler alois then assumed surname hitler also spelled hiedler or name is probably based on one who lives in a hut german for hut nazi official hans frank suggested that alois mother had been employed as a housekeeper by a jewish family in graz and that family s 19 year old son leopold frankenberger had fathered alois no frankenberger was registered in graz during that

volksschule a state owned primary school in nearby move to hafeld coincided with onset of intense father son conflicts caused by hitler s refusal to conform to strict discipline of his school his

in church choir and even considered becoming a priest in 1898 family returned permanently to leonding hitler was deeply affected by death of his younger brother edmund who died in 1900 from measles hitler changed from a confident outgoing conscientious student to a morose detached boy who constantly fought with his father and teachers alois had made a successful career in customs bureau and wanted his son to follow in his footsteps hitler later dramatised an episode from this period when his father took him to visit a customs office depicting it as an event that gave rise to an unforgiving antagonism between father and son who were both strong willed ignoring his son s desire to attend a classical high school and become an artist alois sent hitler to realschule in linz in september 1900 hitler rebelled against this decision and in mein kampf states that he intentionally did poorly in school hoping that once his father saw what little progress i was making at technical school he would let me devote myself to my dream like many austrian germans hitler began to develop german nationalist ideas from a young age he expressed loyalty only to germany despising declining habsburg monarchy and its rule over an ethnically variegated empire hitler and his friends used greeting heil and sang deutschlandlied instead of austrian imperial anthem after alois s sudden death on

such as mayor karl lueger exploited climate of virulent anti semitism and occasionally espoused german nationalist notions for political effect german nationalism had a particularly widespread following in district where hitler lived georg ritter von became a major influence on hitler he also developed an admiration for martin luther hitler read local newspapers such as deutsches that fanned prejudice and played on christian fears of being swamped by an influx of eastern european jews he read newspapers and pamphlets that published thoughts of philosophers and theoreticians such as houston stewart chamberlain charles darwin friedrich nietzsche gustave le bon and arthur schopenhauer origin and development of hitler s anti semitism remains a matter of debate his friend august kubizek claimed that hitler was a confirmed anti semite before he left linz however historian brigitte hamann describes kubizek s claim as while hitler states in mein kampf that he first became an anti semite in vienna reinhold hanisch who helped him sell his paintings disagrees hitler had dealings with jews while living in vienna historian richard j evans states that historians now generally

account upon receiving this news he suffered a second bout of blindness hitler described war as greatest of all experiences and was praised by his commanding officers for his bravery his wartime experience reinforced his german patriotism and he was shocked by germany s capitulation in november 1918 his bitterness over collapse of war effort began to shape his ideology like other german nationalists he believed stab in back myth which claimed that german army undefeated in field had been stabbed in back on home front by civilian leaders jews marxists and those who signed armistice that ended fighting later dubbed november criminals treaty of versailles stipulated that germany must relinquish several of its territories and rhineland treaty imposed economic sanctions and levied heavy reparations on country many germans saw treaty as an unjust humiliation they especially objected to article 231 which they interpreted as declaring germany responsible for war versailles treaty

political messages specifically at people who had been affected by inflation of 1920s and depression such as farmers war veterans and middle class although hitler had terminated his austrian citizenship in 1925 he did not acquire german citizenship for almost seven years this meant that he was stateless legally unable to run for public office and still faced risk of deportation on 25

german alliance in august 1936 in response to a growing economic crisis caused by his rearmament efforts hitler ordered goring to implement a four year plan to prepare germany for war within next four years plan envisaged an all out struggle between judeo bolshevism and german national socialism which in hitler s view required a committed effort of rearmament regardless of economic costs count galeazzo ciano foreign minister of mussolini s government declared an axis between germany and italy and on 25 november germany signed anti comintern pact with japan britain china italy and poland were also invited to join anti comintern pact but only italy signed in 1937 hitler abandoned his plan of an anglo german alliance blaming inadequate british leadership at a meeting in reich chancellery with his foreign ministers and military chiefs that november hitler restated his intention of acquiring lebensraum for german people he ordered preparations for war in east to begin as early as 1938 and no later than 1943 in event of his death conference minutes recorded as hossbach memorandum were to be regarded as his political testament he felt that a severe decline in living standards in germany as a result of economic crisis could only be stopped by military aggression aimed at seizing austria and czechoslovakia hitler urged quick action before britain and france gained a permanent lead in arms race in early 1938 in wake of blomberg fritsch affair hitler asserted control of military foreign policy apparatus dismissing neurath as foreign minister and appointing himself as war minister from early 1938 onwards hitler was carrying out a foreign policy ultimately aimed at war world war ii thumb hitler and japanese foreign minister yosuke matsuoka at a meeting in

joachim von ribbentrop hitler ended sino german alliance with republic of china to instead enter into an alliance with more modern and powerful empire of japan hitler announced german recognition of manchukuo japanese occupied state in manchuria and renounced german claims to their former colonies in pacific held by japan hitler ordered an end to arms shipments to china and recalled all german officers working with chinese army in retaliation chinese general chiang kai shek cancelled all sino german economic agreements depriving germans of many chinese raw materials austria and czechoslovakia on 12 march 1938 hitler announced unification of austria with nazi germany in anschluss hitler then turned his attention to ethnic german population of sudetenland region of czechoslovakia thumb left october 1938 hitler is driven through crowd in in mostly german populated sudetenland region of czechoslovakia which had been annexed to nazi germany as part of munich agreement on 28 29 march 1938 hitler held a series of secret meetings in berlin with konrad henlein of sudeten german party largest of ethnic german parties of sudetenland men agreed that henlein would demand increased autonomy for sudeten germans from czechoslovakian government thus providing a pretext for german military action against czechoslovakia in april 1938 henlein told foreign minister of hungary that whatever czech government might offer he would always raise still higher demands he wanted to sabotage an understanding by any means because this was only method to blow up czechoslovakia quickly in private hitler considered sudeten issue unimportant his real intention was a war of conquest against czechoslovakia in april hitler ordered okw to prepare for fall grun case green code name for an invasion of czechoslovakia as a result of intense french and british diplomatic pressure on 5 september czechoslovakian president edvard benes unveiled fourth plan for constitutional reorganisation of his country which agreed to most of henlein s demands for sudeten autonomy henlein s party responded to benes offer by instigating a series of violent clashes with czechoslovakian police that led to declaration of martial law in certain sudeten districts germany was dependent on imported oil a confrontation with britain over czechoslovakian dispute could curtail germany s oil supplies this forced hitler to call off fall grun originally planned for 1 october 1938 on 29 september hitler neville chamberlain edouard daladier and mussolini attended a one day conference in munich that led to munich agreement which handed over sudetenland districts to germany chamberlain was satisfied with munich conference calling outcome peace for our time while hitler was angered about missed opportunity for war in 1938 he expressed his disappointment in a speech on 9 october in saarbrucken in hitler s view british brokered peace although favourable to ostensible german demands was a diplomatic defeat which spurred his intent of limiting british power to pave way for eastern expansion of germany as a result of summit hitler was selected time magazine s man of year for 1938 in late 1938 and early 1939 continuing economic crisis caused by rearmament forced hitler to make major defence cuts in his export or die speech of 30 january 1939 he called for an economic offensive to increase german foreign exchange holdings to pay for raw materials such as high grade iron needed for military weapons on 15 march 1939 in violation of munich accord and possibly as a result of deepening economic crisis requiring additional assets hitler ordered wehrmacht to invade prague and from prague castle he proclaimed bohemia and moravia a german protectorate start of world war ii in private discussions in 1939 hitler declared britain main enemy to be defeated and that poland s obliteration was a necessary prelude for that goal eastern flank would be secured and land would be added to germany s lebensraum offended by british guarantee on 31 march 1939 of polish independence he said i shall brew them a devil s drink in a speech in wilhelmshaven for launch of battleship on 1 april he threatened to denounce anglo german naval agreement if british continued to guarantee polish independence which he perceived as an encirclement policy poland was to either become a german satellite state or it would be neutralised in order to secure reich s eastern flank and prevent a possible british blockade hitler initially favoured idea of a satellite state but upon its rejection by polish government he decided to invade and made this main foreign policy goal of 1939 on 3 april hitler ordered military to prepare for fall weiss case white plan for invading poland on 25 august in a reichstag speech on 28 april he renounced both anglo german naval agreement and german polish non aggression pact historians such as william carr gerhard weinberg and ian kershaw have argued that one reason for hitler s rush to war was his fear of an early death he had repeatedly claimed that he must lead germany into war before he got too old as his successors might lack his strength of will thumb left upright hitler portrayed on a 42 pfennig stamp from 1944 term reich greater german reich was first used in 1943 for expanded germany under his rule hitler was concerned that a military attack against poland could result in a premature war with britain hitler s foreign minister and former ambassador to london joachim von ribbentrop assured him that neither britain nor france would honour their commitments to poland accordingly on 22 august 1939 hitler ordered a military mobilisation against poland this plan required tacit soviet support and non aggression pact molotov ribbentrop pact between germany and soviet union led by joseph stalin included a secret agreement to partition poland between two countries contrary to ribbentrop s prediction that britain would sever anglo polish ties britain and poland signed anglo polish alliance on 25 august 1939 this along with news from italy that mussolini would not honour pact of steel prompted hitler to postpone attack on poland from 25 august to 1 september hitler unsuccessfully tried to manoeuvre british into neutrality by offering them a non aggression guarantee on 25 august he then instructed ribbentrop to present a last minute peace plan with an impossibly short time limit in an effort to blame imminent war on british and polish inaction on 1 september 1939 germany invaded western poland under pretext of having been denied claims to free city of danzig and right to extraterritorial roads across polish corridor which germany had ceded under versailles treaty in response britain and france declared war on germany on 3 september surprising hitler and prompting him to angrily ask ribbentrop now what france and britain did not act on their declarations immediately and on 17 september soviet forces invaded eastern poland thumb hitler reviews troops on march during campaign against poland september 1939 fall of poland was followed by what contemporary journalists dubbed phoney war or sitzkrieg sitting war hitler instructed two newly appointed gauleiters of north western poland albert forster of reichsgau danzig west prussia and arthur greiser of reichsgau to germanise their areas with no questions asked about how this was accomplished in forster s area ethnic poles merely had to sign forms stating that they had german blood in contrast greiser agreed with himmler and carried out an ethnic cleansing campaign towards poles greiser soon complained that forster was allowing thousands of poles to be accepted as racial germans and thus endangered german racial purity hitler refrained from getting involved this inaction has been advanced as an example of theory of working towards fuhrer in which hitler issued vague instructions and expected his subordinates to work out policies on their own another dispute pitched one side represented by heinrich himmler and greiser who championed ethnic cleansing in poland against another represented by goring and hans frank governor general of occupied poland who called for turning poland into granary of reich on 12 february 1940 dispute was initially settled in favour of goring frank view which ended economically disruptive mass expulsions on 15 may 1940 himmler issued a memo entitled some thoughts on treatment of alien population in east calling for expulsion of entire jewish population of europe into africa and reduction of polish population to a leaderless class of labourers hitler called himmler s memo good and correct and ignoring goring and frank implemented himmler greiser policy in poland thumb upright left hitler visits paris with architect albert speer left and sculptor arno breker right 23 june 1940 on 9 april german forces invaded denmark and norway on same day hitler proclaimed birth of greater germanic reich his vision of a united empire of germanic nations of europe in which dutch flemish and scandinavians were joined into a racially pure polity under german leadership in may 1940 germany attacked france and conquered luxembourg netherlands and belgium these victories prompted mussolini to have italy join forces with hitler on 10 june france and germany signed an armistice on 22 june kershaw notes that hitler s popularity within germany and german support for war reached its peak when he returned to berlin on 6 july from his tour of paris following unexpected swift victory hitler promoted twelve generals to rank of field marshal during 1940 field marshal ceremony britain whose troops were forced to evacuate france by sea from dunkirk continued to fight alongside other british dominions in battle of atlantic hitler made peace overtures to new british leader winston churchill and upon their rejection he ordered a series of aerial attacks on royal air force airbases and radar stations in south east england on 7 september systematic nightly bombing of london began german luftwaffe failed to defeat royal air force in what became known as battle of britain by end of september hitler realised that air superiority for invasion of britain in operation sea lion could not be achieved and ordered operation postponed nightly air raids on british cities intensified and continued for months including london plymouth and coventry on 27 september 1940 tripartite pact was signed in berlin by saburo of imperial japan hitler and italian foreign minister ciano and later expanded to include hungary romania and bulgaria thus yielding axis powers hitler s attempt to integrate soviet union into anti british bloc failed after inconclusive talks between hitler and molotov in berlin in november and he ordered preparations for invasion of soviet union thumb upright boundaries of nazi planned greater germanic reich in early 1941 german forces were deployed to north africa balkans and middle east in february german forces arrived in libya to bolster italian presence in april hitler launched invasion of yugoslavia quickly followed by invasion of greece in may german forces were sent to support iraqi rebel forces fighting against british and to invade crete path to defeat on 22 june 1941 contravening hitler stalin non aggression pact of 1939 over 3 million axis troops attacked soviet union this offensive codenamed operation barbarossa was intended to destroy soviet union and seize its natural resources for subsequent aggression against western powers invasion conquered a huge area including baltic republics belarus and west ukraine by early august axis troops had advanced and won battle of smolensk hitler ordered army group centre to temporarily halt its advance to moscow and divert its panzer groups to aid in encirclement of leningrad and kiev his generals disagreed with this change having advanced within of moscow and his decision caused a crisis among military leadership pause provided red army with an opportunity to mobilise fresh reserves historian russel considers it to be one of major factors that caused failure of moscow offensive which was resumed in october 1941 and ended disastrously in december during this crisis hitler appointed himself as head of oberkommando des heeres thumb hitler announcing declaration of war against united states to reichstag on 11 december 1941 on 7 december 1941 japan attacked american fleet based at pearl harbor hawaii four days later hitler declared war against united states on 18 december 1941 himmler asked hitler what to do with jews of russia to which hitler replied als partisanen exterminate them as partisans israeli historian yehuda bauer has commented that remark is probably as close as historians will ever get to a definitive order from hitler for genocide carried out during holocaust in late 1942 german forces were defeated in second battle of el alamein thwarting hitler s plans to seize suez canal and middle east overconfident in his own military expertise following earlier victories in 1940 hitler became distrustful of his army high command and began to interfere in military and tactical planning with damaging consequences in december 1942 and january 1943 hitler s repeated refusal to allow their withdrawal at battle of stalingrad led to almost total destruction of 6th army over 200 000 axis soldiers were killed and 235 000 were taken prisoner thereafter came a decisive strategic defeat at battle of kursk hitler s military judgement became increasingly erratic and germany s military and economic position deteriorated as did hitler s health thumb left destroyed map room at wolf s lair after 20 july plot following allied invasion of sicily in 1943 mussolini was removed from power by victor emmanuel iii after a vote of no confidence of grand council marshal pietro badoglio placed in charge of government soon surrendered to allies throughout 1943 and 1944 soviet union steadily forced hitler s armies into retreat along eastern front on 6 june 1944 western allied armies landed in northern france in one of largest amphibious operations in history operation overlord many german officers concluded that defeat was inevitable and that continuing under hitler s leadership would result in complete destruction of country between 1939 and 1945 there were many plans to assassinate hitler some of which proceeded to significant degrees most well known 20 july plot of 1944 came from within germany and was at least partly driven by increasing prospect of a german defeat in war part of operation valkyrie plot involved claus von stauffenberg planting a bomb in one of hitler s headquarters wolf s lair at rastenburg hitler narrowly survived because staff officer heinz brandt moved briefcase containing bomb behind a leg of heavy conference table which deflected much of blast later hitler ordered savage reprisals resulting in execution of more than 4 900 people defeat and death by late 1944 both red army and western allies were advancing into germany recognising strength and determination of red army hitler decided to use his remaining mobile reserves against american and british troops which he perceived as far weaker on 16 december he launched ardennes offensive to incite disunity among western allies and perhaps convince them to join his fight against soviets offensive failed after some temporary successes with much of germany in ruins in january 1945 hitler spoke on radio however grave as crisis may be at this moment it will despite everything be mastered by our unalterable will acting on his view that germany s military failures meant it had forfeited its right to survive as a nation hitler ordered destruction of all german industrial infrastructure before it could fall into allied hands minister for armaments albert speer was entrusted with executing this scorched earth policy but he secretly disobeyed order hitler s hope to negotiate peace with united states and britain was encouraged by death of us president franklin d roosevelt on 12 april 1945 but contrary to his expectations this caused no rift among allies on 20 april his hitler made his last trip from fuhrerbunker fuhrer s shelter to surface in ruined garden of reich chancellery he awarded iron crosses to boy soldiers of hitler youth who were now fighting red army at front near berlin by 21 april georgy zhukov s 1st belorussian front had broken through defences of general gotthard heinrici s army group vistula during battle of seelow heights and advanced to outskirts of berlin in denial about dire situation hitler placed his hopes on undermanned and under equipped armeeabteilung steiner army detachment steiner commanded by waffen ss general felix steiner hitler ordered steiner to attack northern flank of salient while german ninth army was ordered to attack northward in a pincer attack during a military conference on 22 april hitler asked about steiner s offensive he was told that attack had not been launched and that soviets had entered berlin hitler asked everyone except wilhelm keitel alfred jodl hans krebs and wilhelm burgdorf to leave room then launched into a tirade against treachery and incompetence of his commanders culminating in his declaration for first time that everything was lost he announced that he would stay in berlin until end and then shoot himself by 23 april red army had surrounded berlin and goebbels made a proclamation urging its citizens to defend city that same day goring sent a telegram from berchtesgaden arguing that since hitler was isolated in berlin goring should assume leadership of germany goring set a deadline after which he would consider hitler incapacitated hitler responded by having goring arrested and in his last will and testament of 29 april he removed goring from all government positions on 28 april hitler discovered that himmler who had left berlin on 20 april was trying to negotiate a surrender to western allies he ordered himmler s arrest and had hermann fegelein himmler s ss representative at hitler s hq in berlin shot after midnight on night of 28 29 april hitler married eva braun in a small civil ceremony in fuhrerbunker later that afternoon hitler was informed that mussolini had been executed by italian resistance movement on previous day this presumably increased his determination to avoid capture on 30 april 1945 soviet troops were within a block or two of reich chancellery when hitler shot himself in head and braun bit into a cyanide capsule their bodies were carried outside to garden behind reich chancellery where they were placed in a bomb crater doused with petrol and set on fire as red army shelling continued grand admiral karl donitz and joseph goebbels assumed hitler s roles as head of state and chancellor respectively berlin surrendered on 2 may records in soviet archives obtained after fall of soviet union state that remains of hitler braun joseph and magda goebbels six goebbels children general hans krebs and hitler s dogs were repeatedly buried and exhumed on 4 april 1970 a soviet kgb team used detailed burial charts to exhume five wooden boxes at smersh facility in magdeburg remains from boxes were burned crushed and scattered into biederitz river a tributary of elbe according to kershaw corpses of braun and hitler were fully burned when red army found them and only a lower jaw with dental work could be identified as hitler s remains holocaust thumb left a wagon piled high with corpses outside crematorium in liberated buchenwald concentration camp april 1945 holocaust and germany s war in east were based on hitler s long standing view that jews were enemy of german people and that lebensraum was needed for germany s expansion he focused on eastern europe for this expansion aiming to defeat poland and soviet union and then removing or killing jews and slavs generalplan ost general plan east called for deporting population of occupied eastern europe and soviet union to west siberia for use as slave labour or to be murdered conquered territories were to be colonised by german or settlers goal was to implement this plan after conquest of soviet union but when this failed hitler moved plans forward by january 1942 he had decided that jews slavs and other deportees considered undesirable should be killed upright thumb hitler s order for aktion t4 dated 1 september 1939 genocide was organised and executed by heinrich himmler and reinhard heydrich records of wannsee conference held on 20 january 1942 and led by heydrich with fifteen senior nazi officials participating provide clearest evidence of systematic planning for holocaust on 22 february hitler was recorded saying we shall regain our health only by eliminating jews similarly at a meeting in july 1941 with leading functionaries of eastern territories hitler said that easiest way to quickly pacify areas would be best achieved by shooting everyone who even looks odd although no direct order from hitler authorising mass killings has surfaced his public speeches orders to his generals and diaries of nazi officials demonstrate that he conceived and authorised extermination of european jewry during war hitler repeatedly stated his prophecy of 1939 was being fulfilled namely that a world war would bring about annihilation of jewish race hitler approved einsatzgruppen killing squads that followed german army through poland baltic and soviet union and was well informed about their activities by summer 1942 auschwitz concentration camp was expanded to accommodate large numbers of deportees for killing or enslavement scores of other concentration camps and satellite camps were set up throughout europe with several camps devoted exclusively to extermination between 1939 and 1945 schutzstaffel ss assisted by collaborationist governments and recruits from occupied countries was responsible for deaths of at least eleven million non combatants including 5 5 to 6 million jews representing two thirds of jewish population of europe and between 200 000 and 1 500 000 romani people deaths took place in concentration and extermination camps ghettos and through mass executions many victims of holocaust were gassed to death while others died of starvation or disease or while working as slave labourers in addition to eliminating jews nazis planned to reduce population of conquered territories by 30 million people through starvation in an action called hunger plan food supplies would be diverted to german army and german civilians cities would be razed and land allowed to return to forest or resettled by german colonists together hunger plan and generalplan ost would have led to starvation of 80 million people in soviet union these partially fulfilled plans resulted in additional deaths bringing total number of civilians and prisoners of war who died in democide to an estimated 19 3 million people hitler s policies resulted in killing of nearly two million non jewish poles over three million soviet prisoners of war communists and other political opponents homosexuals physically and mentally disabled jehovah s witnesses adventists and trade unionists hitler did not speak publicly about killings and seems never to have visited concentration camps nazis embraced concept of racial hygiene on 15 september 1935 hitler presented two laws known as nuremberg laws to reichstag laws banned sexual relations and marriages between aryans and jews and were later extended to include gypsies negroes or their bastard offspring laws stripped all non aryans of their german citizenship and forbade employment of non jewish women under age of 45 in jewish households hitler s early eugenic policies targeted children with physical and developmental disabilities in a programme dubbed action brandt and he later authorised a euthanasia programme for adults with serious mental and physical disabilities now referred to as aktion t4 leadership style thumb hitler during a meeting at headquarters of army group south in june 1942 hitler ruled nsdap by asserting leader principle principle relied on absolute obedience of all subordinates to their superiors thus he viewed government structure as a pyramid with himself infallible leader at apex rank in party was not determined by elections positions were filled through appointment by those of higher rank who demanded unquestioning obedience to will of leader hitler s leadership style was to give contradictory orders to his subordinates and to place them into positions where their duties and responsibilities overlapped with those of others to have stronger one do job in this way hitler fostered distrust competition and infighting among his subordinates to consolidate and maximise his own power his cabinet never met after 1938 and he discouraged his ministers from meeting independently hitler typically did not give written orders instead he communicated verbally or had them conveyed through his close associate martin bormann he entrusted bormann with his paperwork appointments and personal finances bormann used his position to control flow of information and access to hitler hitler dominated his country s war effort during world war ii to a greater extent than any other national leader he strengthened his control of armed forces in 1938 and subsequently made all major decisions regarding germany s military strategy his decision to mount a risky series of offensives against norway france and low countries in 1940 against advice of military proved successful though diplomatic and military strategies he employed in attempts to force united kingdom out of war ended in failure hitler deepened his involvement in war effort by appointing himself commander in chief of army in december 1941 from this point forward he personally directed war against soviet union while his military commanders facing western allies retained a degree of autonomy hitler s leadership became increasingly disconnected from reality as war turned against germany with military s defensive strategies often hindered by his slow decision making and frequent directives to hold untenable positions nevertheless he continued to believe that only his leadership could deliver victory in final months of war hitler refused to consider peace negotiations regarding destruction of germany as preferable to surrender military did not challenge hitler s dominance of war effort and senior officers generally supported and enacted his decisions personal life family thumb hitler in 1942 with his long time lover eva braun hitler created a public image as a celibate man without a domestic life dedicated entirely to his political mission and nation he met his lover eva braun in 1929 and married her on 29 april 1945 one day before they both committed suicide in september 1931 his half niece geli raubal took her own life with hitler s gun in his munich apartment it was rumoured among contemporaries that geli was in a romantic relationship with him and her death was a source of deep lasting pain paula hitler younger sister of hitler and last living member of his immediate family died in june 1960 views on religion hitler was born to a practising catholic mother and an anticlerical father after leaving home hitler never again attended mass or received sacraments speer states that hitler railed against church to his political associates and though he never officially left it he had no attachment to it he adds that hitler felt that in absence of organised religion people would turn to mysticism which he considered regressive according to speer hitler believed that japanese religious beliefs or islam would have been a more suitable religion for germans than christianity with its and historian john s conway states that hitler was fundamentally opposed to christian churches according to bullock hitler did not believe in god was anticlerical and held christian ethics in contempt because they contravened his preferred view of survival of fittest he favoured aspects of protestantism that suited his own views and adopted some elements of catholic church s hierarchical organisation liturgy and phraseology thumb hitler shaking hands with catholic dignitaries in germany in 1930s hitler viewed church as an important politically conservative influence on society and he adopted a strategic relationship with it that suited his immediate political purposes in public hitler often praised christian heritage and german christian culture though professing a belief in an aryan jesus who fought against jews any pro christian public rhetoric contradicted his private statements which described christianity as absurdity and nonsense founded on lies according to a us office of strategic services oss report nazi master plan hitler planned to destroy influence of christian churches within reich his eventual goal was total elimination of christianity this goal informed hitler s movement early on but he saw it as inexpedient to publicly express this extreme position according to bullock hitler wanted to wait until after war before executing this plan speer wrote that hitler had a negative view of himmler s and alfred rosenberg s mystical notions and himmler s attempt to mythologise ss hitler was more pragmatic and his ambitions centred on more practical concerns health researchers have variously suggested that hitler suffered from irritable bowel syndrome skin lesions irregular heartbeat coronary sclerosis parkinson s disease syphilis giant cell and tinnitus in a report prepared for oss in 1943 walter c langer of harvard university described hitler as a neurotic psychopath in his 1977 book psychopathic god adolf hitler historian robert g l waite proposes that he suffered from borderline personality disorder historians henrik eberle and hans joachim neumann consider that while he suffered from a number of illnesses including parkinson s disease hitler did not experience pathological delusions and was always fully aware of and therefore responsible for his decisions theories about hitler s medical condition are difficult to prove and placing too much weight on them may have effect of attributing many of events and consequences of nazi germany to possibly impaired physical health of one individual kershaw feels that it is better to take a broader view of german history by examining what social forces led to nazi dictatorship and its policies rather than to pursue narrow explanations for holocaust and world warii based on only one person sometime in 1930s hitler adopted a mainly vegetarian diet avoiding all meat and fish from 1942 onwards at social events he sometimes gave graphic accounts of slaughter of animals in an effort to make his guests shun meat bormann had a greenhouse constructed near berghof near berchtesgaden to ensure a steady supply of fresh fruit and vegetables for hitler hitler stopped drinking alcohol around time he became vegetarian and thereafter only very occasionally drank beer or wine on social occasions he was a non smoker for most of his adult life but smoked heavily in his youth 25 to 40 cigarettes a day he eventually quit calling habit a waste of money he encouraged his close associates to quit by offering a gold watch to anyone able to break habit hitler began using amphetamine occasionally after 1937 and became addicted to it in late 1942 speer linked this use of amphetamine to hitler s increasingly erratic behaviour and inflexible decision making for example rarely allowing military retreats prescribed 90 medications during war years by his personal physician theodor morell hitler took many pills each day for chronic stomach problems and other ailments he regularly consumed amphetamine barbiturates opiates and cocaine as well as potassium bromide and atropa belladonna latter in form of doktor koster s he suffered ruptured eardrums as a result of 20 july plot bomb blast in 1944 and 200 wood splinters had to be removed from his legs newsreel footage of hitler shows tremors in his left hand and a shuffling walk which began before war and worsened towards end of his life ernst gunther schenck and several other doctors who met hitler in last weeks of his life also formed a diagnosis of parkinson s disease legacy thumb outside building in braunau am inn austria where hitler was born is a memorial stone placed as a reminder of horrors of world war ii inscription translates as for peace freedom and democracy never again fascism millions of dead remind us hitler s suicide was likened by contemporaries to a spell being broken public support for hitler had collapsed by time of his death and few germans mourned his passing kershaw argues that most civilians and military personnel were too busy adjusting to collapse of country or fleeing from fighting to take any interest according to historian john toland national socialism burst like a bubble without its leader hitler s actions and nazi ideology are almost universally regarded as gravely immoral according to kershaw never in history has such ruination physical and moral been associated with name of one man hitler s political programme brought about a world war leaving behind a devastated and impoverished eastern and central europe germany suffered wholesale destruction characterised as stunde null zero hour hitler s policies inflicted human suffering on an unprecedented scale according to r j rummel nazi regime was responsible for killing of an estimated 19 3 million civilians and prisoners of war in addition 28 7million soldiers and civilians died as a result of military action in european theatre of world war ii number of civilians killed during second world war was unprecedented in history of warfare historians philosophers and politicians often use word evil to describe nazi regime many european countries have criminalised both promotion of nazism and holocaust denial historian friedrich meinecke described hitler as one of great examples of singular and incalculable power of personality in historical life english historian hugh trevor roper saw him as among terrible of history most systematic most historical most philosophical and yet cruelest least magnanimous conqueror world has ever known for historian john m roberts hitler s defeat marked end of a phase of european history dominated by germany in its place emerged cold war a global confrontation between western bloc dominated by united states and other nato nations and eastern bloc dominated by soviet union historian sebastian haffner asserts that without hitler and displacement of jews modern nation state of israel would not exist he contends that without hitler de colonisation of former european spheres of influence would have been postponed further haffner claims that other than alexander great hitler had a more significant impact than any other comparable historical figure in that he too caused a wide range of worldwide changes in a relatively short time span in propaganda thumb thumbtime 3 film of hitler at berchtesgaden c 1941 hitler exploited documentary films and newsreels to inspire a cult of personality he was involved and appeared in a series of propaganda films throughout his political career many made by leni riefenstahl regarded as a pioneer of modern filmmaking
