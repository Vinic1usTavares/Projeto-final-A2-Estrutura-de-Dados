goaltender rick dipietro with first overall pick in 2000 nhl entry draft dipietro s selection supplanted luongo as highest drafted goaltender in nhl history and islanders goaltender of future consequently milbury traded luongo to florida panthers along with centre olli jokinen for winger mark parrish and centre oleg kvasha that same day on june 24 2000 deal would later be seen to have

luongo ceased to make himself available for pre game interviews a customary practice for goaltenders but not for captains when asked after canucks elimination whether he thought he should remain team captain he told reporters he did not think it was an issue however gillis who appointed him captain two seasons prior asserted it was a topic to be addressed in off season on september 13 2010 luongo confirmed he was stepping down stating that serv ing as captain in a canadian city for a team with such passionate fans is a privilege and an experience i will always take pride in i will continue to

a pre game ceremony to canucks season opener also in off season gillis fired luongo s goaltending coach ian clark and hired roland melanson in his place luongo had been a personal friend of clark s
