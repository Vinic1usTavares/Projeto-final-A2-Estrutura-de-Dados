its partnership with gaijinworks metafight was released for virtual console in japan on for wii and on for nintendo 3ds it was also released in north america for 3ds on along with another sunsoft game saga for wii u blaster master was created by kenji sada credited as senta who also led development of wing of and wrote its main code game was made by a part time development team of about five people which included team leader and main programmer sada sub programmer kenji kajita character designer hiroyuki art designer yoshiaki iwata pgm f 1 and sound programmer marumo iwata who would direct reimagining blaster master overdrive did game s opening sequence and designed map overall layout and bosses in a 2010 interview iwata said we were trying to make best action game to date with all that entails with sophia game s vehicle we wanted to bring to life a sense of action that incorporated all 360deg of environment in a way that players hadn t really experienced up to that point along with that we wanted large expansive maps so that we could support that vision game s art design came from iwata who was able to translate his original ideas directly into game as far as nes s graphical capabilities could be taken at that time he said goal was really to try to pull off best graphics on nes to date simple graphics were more or less standard on nes at time but i had this firm belief that it was possible to do something better something prettier i feel like we pulled it off and were able to show people what could be done on nes it left an impression around office and from what i ve heard visuals influenced work of other games that were later made by other nes developers as well game s music and sound were designed in cooperation between sunsoft s staff and an outside composer naoki kodaka who had previously worked on scores for many of company s other games iwata credited him for giving company a good reputation for video game music in late 1980s and lamented that none of those people are working together anymore since they ve all separated from sunsoft over years sada created system of alternating between 2d platforming and top down modes during game s planning he came up with idea that sophia would eventually be able to go anywhere in game including navigating on ceilings and walls he created top down portions to allow jason to shoot in all directions and to enable team to express large bosses that really had an impact he did not want to design gameplay in a linear progression instead he drew inspiration from and was influenced by nintendo s metroid to create a game that allowed players to freely move between levels according to iwata we wanted player to experience feeling of excitement that comes from discovering something after endeavoring through a difficult search which is why we composed a map that allowed player to move freely between different areas we really put a great deal of thought into that element of game design and i mean this in best possible way but we wanted player to have to struggle release cho wakusei senki metafight was released for famicom in japan on june 17 1988 while sunsoft s development team headed by iwata were confident that they produced a great game it did not sell well in japan and as a result was not received well within sunsoft game was released in north america on november 1988 game was localized from metafight in japan to blaster master for western markets in north america plot elements normally present in anime as featured in metafight were not yet popular sunsoft s u s division asked japanese development team to change game s original plot elements hence game s plot changed to that of jason and his pet frog fred and name of planet sophia 3rd in metafight became name of jason s tank in blaster master original staff also omitted a portion of map in fourth level in which player was forced to control jason and make a desperate suicide leap for a ladder suspended in mid air after complaints from u s staff no sequel was originally planned due to game s poor sales iwata already started development on another game when north american release blaster master sold well game s impact led sunsoft to develop titles with similar top down gameplay like gremlins 2 new batch and fester s quest latter of whose main designer had helped design characters for blaster master game has

singer book was part of worlds of power series a collection of loose novelizations of various nes games he wrote similar novelizations for ninja gaiden infiltrator and bases loaded ii second season as with other books in series all acts of violence portrayed in games including any death scenes were removed as a result bosses were portrayed in book as holographic projections placed over formless blobs shawn struck and scott sharkey from 1up com said that blaster master was hardest book for lerangis to write because of lack of a middle plot he had to come up with details that were not in game to connect game s actual opening and conclusion sunsoft would use lerangis novel as plot for game s sequel blaster master blasting again making novel only one in worlds of power series to be canonized in a video game series reception blaster master received praise from reviewers for its gameplay weekly famitsu gave it a 32 out of 40 score in a 1988 electronic game player later known as electronic

music in game as one of best in 8 bit era noting up tempo tracks and high quality sound effects ign s mark syan sallee described music as memorable as anything from nintendo while regan said that game s sound effects and music bolster gameplay and graphical atmosphere one of main criticisms of blaster master has been its difficulty ign s levi buchanan mentioned lack of passwords or save features as used in metroid game had to be completed in one sitting they added that some players need to exploit grenade glitch to beat some of bosses buchanan criticized game for its difficulty in on foot portions saying that bosses are too difficult to beat that enemies regenerate upon re entering a screen and that players can lose a life from falling too far in 2d platforming mode ign s lucas thomas agreed about lack of passwords or save features saying that because of game s difficulty dying near end of game and having to restart game all over again without passwords or save points have caused much frustration for players parish criticized game for having a limited number of continues and for graphics in top down perspective saying that display is incredibly cutesy compared to tank sections with protagonist s head providing about 50 of his total body mass some reviewers have found other criticisms in gameplay buchanan mentioned that character holds his gun in his right hand requiring player to compensate by moving left before shooting enemies if player can move left on screen thomas echoed buchanan s concerns in a later review adding that this requires players to mentally adjust and to target enemies off center thomas criticized control of tank in particular lack of traction which he said may cause players to roll off a platform or cliff parish criticized gameplay in top down perspective saying that gun players use is too weak he continued by adding that there are too few upgrades for it and that whenever player takes damage it downgrades from a high powered beam of death to a stupid unreliable of mild discomfort nintendo power reviewed game in its february 1993 issue as part of an overview of nes games that magazine felt were overlooked or otherwise did not sell well

iwata he was surprised about game s reception outside japan which have named it as one of their favorite and most memorable 8 bit titles he said it s kind of funny that first time i ever really had any sense of game s success was about 10 years following original release of blaster master when a young staff member from u s office said something to me like you d definitely have become a super famous game designer if you were an american alex neuse creator of bit trip series reminisced his memories of playing blaster master as a child he acknowledged that game was a clone of metroid that featured a tank that could jump and a corny storyline but he said it was all presented in a way that it felt meaningful he added that game s music convinced him that video game music could be high
