she was rebuked by randall davidson archbishop of canterbury for advocating ordination of women his mother s theology had a profound influence on benn as she taught him that stories in bible were based around struggle between prophets and kings and that he ought in his life to support prophets over kings who had power as prophets taught righteousness benn asserted that teachings of jesus christ had a radical political importance on his life and made a distinction between historical jesus as a carpenter of nazareth who advocated social justice and egalitarianism and way in which he s presented by some religious authorities by popes archbishops and bishops who present jesus as justification for their power believing this to be a gross misunderstanding of role of jesus he believed that it was a great mistake to assume that teachings of christianity are outdated in modern britain and higgins wrote in benn inheritance that benn was a socialist whose political commitment owes much

twentieth century a schoolteacher who transformed china released it from civil war and foreign attack and constructed a new society there in his diaries adding that he certainly towers above any

international monetary fund underlining a wish to counter international market forces which seemed to penalise a larger welfare state benn publicly circulated divided cabinet minutes in which a narrow majority of labour cabinet under ramsay macdonald supported a cut in unemployment benefits in order to obtain a loan from american bankers as he highlighted these minutes resulted in 1931 split of labour party in which macdonald and his allies formed a national government with conservatives and liberals callaghan allowed benn to put forward alternative economic strategy which consisted of a self sufficient economy less dependent on low rate fresh borrowing but aes which according to opponents would have led to a siege economy was rejected by cabinet in response benn later recalled that i retorted that their policy was a siege economy only they had bankers inside castle with all our supporters left outside whereas my policy would have our supporters in castle with bankers outside benn blamed winter of discontent on these cuts to socialist policies during benn s time as energy minister from 1975 1979 he supported united kingdom s use of nuclear power however later in his life he became an opponent of nuclear power attributing his time as running it as a minister to persuading him it was not cheap safe or peaceful when asked in an interview in january 2009 on what he had changed his mind on over course of his life he expanded on this issue by saying move to left by end of 1970s benn s views had shifted to left wing of labour party he attributed this political shift to his experience as a cabinet minister in 1964 1970 labour government benn ascribed his move to left to four lessons how civil service can frustrate policies and decisions of popularly elected governments centralised nature of labour party which allowed leader to run party almost as if it were his personal kingdom power of industrialists and bankers to get their way by use of crudest form of economic pressure even blackmail against a labour government power of media which like power of medieval church ensures that events of day are always presented from point of view of those who enjoy economic privilege as regards power of industrialists and bankers benn remarked benn s philosophy consisted of a form of syndicalism state planning where necessary to ensure national competitiveness greater democracy in structures of labour party and observance of party conference decisions alongside an alleged 12 labour mps he spent 12 years affiliated with institute for workers control beginning in 1971 when he visited upper clyde shipyards arguing in 1975 for labour movement to intensify its discussion about industrial democracy he was vilified by most of press while his opponents implied and stated that a benn led labour government would implement a type of eastern european state socialism with edward heath referring to benn as commissar benn and others referring to benn as a bollinger bolshevik despite this benn was overwhelmingly popular with labour activists in constituencies a survey of delegates at labour party conference in 1978 found that by large margins they supported benn for leadership as well as many bennite policies he publicly supported sinn fein and unification of ireland although in 2005 he suggested to sinn fein leaders that it abandon its long standing policy of not taking seats at westminster sinn fein in turn argued that to do so would recognise britain s claim over northern ireland and sinn fein constitution prevented its elected members from taking their seats in any british created institution a supporter of scottish parliament and political devolution benn however opposed scottish national party and scottish independence saying i think nationalism is a mistake and i am half scots and feel it would divide me in half with a knife thought that my mother would suddenly be a foreigner would upset me very much in british politics during this period term bennism came into use to describe conviction politics economic social and political ideology of tony benn and an exponent or advocate of bennism was regarded as a bennite marr

foot as successor benn outlined what he envisaged next labour government would do within days a labour government would gain powers to nationalise industries control capital and implement industrial

british government should not send a task force to recapture islands task force was sent and following falklands war they were back in british control by mid june in a debate in commons just after falklands were recaptured benn s demand for a full analysis of costs in life equipment and money in this tragic and unnecessary war was rejected by margaret thatcher who stated that he would not enjoy

lost to michael cocks in selection of a candidate to stand in new winnable seat of bristol south rejecting offers from new seat of livingston in scotland benn contested bristol east losing to conservative s jonathan sayeed in june 1983 foot resigned as leader following defeat which reduced labour to only 209 mps while healey also decided to step down as deputy leader however benn s absence from parliament meant that he was unable to stand in resulting leadership contest as only mps were eligible to be candidates benn s absence from contest was reported by glasgow herald to leave neil

american psychiatrist newly elected to a mining seat benn was a supporter of 1984 85 uk miners strike which was beginning when he returned to commons and of his long standing friend national union of mineworkers leader arthur scargill however some miners considered benn s 1977 industry reforms to have caused problems during strike firstly that they led to huge wage differences and distrust between miners of different regions and secondly that controversy over balloting miners for these reforms made it unclear as to whether a ballot was needed for a strike or whether it could be deemed as a regional matter in same way that 1977 reforms had been benn also spoke at a militant tendency rally held in 1984 saying labour movement is not engaged in a personalised battle against individual cabinet ministers nor do we seek to win public support by arguing that crisis could be ended by election of a new and more humane team of ministers who are better qualified to administer capitalism we are working for a majority labour government elected on a socialist programme as decided by conference in june 1985 three months after miners admitted defeat and ended their strike benn introduced miners amnesty general pardon bill into commons which would have extended an amnesty to all miners imprisoned during strike this would have included two men convicted of murder later reduced to manslaughter for killing of david wilkie a taxi driver driving a non striking miner to work in south wales during strike benn stood for election as party leader in 1988 against neil kinnock following

government act a piece of anti gay legislation preventing promotion of homosexuality benn said benn later voted for repeal of section 28 during first term of tony blair s new labour government and voted in favour of equalising age of consent in 1990 he proposed a margaret thatcher global repeal bill which he said could go through both houses in 24 hours it would be easy to reverse policies and replace personalities process has begun but rotten values that have been propagated from platform of political power in britain during past 10 years will be an infection a virulent strain of right wing capitalist thinking which it will take time to overcome hansard hc deb 22 november 1990 vol 181 cols 439 518 at 486 in 1991 with labour still in opposition and a general election due by june 1992

tony benn also received a pipe smoker of year award claiming in his acceptance speech that pipe smoking stopped you going to war in 1991 benn reiterated his opposition to european commission and highlighted an alleged democratic deficit in institution saying some people genuinely believe that we shall never get social justice from british government but we shall get it from jacques they believe that a good king is better than a bad parliament i have never taken that view this argument has also been used by many on right wing eurosceptic wing of conservative party such as daniel hannan mep jonathan freedland writes in guardian that for tony benn even benign rule by a monarch was worthless because king s whim could change and there d be nothing you could do about it prior to retirement 1997 2001 in 1997 labour party under leadership of tony blair won general election in a landslide after 18 years of conservative party rule despite later calling labour under tony blair

to blair welcoming a change of government benn supported introduction of national minimum wage and welcomed progress towards peace and security in northern ireland particularly under mo mowlam he was supportive of extra public money given to public services in new labour years but believed it to be under guise of privatisation overall his concluding judgement on new labour is highly critical he describes its evolution as a way of retaining office by abandoning socialism and distancing party from trade union movement adopting a style of politics overriding concept of collective ministerial responsibility by reducing power of cabinet eliminated any effective influence from annual conference of labour party and hinged its foreign policy on support for one of worst presidents in us history benn strongly objected to bombing of iraq in december 1998 calling it immoral and saying aren t arabs terrified aren t iraqis terrified don t arab and iraqi women weep when their children die does bombing strengthen their determination every member of parliament tonight who votes for government motion will be consciously and deliberately accepting responsibility for deaths of innocent people if war begins as i fear it will several months prior to his retirement benn was a signatory to a letter alongside niki adams legal action for women ian macdonald qc gareth peirce and other legal

insurgents questioning whether they were in fact freedom fighters and comparing insurgents to a british dad s army saying if you are invaded you have a right to self defence and this idea that people in iraq and afghanistan who are resisting invasion are militant muslim extremists is a complete bloody lie i joined dad s army when i was sixteen and if germans had arrived i tell you i could use a bayonet a rifle a revolver and if i d seen a german officer having a meal i d have tossed a grenade through window would i have been a freedom fighter or a terrorist in an interview published in

alleged overshadowing of eu debate by ukip and tory backbenchers he said i took view that having fought europeans in second world war that we should now work with them and co operate and that was my first thought about it then how i saw how european union was developing it was very obvious that what they had in mind was not democratic and way that europe has developed is that bankers and multinational corporations have got very powerful positions and if you come in on their terms they will tell you what you can and cannot do and that is unacceptable my view about european union has always been not that i am hostile to foreigners but that i am in favour of democracy i think they re building an empire there they want us to be a part of their empire and i don t want that illness
