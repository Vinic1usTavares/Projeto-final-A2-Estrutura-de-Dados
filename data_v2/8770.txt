cygnus x 1 abbreviated cyg x 1 is a galactic x ray source in constellation cygnus and first such source widely accepted to be a black hole paul 2011 cygnus x 1 a black hole confirmed centauri dreams imagining and planning interstellar exploration 2011 11 29 accessed 2016 09 16 it was discovered in 1964 during a rocket flight and is one of strongest x ray sources seen from earth producing a peak x ray flux density of it remains among most studied astronomical objects in its class compact object is now estimated to have a mass about 14 8 times mass of sun and has been shown to be too small to be any known kind of normal star or other likely object besides a black hole if so radius of its event horizon has as upper bound to linear dimension of source region of occasional x ray bursts lasting only for about 1 ms cygnus x 1 belongs to a high mass x ray binary system located about 6 070 light years from sun that includes a blue supergiant variable star designated hde 226868 which it orbits at about 0 2 au or 20 of distance from earth to sun a stellar wind from star provides material for an accretion disk around x ray source matter in inner disk is heated to millions of degrees generating observed x rays a pair of jets arranged perpendicular to disk are carrying part of energy of infalling material away into interstellar space this system may belong to a stellar association called cygnus ob3 which would mean that cygnus x 1 is about five million years old and formed from a progenitor star that had more than majority of star s mass was shed most likely as a stellar wind if this star had then exploded as a supernova resulting force would most likely have ejected remnant from system hence star may have instead collapsed directly into a black hole cygnus x 1 was subject of a friendly scientific wager between physicists stephen hawking and kip thorne in 1974 with hawking betting that it was not a black hole he conceded bet in 1990 after observational data had strengthened case that there was indeed a black hole in system this hypothesis lacks direct empirical evidence but has generally been accepted from indirect evidence discovery and observation observation of x ray emissions allows astronomers to study celestial phenomena involving gas with temperatures in millions of degrees however because x ray emissions are blocked by earth s atmosphere observation of celestial x ray sources is not possible without lifting instruments to altitudes where x rays can penetrate cygnus x 1 was discovered using x ray instruments that were carried aloft by a sounding rocket launched from white sands missile range in new mexico as part of an ongoing effort to map these sources a survey was conducted in 1964 using two aerobee suborbital rockets rockets carried geiger counters to measure x ray emission in wavelength range 1 across an 8 4deg section of sky these instruments swept across sky as rockets rotated producing a map of closely spaced scans as a result of these surveys eight new sources of cosmic x rays were discovered including cyg xr 1 later cyg x 1 in constellation cygnus celestial coordinates of this source were estimated as right ascension and declination 34 6deg it was not associated with any especially prominent radio or optical source at that position seeing a need for longer duration studies in 1963 riccardo giacconi and herb proposed first orbital satellite to study x ray sources nasa launched their uhuru satellite in 1970 which led to discovery of 300 new x ray sources extended uhuru observations of cygnus x 1 showed fluctuations in x ray intensity that occurs several times a second this rapid variation meant that energy generation must take place over a relatively small region of roughly this is distance light can travel in a third of a second as speed of light restricts communication between more distant regions for a size comparison diameter of sun is about in april may 1971 luc braes and george k miley from leiden observatory and independently robert m and campbell wade at national radio astronomy observatory detected radio emission from cygnus x 1 and their accurate radio position pinpointed x ray source to star 35 1910 hde 226868 on celestial sphere this star lies about half a degree from 4th magnitude star eta cygni it is a supergiant star that is by itself incapable of emitting observed quantities of x rays hence star must have a companion that could heat gas to millions of degrees needed to produce radiation source for cygnus x 1 louise webster and paul murdin at royal greenwich observatory and charles thomas bolton working independently at university of toronto s david dunlap observatory announced discovery of a massive hidden companion to hde 226868 in 1971 measurements of doppler shift of star s spectrum demonstrated companion s presence and allowed its mass to be estimated from orbital parameters based on high predicted mass of object they surmised that it may be a black hole as largest possible neutron star cannot exceed three times mass of sun with further observations strengthening evidence by end of 1973 astronomical community generally conceded that cygnus x 1 was most likely a black hole more precise measurements of cygnus x 1 demonstrated variability down to a single millisecond this interval is consistent with turbulence in a disk of accreted matter surrounding a black hole accretion disk x ray bursts that last for about a third of a second match expected time frame of matter falling toward a black hole right thumb this x ray image of cygnus x 1 was taken by a balloon borne telescope high energy replicated optics hero project nasa image cygnus x 1 has since been studied extensively using observations by orbiting and ground based instruments similarities between emissions of x ray binaries such as hde 226868 cygnus x 1 and active galactic nuclei suggests a common mechanism of energy generation involving a black hole an orbiting accretion disk and associated jets for this reason cygnus x 1 is identified among a class of objects called an analog of quasars or quasi stellar radio sources now known to be distant active galactic nuclei scientific studies of binary systems such as hde 226868 cygnus x 1 may lead to further insights into mechanics of active galaxies binary system compact object and blue supergiant star form a binary system in which they orbit around their center of mass every 5 days from perspective of earth compact object never goes behind other star in other words system does not eclipse however inclination of orbital plane to line of sight from earth remains uncertain with predictions ranging from 27 65deg a 2007 study estimated inclination is which would mean that semi major axis is about or 20 of distance from earth to sun orbital eccentricity is thought to be only a nearly circular orbit earth s distance to this system is about hde 226868 cygnus x 1 system shares a common motion through space with an association of massive stars named cygnus ob3 which is located at roughly 2 000 parsecs from sun this implies that hde 226868 cygnus x 1 and this ob association may have formed at same time and location if so then age of system is about motion of hde 226868 with respect to cygnus ob3 is a typical value for random motion within a stellar association hde 226868 is about from center of association and could have reached that separation in about which roughly agrees with estimated age of association with a galactic latitude of 4 degrees and galactic longitude 71 degrees this system lies inward along same orion spur in which sun is located within milky way near where spur approaches sagittarius arm cygnus x 1 has been described as belonging to sagittarius arm though structure of milky way is not well established compact object from various techniques mass of compact object appears to be greater than maximum mass for a neutron star stellar evolutionary models suggest a mass of while other techniques resulted in 10 solar masses measuring in x ray emission near object has yielded a more precise value of in all cases object is most likely a black hole a region of space with a gravitational field that is strong enough to prevent escape of electromagnetic radiation from interior boundary of this region is called event horizon and has an effective radius called schwarzschild radius which is about for cygnus x 1 anything including matter and photons that passes through this boundary is unable to escape evidence of just such an event horizon may have been detected in 1992 using ultraviolet uv observations with high speed photometer on hubble space telescope as self luminous clumps of matter spiral into a black hole their radiation will be emitted in a series of pulses that are subject to gravitational redshift as material approaches horizon that is wavelengths of radiation will steadily increase as predicted by general relativity matter hitting a solid compact object would emit a final burst of energy whereas material passing through an event horizon would not two such dying pulse trains were observed which is consistent with existence of a black hole thumb right chandra x ray observatory image of cygnus x 1 spin of compact object is not yet well determined past analysis of data from space based chandra x ray observatory suggested that cygnus x 1 was not rotating to any significant degree however evidence announced in 2011 suggests it is rotating extremely rapidly approximately 790 times per second formation largest star in cygnus ob3 association has a mass 40 times that of sun as more massive stars evolve more rapidly this implies that progenitor star for cygnus x 1 had more than 40 solar masses given current estimated mass of black hole progenitor star must have lost over 30 solar masses of material part of this mass may have been lost to hde 226868 while remainder was most likely expelled by a strong stellar wind helium enrichment of hde 226868 s outer atmosphere may be evidence for this mass transfer possibly progenitor may have evolved into a wolf rayet star which ejects a substantial proportion of its atmosphere using just such a powerful stellar wind if progenitor star had exploded as a supernova then observations of similar objects show that remnant would most likely have been ejected from system at a relatively high velocity as object remained in orbit this indicates that progenitor may have collapsed directly into a black hole without exploding or at most produced only a relatively modest explosion accretion disk right thumb a chandra x ray spectrum of cygnus x 1 showing a characteristic peak near due to ionized iron in accretion disk but peak is gravitationally red shifted broadened by doppler effect and skewed toward lower energies compact object is thought to be orbited by a thin flat disk of accreting matter known as an accretion disk this disk is intensely heated by friction between ionized gas in faster moving inner orbits and that in slower outer ones it is divided into a hot inner region with a relatively high level of ionization forming a plasma and a cooler less ionized outer region that extends to an estimated 500 times schwarzschild radius or about 15 000 km though highly and erratically variable cygnus x 1 is typically brightest persistent source of hard x rays those with energies from about 30 up to several hundred kev in sky x rays are produced as lower energy photons in thin inner accretion disk then given more energy through compton scattering with very high temperature electrons in a geometrically thicker but nearly transparent corona enveloping it as well as by some further reflection from surface of thin disk an alternative possibility is that x rays may be compton scattered by base of a jet instead of a disk corona x ray emission from cygnus x 1 can vary in a somewhat repetitive pattern called quasi periodic oscillations mass of compact object appears to determine distance at which surrounding plasma begins to emit these with emission radius decreasing as mass decreases this technique has been used to estimate mass of cygnus x 1 providing a cross check with other mass derivations pulsations with a stable period similar to those resulting from spin of a neutron star have never been seen from cygnus x 1 pulsations from neutron stars are caused by neutron star s magnetic field however no hair theorem guarantees that black holes do not have magnetic poles for example x ray binary v 0332 53 was thought to be a possible black hole until pulsations were found cygnus x 1 has also never displayed x ray bursts similar to those seen from neutron stars cygnus x 1 unpredictably changes between two x ray states although x rays may vary continuously between those states as well in most common state x rays are hard which means that more of x rays have high energy in less common state x rays are soft with more of x rays having lower energy soft state also shows greater variability hard state is believed to originate in a corona surrounding inner part of more opaque accretion disk soft state occurs when disk draws closer to compact object possibly as close as accompanied by cooling or ejection of corona when a new corona is generated cygnus x 1 transitions back to hard state spectral transition of cygnus x 1 can be explained using a two component flow solution as proposed by chakrabarti and a hard state is generated by inverse of seed photons from disk and likewise synchrotron photons produced by hot electrons in centrifugal pressure supported boundary layer x ray flux from cygnus x 1 varies periodically every especially during superior conjunction when orbiting objects are most closely aligned with earth and compact source is more distant this indicates that emissions are being partially blocked by circumstellar matter which may be stellar wind from star hde 226868 there is a roughly periodicity in emission that could be caused by precession of accretion disk jets as accreted matter falls toward compact object it loses gravitational potential energy part of this released energy is dissipated by jets of particles aligned perpendicular to accretion disk that flow outward with relativistic velocities that is particles are moving at a significant fraction of speed of light this pair of jets provide a means for an accretion disk to shed excess energy and angular momentum they may be created by magnetic fields within gas that surrounds compact object cygnus x 1 jets are inefficient radiators and so release only a small proportion of their energy in electromagnetic spectrum that is they appear dark estimated angle of jets to line of sight is 30deg and they may be precessing one of jets is colliding with a relatively dense part of interstellar medium ism forming an energized ring that can be detected by its radio emission this collision appears to be forming a nebula that has been observed in optical wavelengths to produce this nebula jet must have an estimated average power of 4 or this is more than 1 000 times power emitted by sun there is no corresponding ring in opposite direction because that jet is facing a lower density region of ism in 2006 cygnus x 1 became first stellar mass black hole found to display evidence of gamma ray emission in very high energy band above signal was observed at same time as a flare of hard x rays suggesting a link between events x ray flare may have been produced at base of jet while gamma rays could have been generated where jet interacts with stellar wind of hde 226868 hde 226868 right thumb an artist s impression of hde 226868 cygnus x 1 binary system esa hubble illustration hde 226868 is a supergiant star with a spectral class of o9 7 which is on borderline between class o and class b stars it has an estimated surface temperature of 31 000 k and mass approximately 20 40 times mass of sun based on a stellar evolutionary model at estimated distance of 2 000 parsecs this star may have a radius equal to about 15 17 times solar radius and is approximately 300 000 400 000 times luminosity of sun for comparison compact object is estimated to be orbiting hde 226868 at a distance of about 40 solar radii or twice radius of this star surface of hde 226868 is being tidally distorted by gravity of massive companion forming a tear drop shape that is further distorted by rotation this causes optical brightness of star to vary by 0 06 magnitudes during each 5 6 day binary orbit with minimum magnitude occurring when system is aligned with line of sight ellipsoidal pattern of light variation results from limb darkening and gravity darkening of star s surface when spectrum of hde 226868 is compared to similar star epsilon orionis former shows an overabundance of helium and an of carbon in its atmosphere ultraviolet and hydrogen alpha spectral lines of hde 226868 show profiles similar to star p cygni which indicates that star is surrounded by a gaseous envelope that is being accelerated away from star at speeds of about 1 500 km s like other stars of its spectral type hde 226868 is thought to be shedding mass in a stellar wind at an estimated rate of solar masses per year this is equivalent of losing a mass equal to sun s every 400 000 years gravitational influence of compact object appears to be reshaping this stellar wind producing a focused wind geometry rather than a spherically symmetrical wind x rays from region surrounding compact object heat and ionize this stellar wind as object moves through different regions of stellar wind during its 5 6 day orbit uv lines radio emission and x rays themselves all vary roche lobe of hde 226868 defines region of space around star where orbiting material remains gravitationally bound material that passes beyond this lobe may fall toward orbiting companion this roche lobe is believed to be close to surface of hde 226868 but not overflowing so material at stellar surface is not being stripped away by its companion however a significant proportion of stellar wind emitted by star is being drawn onto compact object s accretion disk after passing beyond this lobe gas and dust between sun and hde 226868 results in a reduction in apparent magnitude of star as well as a reddening of hue red light can more effectively penetrate dust in interstellar medium estimated value of interstellar extinction av is 3 3 magnitudes without intervening matter hde 226868 would be a fifth magnitude star and thus visible to unaided eye stephen hawking and kip thorne cygnus x 1 was subject of a bet between physicists stephen hawking and kip thorne in which hawking bet against existence of black holes in region hawking later described this as an insurance policy of sorts in his book a brief history of time he wrote according to updated tenth anniversary edition of a brief history of time hawking has conceded bet due to subsequent observational data in favor of black holes in his own book black holes and time warps thorne reports that hawking conceded bet by breaking into thorne s
