took place at gaga s home and her vocals were recorded at electric lady studios in new york city music and lyrical interpretation perfect illusion is a dance rock song which is composed around a building chord sequence which bbc music reporter mark savage felt leads to a compelling sense of urgency singer s vocals are kept raw and untreated on song eschewing auto tune composition consists of pulsing verses and a guitar and vocal breakdown before final chorus with gaga singing main title multiple times around two minute mark there is a key change before final chorus lewis corner from digital spy felt that track alluded to gaga s previous album eras he called its core a simple pop song which harked back to singer s initial releases like just dance and poker face both 2008 mixture of guitar and grumbling synths reminded corner of gaga s single marry night from her second studio album born this way 2011 along with thumping beat there were also allusions to artpop era due to verse and refrain being connected in an unconventional manner glamour and rolling stone reported that some listeners found similarities between song and madonna s papa don t preach 1986 in response to

traditional songwriting and influences of soul but not in a literal way perfect illusion is written in key of f minor with a tempo of 125 beats per minute song is composed in time signature of common time and follows a basic chord progression of fm e g dmaj7 cm7 and gaga s vocals span from f3 to d5 lyrically perfect illusion delves on highest of highs and lowest of lows encountered in a relationship which has turned sour hence song s name gaga described it during an interview with iheartmedia as being about modern ecstasy we found our sweet simple way of saying it i get this sick adrenaline rush every time i hear it singer further clarified that lyrics ultimately was a commentary on social media and problems one face trying to present a perfect representation of themselves

illusion was about their relationship gaga retorted during an interview with siriusxm that song was not for kinney and was not a revenge track i love taylor so so much and this song is not a hit out

more rock oriented than just dance or poker face she also complimented vocals compared verses to work by singer bruce springsteen and added that track was as catchy as they come and sure to prove a

work think killers meets kylie lewis corner from digital spy wrote a detailed review of track describing its sound and associated imagery as undressed he also found echoes of springsteen in track

keeping gaga s voice in forefront writing for verge kaitlyn tiffany compared song to bad romance but with an extra adrenaline shot of a big stadium rock song and some twinkly vaguely creepy 80s

force make it a formidable return for gaga mikael wood from los angeles times called song a stomping disco rock jam with a killer robot motown groove buckets of scuzz punk guitar fuzz and a key change designed to trigger pavlovian fist pumps in a review for daily beast kevin fallon was very impressed with gaga s key change and complimented her vocals by describing it as explosive and jagged up that tradition hugh mcintyre from forbes claimed track manages to simultaneously take gaga in a different direction while still maintaining some of qualities that have made her so popular spencer kornhaber

shot cover artwork according to page six clip was filmed in a desert outside los angeles over course of two days gaga s longtime collaborator brandon maxwell did fashion style for production hogben and gelardin has been associated for past 10 years with gaga working on different projects stylistically collaborating on joanne was a different experience for them they were present in recording studio with singer and ronson during conception of several tracks and album s journey helped them understand gaga s intent with music since perfect illusion is an energetic track they wanted video to reflect that it was gaga s idea to envision clip as a performance which became starting point for gelardin and hogben they wanted her to perform in between people instead on a stage and asked ronson parker and bloodpop to play cameos while being interviewed by v magazine directors elaborated further we wanted video to show her without artifice in a way that her videos may not have done in past there is a simplicity in concept for example we love that she holds handheld mic within performance single cover was taken on same day we didn t want it to be a posed still or a fashion image we wanted it to show movement and energy and for it to be about her and her performance gaga drove bronco herself in video and her commitment to performance and her authentic raw energy really came across in way she drove for us as directors it was scary and exciting at same time energy and emotion were purely authentic world premiere occurred on september 20 2016 during season two premiere of scream queens on fox gaga also shared a preview of video showing her swinging a microphone over her head as an ecstatic crowd cheers on visuals begin with her singing while driving a jeep through a desert and then finally performing in front of a crowd aided by producers video ends with gaga rolling around alone in desert jack white from official charts company noted that editing consisted of quick jagged camera cuts which made up majority of visuals in 2017 filming of music video was included in documentary film gaga five foot two reception and analysis thumb 250px gaga performing in desert throughout music video of song image illustrates gaga s eye rolling to back of her head as noted by spencer kornhaber from atlantic as well as epilepsy inducing editing pointed out by lara walsh from instyle alt a moving image of gaga singing while rotating her head as lights flash behind her a writer for billboard noted that gaga waded and stomped through desert while wearing tiny shorts and then appears in a party and ending signified singer to be alone rolling in desert jon blistein from rolling stone described visuals as an eye popping strobe lit with gaga throwing a frenetic desert rager in euphoric new video joey nolfi from entertainment weekly gave a positive review saying that it consisted of simple production design emphasis on gaga s unbridled choreography and noticeable absence of eccentric costumes and wigs which made it a radical departure from gaga s videography he noticed that video was heavy on rock star energy and did not have any particular narrative just focusing on gaga music and moves chelsea stone from teen vogue complimented dance nature of clip and noted that gaga had posted images from video previously as well as wore same outfit from video while announcing its premiere on twitter bianca gracie from fuse commented that gaga exudes fearlessness while she kicks up dust drives around in a jeep and throws a wild party in video carey o donnell from felt that video enhanced song with a sort of a this is what we re doing moment and it pointed to an unplugged era for gaga sasha geffen from mtv news noted gaga s eyes rolling back in her head as she with crowd in clip and at one point she almost rips head off of parker similar thoughts were echoed in lara walsh s review of clip for instyle where she about being a big fan of gaga s raw appearance in video writing for idolator mike wass noted that cover artwork gives one a clear idea regarding what to expect from video seeing that it reinvents gaga as a rockstar and epilepsy induced editing brings whole thing to life however he missed theatricality associated with singer s previous videos caitlyn callegari from bustle compared clip with that of experiencing a gaga concert from front row and called it appealing since it had singer s patented stylistic melodrama while also maintaining an air of realness to it callegari complimented visuals for bringing out gaga as both a performer and singer and this video invites us to enjoy her in her purest form spencer kornhaber from atlantic had hoped that after cheek to cheek era gaga would return to make her music video releases as events like her previous albums however he was disappointed that video for perfect illusion was toned down he felt editing to be excellently chaotic and noted that gaga s shots were filmed at a sped up rate than others other observations included something strange with gaga s eyes which he theorized was either due to makeup or her contact lenses to make whites bigger or directors wanted her to roll her pupils back he found gaga s fierce hungry and perhaps coked out look fitted with song s drug references kornhaber finished review saying that although clip was not a work of provocation it still appeared a brave step since none of singer s contemporaries would have attempted something so raw and low concept huffposts daniel welsh felt disappointed watching perfect illusion since according to him gaga has an impressive track record when it comes to videos live performances and media usage thumb gaga performing perfect illusion during joanne world tour perfect illusion was performed live for first time at moth club in london on september 10 2016 gaga was wearing a crop top tee and silver shorts alongside a microphone which she twirled above her head while
