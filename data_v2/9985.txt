debut studio album new classic song was written in wales during a period of heavy rain which inspired her to create a track that was sad but in a weird way like happy or calming or sort of peaceful with track she wanted to give as much information as she could about herself to detract her listeners from being influenced by criticism and tabloid journalism about her she disliked idea of revisiting her past but felt that it was necessary for her listeners to relate with being her first autobiographical song azalea encountered difficulty during its writing because of personal subject matter which she felt she could not fit into a song on its own azalea wrote song with invisible men trocon markous roberts and natalie sims sims stated that she fki and azalea had initially met back in 2008 but lost touch when azalea moved to los angeles track specifically drew inspiration from a period when azalea suffered from depression and dropped out of high school to become a domestic worker with her mother azalea saved money for a flight ticket to miami and left mullumbimby new south wales before she turned 16 an event referenced in song s lyric no money no family 16 in middle of miami which azalea felt said it all for this reason she chose to write and record work in isolation in rockfield monmouthshire with no phone reception visitors or interruptions she felt as a location it would help her recall personal struggles she wanted to write about on song azalea also believed that her best output was produced when in an environment outside her comfort zone her vocals were recorded at rockfield studios and monnow valley studios sims who abandoned four tour dates in order to fly over to britain to join azalea commented on her own involvement in song that fresh out of a breakup and depressed i spent a month in london in a small 10x10 studio somedays writing and writing and writing regardless of whether or not you like content song told iggy s true story of struggle

denoted it as record s most important and vulnerable moment she has also cited it as her most personal song and song she is most proud of composition work is a snap and trap song which incorporates elements of edm nina long of respect describes it as polar opposite of azalea s previous material track opens with azalea challenging walk a mile in these louboutins upon a sweeping keyboard introduction and beat it then leads into a similarly sad string laden first verse segment containing plaintive melodies according to gregory adams of exclaim song starts off smooth and ballady with azalea running through lines about her background but soon drops into club minded claps and screeching synths a prominent synth bass and drum heavy production drop formula then occurs at song s refrain in which azalea repeats hook i been work work work work workin on my shit production drop casts azalea s rapping against a combination of a roland tr 808 heavy minimal trap beat and edm clapping effects using divisive southern american english pronunciation azalea employs a defiant and rattling staccato delivery in double time her rapping pace varies from fast intricate rhymes to slow stretched out singular words while in verses her delivery is expletively riddled lyrics are autobiographical and portray azalea s fame seeking relocation from mullumbimby to miami at age of 16 and deal with subjects of work ethic and dedication to craft it specifically accounts for events of azalea growing up in mullumbimby juggling multiple occupations to save an income to independently start anew in miami lyrics also serve as a celebration of azalea s progression from being a struggling rapper as a rags to riches story and an underdog anthem line who don t know shit bout where i was made or how many floors that i had to scrub was suggested to be directed at her haters while couplet two feet in red dirt school skirt sugar cane back lanes is eloquent for azalea s origin according to jessie schiewe of respect lyrics also imply that azalea was swindled and take advantage of in her first record deal and that it provides insight into events that have toughened azalea up while cristina jaleru of associated press deduced that lyrics first deal changed me robbed blind basically raped me studied carters till a deal was offered slept cold on floor recording are rapped not as a complaint but as a badge of honor nick aveling of time out writes that azalea is depicted as a hustler and a woman with immense ambition in song in a npr publication ann powers viewed lyrics to be of
