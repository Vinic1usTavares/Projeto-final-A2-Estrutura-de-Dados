south ferry whitehall street is a new york city subway station complex in manhattan neighborhood of financial district under battery park complex is shared by irt broadway seventh avenue line and bmt broadway line it is served by 1 and r trains at all times n train during late nights only w train during weekdays only complex originally consisted of two separate stations in 1905 interborough rapid transit company irt opened a double balloon loop at south ferry serving irt broadway seventh avenue and irt lexington avenue lines brooklyn manhattan transit corporation bmt opened its station at whitehall street in 1918 despite their proximity stations remained separate for 91 years in early 2000s as part of recovery effort from september 11 2001 attacks a new south ferry terminal for broadway seventh avenue line was proposed that station opened in 2009 replacing loop station and providing a connection between broadway seventh avenue line s 1 train and broadway line s n r and w trains new terminal for broadway seventh avenue line was severely damaged during hurricane sandy in 2012 and mta temporarily re opened loop station between 2013 and 2017 adding a temporary connection between irt broadway seventh avenue line s loop and bmt broadway line s platforms newer terminal reopened in june 2017 following extensive renovations and waterproofing work this station complex is third on site to bear name south ferry first was an elevated station located nearby which was open from 1877 to 1950 and served former irt ninth sixth third and second avenue elevated lines second was old south ferry loop station located above existing station complex station layout exits thumb right an entrance to south ferry whitehall street seen in june 2017 entrances and exits are located at following places two staircases at west side of whitehall and stone streets east of alexander hamilton u s custom house and national museum of american indian one staircase at northeast corner of whitehall and stone streets two staircases at southwest corner of whitehall and water streets one set of staircase escalators and one elevator northwest of whitehall terminal one set of staircase escalator outside of bus stop at southeast corner of water and state streets one staircase on southwest side of state street south of intersection with pearl street irt broadway seventh avenue line platforms there are two separate stations on irt broadway seventh avenue line which are individually named south ferry due to their connection to manhattan s south ferry name south ferry loops is used for old south ferry platforms while newer platforms are called new south ferry newer island platform station was used by broadway seventh avenue line s 1 service from 2009 to 2012 until it was damaged by hurricane sandy outer loop platform was reopened from april 4 2013 to june 27 2017 to provide temporary replacement service old south ferry station 1905 2009 2013 2017 south ferry loops consist of two side platforms on curved balloon loop tracks outer platform was operational until 2017 when it was permanently replaced by new south ferry station inner platform was in operation until 1977 and was subsequently walled off however free transfers were unavailable between platforms and each platform was meant to be served by its own line most recent configuration using both tracks consisted of irt broadway seventh avenue line on outer loop platform and irt lexington avenue line on inner loop platform outer platform on july 10 1905 outer south ferry platform was first of two platforms to open and was an extension of original trunk line of interborough rapid transit company inner track existed when station was built but only as a storage track when h system of irt opened on july 1 1918 broadway seventh avenue line trains used outer platform while inner platform was opened for irt lexington avenue line trains which used original trunk line in lower manhattan only end doors of each car of five car trains could platform at station because of large gap between middle doors and platform owing to severe curve of station this problem was remedied in january 1959 when gap fillers were installed services on broadway seventh avenue line including 1 and 9 trains latter of which was a rush hour skip stop duplicate of former from 1989 to 2005 used outer platform as a terminal station for more than a century since its inception except for two relatively short periods of time first period was between september 2001 and september 2002 since main branch south of chambers street was impassable after september 11 attacks second was from march 16 2009 when new south ferry station opened for 1 train passengers to april 4 2013 when outer platform reopened with a transfer to bmt section of station complex newer station located underneath this one allowed a free transfer to bmt station whereas neither of this station s platforms originally did station features thumb left looking down platform platform is smaller than most others in system having only of surface area and it was originally served from two stairs leading from staten island ferry s whitehall terminal radius of curve is only meaning that platform curves approximately 77 5 degrees between its front and back ends platform accommodates first five cars of a train but rear five cars of a 10 car 1 train cannot load or unload in addition spray nozzles are required to lubricate track to reduce friction caused by tight curve which slows train operation and generates a loud metallic scraping noise because of curve gap fillers were required and are still used to bridge gap between platform and doors now automated gap fillers previously required manual operation with a foreman and at least two train crew all of whom could directly see each other train crew had to give a signal to foreman who pulled a tall wooden lever to manually extend and retract gap fillers gap fillers were also unreliable as they needed 15 days of maintenance for every 6 months in service platform featured an oak ticket booth and an oak cased clock from self winding clock company evidence of now demolished ticket booth is a beaux arts design engraved on ceiling platform also features station tiling by heins lafarge who designed station plaque in a sans serif font walls are made of small white rectangular tiles except for bottom which is marble there are also fifteen ceramic plaques toward top of platform wall all of which depict a sloop in new york harbor to signify station s location and use top of wall also includes festooned garlands and station monograms in addition to ceramic trim where wall intersects ceiling station artwork on original exit s landing is a 1990 mural south sails by former mta arts design director sandra bloodworth during 2004 finding of no significant impact for station it was determined that station was eligible for national register of historic places status replacement and restoration south ferry loop station proved to be a service bottleneck operationally loop station functioned an intermediate station rather than as a true terminal as trains would simply proceed back to rector street without motorman needing to go to reverse end of train additionally unlike most terminal stations in system there were neither layup tracks nor an additional track to store terminating trains and there were no additional layup tracks along line until at least 34th street penn station this meant that trains could not dwell at station for longer for 90 seconds including 5 to 10 seconds each that it took to extend and retract gap fillers any trains that went out of passenger service at station could have caused major delays along rest of line finally trains could only proceed through station at slow speeds adding 30 to 60 seconds to travel time compared to a regular terminal station with two tracks and a full length platform this ensured that 1 trains were delayed at chambers street station three stops north for up to two minutes in both directions in order to eliminate this special operation new station was built as a two track 10 car long island platform on a less severe curve permitting operation of a typical terminal station mta stated that new station saved four to six minutes of a passenger s trip time and increased peak capacity of 1 service to 24 trains per hour or one every 2 minutes 30 seconds as opposed to 16 to 17 trains per hour or one every 4 minutes with loop station successor station is fully accessible although its transfer to bmt broadway line is not with main entrance located across from staten island ferry terminal building s entrance after hurricane sandy in late october 2012 outer loop was brought back into service in order to turn trains uptown after terminating at rector street as replacement station suffered extensive flooding damage and closed for repairs after a few months mta decided to reopen loop station as an interim terminal to restore connection from 1 service to staten island ferry south ferry loop station was first subway station to reopen in history of mta station reopened on april 4 2013 and remained opened until june 27 2017 with a connection to broadway line platforms inner platform thumb closed inner platform as seen from outer platform inner platform opened for irt lexington avenue line passengers on july 1 1918 service from that line was moved from outer platform and outer platform was used for trains on newly opened broadway seventh avenue line this platform has an even sharper curve than outer platform and only center doors opened here with special arched openings in a wall between platform and track at locations of doors in late 1950s when irt division began to use mostly r type cars which could not have only center doors opened 5 trains which ended at south ferry evenings and weekends only and 6 trains which ended at south ferry late nights were rerouted to outer loop bowling green south ferry shuttle which ran weekdays and at first also late nights continued to use inner loop running to west platform at bowling green until 1977 when inner platform was closed and lexington avenue trains stopped using outer loop specially modified r12 cars were used starting in late 1960s until service ended these cars had two different door controls first opened outer two sets of doors while second opened center set of doors only there was no free transfer between inner loop and outer loop platforms which meant that passengers must pay another fare when moving from one loop to other no regular service has been at inner loop station since february 13 1977 although inner track is still used as a turning loop for 5 trains when they terminate at bowling green on weekday evenings and weekends south ferry station 2009 2012 2017 present south ferry station which serves irt broadway seventh avenue line exclusively has two tracks and one island platform and is only irt platform currently in use new station s platform has a slight curve but unlike loop stations can fit all 10 cars of a full length train without significant platform gaps or gap fillers two tracks end at bumper blocks at south end of platform this station was built as a replacement for loop station which was relegated to being used for turn arounds once new station opened unlike loop station this station is accessible only by irt broadway seventh avenue line local trains and does not connect with lexington avenue line it allows 24 trains per hour or one every 2 minutes and 30 seconds to terminate at station new station offers three street entrances with main entrance located across from staten island ferry terminal loop station originally had only one entrance within terminal itself before it reopened with a connection to south ferry whitehall street complex in 2013 it also added a free transfer to whitehall street south ferry station on bmt broadway line landscaping for peter minuit plaza which is above station was completed in may 2010 construction on september 11 2001 a terrorist attack destroyed world trade center located slightly to north of south ferry and battery since entire wtc site was destroyed in attacks this meant that segment of irt broadway seventh avenue line that ran through wtc including cortlandt street station two stops north of south ferry was also destroyed this changed 1 2 and 3 service and led to reduced service in manhattan and brooklyn until wtc section of line reopened in september 2002 concurrent with rebuilding of that section of line mta officials recognized need to build a more efficient terminal for 1 and 9 trains at south ferry since it was anticipated that line would be heavily used in long term aftermath of attacks this also coincided with renovation of battery park in 2003 money was allocated for new station s construction and in 2005 construction commenced on new station station was originally budgeted at 400 million with most of money being a grant from federal transit administration earmarked for world trade center reconstruction initially station s construction had been opposed because of high cost and low perceived time savings community leaders acquiesced after being told that some of money was going to be used to renovate battery park and south ferry terminal project was allowed to proceed fta issued a finding of no significant impact on august 30 2004 during planning fta evaluated several alternatives including extending existing loop platform northward building terminal with an extra track and platform building a two track terminal underneath loop building a two track terminal directly under water street to east building a two track terminal along waterfront under south street to southeast building a three track terminal below bmt broadway line s whitehall street station under namesake street and building terminal diagonally under peter minuit plaza of these seven options last one was chosen because any other alternative would have been either too expensive or logistically infeasible project was split up into three parts construction of bellmouths a fan plant and track junctions from existing line approach tunnels to station and station itself bellmouths construction would require that of original tunnel would have to be rebuilt to accommodate new junction fan plant located to east of existing line would facilitate ventilation from new deep level station which would be located below three exiting subway lines loop platform irt lexington avenue line s joralemon street tunnel and bmt broadway line s montague street tunnel two new approach tunnels would be single track tunnels connecting to a cavern where a double crossover switch would be installed new station located at a depth of would contain a platform a new mezzanine level escalators and an elevator in late 2005 new york city authorities announced that builders working on new station had found remains of a 200 year old stone wall after archaeological analysis it was widely reported to be oldest man made structure still in place in manhattan four walls and over 250 000 individual artifacts were found in excavation of subway station a portion of one wall was placed on temporary display inside castle clinton thumb left platform view as seen shortly after opening in 2009 in december 2008 news sources reported that new station was essentially finished however following month opening was delayed because tracks were too far from edge of platform and gap between platform and train did not meet ada standards other delays were attributed to leaks in station which were caused by station s high water table problem was corrected and station opened on march 16 2009 new and old downtown wall street and south ferry forgotten ny retrieved june 11 2014 a year behind when it was originally set to open at 530 million new south ferry station ended up being 130 million over budget it was first new subway station completed since 1989 when ind 63rd street line stations opened on april 16 2009 mta capital construction awarded a 19 2 million contract to tully construction company to reconstruct peter minuit plaza after station opened a long portion of excavated historic wall was embedded permanently into wall of entrance to newly constructed station this wall most likely is a portion of gun batteries that once protected city in late 17th and 18th centuries and gave rise to modern park name said robert tierney chairman of new york city landmarks preservation commission city and new york city transit authority plan to work together to preserve remains which were described as an important remnant of history of new york city station s mezzanine and escalator shafts feature monumental artwork titled see it split see it change which consists of fused glass wall stone mosaic and a stainless steel fence artwork by doug and mike starn depicts manhattan topography and was installed in mezzanine over a period of three years at time of work s installation it was most expensive mta arts for transit work ever installed with a price tag of 1 million post hurricane sandy thumb right station condition after hurricane sandy on october 29 2012 new south ferry station suffered extensive flooding damage caused by hurricane sandy station was flooded in up to of salt water submerging it from track level to mezzanine and turned station into a large fish tank as then mta chairman joseph lhota described it as a result this section of complex was closed until further notice mta estimated that repairs would cost 600 million and might continue until 2016 terminal for routes serving station was moved back to rector street until old loop station could be put back into service old loop station reopened on april 4 2013 as a temporary replacement until new station could be restored to revenue service connection between loop station and rest of station necessitated temporary removal of a section of see it split see it change artwork station underwent renovations signal room relocations and extensive waterproofing work 194 million contract was awarded in november 2014 to judlau contracting and station underwent extensive reconstruction until its reopening some undertaken tasks included installation of retractable floodgates at exits and entrances sealing of vents manholes hatches conduits and ducts and cleaning up of station these improvements necessitated closure of station complex s main entrance for almost a year starting in october 2015 renovation cost 345 million station reopened on june 27 2017 four years and eight months after hurricane sandy opening occurred in time to accommodate new service patterns due to a long term weekend closure of clark street tunnel which diverted weekend 2 trains to south ferry for one year gallery bmt broadway line platforms whitehall street south ferry on bmt broadway line has three tracks and two island platforms outer tracks continue south into montague street tunnel to bmt fourth avenue line in brooklyn and are used by late night n trains and daytime r trains center track used to terminate late night r trains from brooklyn and weekday w trains from queens merges with outer tracks at both ends of station station is deep because of two factors line goes under east river directly southeast of station and station exists immediately to south of shallower bowling green station which crosses broadway line fare control area and transfer to irt broadway seventh avenue line platforms are at extreme south end of station with additional exits at north end south of this station a pair of bellmouths exists allowing for a connection to a never built east river tunnel
