description marker size medium marker color green jacket shoal has been an important part of providence waterfront since city s first port was established in 1680 at india point india point on providence side was a busy and prosperous waterfront area taking its name from its trade connections with east and west indies its success was in part due to large trading businesses of john brown and his partner john francis who set up in providence in 1787 brown namesake of brown university was active in slave trade he his brother his sons and others in his family line brought slave ships to providence as part of atlantic triangle trade in late 1800s steamships that regularly came through shoal to india point carried immigrants to rhode island from ireland cape verde azores and portugal bold point on east providence side of shoal was home to maritime businesses including providence dry dock and marine railway co which operated two patent slips and first floating dry dock in narragansett bay used to repair and maintain ships according to providence journal from 1884 to 1919 it was main ship repair facility in providence green jacket shoal was its parking lot green jacket shoal takes its name from thick green eelgrass that once grew there moses king wrote in 1882 that dense grass is a source of much annoyance to extensive shipping interests at india point and bold point and efforts are being made to secure its removal india point remained profitable into early 1900s but began to decline during great depression it was battered by 1938 new england hurricane and commerce largely ceased by 1940s it had turned into a scrap yard in 1960s and 1970s providence underwent a concerted beautification effort including transformation of india point into a park which opened in 1974 long period of neglect is still reflected in condition of shoal which has accumulated a century s worth of debris remnants of destroyed docks pilings two patent slips dry dock shipwrecks abandoned ships and other structures stick out of water in many places around shoal owing to many years of natural disasters and economic hardship as character of area moved away from its industrial past and with increased public use of water and its surroundings via india point park and bold point park detritus has come to be a noted source of urban blight and significant safety concern for anyone using water in 2001 new england division of u s army corps of engineers proposed filling in area to turn it into a salt marsh research conducted for proposal found abundant shellfish including soft shell clams oysters mussels and periwinkles in intertidal areas of shoal years later when it was identified as a notable ship graveyard marine archaeologists argued for conservation of area as a means of preserving cultural history likening it to preservation of landmarks and other structures on land in 2018 rhode island coastal resources management council created a marine protected area to preserve shoal in cooperation with local historical organizations designation creates a restricted perimeter and authorizes state and local law enforcement to take measures to ensure graveyard is protected ship graveyard before a major 2015 cleanup effort rhode island sea grant funded a study of debris in green jacket shoal in november 2015 marine archaeologist david robinson of university of rhode island counted 26 shipwrecks making it state s largest ship graveyard in 2018 he increased number to 29 wrecks supplementing his dives with help from local libraries and archives two of ships are well known sidewheeler steamboats from late 1800s and early 1900s bay queen and mount hope passenger boats measuring 182 feet and 193 feet respectively bay queen took people around narragansett bay including to attractions like rocky point park and crescent park after running for 37 years from 1865 to 1902 its machinery and upper parts of its hull were removed with intention of turning it into a barge but it was later abandoned mount hope ferried people between providence newport and block island other ships in shoal are more recent including a barge that is also most visible wreck in shoal while shoal was shallow enough to be difficult for many ships to travel through its place in busy harbor made it an easy place to dump unwanted ships shoal was also home to ship maintenance facilities including area s main ship repair facility providence dry dock and maine railway co making it easy to recover anything of value before they were discarded robinson cites combination of these conveniences as primary reason shoal accumulated so many ships when company closed in early 20th century ships were left behind floating near coast of bold point poor quality of water increasingly polluted since middle of 19th century and related lack of marine life may be responsible for good condition of wrecks years later according to robinson via providence journal graveyard contains six classes of ships 2 sidewheeler cruise ships 17 scow barges 4 sailing ships 3 harbor steamers 2 steam diesel boats and 1 schooner barge robinson describes graveyard as not junk but an archaeological site of some significance last gasp of merchant sailing fleet and use of bay as a playground for rhode islanders he and marine archaeologist susan langley have made a case for preserving area for its historical and cultural significance cleanup thumb green jacket shoal in 2017 viewed from bold point park in east providence clean bays a non profit organization based in middletown rhode island developed a technique for clearing underwater debris it is based on aqualogger a ship designed by maine based company deadhead lumber to recover valuable underwater timber clean bays modified design by equipping it with an underwater chainsaw which can drop down to cut pieces of wood from larger structures by chopping up debris into smaller parts it can be easier to bring them to shore but importantly it also does not dig up potentially harmful sediments like using more forceful pulling or dragging methods could technique was piloted near bold point park in summer 2014 with a grant from schmidt family foundation s 11th hour racing project in 2015 clean bays removed two old barges from shoal and in 2014 and 2015 it received state and federal funding through national oceanic and atmospheric administration to pursue a year long project to clean up not just green jacket shoal but 350 acres of providence river and seekonk river for larger project organization modified its own ships to function like aqualogger rather than make arrangements to use it again some of debris with historic value is planned to be left submerged according to u s senator sheldon whitehouse who supported project this is kind of an effort at reclaiming seekonk river and northern tip of bay from long gone industrial uses and making them appropriate for kind of residential and recreational uses that could be a real gift to cities if it were made a more appealing amenity references external links presentation about cultural significance of green jacket shoal
