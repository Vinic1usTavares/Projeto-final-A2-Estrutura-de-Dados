adding an attractive inverse cube force red planet is stationary force f r is balanced by a repulsive inverse cube force a gif version of this animation is found here thumb right 250px figure 2 radius r of green and blue planets are same but their angular speed differs by a factor k examples of such orbits are shown in figures 1 and 3 5 in classical mechanics newton s theorem of revolving orbits identifies type of central force needed to multiply angular speed of a particle by a factor k without affecting its radial motion figures 1 and 2 newton applied his theorem to understanding overall rotation of orbits apsidal precession figure 3 that is observed for moon and planets term radial motion signifies motion towards or away from center of force whereas angular motion is perpendicular to radial motion isaac newton derived this theorem in propositions 43 45 of book i of his philosophiae naturalis principia mathematica first published in 1687 in proposition 43 he showed that added force must be a central force one whose magnitude depends only upon distance r between particle and a point fixed in space center in proposition 44 he derived a formula for force showing that it was an inverse cube force one that varies as inverse cube of r in proposition 45 newton extended his theorem to arbitrary central forces by assuming that particle moved in nearly circular orbit as noted by astrophysicist subrahmanyan chandrasekhar in his 1995 commentary on newton s principia this theorem remained largely unknown and undeveloped for over three centuries chandrasekhar p 183 since 1997 theorem has been studied by donald lynden bell and collaborators its first exact extension came in 2000 with work of mahomed and vawda historical context thumb left 300px retrograde motion of mars as viewed from earth thumb left 300px figure 3 planets revolving sun follow elliptical oval orbits that rotate gradually over time apsidal precession eccentricity of this ellipse is exaggerated for visualization most orbits in solar system have a much smaller eccentricity making them nearly circular a gif version of this animation is found here motion of astronomical bodies has been studied systematically for thousands of years stars were observed to rotate uniformly always maintaining same relative positions to one another however other bodies were observed to wander against background of fixed stars most such bodies were called planets after greek word planetoi planetoi for wanderers although they generally move in same direction along a path across sky ecliptic individual planets sometimes reverse their direction briefly exhibiting retrograde motion to describe this forward and backward motion apollonius of perga developed concept of and epicycles according to which planets are carried on rotating circles that are themselves carried on other rotating circles and so on any orbit can be described with a sufficient number of judiciously chosen epicycles since this approach corresponds to a modern fourier transform qm s mcnamara dj 2008 copernicus s epicycles from newton s gravitational force law via linear perturbation theory in geometric algebra roughly 350 years later claudius ptolemaeus published his almagest in which he developed this system to match best astronomical observations of his era to explain epicycles ptolemy adopted geocentric cosmology of aristotle according to which planets were confined to concentric rotating spheres this model of universe was authoritative for nearly 1500 years modern understanding of planetary motion arose from combined efforts of astronomer tycho brahe and physicist johannes kepler in 16th century tycho is credited with extremely accurate measurements of planetary motions from which kepler was able to derive his laws of planetary motion according to these laws planets move on ellipses not epicycles about sun not earth kepler s second and third laws make specific quantitative predictions planets sweep out equal areas in equal time and square of their orbital periods equals a fixed constant times cube of their semi major axis subsequent observations of planetary orbits showed that long axis of ellipse so called line of apsides rotates gradually with time this rotation is known as apsidal precession apses of an orbit are points at which orbiting body is closest or furthest away from attracting center for planets orbiting sun apses correspond to perihelion closest and aphelion furthest with publication of his principia roughly eighty years later 1687 isaac newton provided a physical theory that accounted for all three of kepler s laws a theory based on newton s laws of motion and his law of universal gravitation in particular newton proposed that gravitational force between any two bodies was a central force f r that varied as inverse square of distance r between them arguing from his laws of motion newton showed that orbit of any particle acted upon by one such force is always a conic section specifically an ellipse if it does not go to infinity however this conclusion holds only when two bodies are present two body problem motion of three bodies or more acting under their mutual gravitation n body problem remained unsolved for centuries after newton whittaker pp 339 385 although solutions to a few special cases were discovered newton proposed that orbits of planets about sun are largely elliptical because sun s gravitation is dominant to first approximation presence of other planets can be ignored by analogy elliptical orbit of moon about earth was dominated by earth s gravity to first approximation sun s gravity and those of other bodies of solar system can be neglected however newton stated that gradual apsidal precession of planetary and lunar orbits was due to effects of these neglected interactions in particular he stated that precession of moon s orbit was due to perturbing effects of gravitational interactions with sun newton s theorem of revolving orbits was his first attempt to understand apsidal precession quantitatively according to this theorem addition of a particular type of central force inverse cube force can produce a rotating orbit angular speed is multiplied by a factor k whereas radial motion is left unchanged however this theorem is restricted to a specific type of force that may not be relevant several perturbing inverse square interactions such as those of other planets seem unlikely to sum exactly to an inverse cube force to make his theorem applicable to other types of forces newton found best approximation of an arbitrary central force f r to an inverse cube potential in limit of nearly circular orbits that is elliptical orbits of low eccentricity as is indeed true for most orbits in solar system to find this approximation newton developed an infinite series that can be viewed as forerunner of taylor expansion cohen p 147 this approximation allowed newton to estimate rate of precession for arbitrary central forces newton applied this approximation to test models of force causing apsidal precession of moon s orbit however problem of moon s motion is complex and newton never published an accurate gravitational model of moon s apsidal precession after a more accurate model by in 1747 analytical models of moon s motion were developed in late 19th century by hill brown and delaunay however newton s theorem is more general than merely explaining apsidal precession it describes effects of adding an inverse cube force to any central force f r not only to inverse square forces such as newton s law of universal gravitation and coulomb s law newton s theorem simplifies orbital problems in classical mechanics by eliminating inverse cube forces from consideration radial and angular motions r t and th1 t can be calculated without inverse cube force afterwards its effect can be calculated by multiplying angular speed of particle mathematical statement thumb right 250px figure 4 all three planets share same radial motion cyan circle but move at different angular speeds blue planet feels only an inverse square force and moves on an ellipse k 1 green planet moves angularly three times as fast as blue planet k 3 it completes three orbits for every orbit of blue planet red planet illustrates purely radial motion with no angular motion k 0 paths followed by green and blue planets are shown in a gif version of this animation is found here thumb 250px right figure 5 green planet moves angularly one third as fast as blue planet k 1 3 it completes one orbit for every three blue orbits paths followed by green and blue planets are shown in a gif version of this animation is found here consider a particle moving under an arbitrary central force f1 r whose magnitude depends only on distance r between particle and a fixed center since motion of a particle under a central force always lies in a plane position of particle can be described by polar coordinates r th1 radius and angle of particle relative to center of force figure 1 both of these coordinates r t and th1 t change with time t as particle moves imagine a second particle with same mass m and with same radial motion r t but one whose angular speed is k times faster than that of first particle in other words azimuthal angles of two particles are related by equation th2 t k th1 t newton showed that motion of second particle can be produced by adding an inverse cube central force to whatever force f1 r acts on first principia section ix of book i propositions 43 45 pp 135 147 where l1 is magnitude of first particle s angular momentum which is a constant of motion conserved for central forces if k2 is greater than one f2 f1 is a negative number thus added inverse cube force is attractive as observed in green planet of figures 1 4 and 9 by contrast if k2 is less than one f2 f1 is a positive number added inverse cube force is repulsive as observed in green planet of figures 5 and 10 and in red planet of figures 4 and 5 alteration of particle path addition of such an inverse cube force also changes path followed by particle path of particle ignores time dependencies of radial and angular motions such as r t and th1 t rather it relates radius and angle variables to one another for this purpose angle variable is unrestricted and can increase indefinitely as particle revolves around central point multiple times for example if particle revolves twice about central point and returns to its starting position its final angle is not same as its initial angle rather it has increased by formally angle variable is defined as integral of angular speed a similar definition holds for th2 angle of second particle if path of first particle is described in form path of second particle is given by function since for example let path of first particle be an ellipse where a and b are constants then path of second particle is given by orbital precession if k is close but not equal to one second orbit resembles first but revolves gradually about center of force this is known as orbital precession figure 3 if k is greater than one orbit precesses in same direction as orbit figure 3 if k is less than one orbit precesses in opposite direction although orbit in figure 3 may seem to rotate uniformly i e at a constant angular speed this is true only for circular orbits if orbit rotates at an angular speed o angular speed of second particle is faster or slower than that of first particle by o in other words angular speeds would satisfy equation however newton s theorem of revolving orbits states that angular speeds are related by multiplication where k is a constant combining these two equations shows that angular speed of precession equals hence o is constant only if o1 is constant according to conservation of angular momentum o1 changes with radius r where m and l1 are first particle s mass and angular momentum respectively both of which are constant hence o1 is constant only if radius r is constant i e when orbit is a circle however in that case orbit does not change as it precesses illustrative example cotes s spirals thumb right figure 6 for blue particle moving in a straight line radius r from a given center varies with angle according to equation where b is distance of closest approach impact parameter shown in red simplest illustration of newton s theorem occurs when there is no initial force i e f1 r 0 in this case first particle is stationary or travels in a straight line if it travels in a straight line that does not pass through origin yellow line in figure 6 equation for such a line may be written in polar coordinates r th1 as where th0 is angle at which distance is minimized figure 6 distance r begins at infinity when th1 and decreases gradually until th1 when distance reaches a minimum then gradually increases again to infinity at th1 minimum distance b is impact parameter which is defined as length of perpendicular from fixed center to line of motion same radial motion is possible when an inverse cube central force is added thumb left 150px figure 7 corresponding to k equal to 2 3 red 1 0 black 1 5 green 3 0 cyan and 6 0 blue when k is less than one inverse cube force is repulsive whereas when k is greater than one force is attractive an inverse cube central force f2 r has form where numerator m may be positive repulsive or negative attractive if such an inverse cube force is introduced newton s theorem says that corresponding solutions have a shape called cotes s spirals these are curves defined by equation where constant k equals when right hand side of equation is a positive real number solution corresponds to an epispiral when argument th1 th0 equals cosine goes to zero and radius goes to infinity thus when k is less than one range of allowed angles becomes small and force is repulsive red curve on right in figure 7 on other hand when k is greater than one range of allowed angles increases corresponding to an attractive force green cyan and blue curves on left in figure 7 orbit of particle can even wrap around center several times possible values of parameter k may range from zero to infinity which corresponds to values of m ranging from negative infinity up to positive upper limit l12 m thus for all attractive inverse cube forces negative m there is a corresponding epispiral orbit as for some repulsive ones m l12 m as illustrated in figure 7 stronger repulsive forces correspond to a faster linear motion thumb left 150px figure 8 poinsot spirals cosh spirals corresponding to l equal to 1 0 green 3 0 cyan and 6 0 blue one of other solution types is given in terms of hyperbolic cosine where constant l satisfies this form of cotes s spirals corresponds to one of two poinsot s spirals figure 8 possible values of l range from zero to infinity which corresponds to values of m greater than positive number l12 m thus poinsot spiral motion only occurs for repulsive inverse cube central forces and applies in case that l is not too large for given m taking limit of k or l going to zero yields third form of a cotes s spiral so called reciprocal spiral or hyperbolic spiral as a solution where a and e are arbitrary constants such curves result when strength m of repulsive force exactly balances angular momentum mass term closed orbits and inverse cube central forces thumb 170px right figure 9 harmonic orbits with blue 2 magenta and 3 green an animation of blue and green orbits is shown in figure 4 two types of central forces those that increase linearly with distance f cr such as hooke s law and inverse square forces such as newton s law of universal gravitation and coulomb s law have a very unusual property a particle moving under either type of force always returns to its starting place with its initial velocity provided that it lacks sufficient energy to move out to infinity in other words path of a bound particle is always closed and its motion repeats indefinitely no matter what its initial position or velocity as shown by bertrand s theorem this property is not true for other types of forces in general a particle will not return to its starting point with same velocity however newton s theorem shows that an inverse cubic force may be applied to a particle moving under a linear or inverse square force such that its orbit remains closed provided that k equals a rational number a number is called rational if it can be written as a fraction m n where m and n are integers in such cases addition of inverse cubic force causes particle to complete m rotations about center of force in same time that original particle completes n rotations this method for producing closed orbits does not violate bertrand s theorem because added inverse cubic force depends on initial velocity of particle thumb right 170px figure 10 subharmonic orbits with blue 1 2 magenta and 1 3 green an animation of blue and green orbits is shown in figure 5 harmonic and subharmonic orbits are special types of such closed orbits a closed trajectory is called a harmonic orbit if k is an integer i e if in formula for example if green planet in figures 1 and 4 green orbit in figure 9 resulting orbit is third harmonic of original orbit conversely closed trajectory is called a subharmonic orbit if k is inverse of an integer i e if in formula for example if green planet in figure 5 green orbit in figure 10 resulting orbit is called third subharmonic of original orbit although such orbits are unlikely to occur in nature they are helpful for illustrating newton s theorem limit of nearly circular orbits in proposition 45 of his principia newton applies his theorem of revolving orbits to develop a method for finding force laws that govern motions of planets johannes kepler had noted that orbits of most planets and moon seemed to be ellipses and long axis of those ellipses can determined accurately from astronomical measurements long axis is defined as line connecting positions of minimum and maximum distances to central point i e line connecting two apses for illustration long axis of planet mercury is defined as line through its successive positions of perihelion and aphelion over time long axis of most orbiting bodies rotates gradually generally no more than a few degrees per complete revolution because of gravitational perturbations from other bodies oblateness in attracting body general relativistic effects and other effects newton s method uses this apsidal precession as a sensitive probe of type of force being applied to planets newton s theorem describes only effects of adding an inverse cube central force however newton extends his theorem to an arbitrary central force f r by restricting his attention to orbits that are nearly circular such as ellipses with low orbital eccentricity e 0 1 which is true of seven of eight planetary orbits in solar system newton also applied his theorem to planet mercury newton principia book iii proposition 2 p 406 which has an eccentricity e of roughly 0 21 and suggested that it may pertain to halley s comet whose orbit has an eccentricity of roughly 0 97 a qualitative justification for this extrapolation of his method has been suggested by wilson and harper according to their argument newton considered apsidal precession angle a angle between vectors of successive minimum and maximum distance from center to be a smooth continuous function of orbital eccentricity e for inverse square force a equals 180deg vectors to positions of minimum and maximum distances lie on same line if a is initially not 180deg at low e quasi circular orbits then in general a will equal 180deg only for isolated values of e a randomly chosen value of e would be very unlikely to give a 180deg therefore observed slow rotation of apsides of planetary orbits suggest that force of gravity is an inverse square law quantitative formula to simplify equations newton writes f r in terms of a new function c r where r is average radius of nearly circular orbit newton expands c r in a series now known as a taylor expansion in powers of distance r one of first appearances of such a series by equating resulting inverse cube force term with inverse cube force for revolving orbits newton derives an equivalent angular scaling factor k for nearly circular orbits in other words application of an arbitrary central force f r to a nearly circular elliptical orbit can accelerate angular motion by factor k without affecting radial motion significantly if an elliptical orbit is stationary particle rotates about center of force by 180deg as it moves from one end of long axis to other two apses thus corresponding apsidal angle a for a general central force equals using general law examples newton illustrates his formula with three examples in first two central force is a power law so c r is proportional to rn formula above indicates that angular motion is multiplied by a factor so that apsidal angle a equals 180deg this angular scaling can be seen in apsidal precession i e in gradual rotation of long axis of ellipse figure 3 as noted above orbit as a whole rotates with a mean angular speed o k 1 o where o equals mean angular speed of particle about stationary ellipse if particle requires a time t to move from one apse to other this implies that in same time long axis will rotate by an angle b ot k 1 ot k 1 for an inverse square law such as newton s law of universal gravitation where n equals 1 there is no angular scaling k 1 apsidal angle a is 180deg and elliptical orbit is stationary o b 0 as a final illustration newton considers a sum of two power laws which multiplies angular speed by a factor newton applies both of these formulae power law and sum of two power laws to examine apsidal precession of moon s orbit precession of moon s orbit thumb 350px right moon s motion is more complex than those of planets mainly due to competing gravitational pulls of earth and sun motion of moon can be measured accurately and is noticeably more complex than that of planets ancient greek astronomers hipparchus and ptolemy had noted several periodic variations in moon s orbit such as small oscillations in its orbital eccentricity and inclination of its orbit to plane of ecliptic these oscillations generally occur on a once monthly or twice monthly time scale line of its apses precesses gradually with a period of roughly 8 85 years while its line of nodes turns a full circle in roughly double that time 18 6 years smith p 252 this accounts for roughly 18 year periodicity of eclipses so called saros cycle however both lines experience small fluctuations in their motion again on monthly time scale in 1673 jeremiah horrocks published a reasonably accurate model of moon s motion in which moon was assumed to follow a precessing elliptical orbit a sufficiently accurate and simple method for predicting moon s motion would have solved navigational problem of determining a ship s longitude in newton s time goal was to predict moon s position to 2 two arc minutes which would correspond to a 1deg error in terrestrial longitude smith p 254 horrocks model predicted lunar position with errors no more than 10 arc minutes for comparison diameter of moon is roughly 30 arc minutes newton used his theorem of revolving orbits in two ways to account for apsidal precession of moon newton principia book i section ix proposition 45 pp 141 147 first he showed that moon s observed apsidal precession could be accounted for by changing force law of gravity from an inverse square law to a power law in which exponent was roughly 2 0165 chandrasekhar p 198 in 1894 asaph hall adopted this approach of modifying exponent in inverse square law slightly to explain an anomalous orbital precession of planet mercury which had been observed in 1859 by urbain le verrier ironically hall s theory was ruled out by careful astronomical observations of moon currently accepted explanation for this precession involves theory of general relativity which to first approximation adds an inverse quartic force i e one that varies as inverse fourth power of distance as a second approach to explaining moon s precession newton suggested that perturbing influence of sun on moon s motion might be approximately equivalent to an additional linear force first term corresponds to gravitational attraction between moon and earth where r is moon s distance from earth second term so newton reasoned might represent average perturbing force of sun s gravity of earth moon system such a force law could also result if earth were surrounded by a spherical dust cloud of uniform density using formula for k for nearly circular orbits and estimates of a and b newton showed that this force law could not account for moon s precession since predicted apsidal angle a was 180 rather than observed a 181 for every revolution long axis would rotate 1 5deg roughly half of observed 3 0deg generalization isaac newton first published his theorem in 1687 as propositions 43 45 of book i of his philosophiae naturalis principia mathematica however as astrophysicist subrahmanyan chandrasekhar noted in his 1995 commentary on newton s principia theorem remained largely unknown and undeveloped for over three centuries first generalization of newton s theorem was discovered by mahomed and vawda in 2000 as newton did they assumed that angular motion of second particle was k times faster than that of first particle in contrast to newton however mahomed and vawda did not require that radial motion of two particles be same rather they required that inverse radii be related by a linear equation this transformation of variables changes path of particle if path of first particle is written second particle s path can be written as if motion of first particle is produced by a central force f1 r mahomed and vawda showed that motion of second particle can be produced by following force according to this equation second force f2 r is obtained by scaling first force and changing its argument as well as by adding inverse square and inverse cube central forces for comparison newton s theorem of revolving orbits corresponds to case and so that in this case original force is not scaled and its argument is unchanged inverse cube force is added but inverse square term is not also path of second particle is consistent with formula given above derivations newton s derivation newton s derivation is found in section ix of his principia specifically propositions 43 45 chandrasekhar pp 183 192 his derivations of these propositions are based largely on geometry proposition 43 problem 30 thumb right 250px diagram illustrating newton s derivation blue planet follows dashed elliptical orbit whereas green planet follows solid elliptical orbit two ellipses share a common focus at point c angles ucp and both equal th1 whereas black arc represents angle which equals solid ellipse has rotated relative to dashed ellipse by angle which equals k 1 th1 all three planets red blue and green are at same distance r from center of force c it is required to make a body move in a curve that revolves about center of force in same manner as another body in same curve at rest chandrasekhar p 184 newton s derivation of proposition 43 depends on his proposition 2 derived earlier in principia chandrasekhar pp 67 70 proposition 2 provides a geometrical test for whether net force acting on a point mass a particle is a central force newton showed that a force is central if and only if particle sweeps out equal areas in equal times as measured from center newton s derivation begins with a particle moving under an arbitrary central force f1 r motion of this particle under this force is described by its radius r t from center as a function of time and also its angle th1 t in an infinitesimal time dt particle sweeps out an approximate right triangle whose area is since force acting on particle is assumed to be a central force particle sweeps out equal angles in equal times by newton s proposition 2 expressed another way rate of sweeping out area is constant this constant areal velocity can be calculated as follows at and periapsis positions of closest and furthest distance from attracting center velocity and radius vectors are perpendicular therefore angular momentum l1 per mass m of particle written as h1 can be related to rate of sweeping out areas now consider a second particle whose orbit is identical in its radius but whose angular variation is multiplied by a constant factor k areal velocity of second particle equals that of first particle multiplied by same factor k since k is a constant second particle also sweeps out equal areas in equal times therefore by proposition 2 second particle is also acted upon by a central force f2 r this is conclusion of proposition 43 proposition 44 difference of forces by which two bodies may be made to move equally one in a fixed other in same orbit revolving varies inversely as cube of their common altitudes chandrasekhar p 187 to find magnitude of f2 r from original central force f1 r newton calculated their difference using geometry and definition of centripetal acceleration in proposition 44 of his principia he showed that difference is proportional to inverse cube of radius specifically by formula given above which newtons writes in terms of two constant areal velocities h1 and h2 proposition 45 problem 31 to find motion of apsides in orbits approaching very near to circles in this proposition newton derives consequences of his theorem of revolving orbits in limit of nearly circular orbits this approximation is generally valid for planetary orbits and orbit of moon about earth this approximation also allows newton to consider a great variety of central force laws not merely inverse square and inverse cube force laws modern derivation modern derivations of newton s theorem have been published by whittaker 1937 whittaker p 83 and chandrasekhar 1995 by assumption second angular speed is k times faster than first since two radii have same behavior with time r t conserved angular momenta are related by same factor k equation of motion for a radius r of a particle of mass m moving in a central potential v r is given by lagrange s equations applying general formula to two orbits yields equation which can be re arranged to form this equation relating two radial forces can be understood qualitatively as follows difference in angular speeds or equivalently in angular momenta causes a difference in centripetal force requirement to offset this radial force must be altered with an inverse cube force newton s theorem can be expressed equivalently in terms of potential energy which is defined for central forces radial force equation can be written in terms of two potential energies integrating with respect to distance r newtons s theorem states that a k fold change in angular speed results from adding an inverse square potential energy to any given potential energy v1 r newton s geometric proof from principia principia revolving orbits 2 simplified geometric proof of proposition 44 although newton states that problem was to be solved by proposition 6 he does not use it explicitly in following simplified proof proposition 6 is used to show how result is derived newton s detailed proof follows that and finally proposition 6 is appended as it is not well known proposition 44 uses proposition 6 to prove a result about revolving orbits in propositions following proposition 6 in section 2 of principia he applies it to specific curves for example conic sections in case of proposition 44 it is applied to any orbit under action of an arbitrary force directed towards a fixed point to produce a corresponding revolving orbit in fig 1 mn is part of that orbit at point p body moves to q under action of a force directed towards s as before force f sp is defined at each point p on curve in fig 2 corresponding part of revolving orbit is mn with s as its centre of force assume that initially body in static orbit starts out at right angles to radius with speed v body in revolving orbit must also start at right angles and assume its speed is v in case shown in fig 1 and force is directed towards s argument applies equally if also force may be directed away from centre let sa be initial direction of static orbit and sa that of revolving orbit if after a certain time bodies in respective orbits are at p and p then ratios of angles ratios of areas and radii figure and arc py in fig 2 are figure and arc pq in fig 1 expanded linearly in horizontal direction in ratio so that and straight lines qt and qt should really be circular arcs with centres s and s and radii sq and sq respectively in limit their ratio becomes whether they are straight lines or arcs since in limit forces are parallel to sp and sp if same force acted on body in fig 2 as in fig 1 body would arrive at y since ry rq difference in horizontal speed does not affect vertical distances newton refers to corollary 2 of laws of motion where motion of bodies is resolved into a component in radial direction acted on by whole force and other component transverse to it acted on by no force however distance from y to centre s is now greater than sq so an additional force is required to move body to q such that sq sq extra force is represented by yq and f is proportional to ry yq just as f is to rq difference can be found as follows so and in limit as qt and qt approach zero becomes equal to or so therefore since from proposition 6 fig 1 and see below force is divide by where k is constant to obtain forces in fig 3 at initial point a of static curve draw tangent ar which is perpendicular to sa and circle which just touches curve at a let r be radius of that circle since angle sar is a right angle centre of circle lies on sa from property of a circle and in limit as q approaches a this becomes hence and since f sa is given this determines constant k however newton wants force at a to be of form where c is a constant so that where expression for f sp above is same as newton s in corollary 4 of proposition 44 except that he uses different letters he writes where g and f are not necessarily equal to v and v respectively and uses letter v for constant corresponding to c and letter x for function f sp above geometric proof shows very clearly where additional force arises from to make orbit revolve with respect to static orbit newton s proof of proposition 44 newton s proof is complicated in view of simplicity of above proof as an example his proof requires some deciphering as following sentence shows and therefore if with centre c and any radius cp or cp a circular sector is described equal to total area vpc which body p revolving in an immobile orbit has described in any time by a radius drawn to centre difference between forces by which body p in an immobile orbit and body p in a mobile orbit revolve will be to centripetal force by which some body by a radius drawn to centre would have been able to describe that sector uniformly in same time in which area vpc was described as g2 f2 to f2 he initially regards infinitesimal as fixed then areas spq and spq are proportional to v and v respectively therefore and at each of points p and p and so additional force varies inversely as cube of radius in fig 1 is a circular arc with centre s and radius sq meeting sp at x perpendicular meets rq at y and let be force required to make a body move in a circle of radius sq if it has same speed as transverse speed of body in static orbit at q at every point p and in particular at apside a but at a in fig 3 ratio of force that makes body follow static curve ae to that required to make it follow circle ab with radius sa is inversely as ratio of their radii of curvature since they are both moving at same speed v perpendicular to sa from first part of proof substituting newton s expression for f sa gives result obtained previously newton s proof of proposition 45 to find motion of apsides in orbits approaching circles proposition 44 was devised expressly to prove this proposition newton wants to investigate motion of a body in a nearly circular orbit attracted by a force of form he approximates static curve by an ellipse with an inverse square force f sp directed to one of foci made to revolve by addition of an inverse cube force according to proposition 44 for static ellipse with force varying inversely as sp squared since c is defined above so that with body in static orbit starting from upper apside at a it will reach lower apside point closest to s after moving through an angle of 180 degrees newton wants a corresponding revolving orbit starting from apside a about a point s with lower apside shifted by an angle a where initial speed v at a must be just less than that required to make body move in a circle then r can be taken as equal to sa or sa problem is to determine v from value of n so that a can be found or given a to find n letting then by our method of converging series plus terms in x2 and above which can be ignored because orbit is almost circular so x is small compared to sa comparing 2 expressions for f sp it follows that also ratio of initial forces at a is given by proposition 6 for proof of proposition 44 above in fig 1 a body is moving along a specific curve mn acted on by a centripetal force towards fixed point s force depends only of distance of point from s aim of this proposition is to determine how force varies with radius sp method applies equally to case where force is centrifugal in a small time body moves from p to nearby point q draw qr parallel to sp meeting tangent at r and qt perpendicular to sp meeting it at t if there was no force present it would have moved along tangent at p with speed that it had at p arriving at point r if force on body moving from p to q was constant in magnitude and parallel to direction sp arc pq would be parabolic with pr as its tangent and qr would be proportional to that constant force and square of time conversely if instead of arriving at r body was deflected to q then a constant force parallel to sp with magnitude would have caused it to reach q instead of r however since direction of radius from s to points on arc pq and also magnitude of force towards s will change along pq above relation will not give exact force at p if q is sufficiently close to p direction of force will be almost parallel to sp all along pq and if force changes little pq can be assumed to be approximated by a parabolic arc with force given as above in terms of qr and time is proportional to area of sector spq this is kepler s second law a proof is demonstrated in proposition 1 book 1 in principia since arc pq can be approximated by a straight line area of sector spq and area of triangle spq can be taken as equal so where k is constant again this is not exact for finite lengths pq force law is obtained if limit of above expression exists as a function of sp as pq approaches zero in fact in time body with no force would have reached a point w further from p than r however in limit qw becomes parallel to sp point w is ignored in newton s proof also newton describes qr as versed sine of arc with p at its centre and length twice qp although this is not strictly same as qr that he has in diagram fig 1 in limit they become equal notes this proposition is based on galileo s analysis of a body following a parabolic trajectory under action of a constant acceleration in proposition 10 he describes it as galileo s theorem and mentions galileo several other times in relation to it in principia combining it with kepler s second law gives simple and elegant method in historically very important case where mn in fig 1 was part of an ellipse and s was one of its foci newton showed in proposition 11 that limit was constant at each point on curve so that force on body directed towards fixed point s varied inversely as square of distance sp besides ellipse with centre at focus newton also applied proposition 6 to hyperbola proposition 12 parabola proposition 13 ellipse with centre of force at centre of ellipse proposition 10 equiangular spiral proposition 9 and circle with centre of force not coinciding with centre and even on circumference
