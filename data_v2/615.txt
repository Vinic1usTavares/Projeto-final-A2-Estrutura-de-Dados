of vampire darla in pilot episode of buffy vampire slayer her performance was so well received that her character appeared in a few more episodes in an interview with thetvaddict com benz said of her casting i was supposed to die in pilot but about halfway through pilot joss whedon was like we re giving you a name and we re not going to kill you and he did that for a while until it finally came time to kill me and kill me and kill me and killed me she later went on to say for me i was a new actor to los angeles didn t know tv business very well so i was just excited to work and play a vampire i had no clue what i was going to do or how i was going to be scary until that is they put vampire makeup on me and i went into trailer and smiled which i thought was creepy joss always said he was intrigued that someone who looked like me and talked like me was like scariest vampire ever that s what he wanted my sweet voice and demeanour until all of a sudden i m just this vicious vampire darla is first killed in seventh episode of buffy vampire slayer in that episode it is revealed that darla was once romantically involved with angel and that she made him a vampire angel stakes her through heart benz was asked to return to role three years later but not on buffy vampire slayer joss whedon wanted her to appear on spin off angel which focused on angel s adventures in los angeles benz said in an interview i was shocked really when they sent me script for angel i kept asking where s darla i remember calling my agent asking are you sure they want me for this episode because i can t seem to find me and then i get to last page and there i am naked in a box awesome it was exciting when asked in an interview with robert canning of ign about how she felt about being asked to come on to angel after previously being killed off benz commented i was shocked i just thought once you poof d you poof d i thought that was it so when they threw it out to me that i was coming back they didn t tell me they were bringing her back to life they just sent me script for season finale for season one of angel when they rose me from dead i was reading script and half way through darla still hadn t shown up benz went on to add i was like alright i get three quarters of way through and i think maybe they sent me wrong script and then i get to last page and i was like oh my god i can t believe this this is so cool at that time i d been committed to another project too we didn t even know if i was going to be available or not but it all ended up working out darla appears in twenty angel episodes mainly as an evil antagonist character is known for dying most in buffy vampire slayer franchise benz later emphasized i just didn t know how it was going to happen so when they sent me script for my last episode of angel which i basically had to sign my life away to read i was sitting in my trailer and i just started to cry i thought it was such a beautiful ending it was payoff and just really brought her whole life kind of to that one moment so i was really upset my last day of filming because i really thought it was over to me characterization thumb upright transformation into darla was complicated benz was not a fan of process darla is presented in series as a wicked vampire with as benz put it generally pure intentions in an interview with thetvaddict benz said darla s just misunderstood her intentions are pure they re just kind of warped from her perspective first she has to eat she just happens to eat people second she was in love with angel and i always viewed darla as jilted ex wife that could never get over being dumped if you really look at her you can have sympathy and empathy for her in beginning of her life she was a prostitute joss and i actually talked about that a lot that she was probably abused growing up she did what she needed to do to survive she just lacked people skills achieving darla s look was a struggle for benz she said taking that makeup off it was like having six layers of skin ripped off your face every time it was miserable and contact lenses were terrible i don t wear contacts and i don t know how people do it sticking things in their eyeballs all time character s sense of fashion is vital to understanding her past benz says darla is dressed to nines in every time period in which she lives and she fully goes after a certain look if she s going to be living during boxer rebellion time she s got big gibson girl hair style and beautiful kimono style clothes benz points out that in buffy pilot episode darla attempting to dress like a high school student exaggerates it with a little twist wearing a catholic schoolgirl uniform instead i think i influenced darla fashion wise in second season of angel where she was a little more classic looking and tailored benz says explaining she collaborated with costume designer to transition darla into a hipper look when she became a vampire again darla shockingly becomes pregnant in third season of angel in an interview with bbc benz admitted yeah i really felt at that point she was pretty strung out her whole world was rocked she never thought she could get pregnant and then all of a sudden she s carrying this child and she s experiencing this soul for first time in four hundred years there s realisation that as soon as baby s born soul s going to go away and it s first time she really experienced true love so she was going through a lot emotionally i just didn t think that she would have time to really think about how she looked i don t think it was a priority and so for me as an actor it was important that i reveal that not get caught up in my own vanity as an actress and portray character as where she really was in an interview with bbc benz described darla as strong i have an amazing stunt double lisa hoyle who looks exactly like me she s just brilliant and fearless and she does about 90 per cent of stunts i think part of element of darla is how strong she is and how fierce she can be and lisa definitely adds to that element i would be a doing huge disservice to darla if i didn t allow her to do work that she does and to help add to that element that s so important to darla which is her strength storylines darla is born in late 16th century in british isles her birth name is never revealed in either series and darla herself eventually forgets it as a young prostitute she emigrates to virginia colony in north america and becomes independently wealthy but also contracts a fatal case of syphilis by 1609 darla lies dying in luxurious house she owns she scoffs at a priest who comes to her deathbed before he reveals his true identity master a very old and powerful vampire and leader of an elite cult of vampires known as order of aurelius darla despises clergy and religion a trait that follows her as a vampire master turns her into a vampire and renames her darla meaning dear one in early modern

first character seen on buffy vampire slayer julie benz instantly made an impression as vampiress darla for next 8 television seasons she would get to show many different facets of role as not even
