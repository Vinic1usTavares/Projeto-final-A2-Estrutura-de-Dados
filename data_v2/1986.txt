thumb 350px right hela cells stained for nuclear dna with blue fluorescent dye central and rightmost cell are in interphase thus their entire nuclei are labeled on left a cell is going through mitosis and its dna has condensed in cell biology nucleus pl nuclei from latin or meaning kernel or seed is a membrane bound organelle found in eukaryotic cells eukaryotes usually have a single nucleus but a few cell types such as mammalian red blood cells have no nuclei and a few others including osteoclasts have many cell nucleus contains all of cell s genome except for a small fraction of mitochondrial dna organized as multiple long linear dna molecules in a complex with a large variety of proteins such as histones to form chromosomes genes within these chromosomes are structured in such a way to promote cell function nucleus maintains integrity of genes and controls activities of cell by regulating gene expression nucleus is therefore control center of cell main structures making up nucleus are nuclear envelope a double membrane that encloses entire organelle and isolates its contents from cellular cytoplasm and nuclear matrix which includes nuclear lamina a network within nucleus that adds mechanical support much like cytoskeleton which supports cell as a whole because nuclear envelope is impermeable to large molecules nuclear pores are required to regulate nuclear transport of molecules across envelope pores cross both nuclear membranes providing a channel through which larger molecules must be actively transported by carrier proteins while allowing free movement of small molecules and ions movement of large molecules such as proteins and rna through pores is required for both gene expression and maintenance of chromosomes although interior of nucleus does not contain any membrane bound its contents are not uniform and a number of nuclear bodies exist made up of unique proteins rna molecules and particular parts of chromosomes best known of these is nucleolus which is mainly involved in assembly of ribosomes after being produced in nucleolus ribosomes are exported to cytoplasm where they translate mrna history thumb left upright 1 5 oldest known depiction of cells and their nuclei by antonie van leeuwenhoek 1719 thumb drawing of a salivary gland cell published by walther flemming in 1882 nucleus contains chromosomes nucleus was first organelle to be discovered what is most likely oldest preserved drawing dates back to early antonie van leeuwenhoek 1632 1723 he observed a lumen nucleus in red blood cells of salmon leeuwenhoek a van opera omnia seu arcana naturae ope detecta experimentis ad illustres viros j arnold et a beman batavorum 1719 1730 cited after dieter gerlach geschichte der verlag harri deutsch frankfurt am main germany 2009 unlike mammalian red blood cells those of other vertebrates still contain nuclei nucleus was also described by franz bauer in 1804 and in more detail in 1831 by scottish botanist robert brown in a talk at linnean society of london brown was studying orchids under microscope when he observed an opaque area which he called areola or nucleus in cells of flower s outer layer he did not suggest a potential function in 1838 matthias schleiden proposed that nucleus plays a role in generating cells thus he introduced name cytoblast cell builder he believed that he had observed new cells assembling around franz meyen was a strong opponent of this view having already described cells multiplying by division and believing that many cells would have no nuclei idea that cells can be generated de novo by cytoblast or otherwise contradicted work by robert remak 1852 and rudolf virchow 1855 who decisively propagated new paradigm that cells are generated solely by cells omnis cellula e cellula function of nucleus remained unclear online version here between 1877 and 1878 oscar hertwig published several studies on fertilization of sea urchin eggs showing that nucleus of sperm enters oocyte and fuses with its nucleus this was first time it was suggested that an individual develops from a single nucleated cell this was in contradiction to ernst haeckel s theory that complete phylogeny of a species would be repeated during embryonic development including generation of first nucleated cell from a a structureless mass of primordial protoplasm therefore necessity of sperm nucleus for fertilization was discussed for quite some time however hertwig confirmed his observation in other animal groups including amphibians and molluscs eduard strasburger produced same results for plants in 1884 this paved way to assign nucleus an important role in heredity in 1873 august weismann postulated equivalence of maternal and paternal germ cells for heredity function of nucleus as carrier of genetic information became clear only later after mitosis was discovered and mendelian rules were rediscovered at beginning of 20th century chromosome theory of heredity was therefore developed structures nucleus is largest organelle in animal cells in mammalian cells average diameter of nucleus is approximately 6 micrometres um which occupies about 10 of total cell volume contents of nucleus are held in nucleoplasm similar to cytoplasm in rest of cell fluid component of this is termed similar to cytosol in cytoplasm in most types of a white blood cell nucleus is and can be bi lobed tri lobed or multi lobed nuclear envelope and pores thumb 280px right eukaryotic cell nucleus visible in this diagram are ribosome studded double membranes of nuclear envelope dna complexed as chromatin and nucleolus within cell nucleus is a viscous liquid called nucleoplasm similar to cytoplasm found outside nucleus thumb right 250px a cross section of a nuclear pore on surface of nuclear envelope 1 other diagram labels show 2 outer ring 3 spokes 4 basket and 5 filaments nuclear envelope otherwise known as nuclear membrane consists of two cellular membranes an inner and an outer membrane arranged parallel to one another and separated by 10 to 50 nanometres nm nuclear envelope completely encloses nucleus and separates cell s genetic material from surrounding cytoplasm serving as a barrier to prevent macromolecules from diffusing freely between nucleoplasm and cytoplasm outer nuclear membrane is continuous with membrane of rough endoplasmic reticulum rer and is similarly studded with ribosomes space between membranes is called space and is continuous with rer lumen nuclear pores which provide aqueous channels through envelope are composed of multiple proteins collectively referred to as pores are about 125 million daltons in molecular weight and consist of around 50 in yeast to several hundred proteins in vertebrates pores are 100 nm in total diameter however gap through which molecules freely diffuse is only about 9 nm wide due to presence of regulatory systems within center of pore this size selectively allows passage of small water soluble molecules while preventing larger molecules such as nucleic acids and larger proteins from inappropriately entering or exiting nucleus these large molecules must be actively transported into nucleus instead nucleus of a typical mammalian cell will have about 3000 to 4000 pores throughout its envelope each of which contains an eightfold symmetric ring shaped structure at a position where inner and outer membranes fuse attached to ring is a structure called nuclear basket that extends into nucleoplasm and a series of filamentous extensions that reach into cytoplasm both structures serve to mediate binding to nuclear transport proteins most proteins ribosomal subunits and some dnas are transported through pore complexes in a process mediated by a family of transport factors known as karyopherins those karyopherins that mediate movement into nucleus are also called importins whereas those that mediate movement out of nucleus are called exportins most karyopherins interact directly with their cargo although some use adaptor proteins steroid hormones such as cortisol and aldosterone as well as other small lipid soluble molecules involved in intercellular signaling can diffuse through cell membrane and into cytoplasm where they bind nuclear receptor proteins that are trafficked into nucleus there they serve as transcription factors when bound to their ligand in absence of a ligand many such receptors function as histone that repress gene expression nuclear lamina in animal cells two networks of intermediate filaments provide nucleus with mechanical support nuclear lamina forms an organized meshwork on internal face of envelope while less organized support is provided on cytosolic face of envelope both systems provide structural support for nuclear envelope and anchoring sites for chromosomes and nuclear pores nuclear lamina is composed mostly of lamin proteins like all proteins lamins are synthesized in cytoplasm and later transported to nucleus interior where they are assembled before being incorporated into existing network of nuclear lamina lamins found on cytosolic face of membrane such as and bind to cytoskeleton to provide structural support lamins are also found inside nucleoplasm where they form another regular structure known as veil that is visible using fluorescence microscopy actual function of veil is not clear although it is excluded from nucleolus and is present during interphase lamin structures that make up veil such as bind chromatin and disrupting their structure inhibits transcription of protein coding genes like components of other intermediate filaments lamin monomer contains an alpha helical domain used by two monomers to coil around each other forming a dimer structure called a coiled coil two of these dimer structures then join side by side in an antiparallel arrangement to form a tetramer called a eight of these form a lateral arrangement that is twisted to form a filament these filaments can be assembled or disassembled in a dynamic manner meaning that changes in length of filament depend on competing rates of filament addition and removal mutations in lamin genes leading to defects in filament assembly cause a group of rare genetic disorders known as most notable is family of diseases known as progeria which causes appearance of premature aging in its sufferers exact mechanism by which associated biochemical changes give rise to aged phenotype is not well understood chromosomes thumb 200px a mouse nucleus in which dna is stained blue distinct chromosome territories of chromosome 2 red and chromosome 9 green are stained with fluorescent in situ hybridization cell nucleus contains majority of cell s genetic material in form of multiple linear dna molecules organized into structures called chromosomes each human cell contains roughly two meters of dna during most of cell cycle these are organized in a dna protein complex known as chromatin and during cell division chromatin can be seen to form well defined chromosomes familiar from a karyotype a small fraction of cell s genes are located instead in mitochondria there are two types of chromatin is less compact dna form and contains genes that are frequently expressed by cell other type heterochromatin is more compact form and contains dna that is infrequently transcribed this structure is further categorized into facultative heterochromatin consisting of genes that are organized as heterochromatin only in certain cell types or at certain stages of development and constitutive heterochromatin that consists of chromosome structural components such as telomeres and during interphase chromatin organizes itself into discrete individual patches called chromosome territories active genes which are generally found in region of chromosome tend to be located towards chromosome s territory boundary antibodies to certain types of chromatin organization in particular nucleosomes have been associated with a number of autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus these are known as anti nuclear antibodies ana and have also been observed in concert with multiple sclerosis as part of general immune system dysfunction as in case of progeria role played by antibodies in inducing symptoms of autoimmune diseases is not obvious nucleolus thumb left 200px an electron micrograph of a cell nucleus showing darkly stained nucleolus thumb 3d rendering of nucleus with location of nucleolus nucleolus is largest of discrete densely stained structures known as nuclear bodies found in nucleus it forms around tandem repeats of rdna dna coding for ribosomal rna rrna these regions are called nucleolar organizer regions nor main roles of nucleolus are to synthesize rrna and assemble ribosomes structural cohesion of nucleolus depends on its activity as ribosomal assembly in nucleolus results in transient association of nucleolar components facilitating further ribosomal assembly and hence further association this model is supported by observations that inactivation of rdna results in intermingling of nucleolar structures in first step of ribosome assembly a protein called rna polymerase i transcribes rdna which forms a large pre rrna precursor this is cleaved into subunits 5 8s 18s and 28s rrna transcription post transcriptional processing and assembly of rrna occurs in nucleolus aided by small nucleolar rna snorna molecules some of which are derived from spliced introns from messenger rnas encoding genes related to ribosomal function assembled ribosomal subunits are largest structures passed through nuclear pores when observed under electron microscope nucleolus can be seen to consist of three distinguishable regions innermost fibrillar centers fcs surrounded by dense fibrillar component dfc that contains and which in turn is bordered by granular component gc that contains protein nucleophosmin transcription of rdna occurs either in fc or at fc dfc boundary and therefore when rdna transcription in cell is increased more fcs are detected most of cleavage and modification of occurs in dfc while latter steps involving protein assembly onto ribosomal subunits occur in gc other nuclear bodies subnuclear structure diameter cajal bodies 0 2 2 0 um clastosomes 0 2 0 5 um pika 5 um pml bodies 0 2 1 0 um paraspeckles 0 5 1 0 um speckles 20 25 nm besides nucleolus nucleus contains a number of other nuclear bodies these include cajal bodies gemini of cajal bodies polymorphic interphase karyosomal association pika promyelocytic leukaemia pml bodies paraspeckles and splicing speckles although little is known about a number of these domains they are significant in that they show that nucleoplasm is not a uniform mixture but rather contains organized functional other subnuclear structures appear as part of abnormal disease processes for example presence of small intranuclear rods has been reported in some cases of myopathy this condition typically results from mutations in actin and rods themselves consist of mutant actin as well as other proteins cajal bodies and gems a nucleus typically contains between 1 and 10 compact structures called cajal bodies or coiled bodies cb whose diameter measures between 0 2 um and 2 0 um depending on cell type and species when seen under an electron microscope they resemble balls of tangled thread and are dense foci of distribution for protein coilin cbs are involved in a number of different roles relating to rna processing specifically small nucleolar rna snorna and small nuclear rna snrna maturation and histone mrna modification similar to cajal bodies are gemini of cajal bodies or gems whose name is derived from gemini constellation in reference to their close twin relationship with cbs gems are similar in size and shape to cbs and in fact are virtually indistinguishable under microscope unlike cbs gems do not contain small nuclear snrnps but do contain a protein called survival of motor neuron smn whose function relates to snrnp biogenesis gems are believed to assist cbs in snrnp biogenesis though it has also been suggested from microscopy evidence that cbs and gems are different manifestations of same structure later studies have shown gems to be twins of cajal bodies with difference being in coilin component cajal bodies are smn positive and coilin positive and gems are smn positive and coilin negative pika and ptf domains pika domains or polymorphic interphase karyosomal associations were first described in microscopy studies in 1991 their function remains unclear though they were not thought to be associated with active dna replication transcription or rna processing they have been found to often associate with discrete domains defined by dense localization of transcription factor ptf which promotes transcription of small nuclear rna snrna pml bodies promyelocytic leukemia bodies pml bodies are spherical bodies found scattered throughout nucleoplasm measuring around 0 1 1 0 um they are known by a number of other names including nuclear domain 10 kremer bodies and pml oncogenic domains pml bodies are named after one of their major components promyelocytic leukemia protein pml they are often seen in nucleus in association with cajal bodies and cleavage bodies pml mice which are unable to create pml bodies develop normally without obvious ill effects showing that pml bodies are not required for most essential biological processes splicing speckles speckles are subnuclear structures that are enriched in pre messenger rna splicing factors and are located in interchromatin regions of nucleoplasm of mammalian cells at fluorescence microscope level they appear as irregular punctate structures which vary in size and shape and when examined by electron microscopy they are seen as clusters of interchromatin granules speckles are dynamic structures and both their protein and rna protein components can cycle continuously between speckles and other nuclear locations including active transcription sites studies on composition structure and behaviour of speckles have provided a model for understanding functional compartmentalization of nucleus and organization of gene expression machinery splicing snrnps and other splicing proteins necessary for pre mrna processing because of a cell s changing requirements composition and location of these bodies changes according to mrna transcription and regulation via phosphorylation of specific proteins splicing speckles are also known as nuclear speckles nuclear specks splicing factor compartments sf compartments interchromatin granule clusters igcs and b snurposomes b snurposomes are found in amphibian oocyte nuclei and in drosophila melanogaster embryos b snurposomes appear alone or attached to cajal bodies in electron micrographs of amphibian nuclei igcs function as storage sites for splicing factors paraspeckles discovered by fox et al in 2002 paraspeckles are irregularly shaped compartments in interchromatin space of nucleus first documented in hela cells where there are generally 10 30 per nucleus paraspeckles are now known to also exist in all human primary cells transformed cell lines and tissue sections their name is derived from their distribution in nucleus para is short for parallel and speckles refers to splicing speckles to which they are always in close proximity paraspeckles are dynamic structures that are altered in response to changes in cellular metabolic activity they are transcription dependent and in absence of rna pol ii transcription disappears and all of its associated protein components cfi m 68 and psf form a crescent shaped perinucleolar cap in nucleolus this phenomenon is demonstrated during cell cycle in cell cycle paraspeckles are present during interphase and during all of mitosis except for telophase during telophase when two daughter nuclei are formed there is no rna pol ii transcription so protein components instead form a perinucleolar cap perichromatin fibrils perichromatin fibrils are visible only under electron microscope they are located next to transcriptionally active chromatin and are hypothesized to be sites of active pre mrna processing clastosomes clastosomes are small nuclear bodies 0 2 0 5 um described as having a thick ring shape due to peripheral capsule around these bodies this name is derived from greek broken and soma body clastosomes are not typically present in normal cells making them hard to detect they form under high proteolytic conditions within nucleus and degrade once there is a decrease in activity or if cells are treated with proteasome inhibitors scarcity of clastosomes in cells indicates that they are not required for proteasome function osmotic stress has also been shown to cause formation of clastosomes these nuclear bodies contain catalytic and regulatory sub units of proteasome and its substrates indicating that clastosomes are sites for degrading proteins fougaro system fougaro system greek fougaro chimney is a sub organelle system in nucleus that may be a mechanism to recycle or remove molecules from cell

transcription that is segregated from location of translation in cytoplasm allowing levels of gene regulation that are not available to prokaryotes main function of cell nucleus is to control gene expression and mediate replication of dna during cell cycle nucleus is an organelle found in eukaryotic cells inside its fully enclosed nuclear membrane it contains majority of cell s genetic material this material is organized as dna molecules along with a variety of proteins to form chromosomes cell compartmentalization nuclear envelope allows nucleus to control its contents and separate them from rest of cytoplasm where necessary this is important for controlling processes on either side of nuclear membrane in most cases where a cytoplasmic process needs to be restricted a key participant is removed to nucleus where it interacts with transcription factors to production of certain enzymes in pathway this regulatory mechanism occurs in case of glycolysis a cellular pathway for breaking down glucose to produce energy hexokinase is an enzyme responsible for first step of glycolysis forming glucose 6 phosphate from glucose at high concentrations of fructose 6 phosphate a molecule made later from glucose 6 phosphate a regulator protein removes hexokinase to nucleus where it forms a transcriptional repressor complex with nuclear proteins to reduce expression of genes involved in glycolysis in order to control which genes are being transcribed cell separates some transcription factor proteins responsible for regulating gene expression from physical access to dna until they are activated by other signaling pathways this prevents even low levels of inappropriate gene expression for example in case of nf kb controlled genes which are involved in most inflammatory responses transcription is induced in response to a signal pathway such as that initiated by signaling molecule tnf a binds to a cell membrane receptor resulting in recruitment of signalling proteins and eventually activating transcription factor nf kb a nuclear localisation signal on nf kb protein allows it to be transported through nuclear pore and into nucleus where it stimulates transcription of target genes compartmentalization allows cell to prevent translation of mrna eukaryotic mrna contains introns that must be removed before being translated to produce functional proteins splicing is done inside nucleus before mrna can be accessed by ribosomes for translation without nucleus ribosomes would translate newly transcribed unprocessed mrna resulting in malformed and nonfunctional proteins gene expression thumb 200px left a micrograph of ongoing gene transcription of ribosomal rna illustrating growing primary transcripts begin indicates 5 end of dna where new rna synthesis begins end indicates 3 end where primary transcripts are almost complete gene expression first involves transcription in which dna is used as a template to produce rna in case of genes encoding proteins that rna produced from this process is messenger rna mrna which then needs to be translated by ribosomes to form a protein as ribosomes are located outside nucleus mrna produced needs to be exported since nucleus is site of transcription it also contains a variety of proteins that either directly mediate transcription or are involved in regulating process these proteins include which unwind double stranded dna molecule to facilitate access to it rna polymerases which bind to dna promoter to synthesize growing rna molecule topoisomerases which change amount of supercoiling in dna helping it wind and unwind as well as a large variety of transcription factors that regulate expression processing of pre mrna newly synthesized mrna molecules are known as primary transcripts or pre mrna they must undergo post transcriptional modification in nucleus before being exported to cytoplasm mrna that appears in cytoplasm without these modifications is degraded rather than used for protein translation three main modifications are 5 capping 3 polyadenylation and rna splicing while in nucleus pre mrna is associated with a variety of proteins in complexes known as heterogeneous particles addition of 5 cap occurs co transcriptionally and is first step in post transcriptional modification 3 poly adenine tail is only added after transcription is complete rna splicing carried out by a complex called is process by which introns or regions of dna that do not code for protein are removed from pre mrna and remaining exons connected to re form a single continuous molecule this process normally occurs after 5 capping and 3 polyadenylation but can begin before synthesis is complete in transcripts with many exons many pre mrnas including those encoding antibodies can be spliced in multiple ways to produce different mature mrnas that encode different protein sequences this process is known as alternative splicing and allows production of a large variety of proteins from a limited amount of dna dynamics and regulation nuclear transport 360px right thumb macromolecules such as rna and proteins are actively transported across nuclear membrane in a process called ran gtp nuclear transport cycle entry and exit of large molecules from nucleus is tightly controlled by nuclear pore complexes although small molecules can enter nucleus without regulation macromolecules such as rna and proteins require association karyopherins called importins to enter nucleus and exportins to exit cargo proteins that must be translocated from cytoplasm to nucleus contain short amino acid sequences known as nuclear localization signals which are bound by importins while those transported from nucleus to cytoplasm carry nuclear export signals bound by exportins ability of importins and exportins to transport their cargo is regulated by enzymes that hydrolyze molecule guanosine triphosphate gtp to release energy key in nuclear transport is ran which can bind either gtp or gdp guanosine diphosphate depending on whether it is located in nucleus or cytoplasm whereas importins depend on rangtp to dissociate from their cargo exportins require rangtp in order to bind to their cargo nuclear import depends on importin binding its cargo in cytoplasm and carrying it through nuclear pore into nucleus inside nucleus rangtp acts to separate cargo from importin allowing importin to exit nucleus and be reused nuclear export is similar as binds cargo inside nucleus in a process facilitated by rangtp exits through nuclear pore and separates from its cargo in cytoplasm specialized export proteins exist for translocation of mature mrna and trna to cytoplasm after post transcriptional modification is complete this quality control mechanism is important due to these molecules central role in protein translation mis expression of a protein due to incomplete excision of exons or mis incorporation of amino acids could have negative consequences for cell thus incompletely modified rna that reaches cytoplasm is degraded rather than used in translation assembly and disassembly thumb left 230px an image of a newt lung cell stained with fluorescent dyes during metaphase mitotic spindle can be seen stained green attached to two sets of chromosomes stained light blue all chromosomes but one are already at metaphase plate during its lifetime a nucleus may be broken down or destroyed either in process of cell division or as a consequence of apoptosis process of programmed cell death during these events structural components of nucleus envelope and lamina can be systematically degraded in most cells disassembly of nuclear envelope marks end of prophase of mitosis however this disassembly of nucleus is not a universal feature of mitosis and does not occur in all cells some unicellular eukaryotes e g yeasts undergo so called closed mitosis in which nuclear envelope remains intact in closed mitosis daughter chromosomes migrate to opposite poles of nucleus which then divides in two cells of higher eukaryotes however usually undergo open mitosis which is characterized by breakdown of nuclear envelope daughter chromosomes then migrate to opposite poles of mitotic spindle and new nuclei reassemble around them at a certain point during cell cycle in open mitosis cell divides to form two cells in order for this process to be possible each of new daughter cells must have a full set of genes a process requiring replication of chromosomes as well as segregation of separate sets this occurs by replicated chromosomes sister chromatids attaching to microtubules which in turn are attached to different centrosomes sister chromatids can then be pulled to separate locations in cell in many cells is located in cytoplasm outside nucleus microtubules would be unable to attach to chromatids in presence of nuclear envelope therefore early stages in cell cycle beginning in prophase and until around nuclear membrane is dismantled likewise during same period nuclear lamina is also disassembled a process regulated by phosphorylation of lamins by protein kinases such as protein kinase towards end of cell cycle nuclear membrane is reformed and around same time nuclear lamina are reassembled by lamins however in dinoflagellates nuclear envelope remains intact centrosomes are located in cytoplasm and microtubules come in contact with chromosomes whose regions are incorporated into nuclear envelope so called closed mitosis with spindle in many other protists e g ciliates and fungi centrosomes are intranuclear and their nuclear envelope also does not disassemble during cell division apoptosis is a controlled process in which cell s structural components are destroyed resulting in death of cell changes associated with apoptosis directly affect nucleus and its contents for example in condensation of chromatin and disintegration of nuclear envelope and lamina destruction of lamin networks is controlled by specialized apoptotic proteases called caspases which cleave lamin proteins and thus degrade nucleus structural integrity lamin cleavage is sometimes used as a laboratory indicator of caspase activity in assays for early apoptotic activity cells that express mutant caspase resistant lamins are deficient in nuclear changes related to apoptosis suggesting that lamins play a role in initiating events that lead to apoptotic degradation of nucleus inhibition of lamin assembly itself is an inducer of apoptosis nuclear envelope acts as a barrier that prevents both dna and rna viruses from entering nucleus some viruses require access to proteins inside nucleus in order to replicate and or assemble dna viruses such as herpesvirus replicate and assemble in cell nucleus and exit by budding through inner nuclear membrane this process is accompanied by disassembly of lamina on nuclear face of inner membrane disease related dynamics initially it has been suspected that immunoglobulins in general and autoantibodies in particular do not enter nucleus now there is a body of evidence that under pathological conditions e g lupus erythematosus igg can enter nucleus bohm i igg deposits can be detected in cell nuclei of patients with both lupus erythematosus and malignancy clin 2007 26 11 1877 1882 nuclei per cell most eukaryotic cell types usually have a single nucleus but some have no nuclei while others have several this can result from normal development as in maturation of mammalian red blood cells or from faulty cell division anucleated cells thumb 230px right human red blood cells like those of other mammals lack nuclei this occurs as a normal part of cells development an anucleated cell contains no nucleus and is therefore incapable of dividing to produce daughter cells best known anucleated cell is mammalian red blood cell or erythrocyte which also lacks other organelles such as mitochondria and serves primarily as a transport vessel to ferry oxygen from lungs to body s tissues erythrocytes mature through erythropoiesis in bone marrow where they lose their nuclei organelles and ribosomes nucleus is expelled during process of differentiation from an to a which is immediate precursor of mature erythrocyte presence of may induce release of some immature erythrocytes into bloodstream anucleated cells can also arise from flawed cell division in which one daughter lacks a nucleus and other has two nuclei in flowering plants this condition occurs in sieve tube elements multinucleated cells multinucleated cells contain multiple nuclei most species of protozoa and some fungi in mycorrhizae have naturally multinucleated cells other examples include intestinal parasites in genus giardia which have two nuclei per cell in humans skeletal muscle cells called myocytes and become multinucleated during development resulting arrangement of nuclei near periphery of cells allows maximal intracellular space for myofibrils other cells in human are osteoclasts a type of bone cell multinucleated and cells can also be abnormal in humans for example cells arising from fusion of monocytes and macrophages known as giant multinucleated cells sometimes accompany inflammation and are also implicated in tumor formation a number of dinoflagellates are known to have two nuclei unlike other multinucleated cells these nuclei contain two distinct lineages of dna one from dinoflagellate and other from a symbiotic diatom mitochondria and plastids of diatom somehow remain functional evolution as major defining characteristic of eukaryotic cell nucleus evolutionary origin has been subject of much speculation four major hypotheses have been proposed to explain existence of nucleus although none have yet earned widespread support first model known as model proposes that a symbiotic relationship between archaea and bacteria created nucleus containing eukaryotic cell organisms of archaea and bacteria domain have no cell nucleus c michael hogan 2010 archaea eds e c cleveland encyclopedia of earth national council for science and environment washington dc it is hypothesized that symbiosis originated when ancient archaea similar to modern methanogenic archaea invaded and lived within bacteria similar to modern myxobacteria eventually forming early nucleus this theory is analogous to accepted theory for origin of eukaryotic mitochondria and chloroplasts which are thought to have developed from a similar endosymbiotic relationship between proto eukaryotes and aerobic bacteria archaeal origin of nucleus is supported by observations that archaea and eukarya have similar genes for certain proteins including histones observations that myxobacteria are motile can form multicellular complexes and possess kinases and g proteins similar to eukarya support a bacterial origin for eukaryotic cell a second model proposes that proto eukaryotic cells evolved from bacteria without an endosymbiotic stage this model is based on existence of modern bacteria that possess a nuclear structure with primitive pores and other compartmentalized membrane structures a similar proposal states that a eukaryote like cell evolved first and phagocytosed archaea and bacteria to generate nucleus and eukaryotic cell most controversial model known as viral eukaryogenesis posits that membrane bound nucleus along with other eukaryotic features originated from infection of a by a virus suggestion is based on similarities between eukaryotes and viruses such as linear dna strands mrna capping and tight binding to proteins analogizing histones to viral envelopes one version of proposal suggests that nucleus evolved in concert with phagocytosis to form an early cellular predator another variant proposes that eukaryotes originated from early archaea infected by poxviruses on basis of observed similarity between dna polymerases in modern poxviruses and eukaryotes it has been suggested that unresolved question of evolution of sex could be related to viral eukaryogenesis hypothesis a more recent proposal hypothesis suggests that nucleus instead originated from a single ancestral cell that evolved a second exterior cell membrane
