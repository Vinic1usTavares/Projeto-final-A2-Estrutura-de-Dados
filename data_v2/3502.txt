flying away production thumb 180px in pilot episode dominic monaghan did not know what tune of you all everybody would be so he had to make up a temporary one alt dominic monaghan in 2009 moth aired on november 3 2004 episode was directed by jack bender and written by jennifer johnson and paul dini church scene with charlie and liam at church in manchester was actually filmed on honolulu where scenes on island are filmed monaghan says that he feels charlie s black hoodie is a sort of security blanket that he hides underneath and uses it when he feels lost heroin that charlie is supposedly snorting is actually brown sugar monaghan revealed this in an interview with stuff magazine in october 2005 saying heroin is brown sugar you get some really sweet boogers you have to be careful not to snort too much of it but it s happened a few times you just find dessert up your nose couple of hours later according to monaghan drive shaft is similar to oasis in that charlie s first album was kind of like oasis s first album critically acclaimed didn t sell big numbers but in industry people gave it respect j j abrams and damon told monaghan that if he wanted to write song that would be charlie s one hit wonder they would consider using it in show monaghan wrote a song called photos and plans with a friend abrams and lindelof liked song but it did not make it into lost lyrics were inspired by an incident on phil donahue show where matt reeves who was close friends with producers bryan burk and damon lindelof saw a female audience member yell out you all everybody acting like it s stupid people wearing expensive clothes producers had an inside joke where they would say this quotation to each other according to burk at one point in a delirious stupor we realized we had said it so many times that that had to be song in pilot monaghan s voice when he sang you all everybody was based on when prince puts on his female voice since song had not been composed yet for moth producers contacted los angeles based singer jude to write a full version song is sung by chris seefried former lead singer of gods child and joe 90 reception moth first aired in united states on november 3 2004 18 73 million people in america watched episode live episode received generally mixed to positive reviews ryan mcgee of zap2it wrote that this episode wasn t a stinker by any measure but after run of early episodes this is first that really didn t hold its own when compared to others adding that moth imagery metaphor just beats you down by episode s end making you long for more subtle writing show has produced up until this point tv critic gave episode a 68 100 writing that it falls between being obvious and cheesy and beautifully paced and structured myles mcnutt of a v club gave episode a b and shared his opinion that it is one of more intensely metaphorical and thus writerly episodes of series eponymous metaphor delivered by locke is one of series most blatant and moth s consistent reappearance in episode calls a lot of attention to construction of narrative ign staff rated moth as 36th best episode in all of lost explaining moth of episode s title appears both as a metaphorical and physical symbol of struggle to find strength within yourself as locke explains to charlie and to take charge of your own life without relying on anyone else to do it for you in a review focusing solely on moth chris carabott of ign gave episode a 9 10 writing that episode does a great job of utilizing screen time for most major characters on show and that locke s analogy of moth in comparison to charlie s situation perfectly encapsulates what many of characters are going through on island in a ranking of all of lost s episodes emily vanderwerff of los angeles times placed moth at number 102 complimenting monaghan and o quinn s acting but criticizing storyline for containing nonsensical drug abuse storytelling moth along with pilot and house of rising sun won a
