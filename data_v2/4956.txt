three witches also known as weird sisters or wayward sisters are characters in william shakespeare s play macbeth c 1603 1607 they hold a striking resemblance to three fates of classical mythology and are perhaps intended as a twisted version of white robed incarnations of destiny witches eventually lead macbeth to his demise their origin lies in holinshed s chronicles 1587 a history of england scotland and ireland other possible sources aside from shakespeare s imagination include british folklore such contemporary treatises on witchcraft as king james vi of scotland s daemonologie norns of norse mythology and ancient classical myths of fates greek moirai and roman productions of macbeth began incorporating portions of thomas middleton s contemporaneous play witch circa 1618 two years after shakespeare s death shakespeare s witches are prophets who hail macbeth general early in play and predict his ascent to kingship upon killing king and gaining throne of scotland macbeth hears them ambiguously predict his eventual downfall witches and their filthy trappings and supernatural activities set an ominous tone for play artists in eighteenth century including henry fuseli and william rimmer depicted witches variously as have many directors since some have exaggerated or sensationalised hags or have adapted them to different cultures as in orson welles s rendition of weird sisters as voodoo priestesses some film adaptations have cast witches as such modern analogues as hippies on drugs or goth schoolgirls their influence reaches literary realm as well in such works as discworld and harry potter series origins thumb macbeth s hillock near brodie castle is traditionally identified as blasted heath where macbeth and banquo first met weird sisters name weird sisters is found in most modern editions of macbeth however first folio s text reads weyward sisters hand in hand posters of sea and land in later scenes in first folio witches are called weyward but never weird modern appellation weird sisters derives from holinshed s original chronicles urmson j o tate s wayward sisters music letters 62 2 1981 245 however modern english spelling was only starting to become fixed by shakespeare s time and also word weird from old english wyrd fate had connotations beyond common modern meaning wiktionary etymology for weird includes this observation word was extinct by 16th century in english it survived in scots whence shakespeare borrowed it in naming weird sisters reintroducing it to english senses abnormal strange etc arose via reinterpretation of weird sisters and date from after this reintroduction one of shakespeare s principal sources for three witches is found in account of king duncan in raphael holinshed s history of britain chronicles of england scotland and ireland 1587 in holinshed future king macbeth of scotland and his companion banquo encounter three women in strange and wild resembling creatures of elder world who hail men with glowing prophecies and then vanish immediately out of their sight holinshed observes that common opinion was that these women were either weird sisters that is goddesses of destiny or else some nymphs or fairies with knowledge of prophecy by their science nicoll allardyce muir kenneth shakespeare survey cambridge university press 2002 4 another principal source was daemonologie of king james published in 1597 which included a news pamphlet titled newes from scotland that detailed infamous north berwick witch trials of 1590 not only had this trial taken place in scotland witches involved confessed to attempt use of witchcraft to raise a tempest and sabotage very boat king james and queen of scots were on board during their return trip from denmark three witches discuss raising of winds at sea in opening lines of act 1 scene 3 news pamphlet states moreover she confessed that at time when his majesty was in denmark she being accompanied with parties before specially named took a cat and christened it and afterward bound to each part of that cat parts of a dead man and several joints of his body and that in night following said cat was conveyed into midst of sea by all these witches sailing in their riddles or cues as aforesaid and so left said cat right before town of leith in scotland this done there did arise such a tempest in sea as a greater has not been seen which tempest was cause of perishing of a boat or vessel coming over from town of brunt island to town of leith of which was many jewels and rich gifts which should have been presented to current queen of scotland at her majesty s coming to leith again it is confessed that said christened cat was cause that king majesty s ship at his coming forth of denmark had a contrary wind to rest of his ships then being in his company which thing was most strange and true as king s majesty acknowledges daemonologie newes from scotland thumb left three witches macbeth by james henry nixon british museum 1831 concept of

clontarf fought outside dublin in 1014 simek 2007 57 shakespeare s creation of three witches may have also been influenced by an anti witchcraft law passed by king james nine years previously a law that was to stay untouched for over 130 years his characters fingers skinny lips and beards for example are not found in holinshed macbeth s hillock near brodie between forres and nairn in scotland

vanish analysis three witches represent evil darkness chaos and conflict while their role is as agents and witnesses their presence communicates treason and impending doom during shakespeare s day witches were seen as worse than rebels most notorious traitor and rebel that can be they were not only political traitors but spiritual traitors as well much of confusion that springs from them comes from their ability to straddle play s borders between reality and supernatural they are so deeply entrenched in both worlds that it is unclear whether they control fate or whether they are merely its agents they defy logic not being subject to rules of real world karin s unreal mockery unreason and problem of spectacle in macbeth elh oct 1989 56 3 pp 485 501 witches lines in first act fair is foul and foul is fair hover through fog and filthy air are often said to set tone for remainder of play by establishing a sense of moral confusion indeed play is filled with situations in which evil is depicted as good while good is rendered evil line double double toil and trouble often sensationalised to a point that it loses meaning communicates witches intent clearly they seek only to increase trouble for mortals around them though witches do not deliberately tell macbeth to kill king duncan they use a subtle form of temptation when they inform macbeth that he is destined to be king by placing this thought in his mind they effectively guide him on path to his own destruction this follows pattern of temptation attributed to devil in contemporary imagination devil was believed to be a

s chronicles one of sources shakespeare used when creating characters portray them as members of upper class they are wearing elaborate dresses and hairstyles and appear to be noblewomen as macbeth and banquo approach shakespeare seems to have diverted quite a bit from this image making witches as banquo says withered and so wild in their attire that look not like th inhabitants o th earth each at once her choppy fingers laying upon her skinny lips you should be women and yet your beards forbid me to interpret that you are so macbeth act 1 scene 3 lines 39 47 three witches of macbeth have inspired several painters over years who have sought to capture supernatural darkness surrounding macbeth s encounters with them for example by eighteenth century belief in witches had waned in united kingdom such things were thought to be simple stories of foreigners farmers and superstitious catholics however art depicting supernatural subjects was very popular john runciman as one of first artists to use shakespearean characters in his work created an ink on paper drawing entitled three witches in 1767 68 in it three ancient figures are shown in close consultation their heads together and their bodies runciman s brother created another drawing of witches called witches show macbeth apparitions painted circa 1771 1772 portraying macbeth s reaction to power of witches conjured vision

three witches in it witches are lined up and dramatically pointing at something all at once their faces in profile this painting was parodied by james gillray in 1791 in weird sisters ministers of darkness minions of moon three figures are lined up with their faces in profile in a way similar to fuseli s painting however three figures are recognisable as lord dundas home secretary at time william pitt prime minister and lord thurlow lord chancellor three of them are facing a moon which contains profiled faces of george iii and queen charlotte drawing is intended to highlight insanity of king george and unusual alliance of three politicians fuseli created two other works depicting three witches for a dublin art gallery in 1794 first entitled macbeth banquo and three witches was a frustration for him his earlier paintings of shakespearean scenes had been done on horizontal canvases giving viewer a picture of scene that was similar to what would have been seen on stage woodmason requested vertical paintings shrinking space fuseli had to work with in this particular painting he uses lightning and other dramatic effects to separated macbeth and banquo from witches more clearly and communicate how unnatural their meeting is macbeth and banquo are both visibly terrified while witches are confidently perched atop a mound silhouettes of victorious army of macbeth can be seen celebrating in background but lack of space necessitates removal of barren open landscape seen in fuseli s earlier paintings for boydell shakespeare gallery of same scene hamlyn 515 529 alt macbeth

macbeth and armed head by fuseli fuseli s other macbeth woodmason painting macbeth and armed head depicts a later scene in which macbeth is shown macduff and warned to be wary of him fuseli evidently intended two paintings to be juxtaposed he said when macbeth meets with witches on heath it is terrible because he did not expect supernatural visitation but when he goes to cave to ascertain his fate it is no longer a subject of terror fuseli chose to make macduff a near likeness of macbeth himself and considered painting one of his most poetic in that sense asking what would be a greater object of terror to you if some night on going home you were to find yourself sitting at your own table would not this make a powerful impression on your mind in music at least fifteen operas have been based on macbeth but only one is regularly performed today this is macbeth composed by giuseppe verdi to a libretto by francesco maria piave and premiered in florence in 1847 in opera three witches became a chorus of at least eighteen singers divided into three groups each group enters separately at start of opera for scene with macbeth and banquo after men s departure they have a chorus of triumph which does not derive from shakespeare they reappear in act 3 when they conjure up three apparitions and procession of kings when verdi revised opera for performance in paris in 1865 he added a ballet rarely performed nowadays to this scene in it hecate a non dancing character mimes instructions to witches before a final dance and macbeth s arrival in henry purcell s opera dido and aeneas with
