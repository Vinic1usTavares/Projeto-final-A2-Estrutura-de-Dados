with his music production center mpc for schematic records a label known primarily for intelligent dance music idm after working with various local hip hop artists making what he described as very boring rap beats herren was inspired to take his music in a more left field direction vocal studies uprock music is primarily instrumental and features unintelligible cut up vocals originally inspired to sample hip hop artists he was signed to work with in studio album consists of samples by more popular hip hop artists including nas ol dirty bastard and erykah badu despite being described as electronic music idm and glitch and not kind of music a hip hop audience is used to hearing herren felt that his music was closer to hip hop album s release after a tour that included a performance at all tomorrow s parties in united kingdom as well as opening for group tortoise in united states album did not chart in either united kingdom or united states but received positive reviews from various sources including allmusic spin and uncut it was later named as one of best albums of year by rolling stone and globe and mail and one of best albums of first half 2000s by pitchfork background and production in mid to late 1990s guillermo scott herren returned to decatur georgia from new york and worked at a recording studio unsatisfied working with studio s clients who he felt made pre historic trap music herren was encouraged to take his music in a more left field direction as he was bored with people barking orders at me to make them these really boring rap beats in return for herren handling studio s hip hop clients studio owner bought him a music production center mpc which herren would use to create his prefuse 73 material thumbnail hip hop artist mf doom pictured is featured on album while working at studio herren met joshua kay and romulo del castillo two miami based producers who had founded schematic records a label known for idm herren recorded and composed music on his mpc and manipulated it to fit schematic s aesthetic while working at recording studio herren felt that hip hop musicians coming in had very trite lyrics and felt he could use them for his own prefuse 73 material for vocal studies uprock narratives herren sampled more famous hip hop records by artists including nas ol dirty bastard and erykah badu herren stated that he used some of his favorite mcs instead of musicians he worked with as he felt these artists were saying totally relevant stuff but i guess it was just my excitement to make it happen but a vocal doesn t have to say anything why not challenge people s imagination and let it say whatever they want it to for vocal studies uprock narratives herren created music using two turntables plugged into his mpc to create glitch sounds through mpc herren switched between different sample sources by instantaneously silencing groups of audio channels at same time in 1999 herren signed to british label warp under two aliases prefuse 73 and savalas after warp staff had heard a previous record of herren s which had sparked their interest in his work herren was familiar with label through artists aphex twin and boards of canada but chose to sign to warp as he was a fan of group broadcast who had released an ep through label vocal studies uprock narratives features rapping from mikah 9 aesop rock and mf doom and vocals from sam prekop of indie rock band sea and cake vocalists did not work directly with herren but sent him audio tapes of their own vocal recordings herren later commented on having prekop sing on album noting that having an indie rock artist on album was his way of trying to get his sound out to a new audience music herren described album as an attempt to bridge hip hop instrumentals with vocal orientated hip hop tracks saying that chopped and edited raps were another layer of music and that he was into creating a whole new mangled language it s a form of communication without communicating a new flow when you feel like you re listening to a standard hip hop track but there s something in it that s not right cut up vocals were also described by herren as a tribute to miami bass music and group mantronix herren said old school dirty south and booty shake shit just way stuff was edited back then all bass music and edit records that s what inspired me i wanted to make edit records but bring all shit that happened afterwards into it hip hop from early 90s through present day song nuno features chopped up vocals with only phrase fuck words of wisdom intelligible title is a reference to portuguese musician nuno canavarro whose 1988 album also features manipulated vocals including randomly reassembled tapes of children singing herren used a sample from canavarro s song for nuno sydney morning herald stated that journalists obsessed with labels had described music in a range of genres from glitch to click hop music journalists made other comparisons of music in context of both electronic and hip hop with exclaim describing this sound as not exactly what hip hop world is used to hearing fact expanded on description of two genres stating that sonic cut ups that characterize vocal studies have often been linked to idm scene but they can just as well be understood within context of scratching and where snatching small elements of records and re contextualizing them was key herren has only described his style as hip hop saying that he does not listen to electronic music and that some people have a hard time accepting what i do during promotion of his next album one word extinguisher herren stated that vocal studies uprock narratives did not have a particular theme as he was primarily focusing on and developing an editing style in contrast his follow up one word extinguisher was about his relationship with a woman and vast spectrum of emotions felt during a break up release and promotion prior to release of vocal studies uprock narratives herren performed at all tomorrow s parties festival at camber sands in april 2001 festival was curated by band tortoise with whom herren toured as opening act in may 2001 vocal studies uprock narratives was released on june 11 2001 through warp on vinyl compact disc and download it was warp s second release by an american musician following richard devine s which had been released in previous january album did not chart in united states or united kingdom herren was not happy on how album was promoted saying i couldn t understand why they were treating me like i was 10 they were ignoring all cultural references that were to be found throughout that first record he felt album would have been easier to package if i d been from bronx instead i was from miami and lived in decatur critical reception john bush of allmusic described album as one of most enjoyable works of experimental techno heard in several years a combination of tough underground hip hop and fractured neo electro of warp favorites autechre and plaid noel dix of exclaim described album as a truly remarkable and creative record praising its unpredictability tedd kessler of nme called album teeth clattering but exhilarating writing that behind every wall of hip hop noise there lurks a heart bursting tune and that s what makes it alluring pitchfork wrote that herren had painted a portrait of peculiar state of our urbanity reviewing album alongside two other warp releases plaid s double figure and squarepusher s go plastic uncut described vocal studies as pick of this crop and concluded that it genuinely seems like a next step for a genre in perpetual need of reinvention bbc gave album a mixed review stating that taken as a whole album is pretty relentless and album was best taken in small doses popmatters gave album a negative review writing that new sounds herren creates are innovative and entertaining he simply overdoes it legacy and influence vocal studies uprock narratives

received exclaiming that most of it was so positive but i d also get a really strong reaction from people some that want to kill me cause they re under impression that i m trying to kill hip hop or something and i m like uh see ya whatever man according to pitchfork album was important for warp which had been seeking credibility after relocating their offices to new york city herren began acting as a r member for label which had a reputation only for idm by introducing it to artists including anti pop consortium battles and flying lotus in 2011 after releasing only she chapters his eighth
