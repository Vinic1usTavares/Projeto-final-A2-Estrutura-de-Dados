edwards was allowed to keep victory he moved from first to seventh in drivers championship on march 12 roush fenway racing announced it would not appeal penalties roush fenway racing president geoff

team had no intention of cheating edwards teammate biffle and newman agreed penalties were justified according to sadler penalties were not severe enough he argued that driver should be penalized or required to miss one event toyota racing development general manager lee white said roush fenway racing had modified edwards car to enhance downforce by which increased car s horsepower leaving corners roush felt white s comments were motivated by results white later issued a statement in which he apologized for his comments an internal investigation found no evidence another person had
