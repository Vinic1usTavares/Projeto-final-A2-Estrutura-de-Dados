southeasterly at at 18 18 as sixteen guns aboard armoured cruisers scharnhorst and were only matched by two 9 2 inch guns on his flagship he needed to close range to bring his more numerous 6 inch guns to bear force 7 winds and high seas however prevented use of half of those guns as they were too close to water he also wanted to use setting sun to his advantage so that its light would blind german gunners spee was well aware of british advantages and refused to allow cradock to close range his ships were faster than british slowed by 16 knot maximum speed of armed merchant cruiser and he opened up range to until conditions changed to suit him sun set at 18 50 which silhouetted british ships against light sky while german ships became indistinguishable from shoreline behind them massie

flagship was hit on scharnhorsts third salvo when shells knocked out her forward 9 2 inch turret and set her forecastle on fire cradock knowing his only chance was to close range continued to do so despite battering that spee s ships inflicted by 19 23 range was almost half of that when battle began and british ships bore onwards spee tried to open range fearing a torpedo attack but british were only away at 19 35 seven minutes later good hope charged directly at german ships although they dodged out of her way spee ordered his armoured cruisers to concentrate their fire on british flagship and she soon drifted to a halt with her topsides all aflame at 19 50 her forward magazine exploded severing bow from rest of ship and she later sank in darkness spee estimated that his flagship had made 35 hits on good hope suffering only two hits in return that did no significant damage and failed even to wound one crewman massie pp 228 30 236 good hope was sunk with all hands a total of 926
