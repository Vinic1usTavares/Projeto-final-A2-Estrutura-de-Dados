new material for her album three of cole s songs were chosen for reviewing including follow your heart madonna s manager freddy demann overheard song and thought it would be a hit for madonna and he asked cole to present a female demo version cole asked his then girlfriend donna de lory to sing demo later on she became madonna s backup singer despite fact that it did not fit exactly with genre of

performing open your heart on who s that girl world tour wearing same attire from music video music video was shot at echo park in los angeles california madonna portrays an exotic dancer who befriends a young boy played by child actor felix howard this video was originally set to be directed by madonna s then husband sean penn but in end final honors went to jean baptiste mondino who went on to work with madonna on her videos for justify my love 1990 human nature 1995 love don t live here anymore 1996 don t tell me 2000 and hollywood 2003 video was shot in july 1986 and was released in december 1986 it was produced by david naylor video was nominated for three mtv video music awards in 1987 in best female video category open your heart lost to another madonna video when music video for papa don t preach won award video has been ranked at number 35 on vh1 s 50 sexiest video moments of all time video is structured as a cinematic peep show and voyeurism that portrays madonna as a stripper according to mondino peep show was his idea since at that time we were into a period where we were experimenting with some kind of freedom about body about sexuality and stuff he wanted to have a naive and sweet feel with portrayal of a boy waiting outside for madonna they built set from scratch including frontal part with ticket booth although it looked fake mondino liked it saying i like fakeness of it i haven t seen it for a long time but when i saw it once again i said it s so naive it s kind of badly done which i like compared to today we didn t have same equipment people are more skillful today but there s something sweet about it madonna was initially asked by him to wear a black wig and initial reaction to whole wardrobe was positive but madonna wanted mondino s opinion on whole ensemble who replied that she would look better as a blonde so wig was kept for initial scenes of video only synopsis and analysis open your heart music video presents an early version of madonna s musings about her italian american heritage and focus on her street theology which was also explicitly brought out by 1987 s who s that girl world tour it starts with little boy trying to go inside a peep show where madonna is star performer but gets rebuffed by an old man at ticket booth inside madonna starts singing song from center of a carousel that revolves to display her to gaze of customers who are sitting safely in their cubicles madonna is dressed in a black bustier spike heels fishnets revealing her new slimmed down body at that time she begins video wearing a black wig which she subsequently removes revealing her short bleached hair bluish and dark lighting reveals her look as a mix of actresses marlene dietrich in movie blue angel as well as liza minnelli as character sally bowles in bob fosse directed musical film cabaret thumb left madonna plays a stripper inspired by marlene dietrich and liza minnelli in music video for open your heart dancing is restrained with a single prop that of a solitary chair at one point in first segment of video she is filmed dancing but camera is almost still and motions of dance are confined within small range of camera as screens inside viewing booths open and close camera slices shots of madonna each with its own angle and duration same imagery is exhibited by little boy outside who tries to frame madonna s playbill image into different angles there are four other men in booths who are made of wood with paintings of artist tamara de lempicka on them madonna at one point takes off her gloves like rita hayworth in gilda and points towards one of wooden paintings it collapses and she blows on her finger video is similar in thematic content to motley crue s video for single girls girls girls but in contrast this video tells story from madonna s point of view she looks down into cubicles to make eye contact with men but they are unable to return it she also looks assertively into camera making eye contact with viewer with these scenes madonna portrays her holding power over men and ability to pursue them madonna represents an assertive woman searching for a lover who can accept her as a human being author bruce forbes notes that men in cubicles are proved unworthy of her and there is an undertone of mockery when madonna addresses them as baby while shaking her body by end of video isolated and sad men depart with doors closing on them as final chorus breaks into dance grooves madonna comes out of theater and gives boy a quick kiss on his lips both are clad in loose fitting gray suits which gives madonna an androgynous look they stroll away playfully in sunrise reminiscent of charlie chaplin and jack coogan in kid with old boss pursuing them and shouting come back come back we still need you in italian tension between visual and musical dimensions of video is extremely unsettling according to author nicholas b dirks only when she disappears from carousel and reappears to run away from her patriarchal boss with young boy then music and visuals become comparable reception feminist writer susan bordo gave a negative review of video saying that leering and pathetic men in cubicles and madonna s escape with boy is cynically and mechanically tacked on as a way of claiming trendy status for what is just cheesecake or perhaps pornography mtv also had some reservations initially before airing video which was later resolved after a meeting with warner officials however socio critic mary harron in her book pop as commodity said that underlying message in video is that though madonna sells sexuality she is free there is no overt representation of anything besides friendship with boy their escape together avoids madonna sexual overtones that would have been stronger if she would have escaped with an adult male this according to author richard dienst seems to suggest a repudiation of adult labor of stage in favor of childhood androgyny authenticity and nomadic play video is also acclaimed for reviving and re creating hard glamor of studio era of hollywood stars and also for representing women as dominant sex author donn welton pointed out that usual power relationship between voyeuristic male gaze and object is destabilized by portrayal of male patrons of peep show as leering and pathetic at same time portrayal of madonna as porno queen object is deconstructed by escape at end of video maura johnston from rolling stone found influences of work of italian film director federico fellini and american musical theater bob fosse johnston added open your heart was gorgeous from paintings of art deco artist tamara de lempicka on club exterior to colorfully cold cast of characters she noticed that at one point in video madonna tilted her head to re create herb ritts shot album cover for true blue live performances open your heart served as opening song on 1987 who s that girl tour it started off with then young dancer chris finch imitating felix howard from video howard did not receive a working license for tour hence finch was taken for his part he went on to become an integral part of most of songs performed on tour after finch two other dancers are introduced before madonna herself appears on stage she wore same black pointy corset and fishnets as in music video she first sings song alone then finch joins her again and they dance together till song ends two different performances of song on this tour can be found on videos who s that girl live in japan filmed in tokyo japan on june 22 1987 and ciao italia live from italy
