blitz class was a pair of avisos built for german kaiserliche marine imperial navy in early 1880s ships and were first steel hulled ships of any kind built by german navy were among first torpedo cruiser type warships in world and were progenitors of later light cruisers of gazelle type they were armed with a gun and one torpedo tube as their principal armament and were capable of a top speed in excess of they were very successful warships remaining in active service for more than three decades blitz and pfeil served extensively in various roles blitz spent much of her career as a flotilla leader for torpedo boats while pfeil served with training squadron and main fleet pfeil was deployed to german east africa in 1889 to suppress abushiri revolt returning to germany in 1890 throughout 1890s ships served with fleet conducting a yearly routine of exercises and training cruises they served in a variety of additional roles during 1890s and 1900s including as tenders fishery protection vessels and training ships they operated as dedicated tenders to battle squadrons of high seas fleet by mid 1900s filling that role through start of world war i blitz took part in operation albion in baltic sea in late 1917 and pfeil was later used as a training ship for u boat crews ships were discarded in early 1920s and broken up for scrap design designed in 1879 design specifications for blitz class avisos called for a top speed of from about though finalized design had a top speed of a knot less ships marked a significant advance in naval technology for german fleet they were first steel hulled vessels and they were first cruiser type vessels to abandon traditional sailing masts their armament a torpedo tube and a battery of light guns reflected growing importance of torpedo as a weapon since torpedo tube served as its primary offensive armament and guns were necessary to defend against increasingly powerful torpedo boats of period at time of their completion they were among earliest torpedo cruisers in world blitz class avisos were first step toward creating modern steel hulled light cruiser and their modern appearance presaged later developments development of aviso type would ultimately come to fruition in light cruisers built a decade later blitz design proved to be an effective one as evidenced by fact that blitz remained in active service for thirty five years general characteristics left thumb illustration of blitz class blitz class ships were long at waterline and long overall they had a beam of and a maximum draft of forward ships displaced as designed and up to at full combat load ships hulls were constructed with transverse and longitudinal steel frames and contained eleven watertight compartments a double bottom was located beneath ships engine rooms blitz and pfeil had a crew of 7 officers and 127 enlisted men though this number was later revised to 6 officers and 135 sailors when serving as torpedo boat flotilla leaders ships had an additional 3 officers and 16 enlisted men ships carried several smaller boats including one picket boat one yawl and one dinghy later in their careers a cutter another yawl and another dinghy were added machinery ships propulsion system consisted of two horizontal 2 cylinder double expansion engines in a single engine room engines drove a pair of 3 bladed screws steam for engines was provided by eight coal fired locomotive boilers after refits in early 1890s ships boilers were replaced with newer more efficient models blitz received eight transverse cylindrical boilers while pfeil had eight cylindrical boilers installed ships were supplied with electrical power with a single generator that operated at 67 volts as built ships were fitted with a schooner rig with a sail area of to supplement her steam engines but this was later reduced to a rig of auxiliary sails with an area of and sails were removed entirely by 1900 propulsion system was rated at for a top speed of neither ship reached this speed on trials blitz managed and pfeil made ships carried up to of coal which allowed them to steam for approximately at a cruising speed of steering was controlled with one rudder armament thumb blitz in port early in her career as built blitz class avisos were armed with one k l 23 gun placed in a pivot mount atop bow gun was supplied with 100 rounds of ammunition ships were also equipped with four 8 7 cm k l 23 guns in single mounts and one torpedo tube mounted in bow above waterline in 1891 and 1892 ships were rearmed with six 8 8 cm sk l 30 guns in single mounts these were carried one on bow one on stern and two amidships on either broadside they also received three 35 cm torpedo tubes one in bow and one on each broadside all submerged in hull ships did not carry

directed operations of navy s torpedo craft and blitz was involved in evaluations of torpedo boat capabilities in early 1880s these included tests to demonstrate ability of boats to operate away from sheltered coastal waters and weapons tests pfeil initially served with training squadron until late 1889 when she was deployed to german east africa to help suppress abushiri revolt she helped to enforce a blockade of colony and also took part in operations against rebel forces sending men ashore and bombarding enemy troops in 1890s both ships operated with fleet blitz with torpedo boats and pfeil as a scout for capital ships during this period they routinely took part in yearly training routine that consisted of flotilla and squadron exercises and culminated in annual fleet maneuvers held every august and september they also frequently escorted members of royal family including kaiser wilhelm ii who cruised aboard his yacht hohenzollern by mid 1890s both ships began to take on secondary duties including fishery protection patrols to prevent foreign fishing boats from violating german territorial waters acting as tenders and serving as training ships although they continued to serve as active units in fleet ships were involved in a number of accidents over course of their careers each sinking a merchant ship in accidental collisions both ships were assigned as dedicated tenders to i squadron and ii squadron in mid 1900s and in this capacity they accompanied fleet s battleships on long range cruises and continued to participate in annual maneuvers blitz and pfeil continued to serve as tenders during world war i though activities during war are unclear as one historian reports her initially being used for coastal defense patrols though another source states that she remained a tender through 1917 when she was sent to participate in operation albion against russian forces in baltic sea she was reportedly also slated to take part in operation schlussstein in august 1918 also directed against russia but plan was cancelled pfeil meanwhile was also used to train u boat crews blitz and pfeil were ultimately struck from naval register in 1921 and 1922 respectively before being broken up notes references category avisos of imperial german navy
