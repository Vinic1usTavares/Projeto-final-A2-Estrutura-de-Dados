nelicourvi weaver ploceus nelicourvi is a species of bird in family ploceidae it is endemic to madagascar together with its closest relative sakalava weaver it is sometimes placed in a separate genus nelicurvius a slender sparrow like bird it is long and weighing breeding males have a black bill and head brown eyes yellow collar grey belly chestnut brown lower tail coverts olive back and blackish flight feathers edged greenish non breeding males have mottled grey and green heads in breeding female front of head is yellow and back olive green with a broad yellow eyebrow it builds solitary roofed retort shaped nests hanging by a rope from a branch vine or bamboo stem in an open space it primarily feeds on insects looking on its own or in very small groups often together with long billed its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical moist lowland and mountain forests conservation status of nelicourvi weaver is least concern according to iucn red list taxonomy nelicourvi weaver was first described by italian naturalist and physician giovanni antonio scopoli in 1786 who called it parvus nelicourvi description was based on a specimen that pierre sonnerat a french naturalist and explorer had collected during his 1770 visit of madagascar on eastern coast possibly near fort dauphin in 1789 johann friedrich gmelin a naturalist from germany gave name loxia pensilis based on a description by english ornithologist john latham who himself had not provided a binomial name in 1827 george shaw an english zoologist and botanist included l pensilis in genus ploceus in 1850 charles lucien bonaparte assigned species to his newly erected genus nelicurvius no subspecies have been described original genus name parvus is latin and means little it is presumed that species epithet nelicourvi was derived from tamil word a name for a or finch on sri lanka in 1783 john latham gave species its first common name in english calling it grosbeak nelicourvi weaver has been designated official name by international ornithological committee ioc vernacular names in are and based on recent dna analysis genus ploceus is almost certainly polyphyletic if all species currently included in genus would remain and genus would be made monophyletic it would have to encompass entire subfamily ploceinae ploceinae can be divided into two groups in first group and bishops genus euplectes are sister to a clade in which genera foudia and quelea are closest relatives and which further includes asiatic species of ploceus i e p p philippinus p benghalensis p and p although untested since georges cuvier picked p philippinus as type species these five species would logically remain assigned to genus ploceus basic to second group is a clade consisting of both species sofar included in ploceus that live on madagascar p nelicourvi and p sakalava and these are morphologically very distinct from remaining species these two species could in future be assigned to genus nelicurvius that was erected by charles lucien bonaparte in 1850 but which was merged with ploceus later on this second group further contains genera and and all remaining ploceus species description nelicourvi weaver is a slender sparrow like bird of long and weighing during breeding period male has a black beak reddish brown eyes and blackish to brownish grey legs his head is black including cheeks around ears forehead crown and nape black is surrounded by a broad yellow collar that includes chin breast side and back of neck yellow collar is on other side bordered by a vaguely defined olive green band lower chest and belly are bluish grey lower flanks grey with a greenish hue wing flight feathers are blackish with those near wing tips with narrow greenish yellow edges and those more to base with broad olive green edges alula and primary coverts are blackish while all other coverts are bright olive green underside of wing consists of light grey feathers with a yellowish tinge shoulders and upper tailbase are also bright olive green under tailbase chestnut colored while tail flight feathers are blackish with wide olive green non breeding plumage differs in black of head which turns olive green mottled with dark grey and presence of a narrow yellow brow front of head of female in breeding plumage is yellow gradually changing to olive green at back of head except for broad yellow rear brow while area between eye and bill is dark greenish grey and area around ear is green head is surrounded by a broad yellow collar that includes chin remainder of female breeding plumage is identical to male s nelicourvi weaver can be distinguished from related sakalava weaver which has streaked plumage somewhat related forest fody and madagascar fody mostly have streaked upperparts and scarlet as most obvious colour sound usual call of nelicourvi weaver is a high pitched very distinct which is more and rasping when birds are in feeding groups other calls that can be heard when birds are at nest include and song which is produced while being at nest sounds like distribution and habitat nelicourvi weaver is an endemic species of madagascar it occurs along entire belt of rainforest that stretches from mountains in north to south east it also is present in litoral forest of eastern coast almost but not quite reaching fort dauphin of old in south east it can be found from see level to mostly around altitude but is also present up to high in marojejy national park in far north an isolated population exists at amber mountain national park it mostly lives in moist mountain and lowland forest but is also present in sclerophyllous mountain forests bushland and thickets ecology and behaviour thumb left male in initial stage of nest roam from forest floor to canopy but particularly favour middle story they mostly operate alone in pairs or groups of three and can also be found mixing with long billed larger flocks do not occur nelicourvi weaver is an agile active species that generally makes a lot of noise it searches for insects on leaves and branches while hanging from vines and twigs it looks for animals in rolled leaves such as wild ginger and along leaf litter probing crevices and opening dead stems it also dismembers flowers to reach nectar mostly arthropods beetles bugs butterflies caterpillars dragonflies flies grasshoppers leafhoppers stick insects millipedes and spiders are consumed sometimes small vertebrates lizards and chameleons next to some nectar fruit and probably seeds reproduction species is apparently monogamous having long term relationships nests are built distanced from other nests although occasionally two nests are within a few meters colonies do not occur males display during breeding season while seated on a horizontal branch with fluttering wings helt low while calling loudly mating starts during sixth day of nest building male chases away other birds from nest possibly to forestall deposition of eggs by other couples or cuckoos eggs usually are produced between october and march corresponding to late dry season and raining season nest building may occur as early as august and does not always signal imminent breeding attempts nests are conspicuous usually in open and away from surrounding vegetation attached from an often defoliated limb bamboo stem or vine hanging above a clearing or a stream at a height of nest is attached to its hold by a long rope it is shaped like a retort having an oval nesting chamber high and in diameter and a vertical entrance hose is attached high up a side and is at least as long as nest is high it is a firm construction made from strips of grass sedge and palm fronds with a thin lining of palm fibres at bottom of nesting chamber male constructs structure of nest while female brings lining material total time used to construct nest is approximately twelve days a clutch consists of one to four most often three oval smooth somewhat shiny variably pale blue green eggs of about 20 1 2 mm 0 8 in long and in diameter eggs are incubated only by female for fifteen days before hatching male lacks brood patches both parents feed chicks and remove fecal sacs predation eggs sometimes fall prey to brown lemurs eulemur fulvus and nest are raided by madagascar harrier hawks radiatus in daytime birds may be taken by banded kestrels falco while at night they are at risk of being captured by barn owls tyto alba references external links nelicourvi weaver species text in weaver watch nelicourvi weaver category endemic birds of madagascar nelicourvi weaver category
