on army volunteers tried to press home service troops into active service to assist and augment undermanned troops overseas from his bed in chorley park hospital smythe dictated a statement to globe and mail newspaper which printed it on its front page on september 19 1944 smythe was accused of acting solely for political gain publisher of globe and mail at time was prominent conservative george

known within army and smythe did not make any complaints to senior officers while in active service despite being criticized smythe kept up his public criticism in newspapers after james ralston canada s defence minister traveled to italy he saw for himself shortage of skilled reinforcements ralston who king did not trust was replaced with andrew mcnaughton who was against conscription

a power struggle over presidency of company smythe suspected that macbrien a member of board of directors wanted to succeed bickle as president and make selke general manager in his own right smythe wanted to be president and asked selke for his support selke equivocated and relationship between two long time friends turned acrimonious leading to selke s resignation in may 1946 two months later

stockbroker and gardens shareholder percy gardiner smythe bought controlling interest in maple leaf gardens ltd and was thus able to install himself as president on november 19 1947 however smythe had been face of franchise for more than two decades before then acknowledging this andy lytle sports editor of toronto star said appointment simply makes official what he has been for years in actuality smythe and gardens are synonymous terms macbrien was made chairman smythe repaid his debt to gardiner by 1960 he later succeeded macbrien as chairman of board smythe oversaw one of hockey s greatest dynasties when toronto won six stanley cups in 10 seasons between 1942 and 1951 hap day coached team to five of those cups and was assistant general manager for sixth he was named in a poll of canadian sports editors most dominating personality in any capacity in sports for 1949 maple leafs were masters of playoff hockey their regular season performances were usually fair to good or just good enough to make playoffs smythe was known for caring little about gaudy regular season records however he did care about winning cup because winning sells tickets however leafs spent most of 1950s as a mediocre team struggling under three different coaches while day remained assistant general manager under smythe even so in 1955 smythe turned over most responsibility for hockey operations to day but nominally remained general manager however just after leafs were eliminated from playoffs in 1957 smythe told media that it had been a season of failure and that he did not know if 55 year old day would be available for next season day felt smythe had cut his legs out from under him and resigned he had spent 28 of previous 30 years with st pats leafs as a player coach or executive by this time smythe had turned team operations over to a seven person committee headed by his son stafford newspaper owner john bassett was another member of committee as was percy gardiner s son george committee became known as silver seven because seven had been born with a silver spoon in their mouths initially all members were in their 30s or early 40s but that changed before end of year when 54 year old harold ballard president of toronto marlboros was appointed to committee to fill a vacancy committee hired punch imlach as general manager imlach would later take over coaching job as well smythe was an nhl owner during era before advent of a players union between 1942 43 and 1966 67 seasons nhl consisted of only six teams original six and players who failed to comply with team orders could easily be demoted to minor leagues and replaced players who did not follow smythe s rules were traded or sent to minors two players danny and john mccormack were both demoted to minors for getting married without smythe s permission while pay for an nhl player was relatively good it still left many players looking for other jobs during off season while owners were all wealthy men these conditions led to two efforts to organize a union which smythe was vehemently against from 1957 onwards smythe along with other owners including james d norris of chicago black hawks and his half brother bruce norris of detroit red wings were accused of union busting activities related to ted lindsay s attempt to form an nhl players association smythe s role in those affairs are dramatized in movie net worth jimmy thomson who was acting captain of maple leafs when players started to organize was singled out by smythe smythe detailed all monies thomson had been paid by organization going back to junior while arranging for thomson to be left off team he also allegedly called thomson a traitor and publicly blamed him for team s poor season thomson finally announced to press that he would never play again for maple leafs and he and tod sloan were traded away to chicago nhl owners eventually agreed to make some concessions to players such as contributing to players pensions owners were able to temporarily head off formation of union although it would eventually be organized some ten years later later years though silver seven made most decisions involving leafs smythe was not a hands off owner and was constantly fighting with his son stafford commented my father has always given me lots of rope when i was thirty i was ten years ahead of everybody but at forty i m ten years behind everybody finally in 1961 stafford resigned from committee and this spurred conn after four years of fighting he offered to sell his shares to stafford and in november 1961 smythe sold 45 000 of his 50 000 shares in maple leaf gardens ltd to a partnership of his son ballard and bassett for 2 3 million a handsome return on his investment of 34 years earlier years later smythe claimed that he thought sale was only to stafford and was furious to learn that he d brought on ballard and bassett as partners according to this account smythe had hoped that stafford would eventually keep gardens for his son tommy however it is not likely that stafford would have been able to raise money on his own as part of arrangement smythe resigned as president and managing director nominating stafford to succeed him at stafford s instigation board then granted smythe a 15 000 annual allowance an office at gardens and a car and driver for rest of his life stafford ballard and bassett then nominated smythe as chairman of board smythe stood down as governor of leafs on february 5 1962 a position he had held since 1927 smythe resigned team chairmanship after toronto won stanley cup in

canada ballard ordered new flag flown because calls were more than three to one in favour of new flag in march 1966 smythe sold his remaining shares in maple leaf gardens ltd and resigned from board of directors after a muhammad ali boxing match was scheduled for gardens he found ali s refusal to serve in u s army during vietnam war to be offensive because as he put it in his autobiography gardens was founded by men sportsmen who fought for their country it is no place for those want to evade conscription in their own country gardens was built for many things but not for picking up things that no one else wants he also said that by accepting fight gardens owners had put cash ahead of class smythe stayed away from gardens and took shots at ownership in press stating that he had been traded for 35 000 and a black muslim minister seats at gardens had been replaced with new narrower ones and smythe commented that only a slim young man could sit in them but prices are so high that only a fat rich man could afford them he continued to be sought out for his views on hockey when nhl expanded to 12 teams from six in 1967 smythe openly opposed expansion on basis that it would make for inferior hockey we had best players in world split between six teams and hockey was always worth money by this time conn and stafford were not on speaking terms and it fell to tom smythe stafford s son to mediate between two stafford built a new office suite at gardens for conn and feud was over after stafford was charged with fraud in 1971 and became ill with a stomach ulcer conn was
