eighteen members although name northumberland rovers was mooted boys settled on name hotspur as with cricket club it was chosen in honour of sir henry percy better known as harry hotspur rebel of

successful and transformed players into a team that were hard to beat in 1949 50 season rowe started his tenure as manager with a 4 1 victory at brentford beginning of an unbeaten run of 23 league and cup games between 27 august 1949 and 14 january 1950 with a free scoring attack force team won second division convincingly with six games yet to play they ended season nine points in front elevating

finished season ahead of manchester united by three points having won their first division championship title in penultimate game of season by beating sheffield wednesday with a solitary goal from duquemin that was tottenham s first ever league title spurs way push and run tactics developed by rowe were successful in his early years as manager rowe credited mcwilliam for learning to play a quick passing game which he developed into a style involving players playing in triangles quickly laying ball off to a teammate and running past marking tackler to collect return pass keeping to rowe s maxim of make it simple make it quick this method proved an effective way of moving ball at pace with players positions and responsibilities being totally fluid it became an attractive fast moving attacking style of play regarded by tottenham fans to be spurs way which was adjusted and perfected in later period under bill nicholson spurs finished second in 1951 52 season beaten to title by a young manchester united team a bad winter and poor state of white hart lane pitch were contributory as push and run style of play required a good firm playing surface following years witnessed a period of decline as great players aged but younger players such as tony marchi and tommy harmer were not yet experienced enough and with injuries and other teams adapting to spurs revolutionary style of play it meant a struggle for once dominant team spurs could only finish tenth in 1952 53 season push and run team also started to disperse medley willis bennett and burgess left to join other teams

successful period in club s history decline and revival under keith burkinshaw 1974 1984 although tottenham managed to reach four cup finals in four years and winning three of them from 1971 to 1974 team began to decline as nicholson was unable to sign players he wanted in part because of his refusal to meet demands for under counter payments early seventies was also beginning of a period of increasing football violence rioting by spurs fans in rotterdam in their loss to feyenoord in 1974 uefa cup final added to his disillusionment nicholson resigned after a poor start to 1974 75 season and a 4 0 loss to middlesbrough in league cup but his tenure ended on a sour note he had sought to be succeeded by blanchflower as manager and johnny giles as player coach but chairman sidney wale was angered by nicholson contacting pair without informing him first club then severed all ties with a ps10 000 payoff even though nicholson had wanted to stay on as an advisor and refused him a

international goalkeeper pat jennings for a bargain ps45 000 to arsenal as burkinshaw had started to use barry daines a move that shocked club s fans and one that burkinshaw later admitted was a great error jennings played on for another seven seasons for spurs arch rivals despite relegation board kept faith with burkinshaw and team immediately won promotion to top flight although it took until final league game of season for them to be promoted a sudden loss of form at end of 1977 78 season meant club needed a point in last game at southampton to tottenham s great relief game ended 0 0 and

for ps600 000 and with help of paul who had bought 15 of shares from family of previous chairman bearman took control in december 1982 scholar inherited a club in debt to tune of nearly ps5 million

who joined manchester united two years later had reneged on an agreement to take over tottenham enjoyed a strong start to 1984 85 season and looked poised to win league title by winter but a series of poor home results in 1985 resulted in team being leapfrogged by eventual champions everton and runners up liverpool their final position of third place in league should have secured them a uefa cup place but heysel disaster on 29 may 1985 which saw 39 spectators crushed to death when liverpool fans rioted at 1985 european cup final resulted in all english clubs being banned from european

suffering an achilles tendon injury and new signings by venables terry fenwick and paul walsh failed to lift team which finished in 13th place striker clive allen was also less prolific in attack in

signed striker paul stewart from manchester city for ps1 7 million spurs made a shaky start to 1988 89 season incomplete refurbishment of east stand caused postponement of opening game against

and then derby county became interested in club putting derby county up for sale so that he could acquire tottenham venables who had previously attempted to buy club but failed then joined forces with

reckless tackle on opponent gary charles winning match 2 1 after extra time spurs became first team to collect eight fa cups a record later surpassed by manchester united in 1996 excitement in north

venables and jointly buy club gascoigne was a transfer target for italian club lazio but his knee injury aggravated later in a nightclub incident meant that he missed 1991 92 season and his transfer
