atom heart mother is fifth studio album by english progressive rock band pink floyd it was released by harvest on 2 october 1970 in uk and by capitol on 10 october 1970 in us it was recorded at abbey road studios in london england and was band s first album to reach number 1 in uk while it reached number 55 in us eventually going gold there a remastered cd was released in 1994 in uk and united states and again in 2011 ron geesin who had already influenced and collaborated with roger waters contributed to title track and received a then rare outside songwriting credit cover was designed by hipgnosis and was first one to not feature band s name on cover or contain any photographs of band anywhere this was a trend that would continue on subsequent covers throughout 1970s and beyond although it was commercially successful on release band particularly waters and david gilmour have expressed several negative opinions of album in more recent years nevertheless it remained popular enough for gilmour to perform title track with geesin in 2008 recording left thumb roger waters onstage at leeds university 28 february 1970 one of earliest live performances of album s title track was at this show pink floyd started work on album after completing their contributions to soundtrack for film zabriskie point in rome which had ended somewhat acrimoniously they headed back to london in early 1970 for rehearsals a number of out takes from rome sessions were used to assemble new material during these rehearsals though some of it such as violent sequence later to become us and them would not be used for some time side one title track to atom heart mother resulted from a number of instrumental figures band had composed during these rehearsals including chord progression of main theme which guitarist david gilmour had called theme from an imaginary western and earliest documented live performance was on 17 january 1970 at hull university band felt that live performances developed piece into a manageable shape recording of track commenced at abbey road studios in london and was somewhat cumbersome as it was first recording to use a new eight track one inch tape and emi transistorised mixing console 8 track 20 microphone inputs in studio and as a result emi insisted band were not allowed to do any splicing of tape to edit pieces together consequently band members roger waters and nick mason had little choice but to play bass and drums respectively for entire 23 minute piece in one sitting other instruments band played were overdubbed later mason recalled final backing track s lack of precise timekeeping would cause problems later on by march they had finished recording track but felt that it was rather unfocused and needed something else band had been introduced to ron geesin via rolling stones tour manager sam cutler and were impressed with his composition and tape editing capabilities particularly waters and mason geesin was handed completed backing tracks band had recorded and asked to compose an orchestral arrangement over top of it while band went on tour to us geesin described composing and arranging as a hell of a lot of work nobody knew what was wanted they couldn t read music according to him gilmour came up with some of melodic lines while pair of them along with keyboardist richard wright worked on middle section with choir when it came to recording his work in june with emi pops orchestra session musicians present were unimpressed with his tendency to favour avant garde music over established classical works and combined with relative difficulty of some of parts harassed him during recording john alldis whose choir were also to perform on track had experience in dealing with orchestral musicians and managed to conduct recorded performance in place of geesin track was originally called amazing pudding though geesin s original score referred to it as untitled epic a refined and improved version with geesin s written parts was played at bath festival of blues and progressive music on 27 june its name was changed after band were due to play an in concert broadcast for bbc radio 1 on 16 july 1970 and had needed a title for john peel to announce it geesin pointed to a copy of evening standard and suggested to waters that he would find a title in there headline was atom heart mother named a story about a woman being fitted with a nuclear powered pacemaker piece as presented on completed album is a progression from pink floyd s earlier instrumental pieces such as a saucerful of secrets and even earlier interstellar overdrive atom heart mother suite takes up all of side one and is split into six parts individually named geesin chose opening section name father s shout after earl hines while other names such as breast milky and funky dung were inspired by album cover artwork orchestral arrangements feature a full brass section a cello and 16 piece john alldis choir which take most of lead melody lines while pink floyd mainly provide backing tracks a reverse of 1960s pop music practice of using orchestration as background and putting rock band in front side two thumb right by 1970 rick wright had started using a hammond m102 organ on stage regularly and it makes a prominent appearance on album album s concept is similar to their previous ummagumma album in that it features full band in first half and focuses on individual members in second half side two opens with three five minute songs one by each of band s three resident songwriters and closes with a suite with sound effects primarily conceived by mason but credited to whole group waters contributes a folk ballad called if playing acoustic guitar pink floyd rarely played song live but waters often performed it at solo shows in support of his radio k a o s album more than a decade later this is followed by wright s summer 68 which also features prominent use of brass in places it was issued as a japanese single in 1971 and was only track on album never to be played live in concert song was reportedly about wright and a groupie on tour and had working title of one night stand according to mason gilmour having had little songwriting experience at that point was ordered to remain in abbey road until he had composed a song suitable for inclusion on album he came up with a folk influenced tune fat old sun which he still cites as a personal favourite song was a regular part of band s live repertoire in 1970 71 and became a staple of gilmour s solo set in 2006 final track alan s psychedelic breakfast is divided into three segments each with its own descriptive title joined by dialogue and sound effects of then roadie alan styles preparing discussing and eating breakfast idea for piece came about by waters experimenting with rhythm of a dripping tap which combined sound effects and dialogue recorded by mason in his kitchen with musical pieces recorded at abbey road a slightly re worked version was performed on stage on 22 december 1970 at sheffield city hall sheffield england with band members pausing between pieces to eat and drink their breakfast original lp ends with sound of tap which continues into inner groove and thus plays on indefinitely original floyd frontman syd barrett recorded his album barrett around same time as atom heart mother with assistance from gilmour and wright he occasionally visited his old band s sessions to see what they were doing artwork thumb right bootleg dark side of moo featured a fan s attempt at copying cover original album cover designed by art collective hipgnosis shows a holstein friesian cow standing in a pasture with no text nor any other clue as to what might be on record some later editions have title and artist name added to cover this concept was group s reaction to psychedelic space rock imagery associated with pink floyd at time of album s release band wanted to explore all sorts of music without being limited to a particular image or style of performance they thus requested that their new album had something plain on cover which ended up being image of a cow storm thorgerson inspired by andy warhol s famous cow wallpaper has said that he simply drove out into a rural area near potters bar and photographed first cow he saw cow s owner identified her name as iii more cows appear on back cover again with no text or titles and on inside gatefold also a pink balloon shaped like a cow udder accompanied album as part of capitol s marketing strategy campaign to break band in us r serge denisoff solid gold popular record industry p 174 transaction publishers 1975 liner notes in later cd editions give a recipe for traditional bedouin wedding feast on a card labelled breakfast tips looking back on artwork thorgerson remembered i think cow represents in terms of pink floyd part of their humour which i think is often underestimated or just unwritten about in mid 1970s a bootleg containing rare singles and b sides entitled dark side of moo appeared with a similar cover like atom heart mother cover had no writing on it although in this case it was to protect bootlegger s anonymity rather than any artistic statement album cover for klf s concept album chill out was also inspired by atom heart mother release and reception atom heart mother was released on 2 october 1970 in uk and 10 october in us it reached number 1 and number 55 respectively in those countries charts it was released in quadraphonic format in uk germany and australia a remastered cd was released in 1994 in uk and us mobile fidelity sound lab released a gold cd in us in 1994 while a lp version was released in us in same year as part of why pink floyd campaign a remaster was released in 2011 then album was re issued again in 2016 on band s own pink floyd records label critical reaction to suite has always been mixed and all band members have expressed negativity toward it in recent times gilmour has said album was a load of rubbish we were at a real down point i think we were scraping barrel a bit at that period and a good idea but it was dreadful atom heart mother sounds like we didn t have any idea between us but we became much more prolific after it similarly in a 1984 interview on bbc radio 1 waters said if somebody said to me now right here s a million pounds go out and play atom heart mother i d say you must be fucking joking in a 1970 review alec dubro of rolling stone appraised atom heart mother negatively stating if pink floyd is looking for some new dimensions they haven t found them here in christgau s record guide rock albums of seventies 1981 robert christgau said suite was easier to digest than second side of songs yeah they do leave singing to an anonymous semi classical chorus and yeah they probably did get horns for fanfares at same hiring hall but at least suite provides a few of hypnotic melodies that made ummagumma such an admirable record to fall asleep to album is ranked number 990 in all time top 1000 albums live performances band were initially enthusiastic about performing suite an early performance was taped for san francisco television station kqed featuring just band on 28 april 1970 two major performances were at bath festival of blues and progressive music on 27 june and garden party in hyde park london on 18 july on both occasions band were accompanied by john alldis choir and philip jones brass ensemble later band took a full brass section and choir on tour just for purpose of performing this piece however this caused tour to lose money and band found problems with hired musicians which changed from gig to gig as they simply took who was available which combined with lack of rehearsal and problems miking up whole ensemble made a full live performance more problematic reflecting on this gilmour said some of brass players have been really hopeless according to mason band arrived at one gig in aachen germany only to discover they had left sheet music behind forcing tour manager tony howard to go back to london and get it a later arrangement without brass or choir and pared down from 25 minutes to fifteen by omitting collage sections and closing reprise of main theme remained in their live repertoire into 1972 first live performance of dark side of moon suite in brighton was abandoned partway through after a break band played atom heart mother instead pink floyd s last live performance of suite took place on 22 may 1972 at olympisch stadion amsterdam netherlands legacy stanley kubrick wanted to use album s title track in a clockwork orange group refused permission primarily because kubrick was unsure of exactly which pieces of music he wanted and what he wished to do with them in retrospect waters said maybe it s just as well it wasn t used after all nevertheless album is visible behind counter in record store scene of film on 14 and 15 june 2008 geesin performed atom heart mother with italian tribute band mun floyd over two nights as part of chelsea festival geesin introduced it with a history and slide show performances featured chamber choir canticum brass and cellist caroline dale who has worked with gilmour second night saw gilmour join geesin on stage for performance which was extended to 30 minutes in 2013 geesin produced a book flaming cow which documented his experience with working with pink
