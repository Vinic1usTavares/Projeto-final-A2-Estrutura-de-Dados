disappearance were called into question president of legislative council of hong kong jasper tsang said china central television cctv report and broadcast of gui s confession did not seem to be able to calm public as case drags on there will be more speculation human rights watch was quoted as saying given that gui has been held nearly three months incommunicado in a secret location and without a lawyer his confession on state controlled tv lacks credibility washington post said narrative seems messy and incoherent blending possible fact with what seems like outright fiction it feels illogical absurd even amnesty international s china researcher cast doubt on narrative asking why would four other employees of a company need to go missing in order to assist with a regular criminal case how could other missing or otherwise investigated colleagues of gui minhai have any connection to case guardian drew a connection to operation fox hunt a chinese government campaign launched by xi jinping in 2014 to repatriate corrupt officials or opponents of regime who had fled abroad and which may also have been responsible for abduction of other missing booksellers by mid june 2016 gui s family had

there was no official record of gui s departure from thailand and that international law had been violated by gui s kidnapping he speculated that abductors had returned to gui s apartment to retrieve his passport and that gui may have been sent to china from cambodia on a plane loaded with chinese deportees gui s daughter angela had been notified of her father s disappearance in an email from lee bo dated 10 november in which lee said he feared gui had been taken to china for political reasons angela dismissed assertion that her father had returned to mainland voluntarily sweden has repeatedly requested transparency from china and summoned thai ambassador for information in december after appearance of video confession swedish foreign ministry reported that a swedish envoy was finally allowed to visit gui in january 2016 swedish foreign minister margot wallstrom condemned forced confessions of dahlin and gui who are both swedish citizens on chinese television terming them unacceptable chinese government has said that gui was first and foremost a chinese subject and swedish government seems to have quietly accepted this position swedish diplomatic effort has been through consular channels and has been low profile in late february 2016 state media appeared to clarify charges against gui saying that gui was being held for illegal business operations he is alleged to have knowingly distributed books not approved by china s press and publication authority according to charges some 4 000 such books had been sent by post disguised as different books to 380

released immediately in his report on hong kong for second half of 2015 british foreign secretary philip hammond expressed concern about causeway bay books disappearances and said in particular that abduction of gui s colleague lee bo a british citizen from hong kong was a serious breach of sino british joint declaration on hong kong and undermines principle of one country two systems gui s detention was discussed at us congressional executive committee on china in may in september angela spoke before united nations human rights council and also made an emotional plea on behalf of her father on swedish television an appearance which prompted another public statement by wallstrom on detention swedish government which said that they had been involved in quiet diplomacy with chinese regime secured a second audience with gui after 11 months of detention a year after gui s disappearance there is a general consensus among commentators that five booksellers were abducted by chinese authorities gui has spent a year in detention while other four men were released in early march 2016 one colleague lam wing kee gave an interview that received significant media coverage in which he spoke in great detail about his abduction and his months in detention by mainland law enforcement in ningbo and subsequently shaoguan their other colleagues have remained low profile and refused

officials gui minhai was set free on 17 october 2017 sweden s foreign ministry had received notification from chinese authorities that gui had been released although neither his daughter nor swedish authorities knew of his whereabouts for a certain time afterwards on 19 january 2018 a group of about 10 men in plain clothes boarded a train bound for beijing and pulled gui from train gui was on his way to a medical examination in beijing accompanied by two senior swedish diplomats according to his daughter angela swedish government acknowledges incident in early february gui again appeared in a confession before reporters from pro establishment news outlets including south china morning post of hong kong gui who had been in custody or under close surveillance for past two years appeared to have been freed in october 2017 he said that sweden had sensationalised his case and tricked him into an unsuccessful attempt to leave china using a medical appointment at swedish embassy in beijing as a pretext they would supposedly wait for an opportunity to repatriate gui to sweden human rights watch and amnesty international denounced this sort of contrived confession made in incommunicado detention sweden later condemned china s brutal intervention in gui s case following week misinformation campaign a study by australian strategic policy institute which analysed tweets of chinese government controlled accounts banned by twitter in response to 2019 hong kong anti extradition bill protests found that accounts also targeted gui minhai other dissidents targeted by bot network

lindstedt contacted her in mid january and invited her to a meeting in stockholm that she had set up with some chinese businessmen who she thought could help secure her father s release angela recounted in her blog that meetings were held at a private lounge in a stockholm hotel where she was sequestered for days and was even escorted to and from bathroom men who claimed to have connections within chinese communist party apparently used a mixture of inducements manipulation and threats on her she was told her that her father s release would be contingent on her stopping her campaign and avoiding media engagement they offered her a chinese visa as well as a job in chinese embassy to angela ambassador lindstedt s presence and seemingly supportive stance suggested talks were initiated by swedish foreign ministry she nevertheless felt uncomfortable with meetings when she later made inquiries of swedish foreign ministry it said it was unaware of events chinese embassy in stockholm denied any involvement swedish foreign ministry said it was not aware of events until after meetings had taken place it confirmed to press that ambassador had been recalled and that an internal investigation into incident was under way on 9 december lindstedt was charged by swedish prosecutors for arbitrariness during negotiations with a foreign power with a possible maximum prison sentence
