become an annual fixture barring periodic fallow years in 1981 michael eavis took control of festival and it was organised in conjunction with campaign for nuclear disarmament cnd that year a new pyramid stage was constructed from telegraph poles and metal sheeting repurposed from materials of ministry of defence a permanent structure which doubled as a hay barn and cow shed during winter in

made profits and eavis donated ps20 000 of them to cnd in following years donations were made to a number of organisations and since end of cold war main beneficiaries have been oxfam greenpeace and wateraid who all contribute towards festival by providing features and volunteers who work at festival in exchange for free entry since 1983 large festivals have required licences from local authorities this led to certain restrictions being placed on festival including a crowd limit and specified times during which stages could operate crowd limit was initially set at 30 000 but has grown every year to over 100 000 1984 saw stage invaded by children during smiths set weather report played main stage and elvis costello headlined last night for almost three hours in 1985 festival grew too large for worthy farm but neighbouring cockmill farm was purchased that year saw a wet festival with considerable rain worthy farm is a dairy farm and what washed down into low areas was a mixture of mud and liquefied cow dung this did not prevent festival goers from enjoying knee deep slurry in front of pyramid stage 1989 was first year that impromptu unofficial sound systems sprung up around festival site a portent of things to come these sound systems would play loud electronic acid house music round clock with largest hypnosis sound system rivaling volume of some of official stages and running non stop throughout festival 1990s biggest festival yet was held in 1990 however day after festival ended violence between security guards and new age travellers so called battle of yeoman s bridge led to organisers taking 1991 off to rethink festival an expanded festival returned in 1992 and this proved a great success 1992 was first year that new age travellers were not initially allowed onto site free and a sturdier fence was designed this success was carried through to 1993 which like 1992 was hot and dry in 1994 pyramid stage burned down just over a week before festival a temporary main stage was erected in time for festival 1994 festival also introduced a 150 kw wind turbine which provided some of festival power this festival also included setting of a new

festival for those who knew little of it channel 4 s 4 goes to glastonbury brought widely expanded televised coverage of festival for first time in 1994 and also following year tv broadcast in 1994 was a crucial factor in ensuring that orbital s performance at festival achieved legendary status as a result living rooms across country were able to experience what a rave might look like and suddenly dance music which had been attacked by establishment and mainstream press for years didn t seem so dangerous indeed 1994 was a crucial turning point for dance music s role at festival speaking to guardian in 2013 about orbital gig michael eavis noted that it marked dance music s appearance on mainstream agenda what was previously underground made it on to one of big stages and there was no going back from there as police and council made me very well aware buzz had been around raves and market sound systems and in travellers fields for years but it needed a showcase to make it legal gig opened way for others such as chemical brothers massive attack and underworld who all played high profile stages in following years developments that led to launch of festival s dance village in 1997 thumb giant love sign inspired by beatles 1995 saw attendance rise drastically due to security fence being breached on friday of festival estimates suggest there may have been enough fence jumpers to double size of festival this aside 1995 proved to be a highly successful year with memorable performances from oasis elastica pulp pj harvey jeff buckley jamiroquai and cure this was also first year of festival having a dance tent to cater for rise in popularity of dance music following success of orbital s headline appearance previous year dance acts of 1995 were led by massive
