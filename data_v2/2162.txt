first silesian war was a conflict between prussia and austria lasting from 1740 to 1742 which resulted in prussia s seizure from austria of most of region of silesia now in western poland war was fought mainly in silesia moravia and bohemia lands of bohemian crown and formed one theatre of wider war of austrian succession it was first in a series of three silesian wars fought between frederick great s prussia and maria theresa s austria in mid 1700s all three of which ended in prussian control of silesia no particular triggering event started war prussia cited its centuries old dynastic claims on parts of silesia as a casus belli but realpolitik and geostrategic factors also played a role in provoking conflict maria theresa s contested succession to habsburg monarchy provided an opportunity for prussia to strengthen itself relative to regional rivals such as saxony and bavaria war began with a prussian invasion of habsburg silesia in late 1740 and it ended in a prussian victory with 1742 treaty of berlin which recognised prussia s seizure of most of silesia and parts of bohemia meanwhile wider war of austrian succession continued and conflict over silesia would draw austria and prussia into a renewed second silesian war only two years later first silesian war marked unexpected defeat of habsburg monarchy by a lesser german power and initiated austria prussia rivalry that would shape german politics for more than a century context and causes in early eighteenth century brandenburg prussia s ruling house of hohenzollern held dynastic claims to various of silesian duchies within habsburg province of silesia a populous and prosperous region contiguous with prussia s core territory of brandenburg besides its value as a source of tax revenue industrial output and military recruits silesia held great geostrategic importance to belligerents valley of upper oder formed a natural military conduit between brandenburg bohemia and moravia and whichever power held it could threaten its neighbours silesia also marked north eastern frontier of holy roman empire allowing its controller to limit influence of poland and russia within germany brandenburg prussia s claims thumb alt map of political borders in central europe in early 1700s lands of bohemian crown under habsburg rule until 1742 when most of silesia was ceded to brandenburg prussia brandenburg prussia s claims in silesia were based in part on a 1537 inheritance treaty between silesian piast duke frederick ii of legnica and hohenzollern prince elector joachim ii hector of brandenburg whereby silesian duchies of liegnitz wohlau and brieg were to pass to hohenzollerns of brandenburg if piast dynasty in silesia should become extinct at time habsburg king ferdinand i of bohemia silesia s legal overlord rejected agreement and pressed hohenzollerns to repudiate it in 1603 hohenzollern elector joachim iii frederick of brandenburg also inherited silesian duchy of jagerndorf from his cousin margrave george frederick of brandenburg ansbach and installed his second son johann georg as duke in bohemian revolt and ensuing thirty years war johann georg joined bohemian estates in revolt against catholic holy roman emperor ferdinand ii after catholic victory in 1621 battle of white mountain emperor confiscated johann georg s duchy and refused to return it to his heirs after his death electors of brandenburg continued nevertheless to assert themselves as legitimate rulers of jagerndorf in 1675 great elector frederick william of brandenburg laid claim to liegnitz wohlau and brieg when silesian piast line ended with death of duke george william of liegnitz but habsburg emperor disregarded hohenzollern claims and lands escheated to crown in 1685 when austria was engaged in great turkish war emperor leopold i gave great elector frederick william immediate control of silesian exclave of schwiebus in return for military support against turks and surrender of outstanding hohenzollern claims in silesia however after accession of great elector s son and successor frederick iii of brandenburg emperor took back control of schwiebus in 1694 claiming that territory had only been personally assigned to late great elector for life as a youth frederick iii had secretly agreed to this in return for leopold s payment of some of his debts but as monarch he repudiated agreement and reasserted old hohenzollern claims to jagerndorf and silesian piast heritage austrian succession thumb alt portrait painting of a young maria theresa maria theresa of austria by martin van meytens two generations later newly crowned hohenzollern king frederick ii of prussia formed designs on silesia soon after succeeding to prussian throne in may 1740 frederick judged that his dynasty s claims were credible and he had inherited from his father a large and well trained prussian army and a healthy royal treasury austria by contrast was in financial distress and its army had not been reinforced or reformed after an ignominious performance in recent austro turkish war european strategic situation was favourable for an attack on austria with britain and france occupying each other s attentions and russia in conflict with sweden bavaria and saxony also had claims against austria and might join in attack though hohenzollerns dynastic claims provided a legalistic casus belli considerations of realpolitik and played leading role in provoking war an opportunity arose for brandenburg prussia to press its claims when habsburg holy roman emperor charles vi died in october 1740 without a male heir with pragmatic sanction of 1713 charles had established his eldest daughter maria theresa as successor to his hereditary titles and upon his death she duly became ruler of austria as well as of bohemian and hungarian lands within habsburg monarchy during emperor charles s lifetime pragmatic sanction had been generally acknowledged by imperial states but when he died it was promptly contested by several parties frederick saw in austria s female succession an opportune moment for seizure of silesia calling it signal for complete transformation of old political system in a 1740 letter to voltaire he argued that pragmatic sanction did not apply to silesia which was held by habsburgs as a part of imperial demesne rather than as a hereditary possession frederick also argued that his father king frederick william i had assented to sanction in return for assurances of austrian support for hohenzollern claims on rhenish duchies of julich and berg which had never materialised meanwhile prince elector charles albert of bavaria and prince elector frederick augustus ii of saxony had each married one of maria theresa s older cousins from a senior branch of house of habsburg and they used these connections to justify claims to habsburg territory in absence of a male heir frederick augustus who ruled poland in personal union was especially interested in gaining control of silesia to connect his two realms into one contiguous territory which would nearly surround brandenburg concern to prevent this outcome contributed to prussia s haste in moving against austria when contested succession provided an opportunity moves toward war thumb alt map of european political borders in 1740 europe in years after

rivals electorates of cologne and palatinate joined these to form an alliance known as league of nymphenburg which aimed at diminution or destruction of habsburg monarchy and its dominant position among german states austria for its part was supported by great britain in personal union with electorate of hanover and eventually savoy sardinia and dutch republic russian empire under empress elizabeth also indirectly took austria s side in wider conflict by making war against sweden a french ally at time maria theresa s aims in conflict were first to preserve her hereditary lands and titles and second to win or compel support for election of her husband duke francis stephen of lorraine as holy roman emperor defending her house s traditional preeminence within germany after emperor charles s death on 20 october frederick quickly resolved to strike first on 8 november he ordered mobilisation of prussian army and on 11 december he issued an ultimatum to maria theresa demanding cession of silesia in return he offered to guarantee all other habsburg possessions against any attack pay a large cash indemnity acknowledge pragmatic sanction and give his vote as elector of

breslau even as he continued to publicly support league of nymphenburg although prussia was allied with french idea of france or bavaria becoming dominant power in germany through austria s destruction did not appeal to frederick with british urging and mediation on 9 october austria and prussia agreed to a secret armistice known as convention of klein schnellendorf under which both belligerents would cease hostilities in silesia though maintaining their appearance and austria would eventually concede lower silesia in return for a final peace to be negotiated before end of year

saxony also securing french and bavarian support for his seizure of entirety of silesia along with bohemian county of glatz as franco bavarian allies made territorial gains frederick became concerned that prussia might be sidelined in eventual peace agreement so he repudiated convention of klein schnellendorf accusing austrians of violating its secrecy and joined general advance southward into bohemia and moravia in december schwerin s army advanced through sudetes into moravia occupying capital at olmutz on 27 december while prince leopold s army besieged fortress at glatz on edge of bohemia in january 1742 imperial election was held at frankfurt where bavarian elector charles albert was chosen as next holy roman emperor in early 1742 frederick organised a joint advance through moravia toward vienna with saxons and french which began after their forces met on 5 february at wischau french however were reluctant and uncooperative and after seizure of iglau on 15 february they withdrew into bohemia prussians and saxons marched on toward brunn main austrian stronghold remaining in moravia but they made little progress due to substantial austrian garrison and a shortage of supplies this moravian campaign achieved no significant gains and effort was finally abandoned on 5 april after which prussians withdrew into bohemia and upper silesia luvaas from as moravian advance collapsed charles alexander of lorraine maria theresa s brother in law led a renewed austro hungarian army of 30 000 through moravia toward bohemia hoping to disperse prussians and liberate prague in

maria theresa was reluctant to make however british envoy lord hyndford pressed her to make peace with prussia and concentrate her forces against french british treasury had financed much of austria s war effort through cash subsidies meant to weaken france and hyndford threatened now to withdraw britain s support if maria theresa refused to give up silesian war for lost two belligerents eventually reached an agreement in 11 june treaty of breslau which ended first silesian war under this treaty austria conceded to prussia large majority of silesia along with bohemian county of glatz territories which would later be consolidated to form prussian province of silesia austria retained remainder of bohemia and two small portions of extreme southern end of silesia including duchy of teschen and parts of duchies of jagerndorf and neisse these lands would later be combined to form crown land of austrian silesia prussia also agreed to take on some of austria s debts that had been secured

separate peace while wider war of austrian succession raged on frederick abandoned his erstwhile allies in league of nymphenburg and earned a reputation for diplomatic unreliability and double dealing seizure of silesia also ensured continuing conflict with austria with prussia removed from conflict austria launched a major counter attack and began regaining lost ground on other fronts and diplomatic situation shifted in austria s favour maria theresa s determination to recover silesia would lead to renewed conflict with prussia in second silesian war only two years later with a third silesian war to follow after another decade prussia in territorial settlement that ended war prussia gained control of extensive new lands in glatz and silesia a region both populous and densely industrialised for time period that would contribute substantial manpower and taxes to prussian state small kingdom s unexpected victory over habsburg monarchy set it apart from german rivals such as bavaria and saxony marking beginning of prussia s rise toward status of a european great power this success planted seeds of future challenges however prussia s seizure of silesia made austria into a lasting and determined enemy beginning austria prussia rivalry that would come to dominate german politics over next century frederick s unilateral withdrawal from nymphenburg alliance and its repetition at end of second silesian war turned sentiment in french royal court against him contributing to france s eventual realignment toward austria in diplomatic revolution of 1750s france would

bavarians previous year western invaders were driven back up danube valley in early 1742 and franco bavarian forces occupying prague were isolated and besieged eventually giving up city in december by
