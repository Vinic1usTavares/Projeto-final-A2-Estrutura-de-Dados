reception episode was well received by many critics though some were not as happy with it a v club emily vanderwerff gave it an a grade and wrote that what she liked most of all was it being remarkably clear eyed about who these people are and what they re capable of crystal bell of huffington post described it as heartfelt comical and yes absolutely ridiculous and hollywood reporter lesley goldberg called it a tearful and touching finale though she acknowledged exceptions erica futterman of rolling stone characterized episode as a nonstop of too many tears and not enough nostalgia while entertainment weekly erin strecker said it had perfect amount of flashbacks and revelations and described it as a season finale that sure felt like a series finale rae votta of billboard wrote that there simply isn t enough time to settle fates of so many seniors in a mere hour a sentiment also expressed by houston chronicle bobby hankinson who thought episode might have felt a little more logical if it was given a full two hours to breathe hankinson also said it left him with mostly questions but also some fury tv guide two reviewers were both enthusiastic kate stanhope described is as a perfect mix of kids past present and future and damian holbrook wrote that class of 2012 went out on a high note with a season finale so solid emotional and entertaining you would have thought you were watching one of show s first 13 episodes vanderwerff called kurt opening his nyada rejection letter as good a gut punch as i can think of for this series though john kubicek of buddytv characterized it as most unbelievable plot twist ever on this show bell hoped that this would extend his stay in lima because it could give more screen time for burt hummel who is arguably best character on glee scene where burt gives kurt his present was described as a gift by many reviewers kubicek wrote kudos to glee for turning a sappy moment into a funny one and strecker noted how powerful scenes typically were between hummels before she added last night was no exception and ended by quoting kurt best graduation gift ever wall street journal raymund flandez deemed unrealistic notion that santana s mother would allow money she had saved for santana s college expenses to be wasted on a dream and bell described it as too good to be true michael slezak of tvline agreed and called maribel crazily lenient but said estefan had done good work kubicek however maintained that estefan was wasted in role and futterman wrote that choppy random scenes would have been a lot better with some gloria estefan singing scene where finn tells rachel he s sending her to new york instead of marrying her both surprised and impressed reviewers strecker called it one of her favorite non singing scenes of year possibly series and vanderwerff put it even more strongly it s one of best things i ve seen on tv this year both monteith and michele were praised for their acting slezak said it was their best work vanderwerff said they kill ed scene and bell said it was some of cory monteith s finest acting rachel s arrival in new york brought comparisons to mary tyler moore from bell and strecker as latter put it she s going to make it after all music and performances performances were given generally good marks by reviewers and one that received most enthusiastic reception was not for singing at all but burt s and dance to single ladies put a ring on it with aid of tina and brittany futterman called it best gift of season and slezak said it was another shining albeit silly moment for glee s best parental unit and gave it an bell wrote i loved every second of it and e online jenna mullins described it as episode s rewind moment jen chaney of washington post was fond of other flashback number sit down you re rockin boat to which she gave an and commented it was a nice reminder of how far these plucky glee kids have come mtv s fallon prinzivalli was not as enthusiastic about repeat performance and said it was not much better than pilot rendition and he was happy to see their version of song retired forever young generated differing reactions from reviewers slezak wondered whether will s diminished role this year reduced impact of his farewell song and gave it a b and futterman wrote that while bare bones guitar arrangement is suitably melancholy schue s voice never quite settles in seeming forced whole way through strecker thought it sounded lovely gave it a b and asked for more in next season and chaney graded it an a and said that it was sweet same word sweet was applied by slezak to kurt s rendition of i ll remember he called song an underrated madonna ballad and graded it a b chaney however said it was not one of madonna s best and performance not particularly memorable so she gave it a while wrote leave this one to madge futterman characterized kurt as dapper and emotional while singing in a crisp clear and natural voice though she wanted performance to be more than everyone s sad faces strecker s grade was an and she wrote that colfer sold it and that it was a nice arrangement for his voice you get what you give by graduating seniors was welcomed by reviewers prinzivalli called it one of cory monteith s best solos all season and a fun cover while futterman described it as fine and fun but nothing really spectacular slezak gave it an a and wrote this spirited rendition captured song s jaunty essence and strecker noted with her b that this was moment when it really kicked in that show will never be same chaney also complimented finn for having gotten hang of this whole singing and dancing thing in last three episodes of this season and gave a grade of b she gave an a to in my life sung by underclassmen and said harmonies sounded lovely bell called it a perfect song to signify graduation others were less enthusiastic futterman described it as a blended past recognition laden with harmonies beatles tune and point where show entered sappy hour and slezak said it was not most ringing endorsement for national champions 2013 chances and graded it a c reviewers wondered at inclusion of glory days chaney stated there is no way anyone should have been blaring springsteen in middle of a commencement ceremony and slezak called song a tone deaf choice for modern teenagers on their big day their grades were b and c respectively strecker merely noted that ceremony doubled as a performance when she gave her b and futterman thought it looked more like a fashion show than a graduation ceremony show s final number roots before branches was greatly praised although hankinson was hoping for a journey reprise or some other big group number he noted that rachel kill ed it and prinzivalli said lea michele shines as always strecker slezak and chaney each gave performance an a chaney called it a well chosen song and slezak wrote that he was glad to be introduced to it at
