battle of forts clinton and montgomery was an american revolutionary war battle fought in highlands of hudson river valley not far from west point on october 6 1777 british forces under command of general sir henry clinton captured fort clinton and fort montgomery and then dismantled hudson river chain purpose of attack was to create a diversion to draw american troops from army of general horatio gates whose army was opposing british general john burgoyne s attempt to gain control of hudson forts were garrisoned by about 600 continental army troops under command of two brothers general and governor of new york george clinton and general james clinton while general israel putnam led additional troops at nearby peekskill new york this battle is also sometimes called battle of clintons due to number of participants with that name brothers were probably not related to sir henry using a series of feints henry clinton fooled putnam into withdrawing most of his troops to east and then he landed over 2 000 troops on west side of hudson to assault two forts after several hours of hiking through hilly terrain clinton divided his troops to stage simultaneous assaults on two forts although approach to fort montgomery was contested by a company armed with a small field piece they attacked two forts at nearly same time and captured them after a relatively short battle more than half defenders were killed wounded or captured british followed up this success with raids as far north as kingston before being recalled to new york city action came too late to be of any assistance to burgoyne who surrendered his army on october 17 only notable consequences of action were casualties suffered and british destruction of two forts on their departure background hudson river valley was a strategically critical area throughout american revolutionary war through this area moved supplies men and materials between new england states and those further south something that became even more vitally important when british largely abandoned new england as an objective of military control later in war in june 1777 general john burgoyne began an attempt to gain control of this key area by moving south from british province of quebec after his early success at ticonderoga his campaign become bogged down in logistical difficulties not reaching saratoga new york until mid september ketchum 1997 p 348 burgoyne held expectations that his campaign would be supported by military forces based in new york city under command of general william howe and that forces would meet at albany about south of saratoga ketchum 1997 p 87 thumb right upright governor george clinton thumb right upright detail of a 1777 french map showing hudson river valley fort montgomery is incorrectly depicted on east side of river apparently as result of poor communications with lord germain britain s secretary of state for colonies and political official in charge of conflict general howe decided instead to attempt capture of philadelphia and sailed south with much of his army in july leaving sir henry clinton in command at new york ketchum 1997 p 82 howe s instructions to general clinton were primarily to hold new york city and to only engage in offensive operations that were consistent with that goal his instructions to clinton on july 30 included a promise that reinforcements would arrive but without any promised time and that clinton should consider making a move in favor or general burgoyne s approaching albany with security to kingsbridge if opportunity presented itself nickerson 1967 p 340 a letter from howe reached burgoyne on august 3 informing him of his move to philadelphia and of clinton s instructions ketchum 1997 p 283 clinton wrote a letter on september 12 received by burgoyne on 21st after battle of freeman s farm that he would make a push at fort montgomery in about ten days if you think 2000 men can assist you effectually nickerson 1967 p 320 prelude american defenses highland region of hudson river valley near west point was defended by continental army troops and state militia under command of major general israel putnam who was based at peekskill several miles upriver from peekskill just above popolopen gorge where popolopen creek enters hudson americans had placed a chain across hudson to prevent british naval vessels from sailing further upriver chain s western end was guarded by fort montgomery named for late general richard montgomery which also overlooked gorge to south also on west side of river south of gorge they had established fort clinton probably named for general james clinton nickerson 1967 pp 334 1981 p 239 fort montgomery which was still undergoing construction was under command of general and governor of new york george clinton while fort clinton was under command of his older brother james their combined forces numbered about 600 primary camp at peekskill which any british naval movements would need to pass had roughly 600 men of men at three sites about 1 000 were regular troops while remainder were short term new york militia putnam s forces had originally been larger but general washington had ordered some of putnam s troops to assist either his washington s defense against howe or gates defense against burgoyne and a number of local militia companies had been dismissed when howe s movements became known nickerson 1967 p 337 putnam received word of arrival of transports in new york on september 29 and wrote governor clinton for assistance who immediately came south from kingston to take charge of forts british movements in mid september around time he wrote letter to burgoyne sir henry clinton had around 7 000 men including around 3 000 poorly trained loyalists to defend new york city nickerson 1967 p 338 his letter to burgoyne had been predicated on expectation that expected reinforcements would arrive in time for him to make a move up hudson within ten days nickerson 1997 p 341 on september 29 he received a letter from burgoyne written after freeman s farm in response to his that was a direct plea for action by end of september 1 700 additional troops were landed from fleet arriving at new york on october 3 sir henry started up hudson river with 3 000 men in three frigates and a number of smaller vessels ketchum 1997 p 383 next day he landed some troops near tarrytown as a feint to draw putnam s troops from peekskill these troops marched about and then ships which continued north he then made a similar feinting maneuver at verplanck s point just three miles 4 8 km south of peekskill on october 5 where he dislodged a poorly manned american outpost nickerson 1967 p 344 these feinting maneuvers completely fooled putnam who drew his troops back into eastern highlands and sent messages across hudson for reinforcements shortly before this last movement sir henry received a dispatch from burgoyne in it burgoyne explicitly appeals to clinton for instruction on whether he should attempt to advance or retreat based on likelihood of clinton s arrival at albany for support he indicated that if he did not receive a response by october 12 he would be forced to retreat nickerson 1967 p 345 clinton s response not written until october 7 was a markedly formal response indicating that he was providing requested diversion and had no expectation of reaching albany adding that sir henry clinton cannot presume to give any orders to general burgoyne as burgoyne outranked him fortunately for clinton none of three copies of this letter reached burgoyne all of messengers carrying them were captured ketchum 1997 p 384 battle thumb right upright general sir henry clinton portrait from 1762 to 1765 thumb left 300px battle of fort montgomery 5 6 october 1777 on foggy morning of october 6 sir henry clinton landed 2 100 men at stony point on west side of hudson and with assistance of a loyalist guide marched them up onto a local rise called after descending other side to a place called doodletown they encountered a scouting party that governor clinton had sent out for reconnaissance which retreated toward fort clinton after a brief exchange of fire sir henry then divided his force into two attack groups to take forts nickerson 1967 pp 346 347 a force of about 900 men under lieutenant colonel campbell composed of 52nd and 57th regiments a detachment of hessian chasseurs and about 400 loyalists led by beverley robinson began trek around gorge toward fort montgomery while sir henry waited with remaining 1 200 men at doodletown before starting on trail to fort clinton in order to give campbell time to make longer journey before beginning simultaneous attacks on two forts governor clinton when alerted to first skirmish had immediately sent to putnam for reinforcements shortly after sending that message he learned from scouts that sir henry s forces were divided while waiting for reinforcements that never came because of sir henry s successful feints his brother james sent 100 men from fort clinton toward doodletown while he sent another company from fort montgomery to oppose campbell s force fort montgomery detachment from fort montgomery numbered about 100 men and included a small artillery piece commanded by captain john lamb setting up a defensive position about one mile 1 6 km from fort they engaged campbell s tired forces with spirit while they were eventually forced to retreat they were able to spike field piece before abandoning it to british after another stand closer to fort supported by 12 pound piece they again retreated again not before spiking cannon due to this dogged defense campbell was not in position until about one hour before sunset having left doodletown at around 10 am offered chance to surrender governor clinton refused and battle was joined thumb left upright general james clinton engraving by h b hall campbell arrayed loyalists on left german

campbell and other officers nickerson 1967 p 349 james clinton narrowly escaped being killed by bayonet when his orderly book deflected weapon s point he and a portion of fort s garrison escaped into woods north of fort nickerson 1967 p 350 fort clinton main approach to fort clinton was via a narrow strip of land about wide between a small lake and river which in addition to being covered by fort s cannons governor clinton had protected by placing abatis to impeded british advance sir henry sent 63rd foot around lake to attack fort from northwest while he first sent light companies of 7th and 26th regiments and a company of anspach grenadiers against main works followed by 26th foot and a detachment from 17th light dragoons and then remaining british and german companies as at fort montgomery defenders were eventually overwhelmed those that surrendered however were not subjected to some of savagery that took place to north a number of garrison including general clinton escaped by scrambling down embankment to river where gunboats took them to safety across river aftermath casualties british casualties were 41 killed and 142 wounded americans had 26 officers and 237 enlisted men captured and about 75 killed and wounded apart from wounded prisoners most of them from garrison of fort clinton carrington 1876 p 359 americans were also forced to destroy a number of boats in area as unfavorable winds prevented them from escaping upriver next day sir henry sent a small detachment to fort constitution a small outpost opposite west point and demanded its surrender lightly manned garrison at first refused but it retreated on october 8 in face of a larger attack force nickerson 1967 p 351 governor clinton and general putnam strategized on their next move clinton opted to move north with troops on western shore as a defense against attacks further upriver while putnam would take steps to defend against attacks to east further british action captain james wallace had begun clearing river of american laid obstacles following battle by october 13 he was able to report that river was clear as far north as esopus nickerson 1967 p 391 sir henry had by then returned to new york due to illness leaving general john vaughan in charge at forts due to delays sending transports with reinforcements north a flotilla carrying vaughan and 1 700 men did not depart until october 15 with orders from clinton to proceed up hudson s river to feel for general burgoyne to assist his operations nickerson 1967 p 392 they anchored that evening near esopus it has been speculated that this movement had an effect on surrender negotiations then ongoing at saratoga due to slow pace of even horse based communications it seems unlikely that general gates was aware of this movement until after surrender terms were agreed on october 17 vaughan s troops burned esopus next day and then sailed further north where they raided livingston estate seat of noted patriot family fleet was pursued by putnam on eastern shore putnam s forces which had grown considerably due to arrival of militia companies from connecticut posed a significant enough threat to vaughan that he then withdrew back to boats thumb right ruins of fort montgomery 2007 on october 17 sir henry received a request for 3 000 men from general howe probably sent after washington s failed attack on germantown to support occupation of philadelphia as new york garrison was already thinned by operation on hudson clinton recalled vaughan and garrison holding two forts forts were destroyed and troops
