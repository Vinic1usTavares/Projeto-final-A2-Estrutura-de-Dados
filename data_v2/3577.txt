77 an important spanish advantage was use of war horses their deployment often terrified native inhabitants of americas who had never seen horses until european contact as important as physical advantage given to a mounted conquistador was ability to rapidly move bodies of troops across a battlefield to outmaneuver their opponents who were exclusively on foot repeated mounted charges could have a devastating impact on massed native infantry wise and mcbride 1980 2008 pp 9 10 spanish also employed fierce war dogs in battle johnson 2009 p 76 pohl and robinson 2005 pp 95 96 restall and

limited use in hot wet tropical climate it was heavy and had to be constantly cleaned to prevent rusting in direct sunlight metal armour became unbearably hot conquistadores often went without metal armour or only donned it immediately prior to battle pohl and hook 2008 p 23 they were quick to adopt quilted cotton armour based upon that used by their native opponents and commonly combined this with use of a simple metal war hat pohl and hook 2008 p 16 26 shields were considered essential by both infantry and cavalry generally this was a circular target shield convex in form and fashioned from iron or wood rings secured it to arm and hand impact of old world diseases diseases introduced to americas by conquistadors had a great impact upon indigenous populations as spanish were occupied

salvador fowler 1993 p 185 by time spanish arrived in area in 1524 it is estimated that up to 50 of native population of el salvador had already been eliminated by new diseases against which they had no immunity it is likely that disease had significantly weakened pipil by time they fielded large armies against spanish at acajutla and tacuzcalco further waves of epidemic diseases spread across

and his trusted lieutenant pedro de alvarado and northward from panama under command of pedrarias davila white 2009 p 32 conquest territory now incorporated into el salvador was not politically unified at time of spanish contact as with neighbouring regions this hindered progress of incorporation into spanish empire as each small kingdom had to be overcome in turn this contrasted with mexico where a large empire had been rapidly overcome with fall of its capital tenochtitlan as spanish authority gradually spread out from mexico and panama this left el salvador in an intermediate region temporarily beyond spanish control spanish colonial towns were founded according to whim of individual conquistadors with no formal planning of their location or of communication routes between them
