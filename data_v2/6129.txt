scored 88 on his first class debut and a century in his next game over following seasons he established himself as a successful county player and in 1908 made his test debut for england scoring 83 in his first innings after some mixed early performances for england hobbs success against south african googly bowlers made his place secure and by 1911 12 when he scored three centuries in test series against australia critics judged him world s best batsman in county cricket he developed an attacking dynamic style of play and was very successful up until 1914 after serving in royal flying corps during first world war he maintained his reputation when cricket resumed in 1919 but his career was threatened by appendicitis which caused him to miss most of 1921 season when he returned he was a more cautious batsman and used a safer style of play subsequently he became more consistent and scored prolifically in both test and domestic cricket until his retirement in this period he played some of his most acclaimed innings hobbs success was based on fast footwork technical ability to play many different shots well and excellent placement of ball among first batsmen to succeed against previously devastating googly bowlers he adapted his technique to meet new styles of bowling that arose early in his career he mixed classical shots with an effective defence he was particularly successful on difficult pitches for batting an opening batsman hobbs established several effective opening partnerships with tom hayward and andy sandham for surrey and with wilfred rhodes and herbert

dissimilar in style arlott p 35 in all first class cricket in 1906 hobbs scored 1 913 runs at an average of 40 70 with a highest score of 162 placing him second in surrey averages wisden praised his

pp 76 77 a condition which afflicted him on sea voyages throughout his life mason p 58 in later tours he travelled overland as far as possible to reduce his time on ships consequently he missed first two games of tour against australian state teams his appearances were further limited by reluctance of mcc captain arthur jones to select him he played in only two of early matches failing on both

professional batsman in england except hayward and tyldesley hobbs began 1909 season with a succession of large scores including a double century in one match and two separate centuries in another mckinstry pp 88 89 such form placed him in contention for a place in england team to play australia that year despite english batting strength but england captain archie maclaren was unconvinced that hobbs possessed required quality surrey captain and england selector h d g leveson gower persuaded committee to include hobbs in squad then convinced a reluctant maclaren to play him in team mckinstry pp 89 91 in first test played at edgbaston hobbs opened batting with maclaren but was dismissed from first ball he received match was a low scoring one and australia set england 105 runs to win hobbs

english players and south african googly bowlers had previously troubled most leading english batsmen mckinstry pp 98 101 provoking debate over how batsmen could combat new delivery mason p 72 mcc captain leveson gower selected wilfred rhodes to open batting with hobbs for first test mckinstry p 102 rhodes a defensively minded batsman who excelled at taking quick singles had begun his career as a bowler who batted down order he steadily improved his batting eventually becoming an opening batsman mckinstry pp 103 05 hobbs and rhodes between 1910 and 1921 opened batting 36 times for england and shared eight century partnerships their average of 61 31 runs per opening partnership remains second highest in test history in other first class cricket they shared a further five century opening partnerships their association was notable for effective running pair developed such an unusually good understanding that they were able to run without calling to each other they scored singles by pushing ball just past nearby fielders and running quickly critics believed that they raised art of running to a new level mckinstry pp 104 05 this tactic developed from first day that hobbs and rhodes batted together in first test they added 159 runs for first wicket mckinstry p 105 arlott p 55 hobbs scored 89 in first innings and 35 in second and while england lost narrowly he appeared much more comfortable than other english batsmen against googly hobbs and rhodes shared a partnership of 207 in tour match following test in which hobbs scored 163 arlott p 56 england also lost second test but hobbs scored 53 and 70 sharing two substantial opening partnerships with rhodes failure of other batsmen defeated by googly bowlers caused consternation in english press mckinstry pp 105 06 as england had few effective pace bowlers on tour hobbs opened bowling in first two tests as well as batting mckinstry p 110 in third test he scored 93 not out to guide england to a three wicket victory mckinstry pp 107 08 however series was lost when england were defeated in fourth match hobbs scored 1 only time in his test career that he failed to reach double figures in either innings and his worst match return in first class cricket mckinstry p 108 in final game of series he scored his first test hundred opening batting and sharing a partnership of 221 with rhodes which was a record at time for first wicket in test matches hobbs scored 187 an innings praised by wisden for its brilliancy mckinstry p 111 in this match he once more opened bowling dismissing reggie schwarz his only test wicket england won match by nine wickets and series finished 3 2 against them hobbs scored 1 124 first class runs at an average of 66 11 on tour while in test matches he scored 539 runs at 67 37 none of other english batsmen came close to matching his success against googly murphy p 41 and by end of series critics were beginning to describe him as world s leading batsman wisden commented beyond everything else from english point of view feature of trip was superb batting of hobbs who easily adapted himself to matting wickets and scored from famous googly bowlers with amazing skill and facility when they came home other members of team could not say too much in his praise fatigue from south african tour affected hobbs in 1910 he scored 1 982 runs at an average of 33 03 lowest average of his career apart from his first season mckinstry p 119 arlott p 58 more effective during 1911 after a long rest during winter hobbs was consistently successful in a hot dry summer which

bowling australia out for 184 and taking a first innings lead of 81 visiting team eventually faced a target of 219 to win hobbs and rhodes restored to opening position began with a partnership of 57 hobbs scored 126 not out his first century against australia and scored particularly well from bowling of h v ranji hordern a googly bowler who had taken 12 wickets in first test mckinstry p 126 wisden commented that hobbs played one of finest innings of his life and england won by eight wickets australia were once more bowled out for a low score in third test this time hobbs and rhodes added 147 for first wicket and hobbs scored 187 england reached a total of 501 and won match by seven wickets mckinstry p 127 having established a lead in series england began fourth test by bowling australia out for 191 at end of first day hobbs and rhodes had scored 54 together and next day they took their partnership for first wicket to 323 setting a new record for highest partnership for any wicket in test matches their partnership remained an overall test record for 22 years and highest for first wicket until 1948 as of 2016 this remains england s highest opening partnership against

in addition he ran out 15 batsmen while fielding at cover point green ed p 356 australians did not dare run when he fielded ball for fear of speed of his throw mckinstry p 132 in all first class matches hobbs scored 943 runs at 55 47 1912 season was unusually wet mckinstry pp 136 37 which resulted in some very difficult pitches for batting mason pp 96 97 wisden remarked that hobbs did not bat particularly well for surrey mason p 99 press criticised him for trying to score too quickly and losing his wicket in process mckinstry p 140 during summer both australia and south africa toured england taking part in triangular tournament hobbs made a slow start to competition when he was bowled in first over in england s opening match and his form was uncertain in early part of season mckinstry p 137 however he scored a century against australia at lord s cricket ground on a very difficult batting pitch in england s second game sharing a partnership of 112 with rhodes he continued with scores of 55 and 68 in next two games against south africa and his batting was praised by press for first time in times he was referred to as a great master mckinstry pp 137 38 south africa were defeated in five of their six games other was drawn as first two games between england and australia were drawn final match was designated as deciding match for tournament mckinstry pp 138 39 hobbs

scores of 82 92 and 97 while he and rhodes shared two century opening partnerships and another of 92 mckinstry p 149 hobbs adopted a cautious approach and wisden noted that he was not quite so

string of centuries including a score of 226 his highest at that time mckinstry pp 151 53 looming first world war overshadowed much of season mckinstry p 153 cricket initially continued once war began

never reached expected heights averaging 36 63 throughout 1915 season mckinstry pp 162 64 168 but his signing provoked an angry exchange of correspondence between yorkshire president lord hawke who

woolley to play in league he continued to play for idle in 1916 mckinstry pp 168 70 and was more successful scoring 790 runs at 52 60 and taking 65 wickets at 6 27 but his conscription after season

successful partnerships this one was based on quick running arlott p 90 sandham even when successful was often overshadowed by his partner on one occasion sandham scored a century but headlines were reserved for hobbs duck sandham usually played subordinate role and hobbs took most of bowling mckinstry pp 181 82 marshall p 108 hobbs made a good start to 1919 season and despite a brief spell of

captained players team for first time towards end of season his form faded owing to lingering effects of his illness and operation previous year wisden observed that he frequently tired during longer innings and often tried to get out soon after reaching three figures mckinstry p 208 this habit of giving up his innings continued throughout remainder of his career season also marked a turning point in his batting approach where he preferred to score more slowly and take fewer risks in contrast to his adventurous pre war tactics mckinstry p 207 second in national batting averages for 1922 he scored 2 552 runs at an average of 62 24 but declined an invitation to tour south africa that winter with mcc less successful during wet 1923 season hobbs failed on many occasions and was unsuccessful

established an opening partnership with yorkshire s herbert sutcliffe pair had opened together briefly in previous seasons and were chosen to open in a test trial early in 1924 beginning a six year

team which toured australia under captaincy of arthur gilligan in 1924 25 lost test series 4 1 but critics thought winning margin flattered host country mckinstry p 227 between them in test matches hobbs and sutcliffe scored seven centuries and shared four opening partnerships which passed 100 runs hobbs began tour well and scored consistently in matches before tests mckinstry p 229 in first

from other batsmen they could have won series in all games hobbs scored 865 first class runs at 54 06 mason p 153 peak of popularity hobbs was particularly successful in 1925 early in season a string

wicket record as of 2016 mckinstry pp 270 71 in drawn second test he and sutcliffe shared an opening stand of 182 hobbs scored 119 but was criticised for slowing down later in his innings leading to

score many runs mckinstry pp 282 84 but hobbs and sutcliffe who had scored 49 on second evening began to bat confidently before effects of a hot sun drying a damp pitch made batting even more

mckinstry pp 305 06 mason p 175 and some critics noticed a decline in his batting a judgement reinforced when he was out to a poorly chosen shot in first innings of third test for 20 australia were able to build up a substantial lead and overnight rain before sixth day of match made them likely winners england needed 332 to win but on a pitch growing more difficult as it dried a total of 100 was considered unlikely mckinstry pp 309 10 hobbs and sutcliffe survived to add 105 for first wicket observers praised their technique against turning ball although australian bowlers were criticised for ineffective tactics mckinstry pp 311 12 mason p 176 hobbs was out for 49 mason p 177 at his suggestion douglas jardine came in to bat next and england reached end of day having lost just one wicket

which toured india and ceylon hobbs was very popular with crowds mckinstry pp 343 44 and scored 593 runs these runs and in particular two centuries he scored were to prove controversial hobbs never believed that matches were or should have been of first class status but statisticians later judged them to be first class mckinstry p 344 wisden never recognised centuries and so records his century

australia in 1932 33 late in 1932 season bill bowes consistently bowled short pitched deliveries against him in a match between surrey and yorkshire bowes was criticised in press and particularly by pelham warner who was to manage mcc team in australia mckinstry pp 348 49 hobbs accompanied team to australia as a journalist writing for news chronicle and star accompanied by his ghostwriter jack ingham during tour hobbs neither condemned bodyline nor fully described english tactics other sports journalists admired hobbs but dismissed his writing as non committal and bland mckinstry pp 349 51 however once tour had finished and he returned to england hobbs openly criticised english tactics in newspaper columns and in a book he wrote about tour mckinstry p 354 in 1933 playing less frequently he scored 1 105 runs at 61 38 aged 50 after missing first games with illness he scored 221 against touring west indian team to acclaim of press mckinstry p 355 he did not play every game and surrey committee happily allowed him to choose which matches to play more centuries followed later that season which took him to 196 in his career fuelling anticipation that he would reach 200 centuries mckinstry pp 355 56 that winter he accompanied mcc team in india as a journalist mckinstry p 357 before next season surrey installed new decorative gates at main entrance to oval which were named after hobbs in his honour mckinstry pp 357 58 in 1934 he scored 624 runs at 36 70 after a solid start he scored his final first class century against lancashire after this he played irregularly and his batting began to appear visibly uncomfortable hobbs realised his career was over in february 1935 he announced his retirement mckinstry pp 360 63 there were many tributes and a public dinner was held in his honour which was attended by many leading figures in cricket mckinstry pp 364 65 in all first class cricket hobbs scored 61 760 runs at an average of 50 70 according to espncricinfo later in 1935 hobbs was made an honorary life member of surrey style and technique for much of hobbs career critics judged him to be best batsman in world e w swanton described him in 1963 as a supreme master of his craft and undisputed head of his profession swanton p 117 neville cardus said that hobbs was first batsman to develop a technique to succeed consistently against googly bowlers and that he mastered all types of bowling all over world and in a variety of conditions other critics have suggested that hobbs moved focus of batting from aesthetic off side shots to leg side play more suited to swing and googly bowling swanton wrote that hobbs combined classical play with effective defence including protecting wickets using his pads against ball unexpectedly moving towards stumps swanton p 119 his pad play was controversial it removed any possibility of dismissal but was regarded by some cricket authorities as negative and unsporting mckinstry pp 286 97 many of his english contemporaries rated hobbs superior to donald bradman often regarded as greatest batsman in history of cricket on difficult pitches mckinstry pp 43 44 in difficult batting conditions hobbs batted with great success and several of his most highly regarded innings came in such circumstances murphy suggests before bradman he was most consistent run getter of all time yet no one worried less about sheer slog of carving out big scores murphy p 42 hobbs frequently was out deliberately soon after reaching a century roughly a quarter of his centuries were scores less than 110 and was not particularly interested in most statistics murphy p 38 an article in wisden in 2000 stated he was never as dominant as bradman he never wanted to be but his contemporaries were in awe of his ability to play supremely and at whim whatever conditions thumb left upright hobbs grip hobbs technique was based on strong forearms and good foot movement r c robertson glasgow suggested that his footwork was as near as is humanly possible perfect in every stroke he moved into line with ball with so little effort that he could bat for hours without over taxing energy of mind or body robertson glasgow p 10 he played every type of shot he did not have a signature shot like other batsmen but selected his strokes effectively robertson glasgow pp 10 11 according to alec kennedy who bowled to hobbs it seemed that he could predict what bowler would do in contrast to many leading batsmen from his time hobbs preferred to play off back foot as he believed it gave him more time to see ball and adapt his shot mckinstry p 116 capable of playing all strokes he hit ball precisely between fielders and sometimes delayed his shot to make ball travel more slowly and allow more time to run he also ran well between wickets he liked to score his first run quickly when he came into bat and he often looked to score quickly at start of an innings before bowlers had settled on occasion hobbs targeted main bowling threats from opposition in an attempt to neutralise them murphy pp 42 43 early in his career mainly before first world war hobbs was an aggressive fast scoring batsman who played many shots after war he was more circumspect and adapted his technique to account for both his increased age and increased pressure and expectation from public and teammates he concentrated to a greater extent on batting for longer periods many critics including hobbs himself recognised change and suggested that he was a better batsman before 1914 however commentators also noted that he displayed greater certainty and control in this later period arlott pp 74 75 mckinstry pp 118 19 cardus wrote that he scored his centuries effortlessly now we hardly noted making of them this was period in which he became known as master murphy p 39 and he was more consistent than before war this was time when public regarded him with most respect and affection 98 of his centuries and 26 411 of his runs at an average of 58 62 in first class cricket were scored after he reached age of 40 hobbs was an occasional medium paced bowler who bowled a good length and made ball swing some critics judged him to be a potentially good bowler but both surrey and england were reluctant for him to bowl regularly fearing it would affect his batting mckinstry pp 110 11 as a fielder hobbs improved greatly from his early days he fielded in covers and was expert in cutting off potential runs and returning ball quickly to wicket keeper contemporaries believed him to be one of best cover fielders there had been and remarked on his powers of anticipation in getting to ball they also noted he sometimes deceived batsmen with his casual attitude and occasional deliberate mis fields these would be followed by very sharp fielding which often produced a run out mckinstry pp 131 32 although a professional captains at time were almost exclusively amateurs respect in which hobbs was held meant that he was accepted as a captain many but not all critics considered him a competent tactician and leader he regularly led players team against gentlemen and sometimes at surrey in absence of percy fender but he was a reluctant captain he disliked responsibility and decision making of leadership and rarely even offered tactical advice mckinstry pp 178 79 276 77 reputation and legacy hobbs was twice selected as wisden s cricketer of year in 1909 and 1926 only he and pelham warner have received this award twice in 1963 neville cardus chose him as one of best six cricketers of previous 100 years to mark wisden s centenary more recently hobbs was selected by a panel of experts in 2000 as one of five wisden cricketers of 20th century in 2009 he was selected by cricket historians and writers as a member of england s all time best team and included in a similar team to represent best players worldwide in history of cricket hobbs test batting average of 56 94 remained as of 2016 sixth best among batsmen to have passed 5 000 runs despite a rise in number of batsmen who average more than 50 since 2000 among openers who have scored 5 000 test runs he has third best average behind sutcliffe and len hutton he was comfortably leading test run scorer during his career and had highest number of test runs at time of his retirement between 1910 and 1929 he averaged 65 55 in test cricket gideon haigh suggests that hobbs was a spontaneous and original trend setting batsman who was not afraid to depart from orthodoxy gerald howat notes that aside from his batting achievements hobbs s biographers and obituarists could strike no discordant note he was a man of moral probity religious conviction and personal commitment and he was humble enough to see himself as an ordinary person blessed with one extraordinary talent which he put into its proper perspective it was an attitude of mind which tempered sternness of his approach with an engaging humour and a delight in playing practical jokes among his contemporaries hobbs was regarded as modest and kind and never criticised other players he avoided confrontation although he was quietly determined according to wisden and tried to avoid publicity according to fender hobbs gave stature to profession of cricket marshall p 34 modern critics have expressed some reservations some have pointed out that his batting average although high has been surpassed by others and that among his many centuries few were as large as other players managed however others contend that his impact on game his achievement in showing that professionals could bat as freely and stylishly as amateurs and his kindness place him among top cricketers of all time wisden described him in 2000 more than anyone else he lifted status and dignity of english professional cricketer in summing up his place in history it said he was not an artist like some of his predecessors nor yet a scientist like some of moderns he was perhaps supreme craftsman to mark 150 years of cricketers almanack wisden named him in an all time test world xi personal life thumb upright 1 2 hobbs wife and son in 1925 family life in 1900 hobbs met ada ellen gates a cobbler s daughter at an evening church service held in st matthew s cambridge progress of their relationship was slowed by hobbs shyness and devotion to cricket but pair eventually married on 26 september 1906 at church in which they met they planned to keep event quiet but it was reported in press and couple received gifts and messages from hobbs surrey team mates mckinstry pp 66 67 hobbs so disliked being separated from his wife during cricket tours that in later years she often accompanied team overseas they had four children jack born in 1907 leonard in 1909 vera in 1913 and ivor in 1914 mckinstry pp 68 69 hobbs and his wife lived in rented property for first years of their marriage his earnings placed them roughly in bracket of lower middle class according to mckinstry although considerably more prosperous than he had been during his childhood family were not initially financially comfortable mckinstry p 69 hobbs wages increased as his reputation grew so that by 1913 he was earning ps375 annually equivalent to about ps32 000 in 2018 placing his family within bracket of london middle class after several years of moving from one property to another he was able to buy his own house in 1913 in clapham common then a comfortable and prosperous area of london mckinstry p 142 by middle of 1920s cricket in england was extremely popular and best players were nationally famous hobbs was biggest cricket star of them all and a combination of his cricket earnings estimated to be around ps780 each year income from his sporting goods business product endorsement he was one of first cricketers to benefit from lending his name to commercial products and ghostwritten books and articles made him comparatively wealthy according to mckinstry his annual earnings probably reached ps1 500 a year by 1925 more than an experienced doctor could earn at time consequently in 1928 family moved to a large house in private grounds and hobbs was able to send his children to private schools mckinstry pp 240 45 he had achieved greater financial independence than most contemporary cricketers but was always first concerned to give his wife and children security lacking from his own childhood retirement and final years following his retirement from cricket in 1934 hobbs continued to work as a journalist first with jack ingham then with jimmy bolton as his ghostwriters he accompanied mcc team to australia in 1936 37 and published four books which sold well in 1930s in addition he produced two ghostwritten autobiographies but generally avoided self publicity or
