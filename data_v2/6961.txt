stegosaurus from greek stegos stegos which means roof and sauros sauros which means lizard is a genus of herbivorous thyreophoran dinosaur fossils of this genus date to late jurassic period where they are found in kimmeridgian to early tithonian aged strata between 155 and 150 million years ago in western united states and portugal of species that have been classified in upper morrison formation of western us only three are universally recognized s stenops s ungulatus and s sulcatus remains of over 80 individual animals of this genus have been found stegosaurus would have lived alongside dinosaurs such as apatosaurus diplodocus brachiosaurus allosaurus and ceratosaurus latter two may have been predators of it these were large heavily built herbivorous quadrupeds with rounded backs short fore limbs long hind limbs and tails held high in air due to their distinctive combination of broad upright plates and tail tipped with spikes stegosaurus is one of most recognizable kinds of dinosaurs function of this array of plates and spikes has been subject of much speculation among scientists today it is generally agreed that their spiked tails were most likely used for defense against predators while their plates may have been used primarily for display and secondarily for thermoregulatory functions stegosaurus had a relatively low brain to body mass ratio it had a short neck and a small head meaning it most likely ate low lying bushes and shrubs one species stegosaurus ungulatus is largest known of all stegosaurians bigger than related dinosaurs such as kentrosaurus and huayangosaurus stegosaurus remains were first identified during bone wars by othniel charles marsh first known skeletons were fragmentary and bones were scattered and it would be many years before true appearance of these animals including their posture and plate arrangement became well understood despite its popularity in books and film mounted skeletons of stegosaurus did not become a staple of major natural history museums until mid 20th century and many museums have had to assemble composite displays from several different specimens due to a lack of complete skeletons stegosaurus is one of best known dinosaurs and has been featured in film postal stamps and many other types of media description thumb left 201px size of s ungulatus orange and s stenops green compared to a human

appendix and in weight various species of stegosaurus were dwarfed by contemporaries giant sauropods some form of armor appears to have been necessary as stegosaurus species coexisted with large predatory theropod dinosaurs such as allosaurus and ceratosaurus most of information known about stegosaurus comes from remains of mature animals more recently though juvenile remains of stegosaurus

museum of utah long and narrow skull was small in proportion to body it had a small antorbital fenestra hole between nose and eye common to most archosaurs including modern birds though lost in extant crocodylians skull s low position suggests that stegosaurus may have been a browser of low growing vegetation this interpretation is supported by absence of front teeth and their likely replacement by a horny beak or rhamphotheca lower jaw had flat downward and upward extensions that would have completely hidden teeth when viewed from side and these probably supported a turtle like beak in life presence of a beak extended along much of jaws may have precluded presence of cheeks in these species such an extensive beak was probably unique to stegosaurus and some other advanced stegosaurids

other ornithischians which might have supported fleshy cheeks rather than beaks stegosaurian teeth were small triangular and flat wear facets show that they did grind their food despite animal s overall size braincase of stegosaurus was small being no larger than that of a dog a well preserved stegosaurus braincase allowed othniel charles marsh to obtain in 1880s a cast of brain cavity or endocast of animal which gave an indication of brain size endocast showed brain was indeed very small smallest proportionally of all dinosaur endocasts then known fact that an animal weighing over 4 5 metric tons 5 short tons could have a brain of no more than contributed to popular old idea that all dinosaurs were unintelligent an idea now largely rejected actual brain anatomy in stegosaurus is poorly known but brain itself was small even for a dinosaur fitting well with a slow herbivorous lifestyle and limited behavioral complexity skeleton thumb mounted composite skeleton referred to s ungulatus carnegie museum of natural history in stegosaurus stenops there are 27 bones in vertebral column anterior to sacrum a varying number of vertebrae in sacrum with four in most subadults and around 46 caudal tail vertebrae are divided into cervical neck and dorsal back vertebrae with around 10 cervicals and 17 dorsals total number being one greater than in hesperosaurus two greater than huayangosaurus although preserves 17 cervicals and an unknown number of dorsals first cervical vertebra is axis bone which is connected and often fused to atlas bone farther posteriorly proportionately larger cervicals become although they do not change greatly in anything other than size past first few dorsals centrum of bones become more elongate front to back and transverse processes become more elevated dorsal sacrum of s stenops includes four sacral vertebrae but one of dorsals is also incorporated into structure in some specimens of s stenops a caudal is also incorporated as a in hesperosaurus there are two dorsosacrals and only four fused sacrals but in kentrosaurus there may be as many as seven vertebrae in sacrum with both dorsosacrals and s stenops preserves 46 caudal vertebrae and up to 49 and along series both and neural spines become smaller until neural spines disappear at caudal 35 around middle of tail neural spines become bifurcated meaning they are divided near top with multiple well preserved skeletons s stenops preserves all regions of body including limbs scapula shoulder blade is sub rectangular with a robust blade though it is not always perfectly preserved acromion ridge is slightly larger than in kentrosaurus blade is relatively straight although it curves towards back there is a small bump on back of blade that would

pp all four limbs were supported by pads behind toes fore limbs were much shorter than stocky hind limbs which resulted in an unusual posture tail appears to have been held well clear of ground while head of stegosaurus was positioned relatively low down probably no higher than above ground plates thumb 201px right life restoration of s stenops based on sophie specimen most recognizable features of stegosaurus are its dermal plates which consisted of between 17 and 22 separate plates and flat spines these were highly modified osteoderms bony cored scales similar to those seen in crocodiles and many lizards today they were not directly attached to animal s skeleton instead arising from skin largest plates were found over hips and could measure over wide and tall in a 2010 review of stegosaurus species peter galton suggested that arrangement of plates on back may have varied between species and that pattern of plates as viewed in profile may have been important for species recognition galton noted that plates in s stenops have been found articulated in two staggered rows rather than paired fewer s ungulatus plates have been found and none articulated making arrangement in this species more difficult to determine however type specimen of s ungulatus preserves two flattened spine like plates from tail that are nearly identical in shape and size but are mirror images of each other suggesting that at least these were arranged in pairs many of plates are manifestly chiral and no two plates of same size and shape have been found for an individual however plates have been correlated between individuals well preserved integumentary impressions of plates of hesperosaurus show a smooth surface with long and parallel shallow grooves this indicates that plates were covered in keratinous sheaths discovery and history stegosaurus one of many dinosaurs first collected and described in bone wars was originally named by othniel charles marsh in 1877 from remains recovered north of morrison colorado these first bones became holotype of stegosaurus armatus marsh initially believed remains were from an aquatic turtle like animal and basis for its scientific name roof ed lizard was due to his early belief that plates lay flat over animal s back overlapping like shingles tiles on a roof a wealth of stegosaurus material was recovered over next few years and marsh published several papers on genus from 1877 to 1897 in 1878 edward drinker cope named hypsirhophus as another stegosaurian based on fragmentary fossils specimens from cope s quarry 3 near cope s nipple site in garden park colorado many later researchers have considered hypsirhophus to be a synonym of stegosaurus though peter galton 2010 suggested that it is distinct based on differences in vertebrae thumb left type specimen of s stenops on display at national museum of natural history marsh named a second species stegosaurus ungulatus in 1879 and finally gave a more detailed description of all stegosaurus fossils collected to far following year in 1881 he named a third species stegosaurus affinis based only on a hip bone this species is generally agreed to have been inadequately described and therefore is a nomen nudum a name lacking a formal description specimen was later lost marsh continued to collect and examine new stegosaurus specimens and in 1887 he named three new species stegosaurus stenops s duplex and s sulcatus though it had not yet been completely prepared nearly complete and articulated type specimen of stegosaurus stenops allowed marsh to complete first attempt at a reconstructed stegosaurus skeleton this first reconstruction of s ungulatus with missing parts filled in from s stenops was published by marsh in 1891 in 1893 richard lydekker mistakenly re published marsh s drawing under label hypsirhophus thumb marsh s 1891 illustration of s ungulatus note single row of 12 large rounded plates based on those of s stenops and eight spikes next species of stegosaurus to be named was s marshi by frederick lucas in 1901 lucas reclassified this species in new genus hoplitosaurus later that year lucas also re examined issue of life appearance of stegosaurus coming to conclusion that plates were arranged in pairs in two rows along back arranged above bases of ribs lucas commissioned charles r knight to produce a life restoration of s ungulatus based on his new interpretation however following year lucas wrote that he now believed plates were probably attached in staggered rows in 1910 richard swann lull wrote that alternating pattern seen in s stenops was probably due to shifting of skeleton after death he led construction of first ever stegosaurus skeletal mount at peabody museum of natural history which was depicted with paired plates in 1914 charles gilmore argued against lull s interpretation noting that several specimens of s stenops including now completely prepared holotype preserved plates in alternating rows near peak of back and that there was no evidence of plates having shifted relative to body during fossilization gilmore and lucas interpretation became generally accepted standard and lull s mount at peabody museum was changed to reflect this in 1924 sophie stegosaurus is most complete fossil specimen of a stegosaurus it is a young adult of undetermined sex long and tall specimen which was found in wyoming is 85 intact containing 360 bones it was put on display at natural history museum london in december 2014 plate arrangement one of major subjects of books and articles about stegosaurus is plate arrangement argument has been a major one in history of dinosaur reconstruction four possible plate arrangements have been proposed over years thumb right 1901 life restoration of s ungulatus by charles r knight with paired dorsal plates and eight tail spikes plates lie flat along back as a shingle like armor this was marsh s initial interpretation which led to name roof lizard as further and complete plates were found their form showed they stood on edge rather than lying flat by 1891 marsh published a more familiar view of stegosaurus with a single row of plates this was dropped fairly early on apparently because it was poorly understood how plates were embedded in skin and they were thought to overlap too much in this arrangement it was revived in somewhat modified form in 1980s by stephen czerkas based on arrangement of iguana dorsal spines plates were paired in a double row along back such as in knight s 1901 reconstruction and 1933 film king kong two rows of alternating plates by early 1960s this had become and remains prevalent idea mainly because some s stenops fossils in which plates are still partially articulated show this arrangement this arrangement is chiral and so demands that a specimen be distinguished from its distinct hypothetical mirror image form species many of species initially described have since been considered to be invalid or synonymous with earlier named species leaving two well known and one poorly known species confirmed stegosaurus remains have been found in morrison formation s stratigraphic zones 2 6 with additional remains possibly referrable to stegosaurus recovered from stratigraphic zone 1 stegosaurus ungulatus meaning hoofed roof lizard was named by marsh in 1879 from remains recovered at como bluff wyoming quarry 12 near robber s roost it might be synonymous with s stenops at it was longest species within genus stegosaurus a fragmentary stegosaurus specimen discovered in portugal and dating from upper kimmeridgian lower tithonian stage has been tentatively assigned to this species stegosaurus ungulatus can be distinguished from s stenops by presence of longer hind limbs proportionately smaller more pointed plates with wide bases and narrow tips and by several small flat spine like plates just before spikes on tail these spine like plates appear to have been paired due to presence of at least one pair that are identical but mirrored s ungulatus also appears to have had longer legs femora and hip bones than other species type specimen of s ungulatus was discovered with eight spikes though they were scattered away from their original positions these have often been interpreted as indicating that animal had four pairs of tail spikes no specimens have been found with complete or articulated sets of tail spikes but no additional specimens have been found that preserve eight spikes together it is possible extra pair of spikes came from a different individual and though no other extra bones were found with specimen these may be found if more digging were done at original site specimens from other quarries such as a tail from quarry 13 now forming part of composite skeleton amnh 650 at

stegosaurus stenops meaning narrow faced roof lizard was named by marsh in 1887 with holotype having been collected by marshall felch at garden park north of canon city colorado in 1886 this is best known species of stegosaurus mainly because its remains include at least one complete articulated skeleton it had proportionately large broad plates and rounded tail plates articulated specimens show that plates were arranged alternating in a staggered double row s stenops is known from at least 50 partial skeletons of adults and juveniles one complete skull and four partial skulls it was shorter than other species at found in morrison formation colorado wyoming and utah stegosaurus sulcatus meaning furrowed roof lizard was described by marsh in 1887 based on a partial skeleton it has traditionally been considered a synonym of s armatus though more recent studies suggest it is not s sulcatus is distinguished mainly by its unusually large furrowed spikes with very large bases a spike associated with type specimen originally thought to be a tail spike may in fact come from shoulder or hip since its base is much larger than corresponding tail vertebrae a review published by maidment and colleagues in 2008 regarded it as an indeterminate species possibly not even belonging to stegosaurus at all but to a different genus peter galton suggested it should be considered a valid species due to its unique spikes susannah maidment and colleagues in 2008 proposed extensive alterations to taxonomy of stegosaurus they advocated synonymizing s stenops and s ungulatus with s armatus and sinking hesperosaurus and wuerhosaurus into stegosaurus with their type species becoming stegosaurus mjosi and stegosaurus homheni respectively they regarded s longispinus as dubious thus their conception of stegosaurus would include three valid species s armatus s homheni and s mjosi and would range from late jurassic of north america and europe to early cretaceous of asia however this classification scheme was not followed by other researchers and a 2017 cladistic analysis co authored by maidment with thomas raven rejects synonymy of hesperosaurus with stegosaurus in 2015 maidment et al revised their suggestion due to recognition by galton of s armatus as a nomen dubium and its replacement by s stenops as type species doubtful species and junior synonyms stegosaurus armatus meaning armored roof lizard was first species to be found and original type species named by o c marsh in 1877 it is known from a partial skeletons and more than 30 fragmentary specimens have been referred to it however type specimen was very fragmentary consisting only of a partial tail hips and leg parts of some back vertebrae and a single fragmentary plate presence of which was used to give animal its name no other plates or spikes were found and entire front half of animal appears not to have been preserved because type specimen is very fragmentary it is extremely difficult to compare it with other species based on better specimens and it is now generally considered to be a nomen dubium because of this it was replaced by s stenops as type species of stegosaurus in a ruling of iczn in 2013 stegosaurus affinis named by marsh in 1881 is only known from a pubis which has since been lost because marsh did not provide an adequate description of bone with which to distinguish a new species this name is considered a nomen nudum laticeps was described by marsh in 1881 from some jawbone fragments bakker resurrected d laticeps in 1986 as a senior synonym of s stenops although others note that material is not diagnostic and is only referable to stegosaurus sp making it a nomen dubium stegosaurus duplex meaning two plexus roof lizard in allusion to greatly enlarged neural canal of sacrum which marsh characterized as a posterior brain case was named by marsh in 1887 including holotype specimen disarticulated bones were actually collected in 1879 by edward ashley at como bluff marsh initially distinguished it from s ungulatus based on fact that each sacral hip vertebra bore its own rib which he claimed was unlike anatomy of s ungulatus however sacrum of s ungulatus had not actually been discovered marsh also suggested that s duplex may have lacked armor since no plates or spikes were found with specimen though a single spike may actually have been present nearby and re examination of site maps has shown that entire specimen was found highly disarticulated and scattered it is generally considered a synonym of s ungulatus today and parts of specimen were actually incorporated into peabody museum s ungulatus skeletal mount in 1910 reassigned species stegosaurus marshi which was described by lucas in 1901 was renamed hoplitosaurus in 1902 stegosaurus priscus described by nopcsa in 1911 was reassigned to lexovisaurus and is now type species of stegosaurus longispinus was named by charles w gilmore it is now type species of genus alcovasaurus stegosaurus madagascariensis from madagascar is known solely from teeth and was described by piveteau in 1926 teeth were variously attributed to a stegosaur theropod majungasaurus galton pm 1981

is type genus that gives its name to family stegosauridae are one of two families within infraorder stegosauria with other being huayangosauridae infraorder stegosauria lies within thyreophora or armored dinosaurs a suborder which also includes more diverse ankylosaurs stegosaurs were a clade of animals similar in appearance posture and shape that mainly differed in their array of spikes and plates among closest relatives to stegosaurus are wuerhosaurus from china and kentrosaurus from east africa following cladogram shows position of stegosaurus within stegosauridae according to mateus 2009 origin origin of stegosaurus is uncertain as few remains of basal stegosaurs and their ancestors are known recently stegosaurids have been shown to be present in lower morrison formation existing several million years before occurrence of stegosaurus itself with discovery of related hesperosaurus from early kimmeridgian earliest stegosaurid genus lexovisaurus is known from oxford clay formation of england and france giving it an age of early to middle callovian earlier and more basal genus huayangosaurus from middle jurassic of china some 165 million years ago mya stegosaurus by 20 million years and is only genus in family huayangosauridae earlier still is scelidosaurus from early jurassic england which lived about 190 mya it possessed features of both stegosaurs and ankylosaurs emausaurus from germany was another small quadruped while scutellosaurus from arizona was an even earlier genus and was facultatively bipedal these small lightly armored dinosaurs were closely related to direct ancestor of both stegosaurs and ankylosaurs a trackway of a possible early armored dinosaur from around 195 mya has been found in france paleobiology upright thumb adult and juvenile s stenops mounted as if under attack from an allosaurus fragilis denver museum of nature and science soon after its discovery marsh considered stegosaurus to have been bipedal due to its short forelimbs he had changed his mind however by 1891 after considering heavy build of animal although stegosaurus is undoubtedly now considered to have been quadrupedal some discussion has occurred over whether it could have reared up on its hind legs using its tail to form a tripod with its hind limbs to browse for higher foliage this has been proposed by bakker and opposed by carpenter a study by mallison 2010 found support a rearing up posture in kentrosaurus though not for ability for tail to act as a tripod stegosaurus had short fore limbs in relation to its hind legs furthermore within hind limbs lower section comprising tibia and fibula was short compared with femur this suggests it could not walk very fast as stride of back legs at speed would have overtaken front legs giving a maximum speed of tracks discovered by matthew morrison natural history museum colorado suggest that stegosaurus lived in multiple age herds one group of tracks is interpreted as showing four or five baby stegosaurs moving in same direction while another has a juvenile stegosaur track with an adult track overprinting it plate function upright thumb left back plate cast museum of rockies function of stegosaurus plates has been much debated marsh suggested that they functioned as some form of armor though 1961 disputed this claiming that they were too fragile and ill placed for defensive purposes leaving animal s sides unprotected nevertheless others have continued to support a defensive function bakker suggested in 1986 that plates were covered in horn comparing surface of fossilized plates to bony cores of horns in other animals known or thought to bear horns christiansen and tschopp 2010 having studied a well preserved specimen of hesperosaurus with skin impressions concluded that plates were covered in a keratin sheath which would have strengthened plate as a whole and provided it with sharp cutting edges bakker stated that stegosaurus could flip its osteoderms from one side to another to present a predator with an array of spikes and blades that would impede it from closing sufficiently to attack stegosaurus effectively he contends that they had insufficient width for them to stand erect easily in such a manner as to be useful in display without continuous muscular effort mobility of plates however has been disputed by other paleontologists another possible function of plates is they may have helped to control body temperature of animal in a similar way to sails of pelycosaurs dimetrodon and edaphosaurus and modern elephant and rabbit ears plates had blood vessels running through grooves and air flowing around plates would have cooled blood et al 1986 found extreme vascularization of outer layer of bone which was seen has evidence that plates acted as thermoregulatory devices likewise 2010 structural comparisons of stegosaurus plates to alligator osteoderms seem to support conclusion that potential for a thermoregulatory role in plates of stegosaurus definitely exists thumb plates of stegosaurus specimen sophie thermoregulation hypothesis has been seriously questioned since other stegosaurs such as kentrosaurus had more low surface area spikes than plates implying that cooling was not important enough to require specialized structural formations such as plates however it has also been suggested that plates could have helped animal increase heat absorption from sun since a cooling trend occurred towards end of jurassic a large ectothermic reptile might have used increased surface area afforded by plates to absorb radiation from sun christiansen and tschopp 2010 state that presence of a smooth insulating keratin covering would have hampered thermoregulation but such a function cannot be entirely ruled out as extant cattle and ducks use horns and beaks to dump excess heat despite keratin covering histological surveys of plate microstructure attributed vascularization to need to transport nutrients for rapid plate growth vascular system of plates have been theorized to have played a role in threat displaying as stegosaurus could have pumped blood into them causing them to blush and give a colorful red warning however christiansen and tschopp 2010 consider this unlikely as stegosaur plates were covered in horn rather than skin plates large size suggests that they may have served to increase apparent height of animal either to intimidate enemies or to impress other members of same species in some form of sexual display a 2015 study of shapes and sizes of hesperosaurus plates suggested that they were sexually dimorphic with wide plates belonging to males and taller plates belonging to females christiansen and tschopp 2010 proposed that display function would have been reinforced by horny sheath which would have increased visible surface and such horn structures are often brightly colored some have suggested that plates in stegosaurs were used to allow individuals to identify members of their species use of exaggerated structures in dinosaurs as species identification has been questioned as no such function exists in modern species thagomizer tail spikes thumb right thagomizer on mounted tail debate has been going on about whether tail spikes were used for display only as posited by gilmore in 1914 or used as a weapon robert bakker noted tail was likely to have been much more flexible than that of other dinosaurs as it lacked ossified tendons thus lending credence to idea of tail as a weapon however as carpenter has noted plates overlap so many tail vertebrae movement would be limited bakker also observed that stegosaurus could have maneuvered its rear easily by keeping its large hind limbs stationary and pushing off with its very powerfully muscled but short forelimbs allowing it to swivel deftly to deal with attack more recently a study of tail spikes by et al which showed a high incidence of trauma related damage lends more weight to position that spikes were indeed used in combat this study showed that 9 8 of stegosaurus specimens examined had injuries to their tail spikes additional support for this idea was a punctured tail vertebra of an allosaurus into which a tail spike fits perfectly s stenops had four dermal spikes each about long discoveries of articulated stegosaur armor show at least in some species these spikes protruded horizontally from tail not vertically as is often depicted initially marsh described s ungulatus as having eight spikes in its tail unlike s stenops however recent research re examined this and concluded this species also had four second brain thumb brain cavity of s stenops marked with red at one time stegosaurs were described as having a second brain in their hips soon after describing stegosaurus marsh noted a large canal in hip region of spinal cord which could have accommodated a structure up to 20 times larger than famously small brain this has led to influential idea that dinosaurs like stegosaurus had a second brain in tail which may have been responsible for controlling reflexes in rear portion of body this brain was proposed to have given a stegosaurus a temporary boost when it was under threat from predators this space however is more likely to have served other purposes sacro lumbar expansion is not unique to stegosaurs nor even sauropods it is also present in birds in their case it contains what is called glycogen body a structure whose function is not definitely known but which is postulated to facilitate supply of glycogen to animal s nervous system it also may function as a balance organ or reservoir of compounds to support nervous system growth juveniles of stegosaurus have been preserved probably showing growth of genus two juveniles are both relatively small with smaller individual being long and larger having a length of specimens can be identified as not mature because they lack fusion of scapula and coracoid and lower hind limbs also pelvic region of specimens are similar to kentrosaurus juveniles one 2009 study of stegosaurus specimens of various sizes found that plates and spikes had delayed histological growth in comparison to skeleton and when dinosaur reached maturity growth in osteoderms may have greatly outpaced that of skeleton a 2013 study concluded based on rapid deposition of highly vascularised fibrolamellar bone that kentrosaurus had a quicker growth rate than stegosaurus contradicting general rule that larger dinosaurs grew faster than smaller ones diet stegosaurus and related genera were herbivores however their teeth and jaws are very different from those of other herbivorous ornithischian dinosaurs suggesting a different feeding strategy that is not yet well understood other ornithischians possessed teeth capable of grinding plant material and a jaw structure capable of movements in planes other than simply orthal i e not only fused up down motion to which stegosaur jaws were likely limited unlike sturdy jaws and grinding teeth common to its fellow ornithischians stegosaurus and all stegosaurians had small peg shaped teeth that have been observed with horizontal wear facets associated with tooth food contact and their unusual jaws were probably capable of only orthal up down movements their teeth were not tightly pressed together in a block for efficient grinding and no evidence in fossil record of stegosaurians indicates use of gastroliths stone s some dinosaurs and some present day bird species ingested to aid grinding process so how exactly stegosaurus obtained and processed amount of plant material required to sustain its size remains poorly understood thumb left tooth crown illustration stegosaurians were widely distributed geographically in late jurassic palaeontologists believe it would have eaten plants such as mosses ferns horsetails cycads and conifers or fruits stegosaurus ungulatus carnegie museum of natural history retrieved 26 october 2006 grazing on grasses seen in many modern mammalian herbivores would not have been possible for stegosaurus as grasses did not evolve until late into cretaceous period long after stegosaurus had become extinct one hypothesized feeding behavior strategy considers them to be low level browsers eating low growing fruit of various plants as well as foliage this scenario has stegosaurus foraging at most 1 m above ground conversely if stegosaurus could have raised itself on two legs as suggested by bakker then it could have browsed on vegetation and fruits quite high up with adults being able to forage up to above ground a detailed computer analysis of biomechanics of stegosaurus s feeding behavior was performed in 2010 using two different three dimensional models of stegosaurus teeth given realistic physics and properties bite force was also calculated using these models and known skull proportions of animal as well as simulated tree branches of different size and hardness resultant bite forces calculated for stegosaurus were 140 1 newtons n 183 7 n and 275 n for anterior middle and posterior teeth respectively which means its bite force was less than half that of a labrador retriever stegosaurus could have easily bitten through smaller green branches but would have had difficulty with anything over 12 mm in diameter stegosaurus therefore probably browsed primarily among smaller twigs and foliage and would have been unable to handle larger plant parts unless animal was capable of biting much more efficiently than predicted in this study however a study published on may 20 2016 by stephen et al indicates stegosaurus bite strength was stronger than previously believed comparisons were made between it represented by a specimen known as sophie from united kingdom s natural history museum and two other herbivorous dinosaurs and plateosaurus to determine if all three had similar bite forces and similar niches based on results of study it was revealed that stegosaurus had a bite similar in strength to that of modern herbivorous mammals in particular cattle and sheep based on this data it is likely stegosaurus also ate tougher plants such as cycads perhaps even acting as a means of spreading cycad seeds findings were published in journal scientific reports paleoecology thumb footprints of an adult and juvenile from morrison formation morrison
