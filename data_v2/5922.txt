know how many times i spun out and didn t spin out amazing race it was fun to drive when i wasn t getting turned around and stab and steer stab and steer that s what you do and some brakes there are brakes involved too i thought i was clear and i tried going down slowly and jimmie just must have been there a little bit turned me sideways and got me on apron scared everybody half to death including me stewart who finished second said i actually had fun racing at daytona again which i haven t had for a while i don t know what consensus is from everybody else but i had more fun as a driver tonight than what we ve had in past ambrose who finished third in race explained it s definitely a lot more fun more entertaining for fans and more in control for drivers according to ragan who was involved in race s largest accident everybody was real racy and i just got into back of menard you get a good run and you re pushing a little bit and i guess he was pushing whoever was in front of him and when you ve got meat in between sandwich you usually get wrecked harvick blamed accident on drivers who had little experience of pack racing biggest problem is tandem racing has been so easy for these guys to stay attached that some of them haven t raced in pack racing it s going to take a lot more patience from a lot of guys who haven t done this before nevertheless menard thought that pack style of racing would be a good combination for daytona 500 and believed it would be chaotic and exciting four days after race nascar announced that pressure relief values in engine would be
