album its songs are accompanied by non linear short films that illustrate musical concepts conceived during production its dark intimate subject material includes feminist themes of sex monogamous love and relationship issues inspired by beyonce s desire to assert her full creative freedom beyonce s album impacted music industry changing release date for music from monday to friday album s initial recording began in new york city where beyonce invited producers and songwriters to live with her for a month during extensive touring following year album changed as she conceived of creating a visual accompaniment to its songs and resumed recording sessions with electronic producer and rock musician boots their collaboration led to more sonically experimental material which combined contemporary r b with electronic and soul music throughout this period album s songs and videos were composed in strict secrecy as beyonce devised an unexpected release beyonce was released digitally on itunes store without prior announcement or promotion and debuted at number one on us billboard 200 earning beyonce her fifth consecutive number one album on chart album sold over 617 000 copies in united states and 828 773 copies worldwide in its first three days of sales becoming fastest selling album in history of itunes store up to that point according to international federation of

world tour during 2014 legs beyonce is third longest charting album by a black woman on billboard 200 behind rihanna s anti and her own i am sasha fierce spending 185 weeks on chart as of 2019 background following release of her fourth studio album 4 2011 beyonce gave birth to her first child blue ivy on january 7 2012 just four months after labor she pursued a three night residency at revel atlantic city s ovation hall entitled revel presents beyonce live choice to hold concerts so soon was purposeful beyonce intended to demonstrate to mothers that they need not halt their careers despite having had children most of summer following residency was spent in hamptons new york where she took time out from public to spend time with her daughter and to begin sessions for her next album she resumed work in early 2013 performing star spangled banner at president barack obama s second inauguration and headlining super bowl xlvii halftime show where there were expectations she would debut new music although these rumors never materialized she also released a self directed autobiographical documentary in february entitled life is but a dream in march 2013 a two part hip hop track entitled bow down i been on was released onto beyonce s soundcloud account bow down produced by hit boy was written after beyonce woke up one morning with a chant stuck in her head feeling angry and defensive this was melded with a timbaland produced second half i been on that makes prominent use of a pitch distorted vocal as a homage to houston hip hop scene michael cragg of guardian described song as brilliantly odd commending its loud abrasive production while pitchforks lindsay zoladz noted song s assertiveness and believed it served as an introduction of what was to come bow down i been on was perceived as a significant departure from beyonce s existing catalogue particularly for its aggressive nature song s atmosphere and its controversial bow down bitches refrain drew a mixed reaction from those who questioned whether lyric was aimed at women or merely a moment of braggadocio beyonce clarified after album s release where elements of bow down appear on track flawless that song and its refrain were intended as a statement of female empowerment neither beyonce or her representatives commented on release of bow down i been on and many journalists questioned nature of its release in context of release of her upcoming album further confusion was created when portions of other tracks grown woman and standing on sun were used for television advertising campaigns with a similar lack of explanation as to their purpose through much of 2013 media intermittently reported that album was delayed or scrapped with one story alleging beyonce had scrapped fifty songs in favor of starting again in july 2013 a spokesperson for beyonce denied speculation that her album had been delayed stating there was no official release date to begin with and that when a date is set it would be announced via an official press release there was considerable confusion among music journalists and fans as beyonce engaged in extensive touring while not discussing album or its release recording and production recording sessions began in summer of 2012 in hamptons new york where beyonce and her husband jay z were living she invited producers and songwriters to accompany them including sia timbaland justin timberlake and dream beyonce described atmosphere as unconventional saying we had dinners with producers every day like a family it was like a camp weekends off you could go and jump in pool and ride bikes ocean and grass and sunshine it was really a safe place she would spend majority of her day with her newborn daughter taking some hours out to record music album s opening track pretty hurts co written by sia was completed during these sessions project was suspended until 2013 and relocated to jungle city and oven studios in new york city where most of album was recorded in an interview for vogue in january 2013 jason gay described beyonce s attention to detail as obsessive when observing her studio noting vision boards she created for inspiration which contained potential song titles old album covers and pictures of performances in mid 2013 a relatively unknown artist boots signed a publishing deal with jay z s roc nation in an interview for pitchfork after album s release boots was coy when answering questions about how beyonce discovered his demo or of his work previous to project only confirming his signing in june 2013 they met in person for first time and boots presented beyonce with material he felt would resonate with her however beyonce was more interested in his experimental material and he reluctantly played her his song haunted on his cellphone she refused to ignore its potential at a later meeting he played her a stream of consciousness rap called ghost which he wrote after an exasperating meeting with a potential record label boots began by composing a melody that reminded him of a hypnotic state then layering guitar arpeggios to resemble work of english electronic musician aphex twin subsequently ghost became first half of haunted he later described beyonce as only visionary in room for her ability to find potential in scraps of songs following these sessions boots would go on to work on eighty percent of beyonce while recording in new york city previously released bow down was incorporated into a track that became flawless during its composition beyonce chose to interpolate a portion of chimamanda ngozi adichie s ted talk we should all be feminists into it as she identified with her interpretations of feminism organic approaches were taken when writing and recording drunk in love and partition when working with detail and timbaland on a beat that became drunk in love she was inspired by what she described as pure enjoyment as both she and jay z free styled their verses for track in studio similarly bassline of partition which beyonce found reminiscent of hip hop music during her early romance with jay z influenced her to accompany track with sexual lyrics she took to a microphone without pen and paper and rapped first verse finding herself initially embarrassed by explicitness of lyrics when composing partition a rap known as yonce was used as opening of track beat of which was built by justin timberlake banging on buckets in studio only four songs were not recorded entirely in new york studios superpower and heaven which were partially recorded in california as well as no angel which was composed in london and xo in berlin and sydney although demo of xo was recorded when beyonce had contracted a sinus infection vocals were never re recorded as she felt their imperfections fit more appropriately in october album began taking shape and standing on sun and grown woman were removed songs which had been previewed in 2013 on television advertisements from beyonce to fit in with its minimalist approach during thanksgiving week vocals on album were edited and producers were notified to submit their final cuts beyonce spent less time on vocal production than she had done with her previous projects instead focusing on perfecting album s music beyonce was mastered at sterling sound in new york city in total eighty songs were recorded for album visuals beyonce first considered idea of creating a visual album in june 2013 when only three or four songs had been completed explaining her motivation she said she would often connect images childhood memories emotions and fantasies to songs she was in midst of composing and that she wanted people to hear songs with story that s in my head as that s what makes it mine she highlighted immersive experience of michael jackson s thriller 1982 as principal influence for creating a body of work that people would hear things differently and actually be able to see whole vision of album videos were filmed between june and november 2013 in various countries as singer traveled on her world tour todd tourso who directed videos for jealous and heaven served as creative director for entire project much of his role concerned liaising between beyonce who for most videos already had concepts and respective directors who also had propositions as most videos were shot outside of us crew surrounding videos was small consisting only of tourso director of photography and producer as well as beyonce and her stylist make up artist and security when filming in public beyonce would wear in ear headphones instead of having music played out loud in order to maintain secrecy of project and prevent any songs leaking thumbnail right 180px standard high line hotel where video for rocket was filmed by time of post production songwriting process began to converge with content of visuals and beyonce would watch unedited footage to fit music to them flawless rocket and mine were noted as having been changed by their visual counterparts tourso commenting that she would rewrite some lines or she would add certain audio or she would add bridges and believed that it would complete picture of where audio needed to go several videos were intended to demonstrate album s central theme of finding beauty in imperfection while working on flawless beyonce was reminded of her loss on television competition star search as a child which she saw as a defining moment in her career and believed that competition had taught her how to embrace imperfection in future theme was represented in videos by recurring use of trophies which singer saw as referencing all of sacrifice i have made as a kid all of time that i lost it was also carried into how visuals were created with videos for drunk in love yonce no angel xo and blue shot without prior preparation as singer found enjoyment in spontaneity of filming locations and in resisting urge to perfect them noting some of visuals explicit content and exposure of her body beyonce said she found shooting them liberating and expressed her intention to demonstrate sexuality as a power that women should have and not lose after becoming a mother she went on to say i know finding my sensuality getting back into my body being proud of growing up it was important to me that i expressed that i know that there are so many women who feel same way music and lyrics beyonce is a fourteen track set with seventeen short films a video for each audio track two extra videos to accompany two part tracks haunted and partition as well as a bonus video for grown woman which lacks an equivalent audio counterpart departing from traditional r b leanings of its predecessor 4 2011 beyonces songs are predominantly alternative r b hence musically album may be located in post dubstep era fusing electronic music with r b and soul album s dark moody production is more textured than previous releases and songs are characterized by heavy bass and loud hi hats as well as prominent synthesizers a quality of restraint features among most songs with subdued pulses ambient effects and throbbing grooves that sneak up on you threatening to explode but only occasionally transforming album adopts unconventional song structure and as evan rytlewski of a v club notes many songs emphasize moody shifting beats and drawn out vibe sessions and are left to slowly unfurl this is particularly prominent on haunted and partition which function as two part suites dream like state created on haunted is ushered in with a stream of consciousness rap entitled ghost which transitions from smoky ethereality to off kilter club beat amid a shifting bassline and ghostly keyboards partition begins with yonce a slick rap set over a simple middle eastern rhythm song is divided by a brief interlude of camera clicks and whirring of a car window before launching into a second half that melds synthesizer pulses with finger snaps to create a southern hip hop bassline over this song follows a candid narrative that describes sex in back of a limousine when travelling to a nightclub several critics noted album s extensive exploration of sexuality having been a singer since age of nine beyonce felt stifled by perception she was a role model for young children and now into her thirties believed she had earned right to express any and every side of her self addressing album s sexual content specifically beyonce said i don t at all have any shame about being sexual and i m not embarrassed about it and i don t feel like i have to protect that side of me several critics described beyonces sex songs as a celebration of monogamous love drunk in love is a duet with her husband jay z and features lyrics heavily laden with double entendres that explore lust within their sexual relationship it fuses intermittent trap beats with heavy bass skittering synthesizers and drums and arabic scale vocal arpeggios beyonce s vocals are diverse including a melodramatic chorus sung in her upper register and a half rapped second verse blow veers from a thumping jazz beat created with sparse piano chords and guitars to a swinging electro funk groove with elements of neo disco its erotic tongue in cheek lyrics include a running cunnilingus metaphor of licking skittles in its chorus slow jam rocket is a homage to d angelo s soul infused untitled how does it feel 2000 described by entertainment weeklys nick catucci as a slippery six and a half minute funk excursion beyonce adopts a slow harmonious vocal as she instructs her love interest to watch her perform a striptease thumb right we raise girls to see each other as competitors not for jobs or for accomplishments which i think can be a good thing but for attention of men we teach girls that they cannot be sexual beings in way that boys are feminist person who believes in social political and economic equality of sexes adichie s pictured speech is sampled on flawless alt a picture of a woman smiling directly at camera much like her previous albums record is feminist with greater exploration of gender issues and conflated with an unwavering look at black female sexual agency soraya mcdonald of washington post viewed beyonce as significant to black feminism as it celebrates black female sexuality in mainstream music and in context of hip hop where it is typically only shown through male perspective album s most explicit commentary on gender is three part flawless it opens with earlier released bow down before seguing into an excerpt of a speech by chimamanda ngozi adichie on socialization of girls final part uses a staccato trap beat as beyonce reflects on her own feminist attitudes encouraging self acceptance among women and criticizing misogynist sentiments other songs allude to darker themes of fear and personal insecurities beyonce noted that album displayed sides of her that only a few people had seen adding that all of us want happiness sometimes you have to take insecurities to get to secure place and all of those things i feel happy to express caitlin white of 405 believed songs as hold forth on most important issues in a woman s life by delving into singer s personal experience with them jealous addresses fidelity and features lyrics in which protagonist experiences promises suspicion and potential revenge it contains an uncanny mix of tones and styles most prominently a morose bassline replete with electronic yelps mine a futuristic r b song with jazz elements is self reflective with lyrics that reference marital strife and difficulties with postnatal depression neo soul song pretty hurts is a self empowerment anthem that decries society s obsession with harmful and unattainable standards of beauty song uses audio snippets of beauty pageants which beyonce contested in to frame song in context of her childhood beyonces vocal production is diverse several songs are half rapped and half sung with particular use of falsetto and head voice telegraphs neil mccormick notes that while singer uses her expansive vocal range unlike her previous releases she restrains from belting and vocal runs as to increase tension in music no angel a chillwave song with influences of minimalist hip hop music is noted for its use of falsetto vocal register with a delivery that is threatening to fray doo wop inspired duet with frank ocean superpower is sung in lower register of both singers while employing girl group harmonies similar to beyonce s work in destiny s child love song xo uses several vocal techniques to evoke a celebration of love and life including echo and several hooks its ascending chorus lines use call and response as well as backing vocals of a sing along crowd as beyonce sings of how her darkest nights are enlightened by her lover s face album s closing tracks are midtempo ballads heaven and blue heaven is an emotive piano led hymn with gospel elements while blue is built on a piano melody over which beyonce sings of love for her daughter using her full vocal range artwork tourso was tasked with designing beyonces album cover which he found difficult considering it was a visual album and thus inundated with imagery over three months he considered over a hundred options only to proceed with his very first idea he was inspired by cover of metallica s eponymous fifth studio album 1991 to create a bold statement specifically to deviate from a beauty shot of beyonce which he felt would be expected he used a font similar to placards used in boxing matches to represent abrasive masculinity which was contrasted by greyish pink font which he described as a subversion of femininity release and promotion throughout 2013 beyonce worked on project in strict secrecy sharing details of album with a small circle of people and continually shifting deadline which was only finalized a week before its release she later explained that her intent was to reinstate idea of an album release as a significant exciting event which had lost meaning in face of hype created around singles in early december 2013 beyonce and her management company parkwood entertainment held meetings concerning its release with executives from columbia records and itunes store using code name lily for album meetings were also held with facebook executives in regard to advertising that resulted in album from social network s then new auto play feature for videos on december 9 2013 rob stringer chairman of columbia records knowingly told media that album would be released at some point in 2014 and it would be monumental on

pleasure at forefront unquestioningly robert christgau admired album s sex sequence of songs where for over seven well differentiated tracks beyonce performs unlikely feat of conveying an open ended
