nuscale power is an american private company that designs and markets small modular reactors smrs it is headquartered in tigard oregon united states in 2014 department of energy projected its technology would be commercially available around year 2025 nuscale is currently planning first power plant in idaho nuscale s smr designs are for diameter by high reactor vessels that use conventional light water cooling methods and runs on low enriched uranium fuel assemblies based on existing light water reactor designs each module is intended to be kept in an underground pool and is expected to produce about 60 megawatts of electricity it uses passive water circulation that can operate without powered pumps or circulatory equipment nuscale was founded based on research funded by department of energy from 2000 to 2003 after funding was cut scientists with program obtained related patents in 2007 and started nuscale to commercialize technology corporate history early history nuscale was founded based on research funded by us department of energy and conducted by oregon state university idaho national laboratory and other colleges beginning in 2000 at time oregon state s nuclear department had been developing passive water circulation techniques for cooling in nuclear plants research grant ended in 2003 but a group of scientists at oregon state university continued work they built a test lab at one third actual scale of technology and inherited related patents from university in 2007 in exchange for a small equity in company nuscale was founded that same year its first funding round was in january 2008 for an undisclosed sum it began seeking certification with nuclear regulatory commission in february 2008 by 2011 nuscale had raised 35 million in financing and had 100 employees in three cities tigard oregon richland washington and corvallis oregon nuscale was first to submit plans for small reactors to nuclear regulatory commission and is widely expected to be first to get government approval it was also being evaluated by a consortium of utility companies called energy northwest funding difficulties and rebound in january 2011 nuscale s largest investor kenwood group was investigated by u s securities and exchange commission and later pleaded guilty to operating a ponzi scheme sec investigation was not related to any of kenwood s dealings with nuscale but kenwood s assets were frozen just as nuscale was expecting additional funding company started making staffing and pay cuts as executives looked for new funding sources and most of company s employees were laid off within a few months that september nuscale obtained a loan to re hire 60 employees in october fluor acquired a majority interest in company for 3 5 million and promised almost 30 million in working capital according to energy daily fluor s investment saved company which had been financially marooned by its prior investor a separate agreement also gave fluor rights to construct nuscale based power plants in august 2012 rolls royce holdings said it would support nuscale s commercialization efforts and help it obtain funding from department of energy s funding opportunity announcement which is intended to provide funding to help bring smrs to market it was not awarded any funding in first round in department of energy s doe second round of funding in december 2013 nuscale won up to 226 million in cost sharing funding to share expense of pursuing government approval through smr licensing technical support program this was followed by an agreement in may 2014 for up to 217 million in funding over a five year period whereby department of energy would match private funding in december 2012 co founder and ceo paul g lorenzini was succeeded by current ceo john hopkins early deployments in march 2012 nuscale signed an agreement with department of energy allowing nuscale and two partners to build and operate a nuscale based nuclear power plant at savannah river site following month energy northwest said it didn t have any immediate plans to construct a nuclear power plant but had evaluated all available smr technologies and identified nuscale as best available option at time in july 2013 nuscale announced an effort to study and demonstrate nuscale reactors in western united states called program win western initiative for nuclear with plans to build first nuscale based power plant in western united states by 2024 in november 2014 nuscale announced it was building what is expected to be first smr in us in idaho plant is for carbon free power project with utah associated municipal power systems company submitted designs to nuclear regulatory commission in january 2017 and if approved hopes to complete its first plant in 2026 in january 2018 nrc agreed that nuscale smr does not need back up power reactors right 500px a diagram of a nuscale small modular reactor smr nuscale designs and markets small modular nuclear reactors that department of energy projected in 2014 to be commercially available around 2025 its designs use light water approach to cooling and power generation that is common in conventional nuclear plants water is heated by nuclear core at base of reactor vessel heated water flows upwards inside riser then down over steam generators as heat is transferred to steam generators water becomes cooler and denser sinking back to bottom of device where cycle is repeated heat transferred to steam generators is used to create steam that turns a turbine which drives an electrical generator each nuscale reactor vessel is expected to be in diameter and tall weighing modules would be pre fabricated delivered by railcar barge or special trucks and assembled on site units were designed to produce 60 megawatts of electricity each and require refueling with standard 4 95 percent enriched uranium 235 fuel every two years nuscale s design does not rely on powered water pumps or circulatory equipment company claims it can shut down and continue cooling itself indefinitely in event of a catastrophe devices are intended to be kept in a below ground pool to absorb shock of earthquakes with a concrete lid over pool in event that ac power is lost for normal cooling systems pool water begins to absorb heat and boil comparisons nuscale is expected to be first smr to market because its cooling is similar to systems used in conventional power plants however alternative cooling systems using molten metals are expected to operate at higher more efficient temperatures once approved company estimates a twelve unit nuscale plant would cost 4 200 an earlier estimate was 5 000 per kilowatt in comparison energy information administration in 2011 estimated costs to be 4 700 per kilowatt for conventional nuclear power 4 600 for a carbon sequestration coal plant and 931 at a gas fired plant or in excess of 1 800 for a gas fired plant with carbon sequestration david executive director of s energy and power division said smrs like nuscale s are ideal for rural towns that need small power plants and do not have access to natural gas nuscale power plants are also expected to take less time materials and space to construct than other power sources and can be expanded incrementally to meet changing power needs operations nuscale has offices in tigard oregon near portland corvallis oregon charlotte north carolina and rockville maryland its headquarters are in tigard and its production facility is located in corvallis it maintains a test facility at oregon state university as well as two additional test facilities in italy nuscale is also exploring potential opportunities in united kingdom notes references external links official website a detailed
