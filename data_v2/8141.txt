pickford this was first game zippo developed for fellow uk based video game company rare at time zippo games had just completed a previous game titled cosmic pirate a game that was published by palace software and released for commodore 64 atari st and amiga in 1988 new to technical capabilities of nintendo entertainment system pickford brothers visited rare and were pleased with their nes library though they thought they were backtracking by deciding to develop games for console according to ste pickford nes seemed primitive by comparison sub commodore 64 but games were ten times better than everything being released for home computers which we appreciated and we wanted to try to make games as good as that rare decided to hire zippo games to develop this wizards warriors sequel pickford remarked rare showed us wizards warriors and asked us to develop sequel and pretty much left us to it rare felt that zippo games was trustworthy enough to develop sequel without much help from them development started in early 1989 when pickford brothers were still learning about nes and what it could do at same time as being new to developing console video games they were also learning about market aspects and nintendo s policies and restrictions on games feeling that graphics in most of games in nes library were poor they placed emphasis on graphics and animation pickford was particularly pleased with animation of enemy eagles and their movement rare assisted with sound and all of game s background music was composed by video game composer david wise who pickford said did a fantastic job on ironsword as far as gameplay was concerned they tried to expand upon its predecessor introducing more adventure based gameplay and additional rpg elements such as magic inns and money graphics and animation ste pickford developed gameplay map for ironsword according to him he basically copied map that was used in a conversion port of ghosts n goblins that he developed a couple of years earlier moreover pickford brothers were trying to resemble ghosts n goblins and similar games by capcom as part of their attempt to earn rights to develop game from rare for map screen ste pickford used specific character data in rom itself used font from elsewhere in data that was inserted separately and overlaid elementals floating heads over top of graphic according to pickford job of graphic was always about 30 drawing and about 70 fiddly technical stuff which was why so many terrible artists people who couldn t draw at all made decent video game artists back then if they could manage technical side of things well enough in developing game s graphics ste pickford translated black and white sketches into character maps in game for bosses plan was to use entire screen while involving as few moving sprites as possible to fool player into thinking whole thing was alive same was done with dragon king which was not one of game s bosses dragon s head and neck were composed of sprites while rest of body was considered part of background dragon s neck stretched out vertically due to nes hardware sprite limitations horizontally animation of eagle eagle king that transports kuros to wind elemental was one of ste pickford s first graphics which he drew for nes it was done in deluxe paint for amiga with sketching done by mouse without assistance from graphics tablets or other scanners he took eagle drawings from a book on animals in motion by eadweard muybridge pickford wanted to show off possible graphical capabilities of nes he said i wanted to do something flashy early in game trying to show off my amazing graphic art skills on rather primitive nes we were working on amiga and st games at same time so were always trying to push nes with bigger and better graphics right from start of our work on machine eagle consisted of only three colors and between 11 and 17 sprites per frame of animation there was a smaller version of same eagle which was used as a regular enemy in that level development of game s title screen was inspired by loading screens that were used in most computer games at time objective was to create a nice looking graphic while waiting for game to load even though nes more rooted in arcade traditions did not require that pickford spent most of his character space on title screen image he was limited in number of available colors due to more limited graphic capabilities of nes as opposed to most home computers as it was more designed for scrolling and animation and not for stationary graphics sword in title screen used character sprites and used a different palette from picture of kuros himself sword had to be vertical as nes hardware did not allow for too many sprites horizontally pickford planned to use and completed an ironsword logo of his own when acclaim made him use their planned logo which he said was a bit more bland and blocky with detail that didn t work very well at such a low pixel resolution release ironsword wizards warriors ii was first unveiled in north america as part of 1989 winter consumer electronics show in las vegas nevada and was displayed with other games to be released later that year by acclaim it was mentioned as a future game in may 1989 premiere issue of video gaming magazine electronic gaming monthly it was also covered in gamepros premiere issue in may 1989 finally it was previewed by nintendo power in its july august 1989 issue for game s cover acclaim hired italian male model fabio lanzoni to pose as kuros fabio was presented on cover bare chested and without armor when zippo games saw image of cover a week prior to its release they were perplexed according to ste pickford our jaws hit floor when we first saw this image which was being merely developers probably about a week before game s release why on earth did they choose a photograph of a bare chested barbarian to promote a game starring a knight in shining armour pickford added that we used it as an example of lack of imagination of americans while suggesting that having an actual suit or armor would be too costly to use for a photo shoot ironsword wizards warriors ii was released by acclaim for nes in north america in december 1989 and in europe and australia in 1991 it managed to sell about 500 000 copies in north america and about 50 000 copies in europe following game s release zippo games would proceed to develop its next game for rare solar jetman hunt for golden warpship they would eventually also release third installment in wizards warriors series wizards warriors iii kuros visions of power television advertisement consisted of a boy who is shown playing first wizards warriors game when a conan barbarian lookalike enters his room after having defeated a monster and hands him a copy of ironsword after describing brief plot and shortly showing clips of game conan lookalike leaves his room while exclaiming fate of world is in your hands back vile beast at end of commercial after briefly playing ironsword boy opens door in his room only to find his dog who now has smoke coming from his behind reception ironsword wizards warriors ii was

offer most of competition pales by comparison ed semrad called game a worthy sequel that fortunately is better than original similarly noting game s size as well as difficulty donn nauert appreciated

featured a poster of game game players magazine awarded ironsword game players nes excellence award as one of best games for console in 1990 game was also featured in uk based magazine mean machines in may 1991 matt regan said that he was not impressed with game saying that similar platforming games such as and gremlins 2 new batch were superior to ironsword and had a more original approach in gameplay he also criticized fact that players cannot hit enemies while in mid air however he noted game s good gameplay julian rignall also said that game was fun but it was not spectacular however just as regan noted rignall said that game did not offer anything special like with better titles such as mega man 2 or super mario bros 2 however he noted game s good graphics and challenge though both noted that backgrounds are slightly bland both reviewers said game was well presented with good introductions and a password mode easy controls fair challenge and fairly good tunes and effects which fit action well overall they said that ironsword was a fun but ultimately limited game that will appeal to platform fans ironsword wizards warriors ii was listed at 64 in ign s list of top 100 nes games reviewer sam claiborn said that game was more expansive than its predecessor and that it featured many of good graphics gameplay and usage of middle english he also noted that fabio s bare breasted likeness smoldering on ironsword s cover art that made this game a smash hit with kids and moms alike website gamesradar praised game s music especially title theme brett elston said it set a serious tone for game saying its heavy droning beats mix with a fantasy minded melody that make it sound like a funeral dirge in shire game s cover which features fabio has received significant coverage from many gaming websites ign listed ironsword as having one of most notable covers in video game history listing its cover as 2nd best of all time behind ninja golf conversely 1up com listed ironsword as having one of worst covers of all time comparing it to cover for mega man gamespy listed it as 4th worst video game cover in history saying that thanks to presence of fabio on cover
