minute book contained an entry instructing secretary to investigate possibility of obtaining a lease on ground at selhurst although calling it a ground was a little misleading since at time it was a

at a cost of ps2 750 and renowned football ground architect archibald leitch was commissioned to design selhurst park leitch had designed stands at craven cottage stamford bridge white hart lane and

edmund goodman stepped down as manager and returned to administrative duties and a succession of managers attempted to plot palace s climb back up table however their stay in division was to last as long as third division south itself with only champions gaining promotion it was a difficult division to get out of although palace came close on more than one occasion in fourteen third division

team has avoided relegation from top flight matthews 113 115 palace avoided drop for two more seasons matthews 115 121 and followed trend of many other top flight clubs by introducing a new player of year award which has been presented at end of every season since 1971 72 campaign first recipient was john mccormick despite some good performances in 1972 73 season notably a 5 0 home win against manchester united in december palace eventually succumbed to drop in their fourth season in top flight arthur wait having overseen rise of club from fourth to first division was replaced as chairman by raymond bloye in november 1972 and club also appointed malcolm allison as new manager in march following year replacing bert head although club saw a record average attendance over season neither crowd nor managerial change were able to keep them at top level allison s first game in charge at home against chelsea did see some changes however including debut of young scottish defender jim cannon palace had never won a london derby in top flight up to this point but cannon who had come through youth ranks marked chelsea striker peter osgood out of game and then scored second goal in a 2

strong recent record as a coach having won trophies with manchester city as an assistant to joe mercer allison or big mal as he was nicknamed in press had a flamboyant personality which was something of a change for club who previously had a rather conservative image palace s nickname was changed from glaziers to eagles and club also changed its colours from original claret and sky blue to a red and dark blue scheme inspired by barcelona eagle was introduced as club mascot at this time an idea borrowed from benfica and club badge was redesigned new season saw introduction of a three up three down promotion and relegation system and palace struggled to find their feet in second division failing to win any of their first 15 league games in bottom place for most of season club aided by signing from southend united of pacey winger peter taylor climbed to seventeenth place with a 3 1 win at fulham on good friday club then turned in three consecutive losses which saw them needing to

allison s rebranded palace crest 1974 75 season was club s first season in division three since 1963 64 and although team had a good season and attendances were highest in division they missed out on promotion finishing in fifth place allison acquired terry venables and ian evans from qpr in exchange for don rogers a trade that was to be significant to palace s and indeed england s football future it was also around this time that allison persuaded club to put more resources into developing a strong youth team a decision that would lead to both success at youth level and emergence of a number of promising young players in first team following season saw palace again fail to gain promotion distracted in part by their best run in fa cup up to that point club reached semi finals beating leeds united and chelsea along way before losing 0 2 to southampton at stamford bridge on 3 april 1976 allison resigned at end of season partly because of failure to get palace promoted but also he had felt

chelsea did in 1960 and 1961 these talented young players had become regulars in first team by 1978 79 season which saw palace vying not only for promotion but also second division title final game of season was a friday night match at home to burnley in front of club s record home crowd of 51 482 there was all to play for a palace win and club would be champions a draw and palace would be promoted but hand title to fierce rivals brighton a loss and palace would stay down with sunderland clinching final promotion place at half time deadlock had not been broken despite palace s dominance but a second half cross from vince hilaire allowed ian walsh to head opener before a great run by david swindlehurst was completed by a finish from outside penalty area to give eagles a 2 0 win palace were crowned champions and had reached top flight again as an increasing number of players from fa youth cup winning team had established themselves in first team press gave palace title of team of eighties they began 1979 80 season well and stayed unbeaten longer than any other club in top flight and also went top of table for first and to date only time in club s history when they beat ipswich

highest ever league finish matthews pp 223 226 slide continued into 1980 81 season with nine defeats in first ten games and venables quit palace to join qpr club were suffering financial problems as well and were virtually relegated by start of february when another even bigger change occurred ron noades previously chairman of wimbledon took financial control of club purchasing it from raymond bloye s consortium palace spent next couple of seasons flirting with relegation from second tier and there were numerous managerial changes including unpopular appointment of ex brighton manager alan mullery steve coppell era 1984 93 thumb right steve coppell who led palace to fa cup final and a third place finish in top flight coppell has managed club over four separate spells former manchester

evans he worked on rebuilding club signing then unknown ian wright from non league greenwich borough and mark bright from leicester city and pair formed strike partnership coppell stabilised club in his first season and after two seasons of narrowly missing out on play offs they followed this up by only just missing out on automatic promotion by a single point club instead entered 1989 second division play offs beating swindon in semi finals to set up a two legged final against blackburn rovers in first leg at ewood park lancashire club won 3 1 but a 30 000 full house at selhurst park saw

headlines when they signed bristol rovers goalkeeper nigel martyn for ps1 million a record fee for a goalkeeper in britain however mixed form meant that eagles ended season fifteenth after spending

title for most of next season but fell just short of eventual champions arsenal and runners up liverpool finishing a club best third in top flight palace were unfortunate to miss out on a place in europe because although ban on english clubs in european competitions following heysel disaster of 1985 had now been lifted there would only be one place available in 1991 92 edition of uefa cup and this went to liverpool rather than palace success was achieved that season however when palace made their third trip to wembley in twelve months beating everton 4 1 in final of full members cup
