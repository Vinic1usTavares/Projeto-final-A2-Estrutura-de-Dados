ultrasonography of suspected or previously confirmed chronic venous insufficiency of leg veins is a risk free non invasive procedure it gives information about anatomy physiology and pathology of mainly superficial veins as with heart ultrasound echocardiography studies venous ultrasonography requires an understanding of hemodynamics in order to give useful examination reports in chronic venous insufficiency sonographic examination is of most benefit in confirming varicose disease making an assessment of hemodynamics and charting progression of disease and its response to treatment it has become reference standard for examining condition and hemodynamics of lower limb veins particular veins of dvs and svs are looked at great saphenous vein gsv and small saphenous vein ssv are superficial veins which drain into respectively common femoral vein and popliteal vein these veins are deep veins perforator veins drain superficial veins into deep veins three anatomic compartments are described as networks n1 containing deep veins n2 containing perforator veins and n3 containing superficial veins known as saphenous compartment this makes it easier for examiner to systematize and map gsv can be located in saphenous compartment where together with giacomini vein and accessory saphenous vein asv an image resembling an eye known as eye sign can be seen asv which is often responsible for varicose veins can be located at alignment sign where it is seen to align with femoral vessels together with gsv and cfv these three veins create an image called mickey mouse sign examination report will include details of deep and superficial vein systems and their mapping mapping is drawn on paper and then drawn on patient before surgery use of ultrasonography in a medical application was first used in late 1940s in united states this use was soon followed in other countries with further research and development being carried out first report on doppler ultrasound as a diagnostic tool for vascular disease was published in 1967 1968 rapid advances since then in electronics has greatly improved ultrasound transmission tomography medical uses it allows examiner to evaluate gross anatomy of venous networks as well as blood flow direction which is crucial in determining vein pathology it has become reference standard used in assessment of condition and hemodynamics of veins of lower limbs normal physiological blood flow is anterograde flowing from periphery towards heart so that evidence of an opposite retrograde flow might indicate a pathology presence of a reflux is likewise of note a reflux when not isolated in a vein as simply retrograde means that blood flow is bi directional where once flow had been only anterograde risks no contraindications are known for this examination ultrasonography does not involve use of ionizing radiation and procedure is harmless and can be safely used on anybody of any age a world health organization report published in 1998 supports this preparation no preparation is normally necessary for this examination but if a complementary study of abdominal veins is also required patient will be asked to fast for 12 hours beforehand sensitivity and specificity measurements are around 90 equipment thumb 270px high frequency probe used for superficial ultrasonography ultrasound equipment must be of sufficiently high quality in order to give a correct image processing result which can then provide invaluable information mainly at superficial level it must be able to provide both color and doppler imaging technologies that developed alongside development of ultrasound use of doppler measurements which trace echoes of generated soundwaves received by probe enable direction and velocity of blood flow to be depicted overlay of color onto doppler information lets these images be seen more clearly choice of a probe will depend on depth needed to be studied for example superficial venous system svs can be very well examined using a high frequency probe of 12 mhz for patients who have thick adipose tissue a probe of 7 5 mhz will be required deep veins require probes of around 6 mhz whilst abdominal vessels are better studied with probes of between 4 and 6 mhz in summary three probes are needed together with a top level scanner also proper use of scanner calls for a high level of expertise so that examiner must be well qualified and experienced in order to give effective results in contrast to arterial ultrasonography wall of vein is not relevant and importance is given to hemodynamic conclusions that examiner can obtain in order to provide a valuable report hemodynamics is study of blood flow and of laws that govern circulation of blood in blood vessels it follows that examiner knowledge of venous hemodynamics is crucial which can be a real barrier to a radiologist untrained in this field who might wish to carry out these examinations specialized training in venous ultrasonography is not undertaken in some countries which undermines best practice mainly when varicose veins need to be examined mechanism thumb 270px left performing venous ultrasonography ultrasonography is based on principle that sound can pass through human body tissues and is reflected by tissue is plane between two tissues with a different density for instance skin fat muscle in same way that light can reflect back on itself from a mirror tissue in body will offer varying degrees of resistance known as acoustic impedance to path of ultrasound beam when there is a high impedance difference between two tissues interface between them will strongly reflect sound when ultrasound beam meets air or solid tissue such as bone their impedance difference is so great that most of acoustic energy is reflected making it impossible to see any underlying structures examiner will see just a shadow instead of image expected air will impede sound waves which is why a gel is used gel prevents air bubbles from forming between probe and patient s skin and so helps conduction of sound waves from transducer into body watery medium also helps to conduct sound waves liquids including blood have a low impedance which means that little energy will be reflected and no visualization possible one of important exceptions is that when blood flow is very slow it can in fact be seen in what is termed spontaneous contrast this technology is widely used in confirming venous pathology diagnoses imaging capability needed was made possible with developments of doppler and color doppler doppler measurements using doppler effect can show direction of blood flow and its relative velocity and color doppler is provision of color to help interpret image showing for example blood flow towards probe in one color and that flowing away another whilst equipment itself is costly procedure is not apart from scanner different probes are required according to depth to be studied a gel is used with probe to make a good acoustic impedance contact training and expertise of examiner is important because of many technical complications that can present venous anatomy for example is not constant for example a patient s vein layout of right limb is not identical to that of left limb probe is an ultrasonic sensor generally known as a transducer which functions to send and receive acoustic energy emission is generated on piezoelectric crystals by piezoelectric effect reflected ultrasound is received by probe transformed into an electric impulse as voltage and sent to engine for signal processing and conversion to an image on screen depth reached by ultrasound beam is dependent on frequency of probe used higher frequency lesser depth reached procedure patient will need to be in an upright position to enable a proper study of blood flow direction chronic venous insufficiency is where veins cannot pump enough blood back to heart it results when vein secondary to a vein wall disease or when normal functioning of valves which serve to keep blood flowing to heart and to prevent reflux become damaged and or incompetent dilation of a vein will prevent valves to close properly this incompetence will result in an reversed blood flow through affected vein or veins it can result in varicose veins and in severe cases venous ulcer reversed blood pools in low third of legs and feet http nih gov article unlike arterial ultrasound study when sonographer studies venous insufficiency vein wall itself has no relevance and attention will be focused on direction of blood flow objective of examination is to see how veins drain in this way venous ultrasonography has at times become a hemodynamic examination which is reserved for experienced who have completed hemodynamic studies and training and have acquired a deep knowledge of this subject also unlike ultrasonography of deep venous thrombosis procedure focuses mainly on superficial veins also unlike arterial ultrasound examination blood velocity in veins has no diagnostic meaning veins are a draining system similar to a low pressure hydraulic system with a laminar flow and a low velocity this low velocity is responsible for fact that it can only be detected spontaneously with doppler effect on proximal and larger femoral and iliac veins here flow is either modulated by respiratory rhythm or is continuous in cases where flow is high thinner veins do not have a spontaneous flow however in some circumstances blood flow is so slow that it can be seen as some echogenic material moving within vein in spontaneous contrast this material can easily be mistaken for a thrombus but can also easily be discounted by testing vein s compressibility echogenic is tissue which reflects ultrasound beam and can be visualized on 225px vein valve and spontaneous contrast to evidence blood flow direction there are some techniques that examiner can use to accelerate blood flow and show valvular function manual squeezing and releasing examiner can compress vein below probe which will push blood in its normal anterograde direction on releasing pressure if valves are incompetent flow will appear as a retrograde flow or reflux greater than 0 5 sec thumb 242px right testing sapheno popliteal junction with parana maneuver thumb right parana maneuver checking perforators parana maneuver makes use of a proprioceptive reflex to test venous muscle pump induced flow proprioceptive refers to a response to a perceived stimulus especially with regard to movement and position of body o d e 2nd edition 2005 a slight push to waist triggers a muscle contraction in leg in order to maintain posture this maneuver is very useful for studying deep vein flow and detecting valvular incompetence mainly at popliteal vein level at back of knee and to check perforator vein incompetence it is very useful when legs are painful or very edematous swollen with fluid flexing toes and feet and extending on tiptoes can all be very useful in detecting perforator vein incompetence these movements unleash a muscle contraction which compresses deep veins if a perforator valve is incompetent then a reflux from deep to superficial through perforator vein will be registered valsalva maneuver when patient performs this maneuver he or she increases intra abdominal venous pressure if great saphenous valve at sapheno femoral junction is incompetent a reflux will appear normal blood flow is anterograde going to heart and from superficial to deep veins via perforator veins however there are two exceptions firstly great saphenous vein gsv collaterals veins that run parallel drain abdominal wall and have a flow from top to bottom so that when an examiner tests sapheno femoral junction a false positive diagnosis might be made secondly in flow from sole of foot venous network around 10 drains to dorsal venous arch of foot going therefore against norm from deep to superficial veins attention will be focused on direction of blood flow in both of venous systems and in perforator veins as well as being focused on shunt detection in venous circulation shunt is situation where blood circulates from one vein leak point to another and from this one to former re entry point creating a pathway in a vicious circle between two veins one with a physiologic flow and other with a retrograde flow a shunting of blood from thigh veins back into lower leg veins will give a reflux situation veins most often found to be incompetent are saphenous veins and perforators communicating with deep veins of thigh technical difficulties venous ultrasonography of lower limbs is most demanding of medical complementary examinations it is dependent on examiner s expertise and training and interpretation of results is subjective and reliant on an understanding of venous hemodynamics a mapping does help reproducibility and inter observer agreement of this examination examination is made even more difficult because there can be dilated veins without insufficiency by hyper debit and non dilated but incompetent veins moreover veins can be discretely incompetent in summer but then be normal in winter also by definition of insufficiency insufficient blood flow blood may be seen to flow freely in both directions anterograde and retrograde between two valves another problem when dealing with superficial venous system is that venous anatomy is not constant position of veins can vary in different patients also in same patient right lower limb is not identical to left lower limb as a further complication to examination where venous insufficiency is evidenced examination needs to be done with probe in transversal position but mapping must be done showing veins in their longitudinal aspect this demands a rapid extrapolation by physician from transversal images seen to longitudinal drawing needed dynamic maneuvers also need to be well executed need of a specialized training is mandatory which is a huge problem for many countries today particular details great saphenous vein thumb eye sign great saphenous vein gsv a superficial vein is longest vein in body it has its origin in dorsal venous arch of foot a superficial vein which connects small saphenous vein with gsv it travels up leg and medial side of thigh to reach groin where it drains into common femoral vein along length of gsv it receives numerous tributaries from subcutaneous layer and drains into deep veins via perforator veins when seen in a scan gsv and giacomini vein together with accessory saphenous vein asv form an image resembling an eye which is referred to as eye sign or eye image all veins which are between skin and superficial fascia are tributaries and all veins which cross deep fascia to join deep venous system are perforator veins three anatomic compartments can be described as networks ni contains deep veins also known as deep compartment n2 contains perforator veins n3 contains superficial veins also known as saphenous compartment some authors describe one more compartment n4 containing collaterals which form a bypass between two distinct points of same vein this compartmentalization is useful in an examination because it makes systematization mapping execution and any surgery strategic easier thumb 270px left carrying out vein mapping being protected between two superficial veins belonging to compartment n3 very rarely become sinuous so that when a sinuous vein is detected sonographer will suspect that it is a tributary sapheno femoral junction is tested by valsalva maneuver with use of color doppler being helpful at this stage wall thickness of vein is significantly increased in venous reflux being approximately 0 58 mm in venous reflux compared to up to 0 45 mm normally accessory saphenous vein thumb 200px asv at sapheno femoral junction mickey mouse sign accessory saphenous vein asv either anterior or posterior is an important gsv collateral frequently responsible for varicose veins located on anterior and lateral aspect of thigh anterior asv is more anterior than asv and is outside femoral vessels plan two veins terminate in a common trunk near groin sapheno femoral junction here asv can be located aligned with femoral vessels at alignment sign also at groin it can be seen at outside of great saphenous vein and together with common femoral vein cfv these three create an image so called mickey mouse sign some authors inspired by this sign presented for first time at chiva s 2002 meeting in berlin described a mickey mouse view at groin an image formed by common femoral vein gsv and superficial femoral artery when asv is incompetent its flow becomes retrograde and tries to drain in superior fibular perforator at side of knee or sometimes it runs down towards ankle to drain in inferior fibular perforator small saphenous vein small saphenous vein ssv runs along posterior aspect of leg as far as popliteal region in upper calf here it enters popliteal space which is located between two heads of muscle where it usually drains above knee joint in popliteal vein or a little less often in great saphenous vein gsv or other deep muscular veins of thigh use of ultrasonography has allowed a number of variations to be shown at this level when no contact is made with popliteal vein it might be seen to drain in gsv at a variable level or it may merge with giacomini vein and drain in gsv at superior 1 3 of thigh it can also but rarely drain in vein of thigh muscle shown below usually though it connects with a perforator vein at its middle 1 3 to check for insufficiency parana maneuver is very useful giacomini vein giacomini vein mostly acts as a bypass between gsv and ssv territories usually its flow is in normal anterograde direction from bottom to top however it can become retrograde without pathology for example after a gsv stripping laser ablation or after its ligation at sapheno femoral junction giacomini vein will drain into ssv with a retrograde flow when there is a gsv thrombosis or other cause of insufficiency giacomini vein can divert blood flow to ssv and from there to popliteal vein where surgery other than stripping or laser ablation is intended examiner will make reference to blood flow direction in this vein as it will be of importance perforator veins thumb insufficient perforator perforator veins play a very special role in venous system carrying blood from superficial to deep veins during muscular their valves close and stop any blood flow coming from deep to superficial veins when their valves become insufficient they are responsible for a rapid deterioration in existing varicose disease and for development of venous ulcers detection of insufficient perforators is important because they need to be however detection of competent ones is as important because they may be used strategically in new techniques of conservative surgery for example a minimally invasive chiva ultrasonography report will include insufficient and continent perforators which will also be shown on venous mapping to test these veins properly examiner will need to use some techniques like parana maneuver toe and foot flexion and hyper extension on tip toes examination report thumb left svs normal mapping after performing this examination physician writes a report in which some points are crucial condition of deep vein system dvs its permeability and compressibility and whether it is continent or insufficient permeability and compressibility of superficial vein system svs presence or absence of superficial insufficiency and in which veins or vein segments which perforator veins are continent or insufficient presence or absence of shunts mapping insufficient veins flux direction shunts and perforators mapping is a schematic depiction of venous anatomic functional configuration in an individual this enables surgeons to plan interventions in a stage known as virtual dissection virtual dissection is a schema based on venous mapping where surgeon projects what he will do to treat his patient drawn on paper after examination it will be drawn over patient s skin before surgery history doppler effect was first described by christian doppler in 1843 nearly forty years later in 1880 piezoelectric effect was discovered and confirmed by pierre and jacques curie both of these findings were used in development of ultrasonography first ultrasound was applied to human body for medical purposes by dr george ludwig university of pennsylvania in late 1940s use of ultrasonography in medicine soon followed in different locations around world in mid 1950s more research was undertaken by professor ian donald et al in glasgow which advanced practical technology and applications of ultrasound in 1963 in france started on his thesis which was presented in 1964 and used pulsed doppler for blood flow calculation as its subject this was followed up by in 1969 dr gene and bio engineering group at university of washington who conducted research on doppler ultrasound as a diagnostic tool for vascular disease published their first work in 1967 first report published about venous system appeared around 1967 1968 a few years later in 1977 claude franceschi published very first book about vascular ultrasonography l investigation par doppler from 1960s commercially available systems were introduced soon other advances in electronics and piezoelectric materials enabled further improvements which meant that ultrasound was quickly adopted for use in medicine due to its rapid accurate diagnostic capabilities which offered possibility of prompt treatment alongside improving imaging technology acoustic doppler and medical ultrasonography color doppler were developed which have had a significant impact on many specialties including radiology obstetrics gynecology and cardiology and have provided even greater scope for ultrasound investigations since 1970 real time scanners and pulsed doppler have enabled use of ultrasound to study function of venous system first demonstration of color doppler was achieved by geoff stevenson further progress in 1970s was made with arrival of microchip and ensuing exponential increase in processing power has meant development of fast and powerful systems these systems involving digital and greater signal enhancement have introduced new methods of interpreting and displaying data rapid technical advancements in transmission tomography made possible very good specificity and sensitivity capability of this technique enabling possibility of properly seeing superficial tissues footnotes references bibliography category medical ultrasonography category diseases of veins lymphatic vessels and lymph nodes
