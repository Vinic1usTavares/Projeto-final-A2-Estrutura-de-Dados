philip i epiphanes philadelphus between 124 and 109 bc 83 or 75 bc was a hellenistic seleucid monarch who reigned as king of syria from 94 to either 83 or 75 bc son of antiochus viii and his wife tryphaena he spent his early life in a period of civil war between his father and his uncle antiochus ix conflict ended with assassination of antiochus viii and a quick succession in syrian capital antioch of antiochus ix then antiochus viii s eldest son seleucus vi after murder of seleucus vi in 94 bc philip i became king with his twin brother antiochus xi and planned to avenge seleucus vi in 93 bc antiochus xi took antioch from antiochus ix s son antiochus x antiochus xi became senior king and philip i remained in a base in cilicia antiochus x returned and killed antiochus xi that year philip i then allied with his younger brother demetrius iii who was based in damascus antiochus x was probably killed in 88 bc demetrius iii took capital and besieged philip i in beroea aleppo but latter prevailed and took antioch their youngest brother antiochus xii took damascus philip i tried unsuccessfully to take damascus for himself after which he disappears from historical record there is no information about when or how he died antiochenes apparently refusing to accept philip i s minor son philip ii as his successor invited tigranes ii of armenia to take city while invasion of tigranes ii is traditionally dated to 83 bc year most scholars agree on for philip i s death conflict may have taken place in 74 bc numismatic evidence and clues in ancient contemporary literature indicate that philip i might have died in 75 bc giving antiochus x s widow cleopatra selene and her son antiochus xiii who probably took control of south following death of antiochus xii in 82 bc a year of claiming whole kingdom philip i initiated monetary reforms and his coins remained in circulation until romans conquered syria in 64 bc roman authorities in syria continued to issue coins modeled on philip i s coins including his portrait until 13 bc background name and early life 280px thumb alt a coin struck by antiochus viii of syria reigned 125 96 bc portrait of antiochus viii on obverse depiction of zeus holding a star and staff on reverse coin of antiochus viii father of philip i seleucid dynasty which ruled syria following death of alexander great was plagued by dynastic feuds during 2nd century bc exacerbated by ptolemaic and roman interference dynastic marriage was used to maintain a degree of peace between ptolemaic egypt and syria ptolemaic princess cleopatra thea became consort of three successive syrian kings in 150 145 and 138 bc syria gradually disintegrated due to constant civil wars as seleucid kings and their heirs fought for power tearing country apart this lasted until about 123 bc when antiochus viii provided a degree of stability which lasted for a decade until his brother antiochus ix declared himself king with his ptolemaic wife tryphaena whom he married in 124 bc antiochus viii fathered five sons seleucus vi eldest antiochus xi and philip i who were apparently twins their younger brother demetrius iii and youngest antiochus xii name philip greek means lover of horses seleucid kings were mostly named seleucus and antiochus philip was used by antigonid dynasty as a royal name and its use by seleucids who were descended from antigonids through queen stratonice was probably meant to signify that they were heirs of latter war with antiochus ix claimed tryphaena s life in 109 bc following antiochus viii s assassination in 96 bc his second wife tryphaena s sister cleopatra selene married antiochus ix who took antioch antiochus viii s sons did not submit to their uncle seleucus vi took antioch in 95 bc after killing antiochus ix while demetrius iii seized and ruled damascus antiochus ix s son antiochus x married cleopatra selene and defeated seleucus vi who escaped to mopsuestia where he was killed by rebels in 94 bc reign

philip i and antiochus xi minted jugate coins with their portraits on obverse historian alfred bellinger suggested that their base of operations was a coastal city north of antioch but according to numismatist arthur houghton beroea is a stronger candidate because city s rulers were philip i s allies all jugate coins were minted in cilicia series with most numerous surviving specimens was probably issued in tarsus making it likely base of operations antiochus xi was portrayed in front of his brother indicating that he was senior king deriving their legitimacy from antiochus viii brothers were depicted on coins with exaggerated aquiline noses similar to their father hellenistic kings did not use regnal numbers which is a modern practise instead they used epithets to distinguish themselves from similarly named monarchs on his coins philip i used epithets philadelphus sibling loving and epiphanes glorious or illustrious brothers intended to avenge seleucus vi according to fourth century writer eusebius they sacked mopsuestia and destroyed it reign in cilicia and beroea thumb 280 px tetradrachm of philip i minted in cilicia while philip i remained in cilicia antiochus xi advanced on antioch and drove antiochus x from city in beginning of 93 bc philip i did not live in syrian metropolis and left antiochus xi as master of capital by autumn 93 bc antiochus x regrouped and defeated antiochus xi who drowned in orontes first century historian josephus mentioned only antiochus xi in battle but eusebius wrote that philip i was also present bellinger believed that philip i s troops participated but that he remained behind at his base since only antiochus xi was killed following defeat philip i is thought to have retreated to his capital which was probably same base from which he and his brother operated when they first prepared to avenge seleucus vi antiochus x eventually controlled cilicia and philip i probably took beroea as his base demetrius iii may have marched north to support antiochus xi in battle of 93 bc and he certainly supported philip i in struggle against antiochus x eusebius wrote that philip i defeated antiochus x and replaced him in capital in 93 92 bc 220 se seleucid year however eusebius does not note reign of antiochus xi or mention demetrius iii account contradicts archaeological evidence represented in a market weight belonging to antiochus x from 92 bc and contains factual mistakes english minister and numismatist edgar rogers believed that philip i ruled antioch immediately after antiochus xi but suggestions that philip i controlled antioch before demise of antiochus x and demetrius iii can be dismissed they contradict numismatic evidence and no ancient source claimed that demetrius iii who actually succeeded antiochus x in antioch had to push philip i out of city in any case antiochus x disappeared from record after 92 bc but could have remained in power until 224 se 89 88 bc he probably died fighting against parthia taking advantage of antiochus x s death demetrius iii rushed to capital and occupied it this led philip i to break his alliance with his brother with most of syria in hands of demetrius iii philip i retreated to his base in 88 bc demetrius iii marched on beroea for final battle with philip i to raise siege philip i s ally ruler of beroea called on arab aziz and parthian governor mithridates for help allies defeated demetrius iii who was sent into captivity in parthia any captive who was a citizen of antioch was released without a ransom a gesture which must have eased philip i s occupation of antioch reign in capital 280 px thumb alt map of syria around 87 bc philip i s realm shortly after battle in late 88 bc or early 87 bc philip i entered syrian capital and had cilicia under his authority he was faced with need to replenish empty treasury to rebuild a country destroyed after years of civil war and in case a new pretender to throne arose those factors combined with low estimates of annual coin dies used by philip i s immediate predecessors in antioch antiochus x his second reign and demetrius iii compared with general die estimates of late seleucid kings led numismatist oliver d hoover to propose that philip i simply re coined his predecessors coins and skewed their dies this resulted in currency bearing philip i s image reduced in weight from standard to this yielded a profit of half an obol on each older coin which was re struck profit was however not main aim of philip i it is more probable that he wanted to pay his troops with coins bearing his own image instead of that of his rivals recoinage was also necessary since philip i s coins were reduced in weight and king needed to enforce use of his currency by removing his rivals heavier coins out of circulation philip i may have adopted new seleucid era dating which have return of antiochus viii from his exile in in 200 se 113 112 bc as a starting point traditional seleucid era started in 1 se 312 311 bc philip i s position on throne was insecure cleopatra selene hid in syria with antiochus xiii her son by antiochus x waiting for an opportunity to regain throne while antiochus xii replaced demetrius iii in damascus but there is no evidence that he sought to compete with his brother for antioch according to josephus philip i took advantage of antiochus xii s absence in a campaign against nabataea to seize damascus governor of city milesius who opened gates for philip i was not given a suitable reward by his new master leading him to wait until philip i left city he then closed gates locking king out until antiochus xii returned in seleucid dynasty currency struck during campaigns against a rival or usurper showed king with a beard antiochus xii was shown beardless for first two years of his reign in 228 se 85 84 bc he appeared with a beard possibly related to philip i s attack on damascus but since antiochus xii did not march north against his brother hypothesis about a connection between antiochus xii beard and philip i s attempt to take damascus weakens no coins of philip i were struck in damascus indicating that his occupation of city was brief end and succession after attack on damascus philip i disappeared from ancient literature without proof 83 bc is commonly accepted as philip i s year of death by most scholars he could have been buried in mausoleum seleucia traditionally philip i is considered by most scholars to have been succeeded by tigranes ii of armenia who was invited by people of antioch despite existence of philip i s probably minor son philip ii second century historian appian assigned a fourteen year reign to tigranes ii which ended in 69 bc and most scholars accepted ancient historian s version hence date 83 bc fate of philip i is a source of debate in academic circles as no clues regarding how where and when his life ended exist many theories were presented by different historians thumb inscription of philip ii escaped to cilicia an inscription of philip ii was found in olba capital of a cilician priestly principality historian auguste bouche leclercq concluded that philip i could not have returned to capital following his defeat in damascus because populace became weary of endless seleucid dynastic quarrels bouche leclercq conjectured based on inscription of his son that philip i might have escaped to cilicia and died in chaos caused by second mithridatic war 83 81 bc between mithridates vi of pontus and rome another possibility is that philip i was preparing to take back his throne after death of antiochus xii d 82 bc but was caught off guard by arrival of tigranes ii and put to death in cilicia historian theodora stillwell mackay suggested that philip i fled to olba following his confrontation with antiochus xii epigraphers josef keil and adolf wilhelm suggested that philip i stayed with priest prince of city peaceful long reign according to bellinger silence of ancient literature might be an indication of a peaceful reign that was perhaps facilitated by philip i s alliance with parthia this would explain massive amount of silver coinage produced by philip i found as far as dura europos which was under parthian rule appian s account is flawed and contradicts contemporary accounts notably roman statesman cicero who wrote in 75 bc that cleopatra selene sent antiochus xiii to rome to appeal for his right to egyptian throne he did not have to appeal for his rights to syria which in words of cicero he inherited from his ancestors cleopatra selene and her son probably took advantage of antiochus xii s death in 82 bc to assume control of south statement of cicero indicates that in 75 bc tigranes ii was still not in control of syria for if he were antiochus xiii would have asked roman senate for support to regain syria since tigranes ii was son in law of rome s enemy mithridates vi likewise philip i could not have been alive since antiochus xiii went to rome without having to assert his right to syria argument for a later armenian invasion is corroborated by josephus who wrote that jews heard about armenian invasion and tigranes ii s plans to attack judea only during reign of hasmonean queen salome alexandra which began in 76 bc it would be odd if tigranes ii took control of syria in 83 bc and jews learned about it only after 76 bc another point of argument is massive quantity of coinage left by philip i which could not have been produced if his reign was short and ended in 83 bc in light of this hoover proposed 75 bc or slightly earlier as philip i s last year this would be in line with cicero s statement about antiochus xiii hoover suggested year 74 bc as date of tigranes ii s invasion giving cleopatra selene and her son time to claim whole country legacy thumb alt see caption roman coin bearing image of philip i philip i s coins were still in circulation when romans annexed syria in 64 bc first roman coins struck in syria were copies of philip i s coins and bore his image with monogram of roman governor first issue was in 57 bc under governor aulus gabinius and last series of philip i s posthumous coins was minted in 13 bc romans may have considered philip i last legitimate seleucid king a theory held by kevin butcher and other scholars hoover opted for a simpler answer philip i s coins were most numerous and earlier seleucid coin models were destroyed making it economically sensible for romans to continue philip i s model anomalous coins of philip differing from his standard lifetime models but similar to later roman philip coins indicate that they might have been minted by autonomous city of antioch between 64 and 58 bc before governor aulus gabinius issued his coins making it viable for romans to continue minting coins already being struck family tree style text align left citations see also list of syrian monarchs list of seleucid rulers timeline of syrian
