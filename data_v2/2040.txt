demanding mother who expected her children to exhibit moral and political leadership and in her husband s absence she carefully supervised their education and upbringing shortly after arriving in her new adopted country vicky observed continuous arguments and intrigues within prussian royal family this bolstered her belief in superiority of english culture she raised her children in english style nurseries and successfully fostered a love of her native country by incorporating aspects of english culture in home and taking them on frequent trips to england while vicky was close with her eldest daughter this changed as girl grew older by time she was two years old charlotte had become known as sweet naughty little and would prove to be most difficult of family s eight children as a young girl she acted nervously and made frequent displays of agitation such as pulling at her clothes an early habit of biting her nails led to preventative measures like forced wearing of gloves but any methods only provided temporary relief queen victoria wrote to her daughter tell charlotte i was appalled to hear of her biting her things does not like naughty little girls in 1863 crown princess

princess rarely withheld her true thoughts of those who displeased her and bluntly admonished her children to encourage their efforts and help them avoid vanity queen victoria urged her daughter to act encouragingly rather than towards charlotte believing that she could not expect young princess to share vicky s tastes biographer jerrold m packard thinks it likely that pretty but nervous and sullen girl sensed her mother s disappointment from an early age exacerbating gulf between them over time a rift developed between family s three eldest and three youngest children deaths of charlotte s brothers sigismund and waldemar in 1866 and 1879 respectively devastated crown princess historian john c g rohl posits that vicky s eldest three children could never live up to her idealised memory of two dead princes strict upbringing vicky gave to eldest three children wilhelm charlotte and henry was not replicated in her relationship with her three youngest surviving children viktoria sophia and margaret eldest children in turn and sensing their mother s disappointment became resentful of vicky s indulgence towards their youngest siblings historian john van der kiste speculates that had vicky shown same level of acceptance with charlotte as with her younger children relationship between them might have been a happier one charlotte was a favourite of her paternal grandparents whom she frequently saw king wilhelm and queen augusta spoiled their granddaughter and encouraged her rebellion against crown prince and princess and charlotte and her brother frequently took their side in disputes with her parents this rebellion was encouraged by german chancellor otto von bismarck who held political disagreements with liberal crown prince and princess charlotte also enjoyed a close

adult life this was accompanied by a nearly continuous state of mental agitation and wild excitement confusing her doctors her many health issues included rheumatism joint pains headaches and insomnia as charlotte grew older her behaviour came to include flirtation spreading malicious gossip and causing trouble traits her mother had noticed in her daughter s youth and had hoped she would outgrow vicky characterised her as a wheedling little kitten who can be so loving whenever she wants something she believed that charlotte s pretty exterior hid dangerous character traits and blamed nature for producing such qualities in her daughter in april 1877 sixteen year old charlotte became engaged to her second cousin prince bernhard of saxe meiningen heir to german duchy of saxe meiningen according to a story related by vicky s biographer hannah pakula charlotte fell in love with prince while they were driving with her eldest brother wilhelm sped up during drive alarming charlotte and causing her to cling to bernhard s arm pakula adds that this sudden but temporary passion likely fit charlotte s changeable personality van der kiste believes charlotte s decision to marry bernhard also stemmed from a desire to become independent of her parents and especially from her mother s criticism prince bernhard an army officer serving in a potsdam regiment was nine years her senior and a veteran of recent franco prussian war though regarded as weak willed he had many intellectual interests particularly in archaeology charlotte did not share these interests but vicky hoped that time as

charlotte devoted her time to enjoying society life in berlin and embarking on long holiday trips during these trips charlotte would often leave her daughter to stay with vicky whom she viewed as source of a convenient nursery feodora frequently made long visits to friedrichshof her maternal grandmother s estate on one occasion vicky observed that feodora is really a good little child far easier to manage than her mother among era s royal families it was unusual to be an only child feodora likely endured a lonely childhood like her mother feodora suffered from sickness and various physical pains as well as severe migraines feodora also lacked an interest in her studies a deficit blamed by vicky on a lack of parental guidance as charlotte and bernhard were frequently away vicky

wife dona letters were written in same handwriting and featured salacious gossip accusations and intrigues among court s powerful some included pornographic images layered upon royal photographs several hundred letters were sent over a four year period wilhelm ordered an investigation but writer or writers were never identified some contemporaries speculated that charlotte known for her sharp tongue and love of gossip may have been responsible historians have since suggested that writer may have been dona s brother duke ernst gunther of schleswig holstein in collaboration with his mistress it is clear that author had an intimate understanding of many personalities within royal family likely making him or her either a family member or courtier during letters scandal charlotte lost her diary which contained both family secrets and critical thoughts on various members of her family diary was eventually given to wilhelm who never forgave her for its contents bernhard was transferred

in law criticizing his appearance and inability to control his strong willed wife unlike her mother feodora wanted children her inability to conceive left feodora disappointed though it pleased charlotte who had no desire for grandchildren van der kiste writes that charlotte and feodora had very similar personalities both strong willed creatures who loved gossip and were too ready to believe worst of each other eventually their relationship deteriorated enough for charlotte to bar feodora and henry from her house charlotte refused to accept feodora s claim to have malaria believing instead that her daughter had contracted a venereal disease from henry this opinion outraged feodora over years members of family tried to repair mother daughter relationship without success charlotte

experienced various pains including chronic aches swollen legs and kidney problems degree of pain became so severe that she took opium as her only comfortable treatment end of war in 1918 led to political demise of german empire as well as all of its many duchies consequently bernhard was forced to abdicate his rule over saxe meiningen following year charlotte travelled to baden baden to seek medical treatment for her heart ultimately dying there of a heart attack on 1 october 1919 at age of 59 bernhard died nine years later and was buried with her at schloss in thuringia medical analysis majority of historians hold that charlotte and feodora were afflicted with porphyria a genetic disease that is believed to have affected some members of british royal family most notably king george iii in their 1998 book purple secret genes madness and royal houses of europe historian john c g rohl and geneticists martin warren and david hunt identify charlotte as ying a crucial position in search for porphyria mutation in descendants of hanoverians for evidence rohl reviewed letters between charlotte and her doctor as well as correspondence with her parents that had been sent over a 25 year period he found that even as a little girl charlotte had suffered from hyperactivity and indigestion as a young woman charlotte became gravely ill with what her mother called malaria poisoning and anaemia followed by neuralgia fainting and nausea all described by rohl as a textbook list of symptoms of porphyria and this several decades before disorder was clinically identified rohl also notes further symptoms described in letters between charlotte and her physician ernst who treated her for over two decades beginning in early 1890s in them charlotte variously complains of toothache backache insomnia dizzy spells nausea constipation excruciating wandering abdominal pains skin oedema and itching partial paralysis of legs and dark red or orange urine last of which rohl calls decisive diagnostic symptom in 1990s a team led by rohl exhumed charlotte s and feodora s graves and took samples of each princess for testing in both mother and daughter researchers found evidence of a mutation related to porphyria while team notes they could not be completely certain that this mutation was caused by genetic disease they believe it beyond dispute based on historical and biological evidence they add that many of same symptoms were found in charlotte s mother vicky as well as other family members including queen victoria rohl warren and hunt conclude for what else could have caused their terrible attacks of lameness and abdominal pain and skin rashes and in charlotte s case dark red urine titles styles honours and arms titles and styles 24 july 1860 18 february 1878 her
