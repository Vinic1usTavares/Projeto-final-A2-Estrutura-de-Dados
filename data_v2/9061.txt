concentrated mainly on studio work on both piano and vibes for other leaders he was much in demand for recording sessions because of excellence of his sight reading and playing on both of his instruments quantity of studio work created a conflict between costa s need and desire to support his family sometimes achieved through working day and night in studios and his belief in developing his jazz talents which would have required playing more in clubs and dealing with people agents club owners artists and repertoire men and so on whose goals seldom matched those of creative musicians

great variety of settings according to critic alun morgan his mind was never cluttered up with thoughts of stylistic divisions he was at home with any jazz group provided it swung and generated a feeling of happiness on piano his trademark sound remarked ken dryden was emphasis of middle and lower registers while nearly ignoring top two octaves dryden ken eddie costa biography allmusic retrieved may 16 2013 some of costa s more linear right hand playing was influenced by his listening to bud powell records while in army costa s playing was more than just one handed lines during a period when typical approach to jazz piano was to concentrate on right hand solos while adding only basic left hand support costa used both hands in creating his own vigorous sound wilson john s june 16 1977 records clavier to jazz piano new york times p 68 his piano playing on informally recorded album fuerst set is typical of his style it was later described by critic whitney balliett each improvisation resembled an excellent drum solo in its rhythmic intensity pattern of beats and elements of surprise costa liked to use octave chords in left hand and single note lines in right and he liked to thunder endlessly down in lower registers of piano at such times he played chords in both hands and with stunning effect he would let loose a staccato passage and then an impossible two handed arpeggio or he would deliver on beat or offbeat chords them making them into sixty fourth notes somehow slurring them and developing great drive and momentum balliett whitney 1981 night
