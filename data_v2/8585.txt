john komnenos asen yoan komnin asen ioannes komnenos jovan komnin asen was ruler of principality of valona from circa 1345 to 1363 initially as a serbian vassal and after 1355 as a largely independent lord descended from high ranking bulgarian nobility john was a brother of both tsar ivan alexander of bulgaria and helena of bulgaria wife of tsar stephen dusan of serbia perhaps in search of better opportunities he emigrated to serbia where his sister was married there he was granted title of despot by stephen dusan who placed him in charge of his territories in modern south albania as despot of valona john established commercial ties with venice and ragusa and he became a citizen of former in 1353 after death of dusan in 1355 he took side of unsuccessful simeon uros in ensuing conflict for serbian throne with venetian assistance john maintained essentially independent status of principality of valona he probably died of plague in 1363 and he was succeeded by alexander komnenos asen who was likely his son from his unknown first wife john s second marriage was to former epirote queen consort anna palaiologina origin and serbian vassalage right thumb berat castle 13th century was under rule of john komnenos asen in mid 14th century while birth date of john komnenos asen is unknown his origin is clearly documented in sources on both sides he descended from highest ranks of 14th century bulgarian nobility he was born to a daughter of despot shishman of vidin and sratsimir despot of kran john s mother was a descendant of asen dynasty as a grand granddaughter of tsar ivan asen ii his siblings were ivan alexander who would ascend to bulgarian throne in 1331 and helena who married serbian ruler stephen dusan in 1332 even though john was commonly referred to as a komnenos in sources his relations to that byzantine family are rather scarce he had rights to that name either through his mother s descent from themselves related to komnenoi or through his marriage to anna palaiologina andreev p p 179 it is uncertain as to exactly why john emigrated to serbia instead of assuming a high ranking position in bulgaria as his ancestry and family ties would suggest bulgarian historian ivan bozhilov is of opinion that john was not seeking political refuge in serbia instead it is most likely that he moved to that country with belief that serbia s territorial expansion and political influence in that period would secure him better career opportunities presumably john accompanied his sister helena when she moved to serbia to marry stephen dusan in 1332 john was first mentioned as despot of valona in 1350 and his documented presence in albanian lands only dates to 1349 however he was most likely bestowed title as early as 1345 or 1346 when stephen dusan was proclaimed emperor tsar soulis p 136 american scholar john fine believes this happened immediately after stephen dusan s coronation in 1346 along with stephen dusan s half brother simeon uros and jovan oliver john was one of three people to bear that title under stephen dusan fine p p 30 john was installed as ruler of valona in late 1345 in wake of serbian conquest of south albania from byzantine empire which was concluded no later than august 1345 bozhilov p 180 besides adriatic port of valona modern vlore john s appanage included nearby and inland castle of berat to northeast other than that extent of his domain is uncertain estimates of area john ruled over range from all of central albania to only three cities mentioned with rest remaining under government of local albanian nobility who owed allegiance either to john or to stephen dusan directly fine p 320 to south john s appanage bordered on lands of simeon uros ruler of epirus fine p 347 relations with venice and independence in 1349 john plundered a venetian commercial ship which had been shipwrecked on coast he controlled in accordance with medieval principle of jus this act necessitated involvement of stephen dusan in order to settle dispute between venice and john as evidenced by an official document from 13 april 1350 soulis p 137 despite this conflict under john principality of valona was an active partner of venice and ragusa modern dubrovnik in maritime commerce two receipts from 27 april 1350 document john s role as a mediator in cattle sugar and pepper trade and reveal that he received significant income from valona customs customs was profitable because port was often visited by merchant ships even though all of these documents were written in slavic john signed his name in greek which testifies to his hellenisation at time john also had ties with mamluk rulers of egypt who addressed him as king of serbia and bulgaria in correspondence soulis pp 136 137 in 1353 john and his family were granted venetian citizenship which hints that his domain was under protection of venice premature death of stephen dusan in 1355 plunged serbian empire into civil war in that conflict john took side of his wife s son in law simeon uros against legitimate successor stephen uros who was stephen dusan s son and simeon uros s nephew while simeon s attempt at taking throne was ill fated and stephen uros even captured berat in 1356 john managed to preserve his remaining lands and became independent from both simeon and stephen uros fine p 357 threat of nikephoros ii orsini who was gaining ground in thessaly and epirus forced john to request dispatch of a venetian warship and an administrator from venice to take control of his domain to which republic obliged bulgarian historian hristo matanov conjectures that after 1355 john may have minted his own coinage intended for trade with partners outside inner balkans he bases this theory on a new reading of several latin language coin inscriptions as monita despoti instead of monita despoti oliveri as previously thought new reading which would identify coins as being minted by john was proposed by yugoslav numismatist nedeljkovic who rejects initial attribution of these coins to jovan oliver matanov p 38 a commercial document from 30 january 1359 which testifies to john s continuing trade relations with venice is chronologically last reference to his activity in contemporary sources while date of his death was not recorded it is likely that john perished during plague epidemic which hit valona and durazzo today durres in 1363 bozhilov pp 180 181 family john s first marriage probably dates to after his arrival in serbia though identity of his first wife if any is unknown if next ruler of valona alexander komnenos asen was his son then he would have been born circa 1346 1348 as he was already an adult in 1363 1366 this would place john s potential first marriage a few years before alexander s estimated birth around 1350 1355 john married anna palaiologina a granddaughter of byzantine emperor michael viii palaiologos and a widow of john ii orsini despot of epirus this marriage to an epirote noblewoman consolidated and legitimised john s position in region besides alexander another very likely child of john komnenos asen was a certain wife of balsa ii who had succeeded alexander as ruler
