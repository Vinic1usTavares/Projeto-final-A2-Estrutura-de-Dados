heartbreaker pushed carey even further into r b and hip hop market becoming her second commercial single to feature a rapper lyrically song talks about a relationship from female perspective and how protagonist incessantly returns to her lover even though he continuously cheats on her and breaks her heart heartbreaker received mixed reviews from music critics many of which felt it was not original or innovative in terms of a creative step forward additionally it was compared heavily to carey s 1995 hit single fantasy which also built its hook from a sampled beat heartbreaker topped canadian singles chart and us billboard hot 100 becoming carey s 14th us chart topper across europe and australia single topped new zealand singles chart and was a top five single in france and united kingdom carey performed heartbreaker live on several television and award show appearances around world as well as on her concert tours accompanying music video for heartbreaker directed by brett ratner is one of most expensive ever made costing over 2 5 million video features carey and her friends visiting a film theater and catching her boyfriend played by jerry o connell on a date with another woman carey played herself and a brunette villainess named bianca during a physical altercation scene in between two women due to contractual agreements at time of its filming jay z was unable to make an appearance in video instead being portrayed as an animated cartoon video was inspired by several films including grease and enter dragon background with her sixth studio effort butterfly 1997 carey started infusing hip hop elements in her songs working with different and younger producers and songwriters after album s success and release of her first compilation album 1 s 1998 carey began to work on her seventh album rainbow 1999 her main focus on album was to continue on same path she began with on butterfly producing a subtle combination between inspirational ballads and hip hop beats heartbreaker marked first time in carey s career that a rapper was included on a lead single following ol dirty bastard who was featured on bad boy remix of fantasy in 1995 while recording album in capri italy carey claimed to have spent most of time developing what she felt to be a strong lead single originally heartbreaker was intended to be part of carey s debut film soundtrack glitter however after film s delay it was included on her album rainbow prior to song s radio release carey spoke of it in an interview it s pretty much in classic style of my up tempo classics like fantasy or dreamlover but it s kind of fun and has a new edge to it i think and definitely having jay z takes it to a whole nother level and dj clue makes it really fun and stuff recording and lyrics while developing rainbow carey had different ideas for lead single after writing song s core lyrics and producing main idea and melody dj clue one of earlier producers in project suggested to carey use and incorporation of hook from attack of name game by stacy lattisaw after agreeing to it they incorporated carey s lyrics and melody to hook and began recording song however after completing heartbreaker carey felt it needed a strong male verse hoping for a rising hip hop artist she chose to work with jay z and began re arranging song as he wrote out his verse jay z wrote his entire verse and helped produce some of song s core instrumentals in an interview with fred bronson carey spoke of her experience working with jay z it s fun when you can find someone that you can relate to and that you respect jay z is someone i admire as a writer and as an artist we could be sitting in studio and he can freestyle a rhyme that would be incredible just off top of his head he doesn t need a pen and paper i equate that to a singer who can pick up mike and riff and ad lib over a song and take you to a totally new place aside from her work with clue and jay z carey s longtime friend and background singer trey lorenz also took part in song s production he provided back up vocals in song and took part in several small areas of development of rainbow when interviewed by bronson carey spoke highly of lorenz he s an amazing writer and singer he s so influenced by old school stuff yet he s so current he s known me since before my first album and he s a great loyal friend aside from use of sample and jay z s verses heartbreaker contains strong female empowering lyrics which carey wrote as a sort of anthem especially because she felt that she personally has been in a similar predicament in past composition heartbreaker is a moderately slow mid tempo dance pop track with r b and hip hop influences according to music sheet published at musicnotes com song is written in key of d major while beat is set in common time which moves at a moderate pace of 100 beats per minute it has a sequence of d bm d as its chord progression carey s vocals in song span from note of d3 to high note of c7 song has a percolating beat over which carey sings with nasal silken and declarative vocals verses feature carey s signature melismatic style combined with rapid yet seamless transitions for example carey starts second verse already in mid belt it s a shame to be while then going off into a whispering coo for so euphoric and weak aside from background vocal stylings from lorenz and other females carey added her own lowered vocals into song giving impression of a doubled voice heartbreaker samples 1982 song attack of name game by stacy lattisaw song s hook and loop were taken and incorporated into melody of heartbreaker as well as being used as its main instrumental components lyrics are constructed in verse pre chorus chorus form carey starts with hook gimme your love gimme your love repeated eight times carey repeats chorus four times ending song with a final gimme your love gimme your love chuck taylor from billboard described its instrumentation as a persistent guitar lick and wrote there s an identifiable chorus here and some semblance of verses but more than anything this song comes across as a blur of jumbled in background including carey s own repetitive harmonies which in this case sound more like a competition than a compliment remix song s main remix titled desert storm remix features female rappers da brat and missy elliott it is first of carey s remixes that was produced by desert storm records producer and rapper dj clue who makes an introduction on remix remix contains lyrical interpolations and an instrumental sample from ain t no fun if homies can t have none by snoop dogg in an interview with mtv news carey spoke of song s remix before its official release in august 1999 and then remix i m so excited about remix it s also gonna go on album and it features missy elliott and da brat and it s kinda like a girl power answer record and it s to loop of snoop dogg s ain t no fun they re not ready for that one a separate music video was filmed for remix shot in black and white and featuring a cameo appearance by dogg desert storm remix received mixed reviews from music critics stephen thomas erlewine chose song as one of top three cuts on rainbow alongside original danyel smith from entertainment weekly called it an overblown miscalculation and wrote missy elliott s and da brat s bad sexual politics sink tired heartbreaker remix larry flick from billboard called remix muscular and street savvy and wrote missy elliott and da brat lace rhymes into track which is enhanced by sample from snoop dogg s ain t no fun if homies can t have none critical reception heartbreaker received mixed reviews from contemporary music critics some of whom compared it heavily to carey s previous lead singles dara cook from mtv called song an airy ditty and wrote on song mariah exudes as much sentiment as hollowed out driftwood cook continued onto song s production writing by texturing it into song producers jimmy jam and terry lewis have finally found productive use other than song closing spectacle for mariah s high octave shriek allmusic editor stephen thomas erlewine named heartbreaker as one of his top three choices from album danyel smith from entertainment weekly called song a delectable confection and wrote she smartly uses jay z s droll rap about a bratty girlfriend as tart counterpoint to her creamy tones however calling it a recycled version of carey s previous songs dreamlover 1993 and fantasy 1995 elysa gardner from los angeles times called song breezy and noted how carey brings a similarly light sensuous touch to heartbreaker additionally gardner complimented jay z s rap verses calling them sly editor from rolling stone arion berger called it nasal silken and declarative while riding percolating beat additionally berger also compared it to carey s fantasy for its similar usage of a sampled hook tom sinclair from entertainment weekly reviewed song individually giving it an f he called it a rehash of fantasy and wrote what self respecting artist would have gall to recycle tom tom club s genius of love source of fantasy for a second time in four years it s a given that pop will eat itself but this sort of self cannibalization should be illegal however sample used in heartbreaker feat jay z was not same sample as one used in fantasy chuck taylor from billboard gave song
