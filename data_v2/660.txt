operation obviate was an unsuccessful british air raid of world war ii that targeted german battleship tirpitz it was conducted by royal air force heavy bombers on 29 october 1944 and sought to destroy damaged battleship after she moved to a new anchorage near tromso in northern norway attack followed up successful operation paravane on 15 september 1944 when tirpitz was crippled by british heavy bombers as allied intelligence was unaware that battleship could no longer operate at sea and warships needed elsewhere were being retained in british waters to counter her it was decided to make another attack after a period of planning and preparations 38 british bombers and a film aircraft departed from bases in northern scotland during early hours of 29 october attack took place that morning but was frustrated by clouds over tromso area which made it difficult for allied airmen to accurately target tirpitz battleship was not directly hit but was damaged by a bomb that exploded near her hull a british bomber made a crash landing in sweden after being hit by german anti aircraft fire and several others were damaged allies remained committed to sinking tirpitz after failure of operation obviate plans for attack were reused for next raid on battleship operation catechism which took place on 12 november 1944 weather conditions were favourable for attackers and tirpitz was sunk with heavy loss of life background from early 1942 german battleship tirpitz posed a significant threat to allied convoys transporting supplies through norwegian sea to soviet union stationed in fjords on norwegian coast ship was capable of overwhelming close escort forces assigned to arctic convoys tirpitz could also potentially attempt to enter north atlantic to attack allied convoys travelling to united kingdom as her sister ship german battleship bismarck bismarck had sought to do in may 1941 to counter these threats allies needed to keep a powerful force of warships with british home fleet and capital ships accompanied most convoys part of way to soviet union tirpitz was repeatedly attacked by british forces royal air force raf heavy bombers made four unsuccessful raids on battleship between january and april 1942 while she was stationed at faettenfjord from march 1943 was based at kaafjord in far north of norway during operation source on 22 september 1943 she was severely damaged by explosives placed on her hull by royal navy personnel who had used midget submarines to penetrate kaafjord on 3 april 1944 aircraft flying from royal navy aircraft carriers attacked tirpitz during operation tungsten and inflicted further damage this attack had been timed for when it was believed repairs to rectify damage caused by operation source were nearing completion a series of subsequent aircraft carrier attacks including operation mascot on 17 july and operation goodwood between 22 and 29 august were unsuccessful as it was believed that further aircraft carrier raids would be fruitless due to shortcomings with royal navy s aircraft and their armament responsibility for sinking tirpitz was transferred to raf s bomber command on 15 september 1944 elite nos 9 and 617 squadrons attacked battleship at kaafjord during what was designated operation paravane this operation employed avro lancaster heavy bombers armed with tallboy bombs and johnnie walker mines and was mounted from yagodnik in soviet union tirpitz was struck by a single tallboy which caused extensive damage to her bow and rendered her unfit for combat prelude a meeting involving grand admiral karl donitz commander of german navy was held in berlin on 23 september to discuss tirpitz donitz was informed that it would take nine months to repair ship and that all work had to be done at kaafjord as battleship would be extremely vulnerable if she tried to sail to a major port as soviet forces were rapidly advancing towards northern norway at that time donitz judged that it was not feasible to either return ship to ocean going service or retain her at kaafjord instead he decided to use tirpitz as a floating artillery battery to defend tromso against amphibious landings and bolster a defensive line which was being prepared in area donitz also expressed hope that retaining ship in commission would continue to tie down enemy forces and by her presence confound enemies intentions commander of german navy s task force in northern norway konteradmiral rudolf peters was directed to position tirpitz at a location near tromso where water was shallow enough to prevent battleship from sinking completely if she suffered further damage an anchorage was selected just off coast of small island of hakoya west of tromso this location lacked natural defences tirpitz had enjoyed at her previous norwegian bases where she had sheltered in fjords which had steep mountains rising from sea this had made it difficult for attacking aircraft to spot and target battleship instead terrain around hakoya was fairly flat and it was near sea to prepare tirpitz for voyage south west a repair ship was sent to kaafjord and helped battleship s crew to weld steel plates over hole in her hull allies were able to confirm that tirpitz had been badly damaged during operation paravane from intelligence gained by photo reconnaissance signals intelligence and norwegian agents but were unsure if this had permanently put her out of service decision made by donitz on 23 september was also not known as a result royal navy continued to assign capital ships to home fleet to guard against prospect of tirpitz putting to sea despite need to redeploy these ships to pacific to reinforce attacks on japanese forces tirpitzs voyage to tromso took place during 15 and 16 october battleship departed kaafjord at noon local time on 15 october under escort of several warships while tirpitz was able to move under her own power flotilla included ocean going tugboats tasked with towing battleship if her damaged bow broke off german force slowly proceeded south and tirpitz eventually arrived at her berth off hakoya at 3 pm on 16 october soon after reaching hakoya 600 sailors mostly members of her engine room crew were removed from ship this left about 1 700 sailors on board allies rapidly responded to tirpitzs redeployment norwegian secret intelligence service sis agents in kaafjord and tromso areas provided reports during battleship s journey egil lindberg radioing united kingdom on 16 october to confirm ship s arrival there in response to these reports british aircraft carrier was dispatched from home fleet s main base at scapa flow on 16 october tasked with confirming location of tirpitz raf was also instructed to fly photo reconnaissance sorties over tromso area as a precaution in case tirpitz was able to conduct combat operations battleship was diverted from an impending deployment to indian ocean to reinforce home fleet until its sole battleship completed repairs british reconnaissance aircraft located tirpitz during afternoon of 18 october first aircraft to arrive over area was a de havilland mosquito from no 540 squadron raf operating out of raf dyce in scotland mosquito s crew took photographs of battleship from a high altitude and returned to base despite damage by anti aircraft guns shortly afterwards implacables fairey firefly aircraft reconnoitred tromso area several taking low altitude photographs of tirpitz off hakoya these aircraft were also fired on by german anti aircraft guns but none were damaged during evening of 18 october implacables commander sought permission to attack tirpitz next day but this was refused by commander of home fleet admiral bruce fraser on grounds that carrier had sailed without any of supermarine seafire aircraft needed to suppress anti aircraft guns fraser was also aware from attacks on tirpitz at kaafjord that carrier s two squadrons of fairey barracuda dive bombers would probably not be able to inflict significant damage and that further raids by raf heavy bombers were required preparations british thumb alt black and white photograph of six aerial bombs resting on stands in an open area six tallboy bombs prior to being loaded on no 9 squadron aircraft in october or november 1944 raf began preparations to attack tirpitz again immediately after she was confirmed to be at tromso as tromso area was within range of lancasters flying from northern scotland if they were fitted with extra fuel tanks and other modifications this operation would be simpler to conduct than operation paravane nevertheless it required a lengthy return flight of nos 9 and 617 squadrons lancasters were modified to extend their range all of aircraft selected for operation were fitted with powerful rolls royce merlin 24 engines which were hurriedly sourced from maintenance units and airfields across uk lancasters also carried two extra fuel tanks inside their fuselage a tank usually fitted to vickers wellington bombers and a type of drop tank used by mosquitos extra fuel put aircraft greatly above their authorised maximum take off weight to address this bombers forward and mid upper gun turrets were removed along with 3 000 rounds of ammunition from rear turret flare chute armour plating around pilot s seat and some of oxygen and nitrogen bottles reduction in armament left lancasters very vulnerable to german fighter aircraft and they would have to fly without escort as no british fighters had sufficient range to reach tromso operational order for attack on tirpitz was issued by no 5 group on 24 october it specified that battleship was to be attacked by 36 lancasters nos 9 and 617 squadrons each contributing 18 another lancaster from no 463 squadron raaf s film unit would also take part but not carry any bombs as johnnie walker mines had failed during operation paravane only tallboy bombs were to be used each bomber carrying one of weapons these bombs were largest in service with raf and were capable of penetrating heavily armoured targets two squadrons were to remain at their home bases until it was judged that weather conditions over tromso were likely to be suitable they would then be bombed up and fly to raf kinloss raf lossiemouth and raf milltown in northern scotland operational order stated that attack was required as it appears likely that germans may attempt to get battleship back to a base in germany where necessary repairs and refit can be carried out after decision was made to launch attack bombers were to fly individually across norwegian sea and cross norwegian coast at a point between mosjoen and where no 100 group raf had found a gap in german radar coverage lancasters were to rendezvous over tornetrask lake in northern sweden this flight path involved violating sweden s neutrality but was selected as it would allow bombers to approach tromso from south east which it was believed germans would not expect after rendezvous was completed and if weather conditions remained suitable bombers would proceed to tromso and attack tirpitz if she could be visually spotted or if obscured her location confirmed relative to unobstructed landmarks if these criteria were not met aircrew were not to bomb following attack on tirpitz bombers were to fly directly back to scotland group captain colin mcmullen was selected to command ground crew and aircrew ahead of start of attack a role he had also played in operation paravane commanders of two squadrons wing commanders james bazin no 9 squadron and willie tait no 617 squadron would control their units in air attack was designated operation obviate preparations were also made to recover aircraft or crews if any of bombers ran short of fuel or suffered battle damage raf sumburgh in shetland was selected as emergency airfield for return journey from tromso if any of bombers experienced engine problems or lacked sufficient fuel to return to uk they were to proceed to soviet airfields at vaenga or yagodnik soviet government was not informed of this until 29 october day of attack no 5 group also requested that three royal navy destroyers be stationed along return route from tromso to rescue crews of any bombers forced down over norwegian sea british were able to draw on two intelligence sources other than photo reconnaissance flights to monitor german forces at tromso lindberg was based there and provided updates on tirpitz by radio as lindberg worked in local meteorological office he also regularly reported on weather conditions other source of intelligence was german radio traffic decrypted by allied codebreakers was particularly vulnerable to attack in period immediately after she arrived at hakoya none of many smoke generators and anti aircraft guns which had protected her against air attack at kaafjord were initially available because they had not yet been shipped south only protection available was from battleship s own armament two flak ships anchored nearby and several anti aircraft batteries in tromso area british intelligence believed that there were 16 heavy and 16 light anti aircraft guns in area at time of operation obviate battleship was also surrounded by torpedo nets no fighter aircraft were stationed nearby depth of water below tirpitz at her mooring was greater than anticipated leaving ship vulnerable to capsizing due to space needed by torpedo nets it was not possible to move tirpitz closer to shore instead work began on building up seabed using earth and gravel two weeks after she reached hakoya battleship s crew expected further air attacks and doubted that she would survive them this and a belief that germany would lose war led to poor morale civilian population of tromso also expected air attacks after tirpitz arrived and were concerned about prospect of being accidentally bombed attack departure on 26 october bomber command advised admiralty that operation obviate would commence as soon as weather conditions permitted after night of 27 october no 5 group also informed two squadrons that day to make final preparations for mission this included loading tallboy bombs in evening of 27 october aircrew selected for operation obviate were briefed on plan and told they would proceed to scottish airfields next morning during morning of 28 october 20 lancasters from each of squadrons flew from their home bases to kinloss lossiemouth and milltown a photo reconnaissance mosquito flew over tromso that morning and confirmed that tirpitz was still moored off hakoya and that weather conditions remained favourable for an attack as forecasts for next day indicated that good weather would continue attack was set for 29 october another mosquito flew over tromso area at midnight on 28 october and reported that conditions remained clear strike force departed scotland in early hours of 29 october no 9 squadron dispatched 20 lancasters aircraft taking off between 1 18 and 2 55 am bst no 617 squadron contributed 19 aircraft which departed between 1 03 and 2 10 am bst no 463 squadron lancaster accompanied attack aircraft over tromso approach flight was uneventful aircraft flew individually across norwegian sea at an altitude of and began climbing to after they crossed norwegian coast one of no 9 squadron aircraft experienced engine problems during climb and returned to uk bombers rendezvoused over tornetrask lake formed up into their attack formations and proceeded to tromso during this flight lancasters climbed to their bombing altitudes of between attack force was fired on by swedish anti aircraft guns when it passed near but no hits were recorded attack on tirpitz was frustrated by cloud cover while weather continued to be fine during approach to tromso british airmen found that surrounding area was mainly covered by cloud tirpitz was visible when bombers first arrived over tromso area but was obscured before any of them were in position to release their bombs despite orders to bring their tallboys back if visual bombing was not possible almost all of bombers attacked historian patrick bishop has written that this was due to an unwillingness to make long return flight carrying a bomb first bombs were dropped at 7 49 am gmt no 617 squadron leading attack sixteen aircraft from squadron released tallboys aimed at tirpitzs estimated position several making multiple bomb runs before attacking one of three lancasters which did not bomb made four runs over tromso before tait gave its pilot permission to break off attack no 9 squadron began its attack six minutes after its sister squadron seventeen lancasters dropping tallboys like no 617 squadron several aircraft from no 9 squadron made multiple bomb runs over tromso one conducting five approaches before attacking at least two of no 9 squadron crews were able to visually aim at tirpitz through gaps in cloud others aimed at battleship s estimated position of two no 9 squadron aircraft which did not bomb one made two passes over tromso final bomb was dropped at 8 07 am gmt german defenders began firing on british aircraft as they approached tirpitz four no 9 squadron lancasters at least one from no 617 squadron and no 463 squadron film aircraft were damaged by anti aircraft fire no 617 squadron lancaster lost so much fuel from two hits that its pilot judged that aircraft would not be able to reach raf sumburgh or ussr instead he decided to put down in northern sweden so that crew could avoid being made prisoners of war aircraft made a crash landing in a bog near all of crew survived and were eventually repatriated to uk by swedish government damage inflicted on other lancasters was not significant none of tallboys struck tirpitz several landed in water near her explosion of one of these bombs damaged battleship s port side propeller shaft and rudder and caused flooding three of her crew were injured explosions from huge bombs were felt by civilians in tromso aftermath most of lancasters return flights were uneventful all returning to uk after completing flights of an average duration of 13 hours a no 617 squadron aircraft made an emergency landing at raf sumburgh after running short of fuel this was one of lancasters that had not released its tallboy damaged no 463 squadron aircraft successfully landed on one wheel at raf waddington airmen were aware that tirpitz had not been sunk and were disappointed with operation s results no 5 group s commander air commodore ralph cochrane sent them a message stating congratulations on your splendid flight and perseverance luck won t always favour tirpitz one day you ll get her allied intelligence soon learned that tirpitz had been only slightly damaged a mosquito conducted a photo reconnaissance flight over tromso area at 12 10 pm gmt on 29 october its photos showed no visible damage to battleship german post battle reports broadcast by radio which were intercepted and decoded confirmed that damage was limited to propeller shaft and rudder lindberg recommended that raf give her another salvo in one of his reports germans believed that several lancasters had been shot down in attack tirpitzs crew attributed failure of operation obviate to their ship s gunnery leading to improved morale they expected that further attacks would be made and were frustrated that luftwaffe fighters had not been available to protect battleship a force of 38 fighters was transferred to bardufoss after operation obviate to bolster region s air defences british remained determined to sink tirpitz as soon as possible shortly after 29 october raid it was decided to use same plans as had been employed in operation obviate in next attack which was designated operation catechism on 12 november nos 9 and 617 squadrons set out from northern scotland again weather over tromso area was clear when they arrived and tirpitz was hit by two tallboy bombs damage from these bombs and several near misses caused battleship to capsize between 940 and 1 204 of her crew were killed references citations works consulted category aerial operations and battles
