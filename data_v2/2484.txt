employees and restaurant employees union local 54 represented about 12 000 workers 10 000 of whom were employed in atlantic city casinos almost all of these casino workers had been organized since legalization of gambling in state on may 13 1981 casino control commission found that frank gerace president of local 54 and frank materio local s grievance manager were associated with organized crime commission also ruled that karlos lasane union s business agent was ineligible to be a union officer or agent because he had previously been convicted of extortion commission also found that union officers refused to cooperate with casino control commission investigators and held stock in resorts international inc which owned one of casinos in which local 54 represented workers both actions contravened state regulations commission feared that local 54 was being influenced by little nicky scarfo a reputed leader of scarfo organized crime family based in philadelphia national and state afl cio officials fearing new jersey law might open door to extensive new state regulation of labor unions asked local 54 to test new jersey law in court after a regulatory appeal casino control commission unanimously rejected union s contention that law was unconstitutional and preempted by nlra janson casino agency rebuts attack by local union new york times august 6 1981 local 54 then filed suit in federal district court seeking a permanent injunction prohibiting enforcement of act at trial union argued that law infringed on its members constitutional right of freedom of association and was preempted by federal labor law state countered that regulation was a permissible infringement of freedom of association because keeping criminal elements out of gaming industry was a compelling governmental interest on march 22 1982 united states district court for district of new jersey held that new jersey statute was not unconstitutionally vague and did not impermissibly infringe on union members first amendment rights union appealed while appeal was pending casino control commission ordered gerace and materio to vacate their union positions commission demanded that both men relinquish their union offices by october 12 1982 or local would not be permitted to collect dues or administer its pension plan wade leaders ordered out of casino workers union associated press september 28 1982 on june 30 1983 a three judge panel of united states court of appeals for third circuit ruled 2 to 1 that district court had erred appellate court granted union s injunction finding that section 93 of act was preempted by section 7 of nlra janson court hears appeal by casino union new york times november 21 1982 court of appeals relied heavily on supreme court s decision in hill v florida ex rel watson 325 u s 538 1945 when it concluded that section 7 conferred an unfettered right on employees to choose officials of their own bargaining representatives brown 468 u s at 504 state sought a rehearing en banc but entire court of appeals refused to rehear case after it deadlocked in a 5 to 5 vote janson court won t rehear case on casino union control new york times july 6 1983 state appealed to u s supreme court which granted certiorari 464 u s 990 1983 decision justice sandra day o connor delivered opinion of court in which chief justice burger and justices harry blackmun and william rehnquist joined justice byron white joined by justices lewis f powell jr and john paul stevens dissented justices william j brennan jr and thurgood marshall did not participate in hearing or decision of case majority opinion justice o connor concluded that section 7 of nlra did not contain explicit pre emptive language nor indicate congressional intent to usurp a state role in labor management relations a consideration for vitality of our federal system and for a rational allocation of functions belies any easy inference that congress intended to deprive states of their ability to retain jurisdiction over such matters brown 468 u s at 503 o connor then rejected appellate court s reading of hill v florida ex rel watson subsequent to hill o connor noted congress had enacted labor management reporting and disclosure act landrum griffin act section 504 a of landrum griffin act explicitly barred from office for a five year period union officers convicted of any number of crimes by enacting section 504 a o connor concluded congress unmistakably indicated that right of employees to select officers of their bargaining representatives is not absolute brown 468 u s at 505 citing plurality opinion in de v braisted o connor noted that court had previously held that landrum griffin act had not preempted role of state legislation in regulating union officials o connor next addressed new jersey statute s enforcement mechanism o connor recognized continuing controlling nature of hill in this regard and acknowledged that questions of constitutionality and preemption must be assessed independently in terms of its potential conflict with federal enactment brown 468 u s at 510 o connor concluded however that record was too incomplete on this issue and remanded issue to appellate court so that it could order further proceedings dissenting opinion justice white writing for dissent argued that linkage between section 93 and section 86 of new jersey act rendered act preempted by federal law if section 86 merely imposed qualifications on union officials white concluded law would not be preempted by nlra brown 468 u s at 513 14 white j dissenting but act went far beyond that and imposed sweeping penalties on union for dissent this proved critical it is not clear what portion of statute court upholds since it expressly refuses to decide whether dues prohibition and fund administration provisions are valid section 93 b does nothing more than impose those two restrictions on unions whose officials are disqualified under criteria set forth in ss 86 it does not by its terms provide a mechanism for disqualifying any union officer therefore while it appears that court holds that a state is free to disqualify certain individuals from acting as union officials as long as it does not impose sanctions on union itself it is not clear that anything in ss 93 b enables state to do that brown 468 u s at 514 fn 1 white noted that although section 7 of nlra granted employees absolute right to choose collective bargaining representatives of their choosing that right was not coextensive with less absolute right to determine who should serve as officers in that organization brown 468 u s at 514 fn 3 in current case white noted workers had chosen an organization rather than an individual as their collective bargaining agent white agreed with majority that state can impose qualifications on officers of local 54 but language of section 7 of nlra as well as court s ruling in hill permitted state to impose sanctions only on officers not on union interfering with relatively untrammeled right of union to carry out its duties as collective bargaining agent was impermissible as a matter of federal law allowing state to so restrict union s conduct infringes on employees right to bargain collectively through representative of their own choosing because it prevents that representative from functioning as a collective bargaining agent a union which cannot sustain itself financially obviously cannot effectively engage in collective bargaining activities on behalf of its members brown 468 u s at 515 record white noted was quite clear in showing that local 54 would not be able to function if either of casino control commission s sanctions were imposed only one of commission s sanctions denying union right to collect dues had been imposed majority argued that since other sanction denying union right to administer its pension and benefit funds had not been imposed this made matter unripe for review by court 468 u s at 512 thus white would have overturned statute on grounds of preemption under section 7 of nlra i am willing to hold that as a matter of law a statute like ss 93 b which prohibits a union from collecting dues from its members impairs union s ability to represent those members to such an extent that it infringes on their ss 7 right to bargain through representative of their choice brown 468 u s at 515 16 consequences of ruling gerace resigned shortly after supreme court s ruling however local 54 immediately rehired gerace as a 48 000 a year consultant casino control commission declared this a subterfuge gaming commission declined to impose either of its statutory sanctions and instead sought a court injunction forcing gerace to resign his consultancy in november 1984 a new jersey state superior court ruled that gaming commission had right to force gerace s resignation gerace initially fought court s order but eventually resigned after concluding that continuing legal battle would be disruptive to operation of union materio and lasane also resigned but were later hired by union as business agents to handle non casino related matters janson state to keep monitoring casino union new york times december 16 1984 five years after ruling in brown v hotel and restaurant employees union an academic study concluded that casino control act had been only marginally successful in preventing or eliminating organized crime influence in new jersey s casino unions study noted that law had not been used since its initial 1981 enforcement action and that many union officials were merely rehired as consultants rather than as elected officers state gaming commission never again attempted to use its two statutory sanctions against any union and relied instead on threat of injunctions to remove officials it suspected of links to organized crime see also list of united states supreme court cases volume 468 notes references court rules new jersey can
