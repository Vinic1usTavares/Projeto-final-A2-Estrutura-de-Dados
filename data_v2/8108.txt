illecillewaet glacier is a glacier in british columbia canada it is located inside glacier national park in selkirk mountains a sub range of columbia mountains after construction of canadian pacific railway cpr near glacier s terminus and building of a hotel nearby glacier became a prominent tourist destination in canadian west easily accessible by road and railway it is one of most studied glaciers in north america its retreat over last one hundred years has been extensively documented physical characteristics glacier is located south of mount sir donald in selkirk mountains west of rogers pass in british columbia outflow of glacier forms headwaters of illecillewaet river illecillewaet neve feeds three other glaciers asulkan geikie and deville as of 2002 accumulation area of glacier is while its ablation area is for a total size of its estimated mean depth is and its highest point is measured at exposed bedrock downslope of glacier s terminus shows effects of glacial plucking history cpr and glacier house thumb 225px a visitor to glacier in 1902 although first nations people were present in valleys to east and west evidence of aboriginal settlement in illecillewaet area has not been found first european to visit glacier was major a b rogers a railway surveyor who examined area in 1882 and 1883 in search of a viable pass with completion of transcontinental canadian pacific railway cpr through nearby rogers pass in 1885 glacier and its surrounding area became one of western canada s first tourist destinations glacier national park was established in 1886 and glacier house a small hotel was built near north end of glacier in same year hotel was expanded in 1892 and 1904 and by 1907 glacier was described as most visited glacier in americas at this point glacier was called great glacier by cpr promoters name illecillewaet is an okanagan first nations word for big water and referred to river before being applied to glacier it gradually replaced great and was adopted by parks canada in 1960s thumb left 225px mary vaux in 1914 new influx of visitors to glacier brought with it both mountaineers and first recorded ascent of glacier was by a o wheeler with edward feuz and charles clarke in 1901 although it had most likely been climbed earlier wheeler and alpine club of canada built a hut near glacier house for mountaineering use feuz was one of several swiss guides hired by cpr to accompany visitors to glacier and up nearby peaks vaux family vaux family were well off quakers from pennsylvania family first visited glacier house and illecillewaet glacier in 1887 on a subsequent trip they noticed a visible retreat of glacier s terminus vaux children william george jr and mary later mary vaux walcott were amateur photographers and began a study of glacier using pictures taken from fixed points william and george jr presented their findings to national academy of sciences in u s their study and methods were considered a breakthrough in new field of glaciology mary vaux would continue to visit area every summer until her death in 1940 on a more anecdotal level vaux family carefully photographed glacier and surrounding area first using glass plates which were transported up and down mountain and sent back to philadelphia and later more modern mamiya medium format cameras there is continuing photographic evidence to support their more scientific measurements george vaux jr s grandson henry vaux jr also an alpine photographer noted static nature of glacier s alpine area related to its short growing seasons only two major differences between contemporary times and early 1900s are retreat of glacier and presence of trans canada highway thus he saw trees that were observed by his grandfather from same perspective and there is little difference except for glaciers most of which are back at least two kilometres and of man made things there are also other organizations that have compiled photographic records unfortunately there have been lapses in coverage and discontinuity in system trans canada highway in 1916 cpr constructed connaught tunnel which bypassed glacier house site numbers of visitors declined and in 1925 hotel was closed it was demolished in 1929 for a thirty year period previously popular glacier was mostly unvisited in 1962 new trans canada highway was completed and its route closely followed that of original cpr line once again illecillewaet was joined with a major transportation route parks canada began to improve facilities at glacier illecillewaet campground was opened and new trails were constructed giving access to glacier now located significantly farther away latter half of century saw more glaciological studies as glacier s retreat became more pronounced glaciological studies thumb image of glacier in early 1900s although sparse compared with studies of european glaciers studies of illecillewaet are detailed by north american standards first scientific study of glacier was performed by vaux family from 1887 to 1912 george william and mary vaux with others including a o wheeler and c e webb measured glacial retreat mostly with annual photos from fixed points period of world war i and great depression saw fewer observations closing of glacier house in 1925 drastically reduced number of visitors to area federal dominion water and power bureau started assessing glacier in 1945 using baseline measurements bureau conducted yearly studies from 1945 to 1950 and every two years from 1950 to 1960 there were no measurements taken from 1960 to 1972 when parks canada began surveying a study which examines rock lichen in order to determine glacial retreat was begun in 1996 satellite imagery has also been used to measure glacier s size retreat since scientific research began in late 1800s illecillewaet glacier has been retreating and shrinking with shorter periods of small advances between 1887 and 1962 terminus of glacier retreated almost parks canada research indicates that there was a period of advancement from 1972 to 1986 with terminus advancing in total there was a net retreat of in period of 1887 to 1984 glacier lost about 28 of its mass by 1951 it regained maybe 1 by 1986 see also canadian pacific hotels references footnotes sources further reading original glaciology studies external
