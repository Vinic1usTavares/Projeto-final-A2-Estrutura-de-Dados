russian ironclad kreml was third and last broadside ironclad built for imperial russian navy during mid 1860s she joined baltic fleet upon completion and accidentally sank a russian frigate in 1869 ship was assigned to gunnery training detachment in 1870 and was frequently rearmed kreml sank in shallow water after a storm in 1885 she was refloated and returned to service ship was placed in reserve in 1904 and disarmed following year before being sold for scrap in 1908 design and description class ironclads were designed as coastal defence ships to protect approaches to saint petersburg and were referred to as self propelled armored floating batteries as such heavy armament and protection were most important factors in their design mclaughlin pp 115 kreml was long overall with a beam of and a mean draft of displacing at full load she was somewhat larger than her half sisters and displaced over more she was fitted with a ram bow and lacked stern ram of her half sisters based on experiences with her sister bilge keels deep and long were fitted to reduce ship s rolling ship did not steer well and historian stephen mclaughlin notes that she had an unpredictable habit of suddenly lurching to one side or another probably as a result of poor water flow to rudder kreml required six men to man her wheel and her total crew numbered 459 officers and enlisted men mclaughlin pp 117 19 as a cost cutting measure ship received refurbished horizontal trunk steam engine from wooden frigate built by carr and macpherson of saint petersburg it had two cylinders each with a bore of and a stroke of using steam produced by four rectangular fire tube boilers to drive a single propeller engine was designed to produce and gave ship a maximum speed of during her sea trials on 18 october 1866 kremls boilers proved to be unable to last more than about a decade in service before they had to be replaced notably in 1876 1886 1892 and 1901 to save money replacement boilers were taken from retiring ships and reconditioned before installation in kreml mclaughlin pp 117 125 26 ship was intended to be rigged as a three masted schooner like her half sisters but her first captain suggested that her fore and mainmasts be square rigged to take advantage of her more seaworthy hull form kremls masts were hollow iron and were used to ventilate lower decks first such masts in imperial russian navy to protect her sailors who determined depth of water under keel in combat kreml was fitted with two sounding tubes that led from gun deck through bottom of hull mclaughlin pp 119 126 kreml was completed with 17 of most powerful guns available to russians 60 pounder smoothbore gun fifteen were mounted on broadside and two guns were placed in pivot mounts on upper deck to serve as chase guns unfortunately it proved to be incapable of penetrating of wrought iron armor at a distance of only during trials in 1859 60 despite this ship continued to be armed with varying numbers of these guns as well as rifled guns throughout her career her upper deck armament changed even more frequently and used different configurations of and 8 inch rifled guns in addition to varying numbers of smaller guns mclaughlin pp 114 121 22 ship s armor configuration differed from that of her half sisters most of her side was covered by of wrought iron armor but transverse armored bulkheads of same thickness protected gun deck from raking fire and upper part of hull outside bulkheads was unprotected teak backing of armor was increased to kremls deck had a maximum thickness of conning tower was also protected by 4 5 inches of armor ship s hull was divided by four watertight transverse and two longitudinal bulkheads for protection against underwater damage mclaughlin pp 117 122 124 construction and service kreml named after kremlin silverstone p 378 was ordered on 20 april 1863 when a contract was signed with russian shipbuilder semiannikov poletika for a total cost of 898 000 rubles construction had not yet begun when russian admiralty board amended contract on 20 july to shorten construction time by one year for a payment of an extra 48 000 rubles in response to adverse foreign reaction to brutal russian suppression of revolts in poland and lithuania that year fearing attack by britain and france board switched priority to smaller s shortly afterwards in belief that they could be completed more quickly so that progress on kreml slowed to a crawl once construction began on 2 october ship was not formally laid down until 23 december and she was launched on 26 august 1865 mclaughlin pp 115 16 ship entered service in 1866 with baltic fleet she accidentally collided with and sank wooden steam frigate on 15 august 1869 killing 16 men from oleg but kreml was only slightly damaged she was assigned to gunnery training detachment in march 1870 and remained with it for bulk of her career in november 1881 steam powered steering gear taken from ironclad was installed which required installation of a high pressure donkey boiler in cramped boiler room this proved to be more trouble than it was worth and was removed two years later kreml was caught by a storm on 10 june 1885 while sailing for reval tallinn and began taking on so much water that her captain decided to make for shallow water she reached kunda bay on estonian coast under sail alone after her engine bearings overheated and forced engine to be stopped once there progressive flooding continued through ventilation shafts sounding tubes and defective valves in internal bulkheads and ship sank in of water kreml was refloated on five days later and repaired in kronstadt she was reclassified as coast defense ironclad on 13 february 1892 and placed in reserve on 24 december 1904 kreml was disarmed and turned over to port of kronstadt for disposal on 15 september 1905 she was stricken from navy list on 12 october and sold for scrap on 8 september 1908 mclaughlin pp 119 121 128
