thumb alt diagram with colored regions minnesota river valley subprovince collided with and overrode superior province 500 px algoman orogeny known as kenoran orogeny in canada was an episode of mountain building orogeny during late archean eon that involved repeated episodes of continental collisions compressions and superior province and minnesota river valley terrane collided about 2 700 to 2 500 million years ago collision folded earth s crust and produced enough heat and pressure to metamorphose rock blocks were added to superior province along a boundary that stretches from present day eastern south dakota into lake huron area algoman orogeny brought eon to a close about it lasted less than 100 million years and marks a major change in development of earth s crust canadian shield contains belts of metavolcanic and metasedimentary rocks formed by action of metamorphism on volcanic and sedimentary rock areas between individual belts consist of granites or granitic gneisses that form fault zones these two types of belts can be seen in wabigoon quetico and wawa subprovinces wabigoon and wawa are of volcanic origin and quetico is of sedimentary origin these three subprovinces lie linearly in southwestern to northeastern oriented belts about wide on southern portion of superior province slave province and portions of nain province were also affected between about 2 000 and these combined with sask and wyoming cratons to form first supercontinent supercontinent overview through most of archean eon earth had a heat production at least twice that of present which caused tectonic processes to be more active as a result plates and continents were smaller no broad blocks as old as 3 ga are found in precambrian shields toward end of archean however some of these blocks or terranes came together to form larger blocks welded together by greenstone belts two such terranes that now form part of canadian shield collided about these were superior province and large minnesota river valley terrane former composed mainly of granite and latter of gneiss this led to mountain building episode known as algoman orogeny in u s named for algoma county wisconsin and kenoran orogeny in canada its duration is estimated at 50 to 100 million years current boundary between these terranes is known as great lakes tectonic zone gltz this zone is wide and extends in a line roughly 1 200 kilometers long from middle of south dakota east through middle of upper peninsula of michigan into sudbury ontario region region remains slightly active today rifting in gltz began about at end of algoman orogeny orogeny affected adjacent regions of northern minnesota and ontario in superior province as well as slave and eastern part of nain province a far wider region of influence than in subsequent orogenies it is earliest datable orogeny in north america and brought archean eon to a close end of archean eon marks a major change in development of earth s crust crust was essentially formed and achieved thicknesses of about under continents tectonics collision between terranes folded earth s crust and produced enough heat and pressure to metamorphose then existing rock repeated continental collisions compression along a north south axis and subduction resulted in uprising of algoman mountains this was followed by intrusions of granite plutons and batholithic domes within gneisses about two examples are sacred heart granite of southwestern minnesota and watersmeet domes metamorphosed gabbros that straddle border of wisconsin and michigan s upper peninsula after intrusions solidified new stresses on greenstone belt caused movement horizontally along several faults and moved huge blocks of crust vertically relative to adjacent blocks this combination of folding intrusion and faulting built mountain ranges throughout northern minnesota northern wisconsin michigan s upper peninsula and southernmost ontario igneous and high grade metamorphic rocks are associated with orogeny by extrapolating now eroded and tilted beds upward geologists have determined that these mountains were several kilometers high similar projections of tilted beds downward coupled with geophysical measurements on greenstone belts in canada suggest metavolcanic and metasedimentary rocks of belts project downward at least a few kilometers greenstone action of metamorphism on border between granite and gneiss bodies produces a succession of metamorphosed volcanic and sedimentary rocks called greenstone belts most archean volcanic rocks are concentrated within greenstone belts green color comes from minerals such as chlorite epidote and that formed during metamorphism after metamorphism occurred these rocks were folded and faulted into a system of mountains by algoman orogeny volcanic beds are thick about greenstone belt was subjected to new stresses that caused movement along several faults faulting on both small and large scales is typical of greenstone belt deformation these faults show both vertical and horizontal movement relative to adjacent blocks large scale faults typically occur along margins of greenstone belts where they are in contact with enclosed granitic rocks vertical movement may be thousands of meters and horizontal movements of many kilometers occur along some fault zones some time before masses of magma intruded under and within igneous and sedimentary rocks heating and pressing rocks to metamorphose them into hard greenish greenstones they began with fissure eruptions of basalt continued with intermediate and felsic rocks erupted from volcanic centers and ended with deposition of sediments from erosion of volcanic pile rising magma was extruded under a shallow ancient sea where it cooled to form greenstones some of minnesota s pillows probably cooled at depths as great as and contain no gas cavities or vesicles most greenstone belts with all of their components have been folded into synclines original basaltic rock which was on bottom occurs on outer margins of trough overlying younger rock units rhyolites and greywackes occur closer to center of syncline rocks are so intensely folded that most have been tilted nearly 90deg with tops of layers on one side of belt facing those on other side rock sequences are in effect lying on their sides folding can be so complex that a single layer may be exposed at surface many times by subsequent erosion volcanic activity as greenstone belts were forming volcanoes ejected tephra into air which settled as sediments to become compacted into greywackes and mudstones of knife lake and lake vermilion formations greywackes are poorly sorted mixtures of clay mica and quartz that may be derived from decomposition of pyroclastic debris presence of this debris suggests that some explosive volcanic activity had occurred in area earlier volcanism took place on surface and other deformations took place at various depths numerous earthquakes accompanied volcanism and faulting superior province thumb right alt black and white map with textured regions wawa quetico and wabigoon subprovinces superior province forms core of both north american continent and canadian shield and has a thickness of at least its granites date from 2 700 to 2 500 million years ago it was formed by welding together of many small terranes ages of which decrease away from nucleus this progression is illustrated by age of wabigoon quetico and wawa subprovinces discussed in their individual sections later terranes docked on periphery of continental masses with developing between fused nuclei and oceanic crust in general superior province consists of east west trending belts of predominately volcanic rocks alternating with belts of sedimentary and rocks due to down warping along elongate zones each belt is essentially a large or block areas between individual belts are fault zones consisting of granite or granitic gneiss its western part contains a regional pattern of east west trending wide granitic greenstone and metasedimentary belts subprovinces western superior province s mantle has remained intact since 2 700 million year ago accretion of subprovinces both folding and faulting can be seen in wabigoon quetico and wawa subprovinces these three subprovinces lie linearly in southwestern to northeastern oriented belts of about wide see figure on right northernmost and widest province is wabigoon it begins in north central minnesota and continues northeasterly into central ontario it is partially interrupted by southern province immediately to south quetico subprovince extends as far west in north central minnesota and extends further to northeast it is completely interrupted by a narrow band of 1 100 to 1 550 million year old southern province to northeast of thunder bay wawa subprovince is most southerly of three it begins in central minnesota continues northeast to thunder bay ontario canada where its southern border just skims north thunder bay and then extends east beyond lake superior northern boundary continues in a roughly northeasterly heading while southern border dips south to follow northeast shore of lake superior fault zones three subprovinces are separated by steeply dipping shear zones caused by continued compression that occurred during algoman orogeny these boundaries are major fault zones boundary between wabigoon and quetico subprovinces seems to have been also controlled by colliding plates and subsequent this rainy lake seine river fault zone is a major northeast southwest trending strike slip fault zone it trends to cut through northwest part of voyageurs national park in minnesota and extends westward to near international falls minnesota and fort frances ontario fault has transported rocks in greenstone belt a considerable distance from their origin greenstone belt is wide at seven sisters islands to west greenstone with pods of gabbro radiometric dating from rainy lake area in ontario show an age of about 2 700 million years old which favors a moving tectonic plate model for formation of boundary largest fault is vermilion fault separating quetico and wawa subprovinces it has a trend and was caused by introduction of masses of magma vermilion fault can be traced westward to north dakota it has had a horizontal movement with northern block moving eastward and upward relative to southern block junction between quetico and wawa subprovinces has a zone of biotite rich migmatite a rock that has characteristics of both igneous and metamorphic processes this indicates a zone of partial melting which is possible only under high temperature and pressure conditions it is visible as a wide belt most of flattened large crystals in fault indicate a simple compression rather than a wrenching shearing or rotational event as two subprovinces docked this provides evidence that quetico and wawa subprovinces were joined by collision of two continental plates about structures in migmatite include folds and foliations foliations cut across both limbs of earlier phase folds these cross cutting foliations indicate that migmatite has undergone at least two periods of ductile deformation wabigoon subprovince thumb precambrian rock in voyageurs national park which straddles wabigoon and quetico subprovinces wabigoon subprovince is a formerly active volcanic island chain made up of metavolcanic metasedimentary intrusions these metamorphosed rocks are volcanically derived greenstone belts and are surrounded and cut by granitic plutons and batholiths subprovince s greenstone belts consist of felsic volcanics felsic batholiths and felsic plutons aged from 3 000 to 2 670 million years old quetico subprovince quetico gneiss belt extends some across ontario and parts of minnesota dominant rocks within belt are schists and gneisses produced by intense metamorphism of greywackes and minor amounts of other sedimentary rocks sediments alkalic plutons and felsic plutons are aged from 2 690 to 2 680 million years metamorphism is relatively low grade on margins and high grade in center low grade components of greywackes were derived primarily from volcanic rocks high grade rocks are coarser grained and contain minerals that reflect higher temperatures granitic intrusions within high grade metasediments were produced by subduction of ocean crust and partial melting of metasedimentary rocks immediately south of voyageurs national park and extending to vermilion fault is a broad transition zone that contains migmatite quetico gneiss belt represents an accretionary wedge that formed in a trench during collision of several island arcs greenstone belts boundaries between gneiss belt and flanking greenstone belts to north and south are major fault zones vermilion and rainy lake seine river fault zones wawa subprovince wawa subprovince is a formerly active volcanic island chain consisting of metamorphosed greenstone belts which are surrounded by and cut by granitic plutons and batholiths these greenstone belts consist of felsic volcanics felsic batholiths felsic plutons and sediments aged from 2 700 to

black and white map with zones delineated by patterns this shows location of slave province to northwest and nain province to northeast in extensive regions of slave province of northern canada magma that later became batholiths heated surrounding rock to create metamorphic regions called aureoles about 2 575 million years ago these regions are typically wide creation of aureoles was a continuous process but three recognizable metamorphic phases can be correlated with established deformational phases cycle began with a deformation phase unaccompanied by metamorphism this evolved into second phase accompanied by broad regional metamorphism as thermal doming began with continued of isotherms third phase produced minor folding but caused major metamorphic recrystallization resulting in emplacement of granite at core of thermal dome this phase occurred at lower pressure because of erosional unloading but temperatures were more extreme ranging up to about with deformation complete thermal dome decayed minor mineralogical changes occurred during this decay phase region has since been effectively stable geochronology of several archean rock units establishes a sequence of events approximately 75 million years in duration leading to formation of a new crustal segment oldest rocks at 2 650 million years old are basic with largely calc alkaline characteristics radiometric dating indicates ages of 2 640 to 2 620 million years are recorded for syn kinematic quartz diorite batholiths and 2 590 to 2 100 million years for major late kinematic bodies at 2 575 25 million years are youngest plutonic units and from two areas traversing one of these aureoles near yellowknife have been studied most of slave province rocks are granitic with metamorphosed yellowknife metasedimentary and volcanic rocks isotopic ages of these rocks is around time of kenoran orogeny rocks comprising slave province represent a high grade of metamorphism intrusion and basement typical of archean terranes batholithic intrusive and metamorphic rocks show foliation and compositional banding rocks are uniformly hard and so thoroughly deformed that little foliation exists most yellowknife supergroup metasediments are tightly folded or occur in plunging nain province archean rocks forming nain province of northeastern canada and greenland are separated from superior terrane by a narrow band of remobilized rocks greenland separated from north america less than and its precambrian terranes align with canada s on opposite side of baffin bay southern tip of greenland is part of nain
