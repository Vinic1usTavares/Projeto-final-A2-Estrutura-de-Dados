nineteenth century london and edinburgh game was set to take place in medieval japan and seventeenth century london during development test players discovered methods of exploiting available powers and abilities to achieve unexpected outcomes instead of restricting these techniques designers attempted to redesign levels to accommodate them dishonoreds music score was produced by composer daniel

designed to allow player to complete it without killing any non player characters npc including boss characters and mission targets an example of a non lethal situation given by co creative designer harvey smith involved player completing a side mission for a character and in return that character had two of corvo s targets kidnapped and enslaved each mission contains multiple ways to explore and reach targets movement through and exploration of levels is designed to support player character s abilities rather than specific paths that are aimed at a particular gameplay style such as hacking or sneaking specific elements of missions such as changes to color of a target s clothing and mask in one mission are randomized requiring player to explore game area to find target each time mission is played player s actions are not judged to be good or evil but instead are tracked by a chaos system that records amounts of friendly fire violence and deaths player causes this modifies game world affecting story without punishing player or forcing them to choose one style of play over another for example an npc who disapproves of violence may refuse to support player or may even betray them game reacts to chaos caused in scripted ways such as changing dialogue and dynamic ways such as increasing presence of rats and plagued citizens and adding new scenes this can affect active mission and future missions system also influences which of game s two endings is reached with variations based on which characters live or die using violence allows missions to be completed in less time than using a stealth approach but violence consumes more in game resources such as health and mana potions which are required more often in direct combat abilities and powers thumb 300px thumbtime 0 02

development thumb upright left deus ex designer harvey smith served as one of dishonoreds two creative directors bethesda softworks first announced dishonored as a first person stealth action adventure game for microsoft windows playstation 3 and xbox 360 platforms on 7 july 2011 dishonored is first arkane studios game bethesda published after bethesda parent zenimax media bought arkane in august 2010 arkane studios founder raphael colantonio and deus ex developer harvey smith were game s creative directors and deus ex designer ricardo bare was its lead technical designer visual design director viktor antonov who designed half life 2 city 17 and art director sebastien mitton led art team smith colantonio antonov and mitton spent three years in pre production bethesda approached arkane and asked them to develop a new game and a new intellectual property team already had ideas for developing a similar game but until bethesda approached them arkane had no specific ideas mitton contacted antonov in may 2009 to ask for his help to establish an artistic identity for a new intellectual property full arkane their offices in lyon france and austin on game game supports a different interface for microsoft windows users to that for console versions and also supports use of xbox 360 controllers on windows pcs smith described team s philosophy of allowing its developers who are passionate about a particular release platform to develop software for it those passionate about pc will work on developing that interface while xbox 360 aficionados were allowed to develop achievements for that platform dishonored was officially released to manufacturing on 28 september 2012 gameplay development team researched unexpected ways player could combine corvo s special powers such as combining a high jump with ability to teleport in order to travel greater distances than either ability allowed independently instead of restricting these exploits team tried to design levels to accommodate them designers did not consider all of powers they conceived during development such as a power to become a shadow that could move along walls to be suitable for game some existing powers went through several revisions a version of bend time caused player to enemies when touched possession allowed player to control a victim remotely without inhabiting their body but this offered less challenge balancing effectiveness of player s powers was considered difficult colantonio said we wanted to give player very strong powers to make player really a badass but at same time we didn t want game to be too easy each power has a duration mana cost and other variable properties that allowed team to effectively scale even most destructive of abilities by making them costly to use frequently or limiting time they remain active dishonoreds stealth system was originally based on that of thief series which uses level lighting and shadows to determine whether an enemy can detect player character s presence however it was decided that it was unrealistic that an enemy could stand directly in front of a player hiding in shadows and not detect them it was also considered that making certain areas dark hid designers work and contrasted poorly with well lit areas much of ambient dialogue was written to be lengthy and add background detail to game world and to entertain stealth players who may be in a single area for a long time conversely main story dialogue was written to be short to compensate for player being able to interrupt or kill character who is speaking to design missions designers began with a cohesive area which they filled with activities for player they defined paths to target areas and developed and expanded them they then populated areas with npcs which they assigned to patrol routes and functions designers would then observe how players interacted with level using their abilities and powers to test whether area provided a suitable challenge for available powers and then redesigned level as needed at first levels featured little directional information to emphasize player s ability to traverse them as they choose but in testing players became lost or obeyed npc commands to not enter an area leaving them unable to proceed in response developers introduced more visual cues and verbal hints to direct players some features and ideas were removed during design process including a mental institution where corvo would have faced sound sensitive patients discussing use of violence and consequences of in game freedom developer joe houston recounted his experience while watching a tester play a mission to infiltrate a masquerade ball houston determined that not killing npcs opened up more objectives and interactions but tester systematically killed every npc in level which houston found disconcerting team came under pressure to excise a scene from end of game where samuel in response to a player killing indiscriminately throughout game can betray corvo by alerting enemies to his presence smith explained everybody just wants to be told in a video game that you re great no matter what you do if you slaughter everybody you killed maids you killed old people you killed beggars you re great here s a medal you re a hero we decided that sounds psychotic it doesn t match our values what we wanted was to let you express yourself in game but to have world react to that at least in some way samuel betraying you and firing off that flare was something we had to fight for design thumb dishonoreds mood was partly inspired by works of nineteenth century artist john atkinson grimshaw depicting london at night dishonored was originally set in medieval japan but idea was dropped early in game s development because of difficulties presented in marketing setting and because no member of design team knew much about culture arkane moved setting to london in 1666 considering that city was recognizable to europeans and americans later designs inspired by added gameplay mechanics such as floodlights electrified barriers and 20th century technologies that it no longer resembled london and arkane opted to develop a fictional city city of dunwall designed to be a contemporary and cool period piece was inspired by late 19th and early 20th century london and edinburgh describing why london had been an initial setting and remained a significant inspiration smith said antonov described his inspiration from london as a big metropolis it s messy it s chaotic and intense and it s both exotic and familiar to americans and to europeans he highlighted importance of that familiarity to different cultures because you want to communicate to a lot of people when you make a new piece of fiction he said that edinburgh provided a sense of containment and a variety of architectural designs which were combined with a futuristic vision which antonov said was not comparable to brass rivets and steam of steampunk design antonov and mitton traveled to london and edinburgh for research taking photographs of people places and objects pair avoided busier streets and focused on side streets and alleyways that would better suit game s world mitton stated we were trying to design game from a rat s viewpoint if we have a small city from a constrained viewpoint what are all different angles that we can explore inspiration also came from artwork of john atkinson grimshaw canaletto and gustave dore world map was designed as a single piece of art and was sectioned so designers were clear on where each mission takes place in game characters were inspired by illustrations from adventure and pirate stories such as captain blood 1922 work of charles dana gibson and mugshots from edwardian london and australia an anatomy expert helped ensure morphology of character faces represented great britain while arkane maintained a sense of realism and political incorrectness mitton established defining groups for characters such as rich poor and hostile with specific anatomy and posture designs and animators created stylized movements for each social class and specific characters to help convey emotions city guards for example have small heads low shoulders and big hands with animations that blend human and monkey movements antonov and mitton employed a textile carpet designer in russia to design and paint some of in game art designers conceived tallboys as town criers stilts were later added after mitton noticed someone cleaning their office facade while wearing stilts town crier role was replaced with loudspeakers throughout dunwall tallboy design evolved into a lamplighter that would light street lamps with whale oil tanks but after further development designers considered that their tall mechanical legs allowed them to burn dead and deal with plague infected citizens while remaining above them and avoiding infection leading to their final design as a guard armed with a bow mitton suggested adding a phosphorus canister to tallboys backs for aesthetic reasons but smith suggested whale oil which in turn led mitton to design whaling ships to give whales a visible presence in city for other technologies designers conceptualized using 18th century technology to build modern items and vehicles and creating 18th century items using modern tools heart is a human heart modified with technology and supernatural that helps player to find collectible items in levels and plays a part related to informing player s decisions about when to apply violence or not making it a really interesting more subtle part of power fantasy heart provides contextual verbal feedback to player offering insight into a particular location secrets or history of a character and its own origins heart was originally designed as a method of identifying assassination targets using vibration and sound mechanics design then developed into concept of heart speaking and feeling alive and having its own agenda as a result of player conducted testing of game designers decided that a more direct navigation system was required heart s gameplay role continued to change and it continued to provide narration on its perceptions of different characters which helped to reinforce narrative themes and to differentiate city s social classes in a more subtle alternative to having characters provide expository dialogue colantonio and smith were concerned that optional use of heart would result in some players missing information it provides but they considered that it was a part of giving player freedom to choose how to play hound pits pub which acts as a base for player was initially a larger structure filling out interior of pub required too many stairs and rooms and large amount of climbing made navigation confusing team found retaining large exterior they wanted while creating and disguising a smaller interior that was easier to traverse challenging pub s exterior was shrunk to resemble an edwardian building but interior remained labyrinthine so colantonio required that a chain be placed outside corvo s bedroom allowing him to reach roof quickly in frustration designers decided to simply close off third floor entirely art team continued to receive requests throughout development requiring them to extend pre production until end of development cycle each design was hand drawn music daniel licht composed game s score an ambient violin heavy presentation designed to represent 19th century london licht s score is designed to make player feel unsettled and not provide comfort he described music as an evil fog that fades in and out of game without being initiated by any scripted moments or to warn of impending danger instead creating impression of ever present danger as dishonored features few cinematic scenes that allowed for long interactions with any particular character licht found himself limited in developing specific character themes and instead focused largely on composing ambient music samples of licht s ambient themes were used in game s few cinematic scenes although licht was not involved in scoring them licht conceived score as a mixture of older music befitting period setting and 20th century techniques such as reversed sounds dishonoreds credit song honor for all was written by licht and his nephew jon who also provided track s vocals it was written as a reward for players who had finished game release dishonored was released on microsoft windows playstation 3 and xbox 360 platforms in north america and france on 9

it released free of charge on 30 august 2012 game requires players to use a knife and crossbow to kill rats while avoiding bombs rat assassin was well received for variety and quantity of content provided but received some criticism for dark visuals that made it difficult to see rats game drew frequent comparisons to another mobile game fruit ninja as part of game s promotion bethesda employed copilot music and sound to develop ominous drunken whaler a modified version of sea shanty drunken sailor copilot decided to use ordinary children to sing lyrics instead of a professional youth choir aiming to achieve a dark haunting quality to music however they found it difficult to recruit children from local schools to sing about slit throats and hungry rats and instead used child actors adult singers who could imitate children and children of their friends instruments included violins detuned and distorted guitars and a whaler stomp created by team who stamped on wooden boards to create a pulsating sound drunken whaler appeared in game s trailer and attracted a positive reception during its presentation at 2012 electronic entertainment expo e3 following its debut trailer was watched

playstation 3 version and 88 out of 100 from 56 critics for xbox 360 version dishonoreds plot received a polarized response with many reviewers praising standalone stories driving each mission but criticizing game s overarching narrative ign s cam shea said it is a shame that dishonored s story isn t greater than sum of its decidedly memorable parts and added dishonored is a game you ll talk with your friends about eurogamers dan whitehead verge s arthur gies and giant bomb s patrick klepek criticized end of game for its generic missions late narrative missteps and abrupt ending klepek also criticized repetitive ambient dialogue in missions whitehead also stated that unique inventive and distinctive missions allowed for memorable gameplay that subverted overarching story joystiq s alexander sliwinski was disappointed by abrupt ending and that story did not explore much of developed world of dunwall but said that overall experience left him wanting more in contrast escapist s susan arendt wrote that story was well paced and john keefer stated that it was emotionally immersing and is role playing at its story driven finest but added that some plot points were not properly explained or developed gameplay was generally praised for giving players freedom to use differing methods to complete objectives and to explore levels keefer wrote that in game mechanics like powers and equipment are not essential and did not detract from story but served as optional bonuses in levels that can be completed with creativity and cleverness he also said that some missions offered too much freedom without guidance leaving player lost on how to proceed according to gies game can initially seem unstructured from a level design perspective but after exploring them it becomes clear about how much thought went into different actions a player can take allowing them to experiment instead of focusing on rigid objective driven design gamespot s chris watters enjoyed various pathways and methods of traversing each level with compelling abilities particularly blink power and freedom of choice which he said made dishonored one of truly remarkable games of 2012 arendt said that game s flexibility was also a shortcoming with certain playing styles favoring certain abilities that when fully upgraded preclude desire to explore levels for further enhancements and resources game informers joe juba also wrote that game punishes players for taking certain paths particularly one of violence which results in more difficult gameplay and a perceived less satisfying ending encouraging stealth over alternatives kotakus jason schreier contrasted dishonored with other contemporary video games and said that where other games may require a player to find a specific solution to defeat an enemy or solve a puzzle dishonored feels like entering a designer s playpen providing player with an array of tools and then allowing them to experiment with how they interact with or break world reviewers also said that game s variety encourages replaying computer and video games alex dale praised variety and replayability of game and said dishonored doesn t demand you see everything it has to offer although it is compulsive enough to ensure you will news com au s william colvin wrote that game s only shortcoming could be that it offered too many options and watters stated game achieves a rare feat of being compulsively replayable problems in player s control of corvo were raised whitehead noted controls were unresponsive when used in contextual situations sliwinski said that controls worked well reviewers criticized ai which some found inconsistent whitehead criticized his experience of enemies that can see corvo from a great distance yet sometimes remain unaware of him while in his enemies peripheral vision juba criticized inconsistent detection by enemies that lead to unpredictable and unreliable stealth mechanics that could force stealth focused players into a combat situation for which their character is not built according to g4 s jake gaskill ai worked well in combat with enemies employing different tactics and effectively countering attacks but when not alerted enemies would ignore actions directly in front of them watters also mentioned lulls in enemy intelligence but he said that it remained tenacious enough to keep enemies formidable game s visuals and design were generally praised gaskill said that art style is unique and game world is both vivid and fully realized and gies stated that game has a unifying vision and design that stands apart from its contemporaries as something different colvin described dishonored as a triumph for medium that sets benchmark for visuals story and character performance and that it is easily best looking game you ll play this year juba found steampunk inspired technology designs fascinating and stated that visual style and art direction offer a distinct aesthetic that accompanies dark and disturbing lore found in city reviewers likened dishonored to well received games from early 2000s such as deus ex and thief video game series telegraphs tom hoggins said it is like thinking man s games from turn of century which cherished player choice and control comparing it against contemporary noisy brash thrill rides obsessed with military ooh rah and barely interactive set pieces dale called dishonored one of greatest games of this generation and wrote that it excelled by drawing inspiration from older games and allowing players to figure out solutions without advice dale also called it first true stealth game for a long time and closest comparison to thief in current generation of games schreier stated that game blends do what you want structure of deus ex with masterful world design of bioshock first installment of story based dlc knife of dunwall was praised for its level design which encouraged exploration to find hidden content and alternative routes through areas modifications to certain abilities particularly blink were similarly well received for changes they brought to gameplay from main game story however was generally criticized polygon noted that deadly assassin daud had no motive for seeking redemption and allowing him to be played as a non lethal character created a disconnect with narrative ign considered that it felt like only half of a complete game lacking any urgency in its story and featuring a disappointing conclusion brigmore witches story received a mixed response with destructoid saying that it offered a more gripping narrative while polygon stated that it lacked same tension as knife of dunwall and ending felt rushed and unsatisfying however gameplay was generally considered an improvement providing more intricate level design and nuanced world building that produced gameplay requiring a more thoughtful approach pc gamer appreciated that levels each had a distinct theme and adequately
