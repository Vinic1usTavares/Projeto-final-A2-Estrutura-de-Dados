vicar of bullhampton is an 1870 novel by anthony trollope it is made up of three intertwining subplots courtship of a young woman by two suitors a feud between titular broad church vicar and a low church nobleman abetted by a methodist minister and vicar s attempt to rehabilitate a young woman who has gone astray trollope expected his depiction of a fallen woman to be controversial and unusually for him wrote a preface defending it but anticipated controversy never materialised and contemporary reviewers tended to ignore that subplot focussing instead on courtship in novel reviews were generally less than positive many reviewers and readers who had acquired a taste for trollope from 1850s 60s barchester novels were unhappy about darker tone of later novels such as this one trollope s fortunes suffered because of mode of novel s publication owing to mismanagement by publishers it was not serialised in a popular magazine as originally intended instead it was issued as monthly numbers a form of serialisation that had become unpopular with reading public and trollope lost readers as a result plot summary vicar of bullhampton is set in a small town in wiltshire it develops three subplots all connected with frank fenwick eponymous vicar mary lowther first subplot involves courtship of mary lowther a childhood friend of vicar s wife harry gilmore a bullhampton squire and a friend of fenwicks falls deeply in love with her mary recognises that gilmore is a good man but she fears that she does not adore him as a woman should adore man she marries fenwicks and her guardian aunt all urge her to accept his proposal telling her that affection she does not now feel will come after marriage in face of this advice she does not reject gilmore outright but asks for time to consider mary finds love she seeks in her second cousin captain walter marrable he falls in love with her and she joyously accepts his offer of marriage however misfortune strikes in form of colonel marrable captain s father who swindles his son out of fortune left him by his late mother impoverished captain fears that he will have to return to india with his regiment he and mary each unwilling to inflict poverty on other end their engagement by mutual consent and with mutual regret mary yields to gilmore s warning him that theirs must be a long engagement and that she will end it if captain marrable finds himself able to marry a woman without a fortune this comes to pass death of captain s cousin heir to family s baronetcy makes him likely eventual heir current baronet accepts captain as his heir buying out colonel s interest to prevent his squandering family fortune two lovers are reunited leaving gilmore bitter and despondent brattle family second subplot involves family of bullhampton s miller jacob brattle his youngest son sam is a hard worker at mill but has fallen in with bad companions and is often absent from home sam s sister carry is worse off yet having yielded to a seducer she has been disowned by her father and is living a life of sin in an unknown location when a bullhampton farmer is murdered in course of a burglary suspicion falls on sam brattle and his associates fenwick believes in sam s innocence and acts as one of his bondsmen through sam he discovers carry s whereabouts and resolves to rescue her if he can he finds her a temporary home but it becomes clear to him that only permanent solution must involve bringing her back into brattle family which means winning her father s forgiveness carry leaves home that fenwick has found her and wanders distraught eventually she returns to mill half resolved to see her old home and then drown herself in millstream there she is greeted lovingly by her mother and sister her father reluctantly allows her to remain in family home eventually he too forgives her although he can never forget shame she has brought on family carry remains with her family for rest of her life but although she has returned to decency her past ensures that she will never find an honest husband sam is never charged with murder although one of his former associates is hanged for it he continues to work at mill and eventually marries a bullhampton girl marquis and methodist a third subplot centres on relationship between fenwick mr puddleham village s methodist minister and marquis of trowbridge bullhampton s principal landowner marquis believes that sam brattle is guilty of murder and is angered by fenwick s support for him he spreads rumours about fenwick s relations with carry brattle and grants puddleham permission to build a chapel on a piece of land neighbouring fenwick s residence where he hopes that sight of it and sound of its bell will annoy vicar fenwick tries to reconcile himself to existence of chapel but it subsequently comes to light that land does not belong to marquis and is instead part of parish s glebe embarrassed marquis pays to move chapel to a new location and through intervention of his son a suave member of parliament he and fenwick are reconciled major themes plight of fallen woman according to trollope plight of carry brattle was at center of story vicar of bullhampton was written chiefly with object of exciting not only pity but sympathy for fallen woman and of raising a feeling of forgiveness for such in minds of other women in autobiography he argued that punishment for fornication is far heavier for women than for men although in most cases latter are more to blame than former and that women are given no opportunity of returning to decent lives however repentant they might be thumb alt caricature of balding crowned man with small moustache and imperial gesturing at poster on which word sensational appears dion boucicault on 5 august 1869 shortly after vicar had begun to appear in form of monthly numbers dion boucicault s formosa or railroad to ruin opened at drury lane title character of boucicault s play was a harlot and her representation on stage provoked an exchange in pages of times critics argued that depiction of a prostitute in theatre would tarnish innocence of unmarried girls attending performance supporters including boucicault himself responded that worse women were regularly portrayed in italian operas such as la traviata and lucrezia borgia which were considered eminently suitable for young women and in police and court news of times itself trollope leapt into fray somewhat belatedly in pages of saint paul s in october 1869 with an article on formosa controversy that can be read as a defence of and an advertisement for vicar he took exception to several of arguments in times young women of 1860s he wrote were not unaware of existence of prostitution and attempting to keep them in ignorance would not conduce to virtue rather than promoting vice an accurate depiction of squalid and miserable life of a woman of streets would arm young people to resist temptation harm done by formosa lies in this that character is utterly false false to human nature and false to london life she is a wretch abominable almost beyond conception so as to be odious if known to most odious she is sharper as well as prostitute and is false to all with whom she comes in contact to those whom she is supposed to love and to those who love her her peculiar profession is represented as causing her no personal remorse and yet she is exhibited to us as a fine creature a noble woman one whom a man might be honoured by loving and at last she ends with a success that which is vile and dirty squalid and miserable that of which we may say that were its horrors known such knowledge would deter more thoroughly than any ignorance is exhibited as a bright existence full of danger indeed but still open to all that is noble and capable of final success when book edition of vicar of bullhampton appeared in april 1870 it bore a preface trollope who ordinarily scorned prefaces and dedications felt compelled to justify presentation of a character like carry brattle he reiterated points he had made regarding formosa that while depicting a fallen woman as or noble might lead impressionable readers to vice a true depiction of such a woman s misery might deter readers from yielding to temptation and might soften hearts of parents whose daughters have fallen and thus afford an opportunity of returning to decency love and courtship a recurring theme in trollope s work is difficulty of choosing between two suitors as henry james expressed it trollope has described again and again ravages of love his story is always primarily a love story and a love story constructed on an inveterate system there is a young lady who has two lovers or a young man who has two sweethearts we are treated to innumerable forms in which this predicament may present itself and consequences sometimes pathetic sometimes grotesque which spring from such false situations to illustrate this point james cited vicar with mary lowther s vacillation between gilmore and col marrable unlike majority of trollope s triangles mary is not called upon to judge between a good suitor and a bad one but between two good men gilmore is presented as a sympathetic and admirable character reader learns far less about captain marrable s character and is given no reason why mary should prefer him to his rival to trollope a woman does not necessarily fall in love because of a man s merits and it is very wrong for a woman to marry where she does not love regardless of her suitor s worthy qualities thumb alt stern looking older woman with glasses seated at a desk writing with a quill pen eliza lynn linton girl of period in david skilton s view carry brattle and mary lowther subplots together comprise a rejoinder to eliza lynn linton s girl of period in her 1868 essay linton accused contemporary english girls of imitating prostitutes in their dress speech and manner and declared that girl of period has done away with such moral as consideration for others or regard for counsel and rebuke trollope was well aware of linton s views and made two references to them in novel according to skilton highly unromantic portrayal of carry brattle s condition was a denial of linton s claim that were gorgeously attired and sumptuously appointed flattered feted and courted and trouble that mary lowther brought upon herself and others came about not because of her disregard for counsel and rebuke but because she attempted to follow advice of her friends and elders near end of novel trollope writes author has endeavoured to describe a young woman prompted in all her doings by a conscience wide awake guided by principle willing if need be to sacrifice herself struggling always to keep herself from doing wrong but yet causing infinite grief to others and nearly bringing herself to utter shipwreck because for a while she allowed herself to believe that it would be right for her to marry a man whom she did not love in skilton s opinion since stories of two women are both essential to trollope s refutation of linton neither can be given titular pre eminence thus book had to take its name from vicar title was changed at some point in novel s development in early planning stages it was tentatively named i count her wrong religion vicar of bullhampton has been described as trollope s most religious novel and frank fenwick as his most explicitly religious character although author won renown for his depictions of lives of clergy in barsetshire novels he wrote of their social rather than their spiritual lives in vicar however fenwick s object is to apply christian doctrine to life in world a variety of religious beliefs are represented among novel s characters jacob brattle is an unbeliever puddleham is a primitive methodist family to which marquis belongs are low church anglicans and fenwick is high church and their charity is tested by their response to carry brattle and it is fenwick who passes test as william cadbury expresses it puddleham has been hardened by too much doctrine jacob brattle by too little fenwick s beliefs are similar to trollope s own in his early life novelist was a supporter of however beginning in about mid 1860s his sympathies tended increasingly toward broad church he defended bishop colenso expressed doubt about literal truth of old testament and questioned doctrine of eternal punishment contained in creed indeed fenwick resembled his creator in more than belief to t h s escott who was personally acquainted with trollope fenwick generous outspoken broad minded and a bit pugnacious was very much like a portrait of author in clerical dress puddleham s discomfiture proves to trollope s naively undisguised satisfaction that providence is on side of state church publication history once a week early in 1868 trollope was approached by e s dallas a fellow member of garrick club dallas had just been appointed editor of once a week a magazine published by firm of bradbury and evans trollope agreed to provide a novel of length of to be serialised beginning in may 1869 for a fee of in course of his correspondence with dallas trollope wrote of course it is understood that it is intended for your periodical once a week trollope wrote vicar of bullhampton between 15 june and 1 november 1868 novel was begun in washington d c where author was on a mission to negotiate a postal treaty and international copyright arrangements with united states it was concluded after his return to england in early stages of his unsuccessful campaign for a parliamentary seat in borough of beverley thumb alt painting of man with white hair and full white beard brooding expression victor hugo ca 1868 as publication date neared difficulties arose in january 1869 dallas asked trollope for permission to defer serial publication by three months as trollope had agreed not to allow another of his novels to run serially during first six months of vicars career editor s request would have diminished author s income trollope initially refused but subsequently agreed to a delay of two months with publication to begin in early july matters did not improve in march 1869 dallas made a new request of trollope once a week had bought rights to victor hugo s forthcoming novel l homme qui rit expecting to begin serialisation in january 1869 however hugo was behind schedule and novel would not be available until april magazine did not have enough space to run hugo s and trollope s novels side by side would trollope therefore be willing to see vicar serialised in gentleman s magazine instead trollope would not gentleman s magazine was in michael sadleir s words a very inferior paper with a lower class of reader and a poor general reputation moreover personal feelings were involved trollope resented fact that he a punctual englishman was being asked to yield to a dilatory frenchman my disgust at this proposition was i think chiefly due to victor hugo s latter novels which i regard as pretentious and untrue to nature to this perhaps was added some feeling of indignation that i should be asked to give way to a frenchman frenchman had broken his engagement he had failed to have his work finished by stipulated time from week to week and from month to month he had put off fulfilment of his duty and because of these laches on his part on part of this french radical i was to be thrown over trollope refused hugo s novel was published in gentleman s magazine beginning in may 1869 however by end of june sale of once a week to a new publisher was in progress rather than vicar in magazine bradbury and evans issued it in eleven monthly shilling numbers running from july 1869 to may 1870 trollope could not object to this mode of independent publication but it was one that had fallen out of favour with public and trollope suffered a loss of reputation and readership as a result he also suffered a pecuniary loss of

halperin in 1998 reception trollope s preface suggests that he anticipated controversy from depiction of carry brattle in vicar of bullhampton this did not happen times declared it a nice easy safe reading book for old ladies and young ladies welcome in all well regulated families contemporary reviewers tended to neglect carry brattle subplot and focus on mary lowther whose conduct was criticised by blackwood s magazine by times and by mrs oliphant saturday review complained that a sort of pervades book and that n is pleasant and described novel as third rate and as a not very satisfactory book this was in keeping with reaction of many readers and reviewers who had grown accustomed to wholesome tone and genteel characters of barchester novels and were not happy with darker and more pessimistic tone of trollope s later works later critics varied in their opinion of novel henry james who had loudly derided several of trollope s novels of mid 1860s described it in an 1883 article as a slow but excellent story which is a capital example of interest produced by quietest conceivable means in 1927 michael sadleir wrote that it has a sure title to enduring reputation of mary lowther whom earlier critics had found irritating he wrote to day she seems sensible enough and as a young woman wholly natural by 1971 however james pope hennessy labelled novel a lifeless dull production more recently still trollope scholars have looked upon it with increasing favour describing it as a powerful work that has suffered undeserved neglect present day critics have focussed increasingly on carry brattle subplot it has been suggested supported in part by similarity of passages from vicar from autobiography and from small house at allington referring to johnny eames that
