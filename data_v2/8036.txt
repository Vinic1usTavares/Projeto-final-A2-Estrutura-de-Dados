an assistant for kishimoto ever since narutos early chapters to draw it instead a countdown website titled next generation was used to promote new manga in december 2015 boruto naruto next serialisation was announced kishimoto said he wanted boruto to surpass his own work writer of boruto ukyo kodachi had written a light novel called gaara hiden 2015 and had assisted kishimoto in writing script for film boruto naruto movie besides writing for series kodachi supervises story of anime kishimoto also acted as supervisor of anime for episodes 8 and 9 kodachi explained that series setting which is notable for handling more science than naruto was influenced by his father a physician in order to further combine use of ninjutsu and technology kodachi was inspired by sci fi role playing games despite kishimoto revising manga s scenario he advised ikemoto to make his own art style instead of imitating his ikemoto agreed and felt optimistic about his art style while noting long time fans might be disappointed kishimoto is not drawing boruto ikemoto stated he would do his best in making manga while feeling honoured to create art for boruto ikemoto stated he is grateful series is released monthly rather than weekly because producing required amount of nearly 20 pages per chapter would be stressful however he still finds monthly serialisation challenging regular chapters of boruto tend to exceed 40 pages creation of thumbnail sketches takes a week pages take 20 days to produce while rest of time is used for colouring images and retouching chapters in drawing characters ikemoto felt that facial expressions of boruto changed as story moved on initially giving protagonist large eyes for character s interactions with tento boruto s appearance was made more rebellious when he instead talked with kawaki despite having a lighter tone than naruto series begins by hinting at a dark future this set up was purposed by kishimoto to give manga a bigger impact and to take a different approach than one from boruto movie in this scenario ikemoto drew an older boruto but he believes this design may change once manga reaches this point in early 2019 ikemoto stated relationship between boruto and kawaki would be biggest focus on plot as it would progress until their fight in flashforward ikemoto aims to give series nearly 30 volumes to tell story kodachi drew parallels between boruto and post cold war era stating that while new characters are living in a time of peace something complicated might bring world back to chaos although kishimoto is not writing series he created multiple characters for staff to use kishimoto did not specify whether naruto or another important character would die but he said he would find a situation like this interesting and
