august 2001 by simon schuster in united states taraborrelli first considered writing book in 1990 but realizing project might be premature in respect to madonna s fledgling career set it aside he began writing book in 1996 when madonna gave birth to her daughter lourdes other books about madonna s life and career had been based on previously published material but taraborrelli s biography was result of research spanning a decade and includes exclusive interviews with madonna s close friends business associates family members and her father tony ciccone these interviews were conducted by author himself as well as his team of private investigators taraborrelli also interviewed madonna over course of years and often drew from his first hand experiences while writing book madonna an

debut album and of her belief that she would someday enjoy great success as century s biggest star taraborrelli thought her brash cocky petulant self indulgent and a mediocre beauty with a voice to match madonna an intimate biography 2002 author s note p 13 taraborrelli was proven wrong and in 1990 he considered writing her biography but put thought aside thinking such a venture was premature he pointed out that most subjects need time for evolution and personal growths before their stories are ripe enough to put on paper madonna was in an ambitious self involved phase during which nothing mattered more to her than her career he picked up writing again in 1994 but felt same way about her and hoped time would come when singer would focus on her personal life rather than her career a personal evolution occurred in her life with birth of daughter lourdes in 1996 and it was then that taraborrelli sensed time was ripe to begin writing her biography madonna an intimate biography 2002 author s note p 14 writing and release taraborrelli decided to focus on singer s private life who she really was many books about superstar were based on previously published material but taraborrelli had ten years of research to draw upon including interviews with people who had not spoken about madonna in public and his own interviews with icon taraborrelli and his team of private investigators interviewed madonna s close friends business associates and family members including her father silvio ciccone while researching book taraborrelli realized that one of greatest misconceptions about madonna was that she was cold and unemotional in her personal relationships his research found this to be untrue and taraborrelli cited as an example icon s 1990 relationship with actor warren beatty their relationship was generally perceived as nothing more than promotion for their film dick tracy and madonna was regarded as opportunistic taraborrelli unearthed that madonna actually had strong feelings for beatty actor however was not as emotionally invested as madonna and relationship ended with her heart being broken author believed that readers would be surprised by many times that madonna has ended up feeling alone and rejected she has built her entire career on an image of indestructibility but at least in her personal life and again i make that distinction because this isn t necessarily true in her business life she is one of most fragile subjects i ve ever written about this book is really about placing her life into proper historical context and once again answering why questions about her taraborrelli has written updated versions of book released in 2008 and 2018 latter to commemorate madonna turning 60 years old updated versions had reconstructed thoughts expressed in some areas based on author s current perception he also added commentary and stories he found relevant to be added to madonna s legacy madonna an intimate biography of an icon at sixty 2018 author s note p xi xii los angeles may 2018 critical response book received mixed reviews caroline foulkes wrote in birmingham post thing about this biography is depths to which taraborrelli has dug to get information on a famously controlling woman he relates revealing anecdotes as if they were mere bagatelle making news of world style revelations look like kid s stuff if taraborrelli were to include in his list of acknowledgments thanks to maid who let me into madonna s bedroom to raid her underwear drawer it wouldn t be any great surprise she also felt that despite sensationalism taraborrelli s writing style lets him down too often it descends into kind of mush you expect from an airport novel with singer coming across more like a character from shirley conran s lace than a real woman peter sobczynski reviewed book for post tribune and felt that problem with writing an unauthorized tell all biography is that in this information rich world that we live in by time a book gets written on somebody most of juicy stories are already common knowledge to make up for that tell all author needs to fill his or her pages with either a thoughtful analysis of subject at hand or frankly newer and better dirt unfortunately celebrity biographer j randy taraborrelli does neither with his latest concoction madonna an intimate biography william leith of london evening standard noted that taraborrelli s theory that madonna having been bereaved at age of five became driven both sexually and in other ways is believable but is it true in end you ll make up your own mind this is a book you will find yourself just dipping into for hours at a stretch and john from knight ridder thought taraborrelli is retelling all known facts about madonna and more after all in those 10 years great woman has had two children wed and maintained her image as a major pain in he does a great job of bringing forth these unknown facts ward triplet of kansas city star felt that although book is an eerie but compelling day by day account of madonna and how she became who she is sometimes taraborrelli feels like revealing more about his process of writing than his subject and ann o neil in los angeles times complimented book for being different from regular dirt written everyday about madonna sylvia sharma from daily mirror felt that taraborrelli s rummage through madge s life can bring you to shame this is madonna biography all had been waiting for this is who she is not staunch woman that we see but a woman who is no different than one of us mike thomas from chicago sun times said that
