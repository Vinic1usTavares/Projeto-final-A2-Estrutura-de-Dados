thumb right 250px consecration of euthymius as patriarch of constantinople miniature from madrid skylitzes euthymius i syncellus 5 august 917 was ecumenical patriarch of constantinople from 907 to 912 a monk since his youth he became spiritual father of future emperor leo vi wise and was raised by him to high ecclesiastical office of syncellus despite his turbulent relationship with leo in 907 he was appointed to patriarchate and held post until his deposition shortly before or after leo s death in 912 life euthymius was born in seleucia in isauria and became a monk at an early age according to his funeral oration composed by arethas of caesarea he was a relative of miracle worker gregory of following stints at monastic community of mount olympus and a monastery near nicomedia euthymius came to byzantine capital constantinople where he entered monastery of st theodore in capital s outskirts euthymius had a relationship with patriarch ignatius whom he alludes to as his master and it is probably during ignatius second tenure on patriarchal throne 867 877 that he was appointed as spiritual father of prince leo son of emperor basil i macedonian and future emperor as leo vi wise indeed historian shaun tougher argues in his study of leo s reign that euthymius was possibly spiritual father of all of basil s sons euthymius supported leo in his conflict with his father over his affair with zoe zaoutzaina according to euthymius hagiography vita euthymii he helped leo survive his imprisonment in 883 886 while young prince constantly requested his advice forcing him to stay in constantinople rather than his monastery at time of basil s death in 886 euthymius was a monk in monastery of theotokos of spring with leo s accession to throne euthymius was rewarded by being appointed as abbot of a newly built monastery in psamathia quarter in constantinople built on land confiscated from exiled leo katakalon according to vita euthymii he accepted only after emperor agreed to recall katakalon from exile and restore to him rest of his properties monastery was inaugurated on 6 may 889 or 890 in presence of leo and latter s brother stephen who since december 886 was patriarch of constantinople at about same time according to p karlin hayter in late 888 or early 889 he was also named to post of syncellus succeeding stephen who had held post in tandem with patriarchate since 886 this was an important office in byzantine ecclesiastical hierarchy and several of its holders had subsequently advanced to patriarchate despite his closeness to new emperor euthymius relationship with leo was notoriously stormy shaun tougher and perhaps explains why did not succeed to patriarchal throne until 907 vita euthymii also assigns much of blame for euthymius s troubled relation with emperor on machinations of zoe zaoutzaina s father stylianos zaoutzes zaoutzes rivalry with euthymius is a major theme of his hagiography where former is represented as an all powerful minister whose ambitions and machinations are responsible for all errors and calamities of reign and with whom euthymius was engaged in a battle for prize of leo s soul how far stylianos reported dominance reflects reality is questioned by tougher who points out that from historical sources leo does not seem to have simply followed stylianos initiative but to have retained control of affairs throughout his reign euthymius has also been seen by modern scholars as an advocate of traditional aristocracy and at odds with leo s foreign i e non byzantine greek and non aristocratic advisers such as armenian zaoutzes arab eunuch chamberlain samonas or italian nicholas mystikos who preceded euthymius on patriarchal throne although this probably has more to do with obvious effort of vita to present euthymius as a perfect saint which leads it to denigrate his rivals euthymius first incurred leo s displeasure when he supported his first wife theophano and dissuaded her from seeking a divorce due to emperor s neglect and his continued cohabitation with his long time mistress zoe zaoutzaina after theophano s death euthymius opposed leo s second marriage to zoe zaoutzaina due to her ill repute which earned him a two year confinement in monastery of st diomedes he was not released until after zoe s death two years later following zoe s death after giving birth to a daughter anna leo pursued a normally un canonical third marriage to eudokia in hopes of having a male heir indeed a boy named basil was born in easter 901 but eudokia died during childbirth and was soon followed by baby this was once more occasion of a clash between emperor and euthymius vita asserts that following death of zoe and her father as well as discovery of a conspiracy by their relatives leo had repented of his treatment of euthymius and asked for his forgiveness emperor repeatedly sought his counsel going as far as visiting him incognito at monastery in psamathia during one of visits euthymius prophesied eudokia s death and later refused to attend her funeral retiring with six followers from constantinople to suburb of ta agathou a property of his monastery undeterred emperor took a mistress zoe karbonopsina and in september 905 he was finally able to celebrate birth of future emperor constantine vii porphyrogennetos fact that child s mother was emperor s mistress caused trouble with leading church officials and leo was forced to promise to separate from zoe as a precondition for infant s ceremonial baptism by patriarch nicholas mystikos in hagia sophia euthymius too was persuaded to act as one of constantine s godfathers in ceremony which took place in january 906 despite his pledge to separate from zoe however leo now was determined to legitimize both her and their son by a fourth marriage something utterly forbidden by canon law on pain of excommunication patriarch nicholas initially supported emperor in his efforts to secure a grant of economy but church leadership was vehemently opposed forcing nicholas too to change sides as impasse continued in february 907 nicholas was dismissed by emperor and euthymius was appointed in his stead vita explains nicholas stance and his final deposition by his implication in abortive plot of general andronikos doukas but other sources are silent as to exact background of affair thumb right 250px emperor alexander dismisses euthymius miniature from madrid skylitzes despite euthymius notorious stubbornness which probably had discouraged leo from raising him to patriarchate sooner he proved willing to grant emperor economy aided by assent of other patriarchates of pentarchy despite zoe s repeated efforts however he steadfastly refused to officially recognize her marriage with emperor as canonical and her status as empress leo was forced to do penance to atone for his marriage and to pass a law excluding anyone from ever again marrying for a fourth time as a result of settlement on 15 may 908 euthymius crowned infant constantine vii as co emperor even though later byzantine chroniclers tend to side with nicholas mystikos against leo they paint euthymius in a favourable light according to vita his tenure helped heal rift in church and reconcile many leading churchmen with emperor s fourth marriage bishop gabriel of ancyra is even said to have sent of saint clement as a gift and a token of appreciation shortly before leo s death in may 912 emperor reconciled himself with nicholas mystikos who now demanded his re instatement as patriarch sources are unclear but shortly after leo s death or perhaps already before euthymius was deposed by a synod convened at magnaura in favour of nicholas who was recalled from exile euthymius was exiled to agathou where he died on 5 august 917 hagiography and writings euthymius hagiography vita euthymii or life of euthymius was apparently written in years 920 25 according to p karlin hayter or according to d soon after 932 its author is unknown but in words of shaun tougher he had an insider s perspective on court affairs during leo vi s reign and is consequently one of richest sources for period from death of basil i to early years of constantine vii alexander kazhdan however despite offering a vivid portrait of leo and his court with eye witness anecdotes that illustrate emperor s character as a source it is limited due to its focus on and bias in favour of euthymius as well as due to fact that several sections are missing single surviving manuscript was kept in berlin and vanished during world war ii but vita exists in several critical editions euthymius own writings are few and relatively insignificant comprising sermons on conception of st anne and an homily on virgin mary his contemporary arethas of caesarea also wrote a panegyric in his honour but according to kazhdan it is conventional and provides only limited data notes references sources further reading category 830s
