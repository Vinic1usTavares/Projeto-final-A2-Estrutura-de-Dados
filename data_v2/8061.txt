with venice and were even accused of heresy to makarska branch belonged croatian poet and monk andrija kacic miosic whose work pleasant conversation of slavic people 1756 was one of most popular croatian literary works for more than a century notable members of hungarian branch were bans of croatia and slavonia etymology family derives from slavic snake based on etymology it is likely that hungarian kacics kacsics are originally of slavic rather than hungarian origin latin sources also refer to name as de genere chacittorum generatione cacich genus chacittorum de cacich and kacic name is distinct from similar sounding name of another noble family kasic and its derivations history kacic s family can be traced to pacta conventa an agreement dating from 1102 or later according to which kacics were one of twelve croatian noble tribes genus who accepted hungarian king coloman as new king of croatia they were represented by comes juraj kacic gurram de genere chacittorum according to supetar cartulary they were one of six tribes which selected bans who in turn elected a new king in a case where prior king died without leaving heirs first mention of kacics is considered 1165 when byzantine chronicler john kinnamos said that 57 cities in croatia and dalmatia as well nation kacics came under byzantine rule kacics were mostly recorded in scope of sales contracts and lands disputes or as witnesses in 1182 first explicitly mentioned noblemen as members of genus kacic are miros kacic 1166 82 and his son previously also miros s father toljen 1164 66 judge of tinj kacic with sons juraj and kacic with sons dragos and pribislav and likely otra with his son dragoslav kacic family originated in zadar hinterland near krka river and when king petar kresimir iv mastered some members of family likely relocated to area between cetina and neretva rivers social distinction between noble kacics in zadar biograd hinterland and princely knezes kacics from omis remains uncertain but two families are considered to be related clearest established connection is noble hodimir mentioned in 1207 in a charter of st peter s church in near tinj whose son nikola was an omis knez in 12th and 13th centuries kacics possessed lands in zadar hinterland in wider area of tinj nadin kacina gorica and from mid 14th to 15th century their holdings expanded to include bistrovina kacina gorica and and wider area around those villages center of genus was in nadin for some zadar nin and possibly pag where dominum is mentioned according to m markovic in early 11th century lands west of nadin were ruled by tribe while in east by family kasic family name of kacics can be found in toponyms kacina gorica alleged second name for bistrovina and kacic cacich in 14th century family members began to identify themselves by family names with adjective de generatione cacich in next period kacics can be traced through three families in 15th to 17th centuries a branch settled in wider area of and bosanska krupa where in 1487 there was a dispute between them and noble family last mention of nadin kacics dates back to 1527 when simun simon was in citadel of zadar after pressure from ottoman conquest omis branch right thumb 280px mirabella fortress where kacics and pirates of omis had their main hideout first known knez of omis nikola was mentioned along with his relatives and everyone under his lordship in a peace treaty with kotor from 1167 knez nikola s power and independence was strong enough to have rogerije archbishop of split executed in 1180 family political influence at that time included brac and hvar also of genus well as previous sibenik zupan archbishop rogerije who also served byzantine emperor manuel i komnenos as representative governor of croatia

islands of brac hvar and vis and probably at some point korcula but it is uncertain whether land included coastal and to north and makarska coast to south in 13th century center of principality was omis and with title of omis knez comes sources also mentioned title of knez for islands in 13th century terms kacics kacici and residents of omis omisani are both mentioned making it sometimes more difficult to reliably identify members of genus however it seems that princely titles were held only by kacics they achieved a large degree of independence from central government and imposed name of omis and kacic family over entire region kacics and omis citizens made a peace treaty with venice in 1208 and brothers rados dragan bogdan and were mentioned by knez sebena in document however in
