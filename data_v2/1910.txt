thumb debate between k eric drexler and richard smalley on feasibility of molecular assemblers began in 2001 and concluded in a cover story in chemical engineering news in 2003 drexler smalley debate on molecular nanotechnology was a public dispute between k eric drexler originator of conceptual basis of molecular nanotechnology and richard smalley a recipient of 1996 nobel prize in chemistry for discovery of nanomaterial buckminsterfullerene dispute was about feasibility of constructing molecular assemblers which are molecular machines which could robotically assemble molecular materials and devices by manipulating individual atoms or molecules concept of molecular assemblers was central to drexler s conception of molecular nanotechnology but smalley argued that fundamental physical principles would prevent them from ever being possible two also traded accusations that other s conception of nanotechnology was harmful to public perception of field and threatened continued public support for nanotechnology research debate was carried out from 2001 to 2003 through a series of published articles and open letters it began with a 2001 article by smalley in scientific american which was followed by a rebuttal published by drexler and coworkers later that year and two open letters by drexler in early 2003 debate was concluded in late 2003 in a point counterpoint feature in chemical engineering news in which both parties participated debate has been often cited in history of nanotechnology due to fame of its participants and its commentary on both technical and social aspects of nanotechnology it has also been widely criticized for its adversarial tone with drexler accusing smalley of publicly misrepresenting his work and smalley accusing drexler of failing to understand basic science causing commentators to go so far as to characterize tone of debate as similar to a pissing match and reminiscent of a saturday night live sketch participants k eric drexler thumb 200px k eric drexler developed and popularized concept of nanotechnology and founded field of molecular nanotechnology k eric drexler is generally considered to have written first scholarly paper on topic of nanotechnology and was a key figure in popularizing these concepts through several publications and advocacy work trained as an engineer drexler was inspired by a then obscure 1959 talk by physicist richard feynman called there s plenty of room at bottom which posited that it should be physically possible to manipulate individual atoms using top down engineering methodologies drexler was also inspired by recent advances in molecular biology such as recombinant dna technology in a 1981 publication in proceedings of national academy of sciences considered to be first journal article on nanotechnology he argued that biological systems such as ribosome were already capable of building molecules atom by atom and that artificial machines with this capability could also be constructed drexler went on to publish two books on nanotechnology engines of creation in 1986 which was intended for public and technical work nanosystems in 1992 he also co founded foresight institute a public interest group devoted to increasing public awareness and information about molecular nanotechnology edwards pp 15 21 27 drexler s vision of nanotechnology now called molecular nanotechnology is based on concept of molecular assembler a molecular machine which would manufacture molecules and molecular devices atom by atom drexler drew a distinction between wet nanotechnology based on biological systems and second generation dry nanotechnology which would be based on mechanosynthesis positional control of molecules through principles more related to mechanical engineering drexler and his followers have focused almost exclusively on latter form of molecular nanotechnology but drexler has stated that both are valid pathways to creating molecular machine systems richard smalley thumb 250px richard smalley won 1996 nobel prize in chemistry along with harry kroto and robert curl for their 1985 discovery of buckminsterfullerene richard e smalley a chemist at rice university was best known as a co discoverer of c60 form of carbon known as buckminsterfullerene in 1985 along with harry kroto robert curl james heath and sean o brien buckminsterfullerene was first to be discovered of class of molecules known as fullerenes which also includes carbon nanotubes study and application of fullerenes forms a significant part of fields of nanomaterials and and smalley kroto and curl were awarded 1996 nobel prize in chemistry for their discovery edwards pp 27 64 smalley had also taken a prominent public policy role in relation to nanotechnology and was an outspoken advocate for using nanotechnology to develop solutions to world s energy and health problems for example raising possibility of using nanomaterials for efficient energy storage and transmission and of developing nanomaterial based drugs for targeted drug delivery smalley was also active in commercializing his academic research into carbon nanotubes having founded carbon nanotechnologies inc and serving on scientific advisory board of two other biotechnology and nanotechnology startups smalley died of leukemia in october 2005 after conclusion of his debate with drexler edwards pp 132 184 debate smalley s scientific american article thumb smalley s 2001 scientific american article doubting feasibility of molecular assemblers led to a rebuttal by drexler and his colleagues smalley wrote an article of chemistry love and nanobots for september 2001 issue of popular science magazine scientific american which was a special issue on topic of nanotechnology smalley opened by comparing a chemical reaction to an intricate dance of atoms he referenced idea of a molecular assembler a nanorobot capable of manipulating individual atoms to build a desired product posing question of how long it would take such an assembler to produce a meaningful amount of material he estimated that one assembler working alone would take millions of years to produce one mole of material but self replicating assemblers could within a minute produce a large enough ensemble of assemblers that would then be capable of producing a mole of product in a fraction of a millisecond smalley then discussed fear that nanorobots could mutate and reproduce indefinitely causing a grey goo scenario or referring to bill joy s previous article why future doesn t need us that nanorobots could develop swarm intelligence and become alive in some sense smalley then considered how realistic concept of a self replicating nanorobot was he noted that in a chemical reaction chemical bonds are all interconnected and that placement of each atom is sensitive to position of all other atoms in vicinity he then asserted that a molecular assembler would thus have to control many atoms simultaneously in order to work and would thus have to have many manipulator arms this led him to raise two objections to concept of molecular assembler which he called fat fingers problem and sticky fingers problem smalley closed article by returning to analogy of chemistry as a dance of love remarking that you don t make a girl and a boy fall in love by pushing them together drexler s response drexler responded by publishing a rebuttal later in 2001 through institute for molecular manufacturing which was co authored with others including robert freitas j storrs hall and ralph merkle authors first discussed fat fingers argument by attacking smalley s notion that a chemical reaction must involve five to fifteen atoms stating that many reactions involve only two reactants one of which can be immobilized and other attached to a single finger they cited as evidence experimental and theoretical results indicating that using scanning tunneling microscope stm tips and related technologies could be used as a reactive structure for positional control and for interaction with surface bound molecules they also noted that atomically precise final products do not require precise control of all aspects of chemical reaction authors noted that sticky fingers problem is valid in some reactions but argue that it would be fallacious to conclude that all reactions have this problem authors put forth ribosome as an example of a natural molecular machine because ribosome suffers from neither problem they must not be fundamental saying authors also questioned smalley s figures for replication time of nanomachines instead of smalley s figure of 1 ghz for atomic placement frequency they point out that nanosystems suggested a frequency of 1 mhz a thousand times slower and that at smalley s higher frequency diamondoid nanomachines would overheat and decompose in milliseconds authors called this a straw man argument writing that in a serious scientific discussion a discrepancy of three orders of magnitude between what has been proposed in literature and what is criticized suggests at best an inadequate grasp of proposal authors closed by stating that best way to find out whether molecular assemblers are feasible is through experimental and theoretical work and that there are many worthy molecular systems engineering challenges to overcome but thus far there has been no credible argument that these devices are infeasible drexler followed up with two open letters to smalley in april and july 2003 april letter began i have written this open letter to correct your public misrepresentation of my work drexler accused smalley of continuing to dismiss his work by publicly describing molecular assemblers as requiring what drexler now calls smalley fingers which he stated to be unlike enzyme like systems he had actually proposed he asserted drexler compared nanotechnology debate s importance to that of discussions of spaceflight before sputnik or to theoretical work on nuclear chemistry before manhattan project he disputed smalley s arguments that fear of a grey goo scenario would hinder continued funding of nanotechnology research arguing that potential for long term risks made research even more important his conclusion stated your misdirected arguments have needlessly confused public discussion of genuine long term security concerns july 2003 letter referenced a note from smalley promising to respond which had yet gone unfulfilled drexler mentions inconsistencies in smalley s previous public statements on atom by atom construction and ended by stating i would not ordinarily raise an issue so persistently but question of what nanotechnology can ultimately achieve is perhaps most fundamental issue in field today it shapes basic objectives and expectations and your words have been remarkably effective in changing how this issue is perceived exchange of letters in chemical engineering news thumb a depiction of a putative molecular planetary gear set smalley questioned whether devices like these could be constructed using an enzyme like mechanical process either in an aqueous solution or with some other chemistry and whether such devices would be operational at all debate was concluded in a point counterpoint feature that was 1 december 2003 cover story of chemical engineering news newsmagazine of american chemical society feature first reproduced drexler s april 2003 open letter to smalley smalley s response began by apologizing for any offense his september 2001 article had caused and stating that drexler s book engines of creation had triggered smalley s own interest in nanotechnology he agreed that smalley fingers could not work and then asserted that same reasons that would preclude atomic control of reactions would also preclude manipulation of larger building blocks since each molecule would have multiple atoms which would need to be controlled he then agreed that something like an enzyme or ribosome would be capable of precise chemistry but asked how nanorobot would be able to obtain control and repair such an enzyme and noted incompatibility of many reactions with water based biological systems stating that biology is wonderous in vast diversity of what it can build but it can t make a crystal of silicon or steel or copper or aluminum or titanium or virtually any of key materials on which modern technology is built smalley asked what kind of nonaqueous chemistry drexler would envision for his molecular assemblers to operate upon calling this a vast area of chemistry that has eluded us for centuries drexler s began by returning to feynman s 1959 talk stating that although inspired by biology feynman s vision of nanotechnology is fundamentally mechanical not biological he characterized challenges as being that of systems engineering rather than solely chemistry and referred smalley to nanosystems with its vision of mechanical control of chemical reactions with no enzymes and no reliance on solvents or thermal motion he stated drexler reiterated that these molecular assemblers would require no impossible fingers and would augment solution phase chemistry to produce macroscopic products with precise arrangements of chemical building blocks using solution phase molecular assemblers to bootstrap construction of more sophisticated assemblers he concluded by writing smalley began his concluding letter smalley stated his belief that most reactions using mechanosynthesis would simply give wrong product and that very few reactions and target molecules would likely be compatible with such an approach he asserted that any robotic assembler arm would need an enzyme like tool at its end such would require a liquid medium and as all known enzymes use water as that medium range of products must be limited to meat and bone of biology he accused drexler of creating a pretend world where atoms go where you want because your computer program directs them to go there lastly smalley recounted his recent experience reading essays written by middle and high school students after an outreach visit saying that nearly half of them thought that self replicating nanorobots were possible and that most were worried about results of them spreading across world smalley called this a deeply troubling bedside story that he did his best to allay smalley concluded his letter critical response tone debate has been widely criticized for its adversarial tone david berube in nano hype truth behind nanotechnology buzz characterized it as two people talking over each other not conducive to reasonable rebuttal and quoted nanotechnology blogger and journalist howard as saying tenor of debate is about personal pride reputation and a place in pantheon founder james von ehr remarked that eric drexler didn t do himself any favors by getting into a pissing match with a nobel prize winner an article in new york times called debate reminiscent of that old saturday night live sketch with dan aykroyd and jane curtin tossing insults at each other while ostensibly debating a serious political issue referring to a version of long running weekend update segment technical commentary debate has received technical criticism as well steven a edwards in nanotech pioneers noted that ambiguity of specifications and even definition of a molecular assembler makes an evaluation of argument difficult and minimizes its scientific implications he remarked that nowhere in it does nanosystems contain a blueprint for a molecular assembler we are told for instance that a manipulator arm would involve 4 000 000 atoms but we are not told which atoms or how they would be put together he concludes that debate over mechanosynthesis so far is huge to participants but mainly an entertaining academic diversion to most on other hand futurist ray kurzweil in his book singularity is near declared drexler as winner of debate reiterating view that smalley distorted drexler s ideas and calling smalley s responses short on specific citations and current research and long on imprecise metaphors and asserting that smalley is ignoring past decade of research on alternative means of positioning molecular fragments using precisely guided molecular reactions which have been extensively studied he quoted experimental results on enzyme function in nonaqueous solutions and pointed out that modern non biological technology such as airplanes and computers have exceeded capabilities of natural biological systems he also noted that earlier critics also expressed skepticism that either worldwide communication networks or software viruses that would spread across them were feasible but today we are obtaining far more gain than harm from this latest example of intertwined promise and peril commentary on public perception of nanotechnology debate s focus on public perception of nanotechnology has also received commentary political blogger glenn reynolds stated that business community is afraid that advanced nanotechnology just seems too well spooky and worse that discussions of potentially spooky implications will lead to public fears that might get into way of bringing products to market berube p 58 lawrence lessig criticized scientific establishment represented by smalley for arguing that if so called dangerous nanotech can be relegated to summer sci fi movies and forgotten after labor day then serious work can continue supported by billion dollar funding and uninhibited by idiocy that buries for example stem cell research kurzweil wrote that smalley s approach to reassuring public would backfire because it denied both benefits and risks of molecular nanotechnology references category history of technology category nanotechnology publications
