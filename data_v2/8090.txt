all again under different musical guises but these 3 shows will be fight like apes last we want to call it a day while we re all still pals and are proud of what we ve done and we are very very proud it s a deadly time in so many ways to be in a band you can have so much control over your work if you re clever you can release it how and when you like and in our opinion right now ireland is healthiest it s ever been in terms of talent and diversity but there are massive challenges for a lot of bands mostly financial that make this a tough job and sadly those obstacles have become too big for us i think we all know that we re going to hear announcements like this more often a lot of people don t seem to understand that we can t keep producing records if you keep not paying for them bands are having to sell beautiful albums for eur2 99 labels can t give you as much support since they re losing income too and our alternative radio stations are practically non existent now meaning so many wonderful bands will not get a chance to get played on radio as they ll be competing with huge pop acts please buy your music in independent record stores or directly from band don t fool yourself in to thinking that your ps10 subscription to deezer and spotify helps us at all it does not look how many bands are on there and do maths please go to gigs please buy thanks to all you entirely crazy wonderful people who have supported us and danced and screamed with us over past 10 years we could never thank you enough i still can t believe some of amazing things we ve done
