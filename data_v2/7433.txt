trifluoroperacetic acid acid is an organofluorine compound peroxy acid analog of trifluoroacetic acid with condensed structural formula it is a strong oxidizing agent for organic oxidation reactions such as in baeyer villiger oxidations of ketones it is most reactive of organic peroxy acids allowing it to successfully oxidise relatively unreactive alkenes to epoxides where other peroxy acids are ineffective it can also oxidise chalcogens in some functional groups such as by transforming selenoethers to selones it is a potentially explosive material and is not commercially available but it can be quickly prepared as needed its use as a laboratory reagent was pioneered and developed by william d emmons properties at standard ambient temperature and pressure trifluoroperacetic acid is a colourless liquid with a boiling point of 162 degc it is soluble in acetonitrile dichloromethane diethyl ether and and readily reacts with water like all peroxy acids it is potentially explosive and requires careful handling it is not commercially available but can be made in lab and stored for up to several weeks at 20 degc some preparative methods result in mixtures containing residual hydrogen peroxide and trifluoroacetic acid and heating such a mixture is extremely hazardous hydrogen peroxide can be decomposed using manganese dioxide for safety before heating preparation trifluoroperacetic acid can be easily prepared by an organic syntheses process of treating trifluoroacetic anhydride with a concentrated 90 aqueous solution of hydrogen peroxide as anhydride will form trifluoroacetic acid in contact with water an excess of anhydride also serves to remove solvent from peroxide reactant 2 a more dilute hydrogen peroxide solution 30 can be used to form trifluoroperacetic acid for some reactions from trifluoroacetic acid in order to avoid danger of handling pure or highly concentrated solutions of hydrogen peroxide hydrogen peroxide urea can be used to give peracid this method involves no water so it gives a completely anhydrous peracid which is an advantage when presence of water leads to side reactions during certain oxidation reactions in cases where a ph buffering agent is needed for a synthesis and where presence of water is tolerated another approach has been developed reacting trifluoroacetic anhydride with sodium yields trifluoroperacetic acid and sodium carbonate obviating need for an additional buffer 3 4 6 4 3 trifluoroperacetic acid can also be generated in situ allowing it to react promptly with target substrate rather than pre synthesizing a batch of reagent for later use uses right thumb bis trifluoroacetoxy iodo benzene trifluoroperacetic acid is primarily used as an oxidising agent in september 1953 journal of american chemical society published work by william d emmons and arthur f ferris reporting that this reagent generated in situ was capable of oxidising aniline to over following two years emmons reported a preparative method for this reagent and published six further manuscripts in this journal on its applications emmons is remembered in part as pioneer and developer of trifluoroperacetic acid as a laboratory reagent which has since become useful as a reagent for many different types of synthetic reactions one example is formation of hypervalent iodine compound bis trifluoroacetoxy iodo benzene which is used to carry out hofmann rearrangement under acidic conditions hypervalent compound is accessible in two ways and which is chosen usually depends on what materials are available it can be prepared from its acetate analogue by an exchange reaction or by reacting iodobenzene with a combination of trifluoroperacetic acid and trifluoroacetic acid frameless 400px center baeyer villiger oxidation 400px thumbnail right generalised baeyer villiger oxidation of linear and cyclic ketones trifluoroperacetic acid is one of strongest reagents used for baeyer villiger oxidations as a consequence of its high acidity relative to similar and peroxides this reaction converts ketones to either straight chain esters or lactones and is named for adolf von baeyer and victor villiger who first reported it 1899 reaction is believed to proceed via a intermediate and demonstrates good and for position of oxygen atom insertion along with retention of stereochemistry at adjacent position as can be seen in following example phosphate is added as a ph buffer to prevent highly acidic trifluoroacetic acid byproduct from causing hydrolysis or of ester product frameless center 500px epoxidation prilezhaev reaction involves conversion of an alkene to an epoxide using a peracid as oxidant and was first reported in 1909 reaction has been used as final step of synthesis of a alkaloid in this approach a 4 3 cycloaddition mediated by is used to construct skeleton hydroxyl functional group is then introduced by diastereoselective reduction of ketone with hydride and preparation completed with a prilezhaev trifluoroperacetic acid epoxidation frameless center 600px high reactivity of trifluoroperacetic acid relative to other peroxy acids allows it to successfully oxidize relatively electron poor alkenes such as 1 and a b unsaturated esters such as methyl methacrylate substrates that are generally resistant to peroxy acid epoxidation including additional buffered trifluoroacetic acid in mixture gives a vicinal hydroxy trifluoroacetate structure instead of an epoxide which can be converted to diol by treatment with acidic methanol such as in following conversion of 1 to 1 2 frameless center 600px in case of an allyl alcohol compound with a proximate carbonyl functional group epoxide can undergo a ring expansion reaction to form a dioxolane process below was used as part of total synthesis of a natural product frameless center 700px preparation of isomeric compound sporol involved a similar dioxolane formation in this case use of trifluoroperacetic acid derived from hydrogen peroxide which therefore presumably contained traces of water gave mostly a rather than closed ring dioxolane use of urea complex which gave a water free material successfully gave dioxolane as major product dioxolane is expanded to 1 3 system found in sporol at a later step in synthesis heteroatom oxidation functional groups containing heteroatoms in low oxidation states can be oxidised by trifluoroperacetic acid common cases include oxidation of iodine for example formation of hypervalent iodine compound from iodobenzene mentioned earlier nitrogen sulfur and selenium in case of nitrogen containing compounds known transformations include and aromatic primary amines to nitro compounds even with electron withdrawing substituents for example to to nitramines formation of aromatic n oxides and aromatic n oxides and conversion of nitroso compounds to nitro compounds or nitramines for example a mixture of hydrogen peroxide and trifluoroperacetic acid oxidises nitroso substituted pyrimidine 4 6 5 2 thiol to its nitro analogue while also removing thiol moiety by oxidative hydrolytic desulfurization frameless center 500px in case of chalcogen elements sulfide moieties r s r can be oxidised by trifluoroperacetic acid to sulfoxide r s o r and or r s o 2 r forms depending on conditions used in analogous selenium system trifluoroperacetic acid oxidation of selenoethers r se r produces selones r se o 2 r without formation of related r se o r as an product a reaction which is particularly effective when r is an aryl group a general approach to formation of chlorides rs o cl is reaction of corresponding thiol with chloride in cases where chloride results instead a subsequent trifluoroperacetic acid oxidation affords desired product as in case of 2 2 2 1 1 frameless 600px thumb center trifluoroperacetic acid oxidation of thiophene illustrates competing pathways for reaction with both s oxidation and epoxidation being possible major pathway initially forms sulfoxide but this chemical promptly undergoes a diels alder type dimerisation before any further oxidation occurs neither thiophene s oxide or thiophene s s dioxide are found among products of reaction dimer can then be oxidized further converting one of s oxide moieties to an s s dioxide in minor reaction pathway a prilezhaev epoxidation results in formation of thiophene 2 3 epoxide that rapidly rearranges to isomer thiophene 2 one trapping experiments demonstrate that this epoxide pathway is not an alternative reaction of s oxide intermediate and isotopic labeling experiments demonstrate that a 1 2 hydride shift an nih shift occurs and thus that a cationic intermediate is involved choice of trifluoroperacetic acid preparation method is important as water suppresses minor reaction pathway likely because it acts as a competing base frameless center 500px oxidation with acidic rearrangement use of trifluoroperacetic acid with boron trifluoride causes oxidation of alkenes and aromatic rings with concomitant rearrangement of molecular skeleton for alkenes reaction gives a ketone product though mechanistic process is not simply epoxidation followed by a bf3 catalyzed

400px center oxidative cleavage of arenes in addition to simple oxidation of aromatic rings to form carbonyl compounds see trifluoroperacetic acid can fully cleave carbon carbon bonds within ring unlike other oxidations of structures which yield benzoic acids and related compounds by cleavage of alkyl chain at reactive position trifluoroperacetic acid causes an inverse oxidation cleaving aromatic ring itself while leaving alkyl group intact frameless center 350px this selectivity for certain types of bonds allows it to be used to decompose complex mixtures of such as coal in order to determine structural details aromatic systems containing heteroatoms are resistant to this ring opening as heteroatom oxidation occurs preferentially and deactivates ring towards electrophilic attack by peroxy acid for example purines pyridines and instead form n oxides while sulfur systems like are converted to aromatic systems with ring activating substituents can be oxidised to form phenols instead of undergoing a ring opening reaction mesitylene for example reacts with trifluoroperacetic acid to form 2 4 6 researchers attempting to form a lactone by baeyer villiger oxidation of 7 were unable to prepare desired product but did achieve oxidation of aromatic ring to produce a phenol derivative in high yield frameless center 350px notes references category compounds category organic
