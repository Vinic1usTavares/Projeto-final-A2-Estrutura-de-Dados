camber castle also known formerly as winchelsea castle is a 16th century device fort built near rye by king henry viii to protect sussex coast of england against french attack first fortification on site was a small round artillery tower constructed by henry between 1512 and 1514 overlooking camber anchorage and entrance to rye harbour in 1539 increasing tensions with france encouraged henry to rethink his coastal defence plans and camber castle was rebuilt and extended over next year under direction of moravian engineer stefan von haschenperg results were considered unsatisfactory and further work was carried out from 1542 to 1543 at great expense to rectify problems result was a large concentric artillery fort with a central keep surrounded by four circular bastions and a circular entrance bastion built from stone and brick finished castle was initially equipped with 28 brass and iron artillery guns and a garrison of 28 men commanded by a captain it may have seen service in 1545 when a french fleet attacked coast but its operational value was short lived camber and surrounding harbours began to silt up becoming unusable by shipping and coastline receded away from fort eventually placing it well inland furthermore fort had been superseded by newer european military designs even before it had been completed and peace with france later in century removed much of requirement for fort castle still remained operational up until 1637 when it was closed by king charles i with outbreak of civil war in 1642 much of fortification was dismantled by parliamentary forces to prevent it being used by royalists thumb camber castle in dry landscape of 2018 summer ruins became a popular spot for picnics in 18th and 19th centuries and was painted by j m w turner plans to redevelop castle as a martello tower or as a clubhouse for a local golf course came to nothing although property was used in second world war probably as an early warning site archaeological interest in fort increased after war and in 1967 it was taken into guardianship of state property being bought from private owners in 1977 it is now operated by english heritage who reopened it to visitors after an extensive programme of conservation between 1968 and 1994 fort is an unusual example of an unmodified device fort and is protected under uk law as a grade i listed building history

castle was built approximately between ports of rye and winchelsea on south coast of england overlooking a body of water called camber at mouth of brede rother and rivers two towns were part of cinque ports a strategic chain of maritime towns responsible for providing ships to king s navy although winchelsea s harbour had silted up by 16th century limiting its utility and similar problems were beginning to impact port of rye mouth of camber had also begun to silt up in late medieval period although in this case process had created an important new anchorage for ships first fortification at camber may have been built shortly after 1486 by sir richard guldeford master of ordnance who was given manor of higham by king henry vii in exchange for richard constructing a tower to protect anchorage there is no surviving evidence however to show if a tower was in fact built as guldeford had promised and henry vii did not invest much in his coastal defences during rest of his reign many castles across england were left in poor repair often considered to be outdated and too expensive to maintain henry viii became king in 1509 and began to follow a more aggressive policy towards neighbouring france than his father tensions increased and in 1512 henry ordered construction of an artillery tower and a new bridge at camber work was carried out by edward guldeford richard s son and cost ps1 309 over next two years resulting circular stone tower was across and around high occupying shingle spit of kevill point and controlling camber and port of rye it would have provided relatively limited facilities and living accommodation and was probably not permanently garrisoned despite being an artillery tower with a flat roof to carry heavy guns tower was not initially supplied with any artillery and was therefore unable to protect rye against hostile naval expeditions which attacked coast in 1520s after many letters from guldeford to lord chancellor cardinal thomas wolsey some guns finally arrived around 1536 in form of wrought iron serpentines prescient concerns began to be raised in mid 1530s about whether camber might silt up further and ultimately become unusable as an anchorage concentric design 1539 40 thumb upright keep based on original artillery tower in 1539 threat of invasion from france and spain grew and henry issued orders for his coastal defences to be improved creating a sequence of fortifications called device forts across england these were intended to carry artillery pieces able to engage enemy naval vessels should they approach coast and to deter any enemy landings as part of this programme of work camber castle was considerably expanded at a cost of ps5 660 first phase of this work took place from 1539 until autumn 1540 moravian engineer stefan von haschenperg was responsible for design of fort being paid substantial salary of ps75 a year for his work on this and other similar projects including calshot hurst sandgate and sandown philip chute john fletcher and william oxenbridge all prominent local men served as commissioners for project oxenbridge becoming pay master finding sufficient numbers of workmen was difficult and some had to be pressed into service unwillingly more artillery pieces were sent to castle ahead of work being completed and were probably installed in temporary battery positions around castle site initially old tower was converted into a stronger keep which was able to support artillery guns on its roof a gatehouse was built alongside it four stirrup towers so called because of their shape a curtain wall was constructed around outside of castle and bastions erected around wall towards end of this phase of work castle was altered in a frantic burst of work possibly driven on by pressure from king himself height of curtain wall was increased gatehouse extended into an entrance bastion a new network of underground passages installed and foreworks added around outside of bastions by end of 1540 castle was garrisoned with 17 men and equipped with artillery with chute appointed as its captain result was a concentric fortress which von haschenperg had hoped would combine best of italian military architecture able to carry heavy guns but with a low profile to protect against any incoming artillery fire various flaws rapidly became apparent castle s design had focused on defence with result that guns could not easily be brought to bear on enemy vessels which had been original intent of building fortification by camber some of angles of fire from defences were blocked by entrance and high water table may have caused serious damp problems on ground floor furthermore design was different from other device forts constructed across region and would have stood out as unusual and not in keeping with king s general intent for chain of forts redeveloped concentric design 1542 43 thumb 250px castle s concentric design seen from air as a result of problems with original design in summer 1542 work recommenced on castle well after initial invasion scare was over lasting until august 1543 decision to rectify problems with castle may have been taken by king henry himself oxenbridge appears to have stayed on as pay master and acted as master of works with von haschenperg remaining in his role as engineer almost until end of project despite difficulties with his earlier work cost of second phase of work was much higher than first around ps10 000 design was rather different to von haschenperg s first castle keep and stirrup towers were raised in height level of floors elevated curtain wall was strengthened old bastions entirely removed and four new larger bastions added in their place while older foreworks around castle were demolished keep s flat roof was altered to a pitched design and guns that it had supported moved into outlying bastions although size of castle had slightly decreased new design had much more domestic space available for garrison in practice even revised design ignored acute angled bastions which had been introduced in europe round towers creating numerous patches of dead ground around castle into which its guns could not fire high walls presented a greater target internal design was complicated and it remained difficult to move around inside fort indeed historian peter harrington describes final design as even more archaic than its predecessor chute s role was extended to become keeper and captain of camber and keeper of waters of camber and puddle in january 1544 for which he was paid two shillings a day haschenperg left england in disgrace in 1544 facing complaints that he was a man who will pretend more knowledge than he hath indeed bulk of stone for two phases of project was acquired by demolishing monastic buildings in winchelsea and by purchasing it from nearby fairlight and hastings quarries higher quality stone was bought from in hampshire and from various suppliers in normandy timber was acquired from and knell latter two lumber felling operations being run directly by camber project team chalk was brought from dover to manufacture lime and at least 16 000 bricks initially purchased to make necessary kilns with possibly over 500 000 further bricks being manufactured locally as work progressed steel iron and tiles were bought locally in sussex along with a crane for project s quay operational use thumb left a replica 16th century english bronze culverin near and an iron portpiece castle was already obsolete by time it had been completed as european military design had moved beyond curved bastions embracing angular designs seen in later star forts nonetheless it remained operational as an artillery fort for rest of century with an initial garrison in 1540 of 24 men under command of chute rising to 28 men and captain after 1542 although it had been fitted with gunloops for handguns from very start castle initially relied heavily on archers for its own protection against attack from land it had stocks of 140 longbows and 560 sheaves of arrows in 1568 for example probably for use by local militia in event of a war polearms were also stored there in considerable numbers again probably for use by militia initially fort was equipped with between 26 and 28 artillery pieces including brass demi cannons culverins demi culverins and a falconet and wrought iron guns such as bases and slings after 1568 castle typically held around nine or ten guns for most of 16th century including cannons demi cannons culverins and demi culverins brass guns could fire more quickly up to eight times an hour and were safer to use than their iron equivalents it is uncertain how far castle s guns could have reached analysis carried out in 16th and 17th century on ranges of artillery suggested that a culverin for example could hit at a target up to between and away in july 1545 french carried out a raid at nearby seaford and castle may have seen action against french fleet soon however silt began to block entrance to camber threatening its use as an anchorage complaints were made to parliament about situation in 1548 and authorities in rye expressed fears in 1573 that camber was damaged beyond repair by end of century reclamation of surrounding marshes and dumping of ballast by passing ships had accelerated natural processes and anchorage was ruined surrounding region was also less strategically important than it had once been towns like winchelsea and rye were in decline peace had been made with france in 1558 and military attention shifted towards spanish threat to south west of england castle was garrisoned from 1553 onwards by between 26 and 27 men including 17 gunners they were led by a captain thomas wilford having taken over this role by 1570 as century went on castle became difficult to maintain by 1568 gun platforms were reported to be in utter ruing and decay with repairs projected to be likely to cost around ps60 although it is unclear whether repairs were carried out tensions between spain and england rose and in 1584 queen elizabeth i spent ps171 on repairs to castle amid fresh fears of an invasion war broke out next year and in 1588 year of spanish armada a jesuit priest called father and roger walton a spy in pay of spanish made plans to hand over castle to an invading force of french and spanish soldiers although conspiracy never came to fruition in 1593 there was a fresh crisis with spain and brass guns needed for english navy were in short supply brass artillery pieces were therefore rounded up from forts along south coast including camber number of guns at castle remained around same but larger brass culverins and demi cannon were removed being replaced with smaller iron demi culverins sakers and a minion in 1594 another royal survey suggested that ps95 of repair work was needed on fortifications 17th 19th centuries closure and english civil war camber castle went through several changes at start of 17th century in 1610 peter temple was appointed as captain of castle and between 1610 and 1614 garrison was reduced to 14 soldiers including only 4 gunners either as an effort to reduce costs or as a result of changing types of artillery kept at castle north and south bastions were filled in to form solid gun platforms around approximately 1613 and 1615 and an earth rampart called rampire was built up against south corner of castle these solid bastions would have sacrificed living space less in demand with a smaller garrison but been much cheaper to maintain longbows fell out of use in warfare as archery in england declined and were replaced by arquebuses and muskets 46 of which were kept at castle in 1614 sir john temple took over as captain in 1615 being replaced by robert bacon by 1618 fortification was now both antiquated and too far from receding sea to be useful in 1623 it was suggested that castle should be closed and king charles i was briefed on dilapidated condition of fortification which was now reportedly around from sea local towns campaigned to keep castle operational but in 1636 charles issued an instruction to demolish it garrison by now led by captain thomas porter left next year followed by artillery when civil war broke out in 1642 between supporters of charles and those of parliament camber castle had not been entirely closed and was being used as a royal munitions store citizens of rye sided with parliament which agreed that weapons and stores in castle should be removed and taken to town for safe keeping concerned that it might be seized by royalist forces parliament went on to dismantle castle over next year stripping lead from roof blocking up gunports and demolishing living accommodation as a result camber castle was not used by royalists during second english civil war in 1648 despite several other of device forts along south coast being occupied ruins thumb engraving of castle ruins in 1785 after restoration of charles ii to throne in 1660 a royal survey of castle found fortification to be in ruins an increasing number of visitors came to see castle in 18th and 19th centuries with north east corner becoming a popular site for picnics writing in 1785 antiquarian francis grose attributed decline of fortification to changes in local harbours and superiority of british navy in protecting coasts observing that castle s architecture clearly shew low state of military architecture during 16th century in england in response to threat posed by france during napoleonic wars lieutenant colonel john brown surveyed castle in 1804 to examine whether central keep could be turned into a martello tower a type of circular gun tower popular during this period scheme was not taken forward although defences of surrounding coast line were much improved by government painter j m w turner visited between 1805 and 1807 during middle of this work later depicting castle in landscape paintings and sketches of area 20th 21st centuries thumb left an aerial view of castle centre with river brede left modern castle water right and rye harbour top right at start of 20th century camber castle and surrounding farmland remained in private ownership and open to visitors in 1931 there was a proposal to turn keep into a golf clubhouse but project was not taken forward and facility was built at nearby castle farm instead a research team from victoria county history project visited castle in 1935 resulting in first albeit cursory historical analysis and survey of fortification being published two years later by 1940s castle structures were mostly covered with rubble and debris interwoven with pathways created by movement of visitors over years during second world war castle was used by british army possibly as an early warning site fitted with anti aircraft searchlights in an area just to north of castle starfish and naval decoy sites were created to distract incoming german bombers from town of rye itself trenches were dug in north bastion and military training may have been conducted around outskirts of castle in post war years archaeological interest in castle grew from 1951 onwards ministry of works carried out a long running research project into device forts section on camber being written by historian martin biddle and finally published in 1982 biddle carried out an exploratory archaeological survey of site in 1962 and following year ruins were closed to allow more extensive archaeological excavation by ministry these were initially carried out by biddle and alan cook with support from local school children and from young offenders from borstal institution in dover state took camber castle into guardianship in 1967 and next year government began a slow process of restoring castle with intention of eventually reopening it to public their efforts largely focusing on protecting internal brick walls and wall cores further excavations followed in 1970s and early 1980s in 1977 department of national heritage bought castle from its owners government agency english heritage took control of castle in 1984 and a scheme to reopen property to visitors was put forward in 1993 this included a final assessment of archaeological work of previous decades and castle finally opened to public again in 1994 as of 2015 castle is open to visitors through guided tours organised by rye harbour nature reserve site is protected under uk law as a grade i listed building architecture and landscape landscape camber castle now lies on brede

as largest of device forts at deal in kent first tower on site was built from fine grained yellow sandstone with later expansion making use of both yellow and grey sandstone with imported caen stone being used for finer detailing ironstone siltstone and brown sandstone rubble and boulders was used for core of castle walls some of it taken from local cliffs castle would have been entered through entrance bastion core of this building was constructed in second phase of work on castle and was initially a square one storey construct across before being extended forward by an additional to form a circular bastion an additional floor was then added on top in third phase internal walls have mostly been destroyed but ground floor chambers would have been used for administration and possibly as living rooms for deputy captain first floor would have formed a high status set of chambers for use of captain and included large windows fireplaces and a private garderobe but most of this storey has been destroyed a special german was probably fitted into chambers for use of philip chute first captain of castle and was illustrated with pictures of soldiers and protestant german leaders only fragments of stove have survived in centre of fortification was keep built up from round tower of 1512 14 and of original building s walls were incorporated into new design original tower had ten gunports embedded at ground level in its walls but these were blocked up in second phase of building keep would originally had a parapet running around its roof which was initially flat but converted to a ridged design in third phase of work ground floor was laid in brick and had a brick and stone lined well to supply it with water keep had two fireplaces but these were small and not intended for cooking indeed final version of keep was probably never used as a living space first floor windows were added in final phase of work they were not intended for use as gunports but they had bars and shutters so could have been easily secured in event of an attack an underground vaulted ring passageway only high ran around outside of keep with similar covered radial passageways leading off to each of bastions passageways are now ruined a cobbled courtyard surrounded keep separating it from external defences and containing a well in north west corner underground passageways led from entrance bastion to outside castle walls either to allow garrison to escape in an emergency or to assault a besieging force outer part of castle was defended by an octagonal wall which linked four stirrup turrets and bastions that formed main defences for castle this wall had initially been built in second phase of work on castle but was then supplemented in final phase with an additional exterior facing and was originally finished with a gun embrasure along each section and parapets a two storey gallery which provided relatively spacious barrack accommodation for garrison ran all way around inside of wall although only ground floor of gallery now survives gallery would have been lit by windows facing into courtyard rampire earthwork built in early 17th century lies across south and south east parts of defences where gunports were blocked up with stone when earth was piled up along inside of castle four stirrup towers are two storeys tall across internally with walls flat at front and curved at back they would originally have been topped by firing platforms with gunloops around inside of fortification enabling their occupants to fire into courtyard if necessary bastions built around outside of towers in third phase of work are wide internally and each extend from their respective stirrup tower with walls most of bastions had a single internal gun room with a robust gun deck on top but west bastion was used as a kitchen and interior was fitted with two circular ovens and a range for cooking bastions would have been connected by a wall walk and parapets but these have since been lost south stirrup tower and bastion remains partially buried as a result of construction of rampire see also castles in great britain and ireland list of castles in england notes
