two games in arkham series said he would not be involved in writing a sequel to arkham city he did not write that game s story based harley quinn s revenge downloadable content and said that warner bros and rocksteady suggested he accept other work if offered rocksteady opted to use its own team of writers headed by game director sefton hill and designer ian ball with script elements by martin lancaster geoff johns served as a consultant on plot thumb upright left kevin conroy serves as voice of batman in all of rocksteady s arkham games development of arkham knight began in 2011 after completion of work on arkham city and took four years to finish it was publicly revealed in march 2014 following leaked marketing material at end of february with series creators rocksteady studios returning to develop game following development of 2013 s batman arkham origins by wb games montreal arkham knight is described as concluding chapter of arkham series from rocksteady they had a finale for series in mind since development of arkham city kevin conroy returns as voice of batman having done so in arkham asylum and arkham city after stating at 2013 dallas comic con that he had been working on next arkham this statement led to speculation that he would reprise his role as batman in arkham origins only arkham game known to be in development at time which was not case rocksteady decided early on in development to make arkham knight only for then upcoming next generation of consoles which was considered to allow them to focus on using system resources to their fullest without reining in their ideas to accommodate older generation systems game allows for up to five times number of on screen enemies as were possible in arkham city and riots can feature up to fifty on screen enemies interacting with environment to smash items and spray graffiti technical changes also allowed for cutscenes to be rendered in real time in game engine where previous installments had used pre rendered videos to compensate describing scale of difference between arkham knight and earlier games lead character artist albert feliu said that a single character model in arkham knight could contain same amount of polygons used to render entirety of arkham asylums environment arkham knight is first in series to use apex physics simulation engine to have items like cloth such as batman s cape react realistically to movement or wind warner bros supported rocksteady s concept for game but both parties felt that three years was too long to wait between games so wb games montreal was tasked with creating prequel arkham origins to fill gap unlike arkham origins game does not feature a multiplayer component as hill explained development team knew single player game would take team s full effort with their focus on making best single player experience we can we did not feel that it needed a multiplayer element warner bros backed that up right at start design batman s batmobile was an aspect of character that rocksteady had wanted to include in its other arkham games but were limited by technical constraints designers who worked in conjunction with dc chose to look at their earlier design from arkham asylum instead of models from history of batman comics and media and evolve that to meet necessary gameplay requirements vehicle was designed to integrate with batman s on foot traversal without being a burden hill stated we didn t want it to be like okay batmobile is so good i ll just stay in that all time or batman is so powerful gliding around i won t be using batmobile there s a definite need to use both of those world s challenges were set out on vertical and horizontal plane of map to discourage players from using only one form of movement with batmobile providing a faster method for moving large distances over gliding unlike arkham origins arkham knight does not feature a fast travel system as designers considered traversal to be part of game and allowing players to skip that would detract from experience buildings hit by vehicle suffer cosmetic damage without slowing car as it was considered that being impeded by a collision while turning a corner would diminish fantasy of driving batmobile during early development rocksteady placed a prototype batmobile in existing arkham city map and learned that claustrophobic city designed for batman to glide and grapple did not work well for driving a vehicle gotham city was thus redesigned with wider streets to allow space for batmobile and other street traffic to drive without colliding into walls and buildings were made taller to accommodate vehicle s ejection ability to redesign gotham city designers attempted to build on previous games gothic architecture while making a more believable and dense city alongside minor elements like neon lights billboard advertising and american style cars team developed ideas for shops that could be found in city while retaining a grimy dystopian theme describing design hego said every kind of element we ve added in there makes entire experience feel a little out of time you couldn t pinpoint whether it s twenty years ago now or in ten years time designers valued making an open world that was rich vibrant dense and full of interesting things to do over it just being large in writing for batman hill considered that a fundamental aspect of character was how he interacts with his villains allies and city around him hill said you know what does it mean to be batman how does it affect batman when things happen to him what is his psychological make up those are influences behind game you actually delve into psyche of what makes him what he is which is where i think so much of interest in batman is batman s armor was redesigned to match that of batmobile to make them appear visually similar featuring same shapes and material textures and appear functionally compatible with high speed methods in which character enters and exits vehicle design also added armor over batman s shoulders covering previously exposed cape to make it appear more feasible that it could hold batman s weight without failing during gliding for other returning characters art director david hego said that designs were conceived to keep them interesting after players had seen them several times before in previous games while game s autumnal setting also necessitated a change in character clothing over winter setting of arkham city penguin lost his long coat and was made to look dirtier his clothing showing signs of sweat and food stains and his head was shaved for two face designers felt character did not require changing significantly and instead emphasized existing character traits particularly his disfigured flesh using references of burnt flesh as inspiration similarly they wanted to retain typical riddler characterizations like green shirts emblazoned with question marks but instead had character design evolve throughout game modifying his own costume in response to events of plot music arkham asylum and arkham city composer nick arundel returned to score arkham knight while his partner on those games ron fish was replaced by composer david buckley on his continued involvement in series arundel said one of good things about doing a sequel is you get opportunity to redo things you wished you changed to revisit things we have a set of material that we want to keep consistent like batman theme we wanted to keep that theme and tailor it more to story for this game how can we get scarecrow element out of that one theme arundel added that buckley was willing to work within music he had already created as opposed to wanting to add his own personal touch to it buckley received arundel s work from arkham asylum to help create new variations on chords and melody from original theme volume 1 of official soundtrack was released from watertower music alongside game on june 23 2015 and a limited edition vinyl record featuring fifteen songs from soundtrack chosen by arundel singer and record producer trent reznor served as a music consultant on arkham knights be batman trailer however game also features three songs including i ve got you under my skin by frank sinatra mercy by muse and wretched by nine inch nails release batman arkham knight was released on playstation 4 xbox one and windows on june 23 2015 game was originally scheduled to be released on october 14 2014 which in turn was delayed to june 2 2015 on first delay rocksteady marketing game manager guy perkins stated if we didn t give team more time to do it then we would be releasing something that we weren t happy with we want to make sure we re absolutely nailing it 100 a quality assurance tester for game added getting game to work

nothing short of revolutionary and best game of this console generation steve tilley of toronto sun deemed game fantastic if a little formulaic he felt it a satisfying and appropriately large scale conclusion to rocksteady s arkham games praising surprises in plot as well as graphics combat and batmobile s range of abilities andrew reiner of game informer awarded arkham knight a 9 5 out of 10 calling it a narrative juggernaut with mother of all plot twists he described game s gotham city as a beautifully realized playground for batman highlighting distinctive boroughs and added that batmobile packs a satisfying punch with its cannon with additional praise to riddler racetracks and game variety he felt though that combat was somewhat easier than previous games most notably due to game s dual play mechanic simon miller writing for videogamer com gave game a 10 out 10 score and called it best batman game ever made and a classic in its own right a masterpiece despite perfect score miller did name batmobile as one of game s faults though lauded rush of adrenaline invoked while driving car through streets of city eurogamer s dan whitehead recommended game giving high praise to detail of open world and characterization of batman but again criticizing batmobile s battle mode feature as one of weaker aspects of game gamestm gave arkham knight a 9 out of 10 praising game for functioning without presence of joker and praising story for its intimacy and inviting epic scale nature batmobile gameplay was described as thrilling though least immersive part of game dual play elements were also hailed as best aspect of game in addition to their involvement with riddler challenges chris carter of destructoid conversely was heavily critical of riddler challenges and their requirement for game s full ending finding many to be tedious while others lacked any resemblance of actual riddles such as breakable objects he felt that puzzles driven by intuition were better elements of mission kevin vanord writing for gamespot awarded game a 7 out of 10 praising game s terrific amount of variety its improvement of past games elements cleverness of game s puzzles and dual play mechanics vanord reacted positively to segments involving batmobile s battle mode calling it a delight and called vehicle s driving slick and satisfying however vanord found fault with some of game s logic particularly clash between batman s no kill rule and batmobile s significant propensity for destruction he also noted how story s thematic elements and repeated metaphors became redundant mentioning its ham fisted storytelling and describing game overall as only as good as world allows it to be sam roberts from gamesradar noted game s satisfying cinematic value particularly moments in which it felt like batman animated series however roberts did reserve some criticisms calling some of batmobile s additions slippery and deemed it a mixed affair campaign was described as full of generally wonky storytelling sometimes hammy dialogue and unconvincing duo of primary villains roberts praised gorgeous open world and its side missions as almost universally fantastic finding fault with firefly missions among others riddler s batmobile racetracks were considered beyond silly though he still commended character for his increased involvement in story additionally stapleton and paul tassi of forbes both took issue to rocksteady s marketing of arkham knight as an original character as moniker was original but character in role was not stapleton felt problem was that marketing for character indicated it was a big mystery to his identity but any moderately knowledgeable batman fan could reasonably deduce identity we all already knew who arkham knight was we were just hoping it wasn t true because we wanted original story we d been promised tassi criticized rocksteady for promising a new character and insisting identity would shock and amaze us all when it turned out to essentially be a renamed and version of a character that has already existed for years additional content carter was critical of harley quinn and red hood story packs both originally pre order bonuses before being released as purchasable dlc carter called both painfully and disgustingly short respectively with harley pack lasting around 30 minutes and red hood around 10 minutes he added that he expected more from downloadable content hoping additional arkham stories would feature more content for batgirl a matter of family story pack stapleton offered a mixed reaction giving dlc a 6 3 out of 10 praising unique design and atmosphere of theme park setting and also commenting positively on story variation in combat batgirl s character design and mark hamill s performance as joker a prominent concern however was short length of campaign and lack of replay value aside from rather simple collectables found around map he added worse there s no new ar challenge map where you can play as batgirl which means her great looking character model is trapped in this single piece of story content considering arkham knight is fairly stingy in challenge map department that s another big missed opportunity reiner felt pack would only be of value to players who enjoy arkham story stating developer wb montreal can be commended for creating a wonderfully realized version of batgirl who is resourceful and capable of striking fear into joker s henchmen but mission she embarks on lacks creativity and ranks among arkham series worst he did however praise side story involving edward burke person who built amusement park where story takes place calling it twisted and dark and shedding new light on one of series mainstays aoife wilson of eurogamer was critical of batgirl s characterization calling it a bland no frills reading of character to be frank which focuses on her familial connections rather than her youthful exuberance wilson also lamented that emphasis on batgirl s hacking abilities proved to be no more than a simple extension of arkham knights remote hacking environmental puzzles she offered words similar to stapleton s on how lack of additional challenge maps confines batgirl character model to only dlc wilson was skeptical as to whether future season pass dlc would be worth purchasing unless there was an increase in production value and a real introduction to new gadgets and gameplay variety carter gave dlc a 6 5 out of 10 reacting positively to confinement to good bits of arkham knight more specifically lack of batmobile and an emphasis on puzzle solving he also compared it favorably to harley quinn and red hood story packs towards which he previously gave negative reviews in contrast to stapleton carter felt that not many of environments were particularly memorable and also felt length was sufficient compared to game s previous story packs carter pointed out that a benefit to game would be a free roaming option involving downloadable characters meanwhile erik kain of forbes felt that dlc should have been provided free of charge remarking on campaign s shortness and calling it straightforward and lackluster he also criticized warner bros for their marketing campaign with arkham knight and its dlc commenting on their sacrificing quality over quantity to continuously charge customers for rather mediocre content carter awarded season of infamy content a 7 5 out of 10 he felt that mad hatter mission was weakest link in chain calling it a neat concept but it s so fleeting that i barely had time to digest it for killer croc s carter said mission was a predictable storyline since killer croc is generally portrayed as a one dimensional foe though i t works better than mad hatter s portion because most of it isn t re used environments and there is a nice brief reunion with nightwing speaking of mister freeze mission carter called exploration of freeze s relationship with his wife nora compelling and enjoyed fact it was only season of infamy mission to feature a predator challenge additionally he added that batmobile sequence had more of a reason to exist than most of ones in campaign finally carter called ra s al ghul mission other highlight of pack and felt choice mission gave players at end was pretty interesting he also added setting of elliot general hospital was a good way to highlight hush s family legacy since his part in main game was extremely disappointing technical issues on windows version windows version of game had a more mixed reception with criticism aimed mostly at technical issues present at time of game s release ultimately leading to sales being suspended on june 23 2015 launch day for arkham knight thousands of users reported major technical flaws and performance problems with windows version of game with some saying it seemed like optimization phase of game s development was skipped steam users immediately wrote scathing reviews of game s performance including reports of frame rate being capped at 30 frames per second which could be raised though with potential side effects and dropping as low as 10 frames per second while gliding or using batmobile even high end graphics cards such as nvidia s geforce gtx 970 were unable to handle game well with users reporting frequent frame rate dips and stutters nvidia and amd released new

retail versions were being recalled by middle of july warner bros announced they were targeting an interim patch update for existing players to be released in august on august 21 2015 warner bros

available for sale again on october 28 2015 along with a patch updating game to include all previously released dlc and content updates except console exclusives after game was made available again it was still criticized for lingering technical issues resulting in warner bros offering full refunds for game as well as game s season pass until end of 2015 regardless of how long game was owned warner
