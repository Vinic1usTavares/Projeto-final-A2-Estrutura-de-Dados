northernmost point accessible by road from rainy river area heenan would become minister of lands and forests in mitch hepburn s cabinet this provided impetus for construction to begin in 1934 unlike previously built roads in area fort frances kenora highway as it was known prior to its opening was constructed through rugged terrain of canadian shield rocks forests lakes muskeg and insects served as major obstacles during construction of highway which progressed from both ends by late 1935 only remaining gap in road was sioux narrows bridge construction on this bridge was underway by march 1936 it was rapidly assembled using douglas fir from british columbia as main structural members bridge was completed on june 15 1936 completing link between fort frances and kenora thumb right sioux
