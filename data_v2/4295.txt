m class cruisers were a class of light cruisers planned but never built by nazi germany s kriegsmarine before world war ii ships were designed for commerce raiding in atlantic ocean design for first four ships suffered from a number of problems and so fifth and sixth ships were substantially redesigned name of class is taken from letter designating first projected unit as long as ships were not named they were referred to by letters assigned in chronological order of their planned construction first planned unit would have been thirteenth german cruiser and was therefore listed as cruiser m in navy s documents had any of ships been built class would have been named after first completed unit development and cancellation m class was intended for use as a scout for commerce raiding squadrons envisioned under plan z zabecki p 901 ships design process started in 1936 ships were intended for long range commerce raiding they were an improvement over previous designs which suffered from insufficient range to be effective commerce raiders however requirements placed on design high maximum and cruising speeds long range heavy armament and armor sufficient to withstand 15 cm shells all on a displacement no more than 8 000 metric tons were deemed impossible by design staff in july 1937 oberbefehlshaber der marine commander in chief of navy requested proposals from both naval design staff as well as private dockyards none of designs by dockyards were practical and so official design which only met some of requirements was chosen groner p 124 during further development of design serious flaws became apparent including weakness of both main battery and anti aircraft armament as well as insufficiently thick armor protection stepped arrangement of deck armor wasted space and was therefore impractical layout of propulsion system was also problematic both turbines were in same engine room and therefore each were vulnerable to disabling if other was damaged their crew spaces were also insufficient for long range cruises as a result design was heavily modified for last two ships of class q and r groner pp 124 125 initial design borrowed on contemporary british and french ships and respectively distribution of m class ships side armor was most obvious influence of southampton class design contract for m was assigned to deutsche werke in kiel under construction number 263 n followed at kriegsmarinewerft in wilhelmshaven as number 129 o construction number 606 was assigned to germaniawerft in kiel but on 8 august 1939 contract was transferred to kriegsmarinewerft p was also assigned to germaniawerft under number 607 q was assigned to schichau in danzig and contract for r was awarded to deutsche werke only keels for m and n were laid in 1938 but construction was halted on 19 and 21 september 1939 respectively both hulls were broken up on stocks shortly thereafter design general characteristics first four m class ships m n o and p were 178 meters long at waterline and 183 meters long overall they had a beam of 17 meters and a draft of 5 42 meters standard 7 25 meters forward and 6 03 meters aft ships had a designed displacement of 8 500 metric tons but displaced 7 800 tons at standard load and 10 400 tons fully laden groner p 125 ships had a crew of 28 officers and 892 men they were designed to carry one picket boat a barge a launch and two cutters last two ships q and r were enlarged versions 188 meters long at waterline and 196 m overall their beams were 1 meter wider at 18 meters ships draft was lower at 5 4 meters ships were designed to displace 9 300 tons and displaced 8 568 tons standard all six ships were to have steel made and up to 85 welded construction design called for fifteen watertight compartments and a double bottom for 78 of length of hull all six ships were intended to use two sets of brown boveri co and wagner turbines or marine type turbines built by germaniawerft and four man double acting 12 cylinder two stroke diesels q and r however was equipped with an additional four diesels for a total of eight turbines were powered by four wagner ultra high pressure boilers designed to put out 58 atmospheres of pressure propulsion system drove three screws although four were considered for q and r ships electrical power was supplied by four generators that produced 2 400 kw at 220 volts armament and armor all six ships were armed with same set of weaponry primary armament consisted of eight 15 cm l 55 quick firing guns mounted in four twin turrets in superfiring pairs fore and aft guns had a total of 960 shells for 120 rounds per gun 15 cm twin turrets were drh l c 34 mounts same type as those fitted to and s as well as a number of other designs gardiner chesneau p 232 turrets allowed depression to 10 degrees and elevation to 40 degrees which enabled a maximum range of 15 cm guns had a rate of fire of between 6 and 8 rounds per minute at a muzzle velocity of 875 meters per second 2 871 ft s guns used two propellant charges a rpc 38 fore charge and a main charge in a brass cartridge ships carried four 8 8 cm l 76 anti aircraft guns in two twin turrets aft of main superstructure 8 8 cm guns were supplied with 1 600 shells for 400 rounds per gun these guns fired high explosive shells at a rate of fire of 15 to 20 rounds per minute and a muzzle velocity of 950 m s 3 117 ft s guns could elevate to 80 degrees which allowed them to hit targets flying at m class ships were also equipped with eight 3 7 cm aa guns in twin mounts centered on superstructure they had a total of 9 600 shells anti aircraft weaponry was supplemented with four 2 cm guns each of which had 2 000 rounds ships were also armed with eight deck mounted torpedo tubes and approximately 60 mines ships were to have been protected with krupp and wotan hart wotan hard armor plating class decks were 20 mm thick with 35 mm thick sloped deck conning tower had a roof that was 50 mm thick and sides 100 mm thick inner layer of armor belt was 50 mm thick in critical areas amidships and tapered down to zero protection at stern and bow outer layer was 30 mm amidships it too tapered down to nothing at both ends of ships gun turrets had same armor protection as preceding light cruiser sides were 35 mm thick faces were 80 mm thick roofs ranged in thickness from 20 35 mm armor protecting turret barbettes was 60 mm thick groner p 122 footnotes references category plan z category cruiser classes category cruisers of kriegsmarine category proposed ships of germany
