father in politically charged atmosphere of day in boston selfridge fearing for his own safety had armed himself with a dueling pistol younger austin had apparently on his own initiative sought to

in yellow in 1796 sullivan was appointed by secretary of state timothy pickering to be united states agent to binational commission established under terms of jay treaty to formalize border between maine and british now canadian province of new brunswick southern portion of border had been defined as saint croix river in 1783 treaty of paris which ended american revolutionary war but there was some question as to which river it actually was because area was then sparsely peopled and poorly surveyed and maps of area contained conflicting references to named river amory pp 305 316 sullivan s responsibility was to gather relevant maps and legal documents and then present a legal case for united states claim for what border should be in addition to researching materials in massachusetts archives sullivan spent a significant amount of time exploring poorly surveyed and remote passamaquoddy bay attempting to build a case that river was river intended by treaty negotiators which river it was hinged on location of a 1604 french settlement on an island in river and commissioners and agents explored area and ordered surveys surveys located evidence of settlement on saint croix island after which commission fixed southern portion of border on what is now known as saint croix river amory pp 314 332 disposition of some islands in bay was not settled and northern portion of border would not be fixed until 1842 webster ashburton treaty amory p 333 governor sullivan received republican nomination for governor in 1797 and 1798 but lost to federalist increase sumner in 1798 by a landslide after xyz affair lent strength to federalist cause robinson pp 15 17 republicanism eventually began gaining ground in massachusetts and sullivan was again nominated in 1805 and 1806 for governor losing both times to popular incumbent governor caleb strong in 1806 republicans gained control of massachusetts legislature which managed to very nearly deny strong a narrow victory with fewer than 200 votes in balance republican controlled legislature scrutinized returns in a partisan manner discarding ballots that had misspelled strong s name while retaining those that misspelled sullivan s and performing tallies in ways that favored their candidate this process concluded with a finding that strong in fact lacked a majority of votes which was what was then required to carry election as opposed to modern plurality requirement strong s federalist allies in legislature were able to publicize partisan nature of analysis resulting in a hostile public backlash he was proclaimed winner after further less biased analysis corrected count in his favor morison p 272 in 1807 sullivan again faced strong but was this time decisively victorious carrying eastern counties present day maine by a wide margin amid a series of republican victories throughout new england banks p 54 robinson pp 47 49 thumb left upright caleb strong although sullivan sought in some ways to be a moderate voice in highly partisan disagreements between federalists and republicans he supported policy of president thomas jefferson in embargoing trade with great britain and france who were then embroiled in napoleonic wars embargo act of 1807 had a significant negative impact on shipping interests based in massachusetts ports and federalists sought to use this and threats of war emanating from jefferson administration to unseat sullivan in 1808 federalist senator timothy pickering wrote an open letter raising specter of war and charging jefferson with failing to publish critical documents in ongoing negotiations he then asked sullivan to formally send it to state legislature with view that this would imply sullivan s agreement with its content sullivan refused after which federalists used that fact to charge that republicans generally were withholding damaging information sullivan s defense included letters by senator john quincy adams countering federalist charges while this was sufficient to ensure sullivan s reelection in 1808 control of legislature was returned to federalists buel pp 39 44 republicans were unhappy with sullivan s handling of political attacks and for his refusal to remove federalists from patronage positions in government buel p 44 federalist legislature immediately launched attacks on sullivan and republicans which sullivan was not immediately able to respond to in spring of 1808 before may opening of legislature sullivan s health began to decline epilepsy and an organic disease of heart so he was unable to seize initiative when he finally made his speech to assembly he failed to respond to political aspects of dispute and called for national unity in dealing with outside interests his warnings to jefferson on nature of contentious disputes going on in state were attributed by jefferson to his declining mental state buel p 46 cognizant of sullivan s precarious health federalists sought a delay in electing a slate of electors for electoral college in 1808 presidential election sullivan who would have vetoed a slate of federalist electors as they were then chosen by legislature and not by popular vote federalist legislative majority would have assured this he acquiesced in hopes that elective actions in other states would moot decision made in massachusetts buel p 48 sullivan also came under criticism by political partisans on both sides for issuing large numbers of exemptions to embargo ostensibly to avoid civil strife in event of a grain shortage buel p 53 when legislature met in november it rejected a proposal by sullivan that popular elections determine state s electoral slate and instead chose a federalist slate supporting charles cotesworth pinckney for president in a vote boycotted by many republicans based on widespread opinion that federalists were likely to lose presidential election sullivan his health failing forwarded electoral votes on to congress buel p 57 he died in office on december 10 1808 aged 64 buel p 58 and was interred in boston s granary burying ground in a tomb shared by colonial governor richard bellingham historical sketch and matters appertaining to

charles river connecting boston to cambridge and was instrumental in development of boston s first public water supply a wooden aqueduct from jamaica pond amory p 293 family and legacy sullivan s brothers were active participants in revolutionary war john daniel and ebenezer all served in continental army john served with some distinction until he retired from army to enter new hampshire

was also captured in action and died aboard a british prison ship maier p 284 sullivan maine is named for his brother daniel one of early settlers of that area hatch p 241 and several places in new hampshire are named for john gannett p 293 in 1808 while sullivan was governor a small fortification now known as fort sullivan was constructed in eastport maine who it is named for is uncertain one early eastport historian states that john and james are both likely candidates preferring john for his association with general henry dearborn who ordered fort s construction kilby pp 153 154 sullivan and his first wife hettie had nine children two of whom died young and one son who died in 1787 due to hardships of militia service during shays rebellion hettie died in 1786 and he afterward married martha langdon widowed sister of new hampshire politician john langdon browning p 38 sullivan s enduring interest in maine led him to write history of district of maine published in 1795 first work to document that history taylor p 286 maine historian charles clark writes that sullivan s history while neither thoroughly researched nor particularly well written is an un self conscious expression of romantic nationalism that is picturesque romantic and inspired sullivan also predicted that maine would eventually separate from massachusetts because it is so large and populous and its situation so peculiar that it cannot remain long a part of other state clark p 73 works notes references amory was sullivan s grandson five volume history of massachusetts until early 20th century of sources
