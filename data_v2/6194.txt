junior cataloguer position working in both antiquities and impressionist art departments this position enabled him to develop his eye for art and he quickly became known for his ability to discern forgeries his work as a cataloguer also taught him to describe objects in a concise manner and required him to research these objects chatwin advanced to become sotheby s expert on antiquities and impressionist art and would later run both departments many of chatwin s colleagues thought he would eventually become chairman of auction house during this period chatwin travelled extensively for his job and also for adventure travel offered him a relief from british class system which he found stifling an admirer of robert byron and his book road to oxiana he travelled twice to afghanistan he

circumstance elizabeth knew and accepted chatwin had hoped he would grow out of his homosexual behaviour and have a successful marriage like his parents during their marriage chatwin had many affairs

had hoped to have children but they remained childless in april 1966 at age of 26 chatwin was promoted to a director of sotheby s a position to which he had aspired to his disappointment he was made a junior director and lacked voting rights on board this disappointment along with boredom and increasing discomfort over potentially illegal side deals taking place at sotheby s including sale of objects from pitt rivers museum collection led chatwin to resign from his sotheby s post in june 1966 chatwin enrolled in october 1966 at university of edinburgh to study archaeology he had regretted not attending oxford and had been contemplating going to university for a few years a visit in december 1965 to hermitage in leningrad sparked his interest in field of archaeology despite winning prize for best first year s work he found rigour of academic archaeology tiresome and he left after two years without taking a degree nomadic alternative following his departure from edinburgh chatwin decided to pursue a career as a writer successfully pitching a book proposal on nomads to tom maschler publisher at jonathan cape chatwin tentatively titled book nomadic alternative and sought to answer question why do men wander rather than stand still chatwin delivered manuscript in 1972 and maschler declined to publish it calling it a chore to read between 1969 and 1972 as he was working on nomadic alternative chatwin travelled extensively and pursued other endeavours in an attempt to establish a creative career he co curated an exhibit on nomadic art of asian steppes which opened at

to sell it to european television companies chatwin also took photographs of his journeys and attempted to sell photographs from a trip to mauritania to sunday times magazine while times did not accept those photographs for publication it did offer chatwin a job sunday times magazine and in patagonia in 1972 sunday times magazine hired chatwin as an adviser on art and architecture initially his role was to suggest story ideas and put together features such as one million years of art which ran in several issues during summer of 1973 his editor francis wyndham encouraged him to write which allowed him to develop his narrative skills chatwin travelled on many international assignments writing on such subjects as algerian migrant workers and great wall of china and interviewing such diverse people as andre malraux maria reiche and madeleine in 1972 chatwin interviewed 93 year old architect and designer eileen gray in her paris salon where he noticed a map she had painted of area of south america called patagonia i ve always wanted to go there chatwin told her so have i she replied go there for me two years later in november 1974 chatwin flew out to lima in peru and reached patagonia argentina a month later he would later claim that he sent a telegram to wyndham merely stating have gone to patagonia actually he sent a letter i am doing a story there for myself something i have always wanted to write up this marked end of chatwin s role as a regular writer for sunday times magazine although in subsequent years he contributed occasional pieces including a profile of indira gandhi chatwin spent six months in patagonia travelling around gathering stories of people who came from elsewhere and settled there this trip resulted in book in patagonia 1977 he used his quest for his own piece of brontosaurus one from his grandparents cabinet had been thrown away years earlier to frame story of his trip chatwin described in patagonia as narrative of an actual journey and a symbolic one it is supposed to fall into category or be a spoof of wonder voyage narrator goes to a far country in search of a strange animal on his way he lands in strange situations people or other books tell him strange stories which add up to form a message in patagonia contains fifteen black and white photographs by chatwin according to susannah clapp who edited book rebecca west amused chatwin by telling him that these were so good they rendered superfluous entire text of book this work established chatwin s reputation as a travel writer one of his biographers nicholas murray called in patagonia one of most strikingly original post war english travel books and said that it revitalised genre of travel writing however residents in region contradicted account of events depicted in chatwin s book it was first time in his career but not last that conversations and characters which chatwin presented as fact were later alleged to be fiction for in patagonia chatwin received hawthornden prize and e m forster award from american academy of arts and letters graham greene patrick leigh fermor and paul theroux praised book as a result of success of in patagonia chatwin s circle of friends expanded to include people like jacqueline kennedy onassis susan sontag and jasper johns ouidah and black hills upon his return from patagonia chatwin discovered a change in leadership at sunday times magazine and his retainer was discontinued chatwin intended his next project to be a biography of francisco felix de sousa a 19th century slave trader born in brazil who became viceroy of ouidah in dahomey chatwin had first heard of de sousa during a visit to dahomey in 1972 he returned to country by then renamed people s republic of benin in december 1976 to conduct research in january 1977 during 1977 benin coup d etat attempt chatwin was accused of being a mercenary and detained for three days chatwin later wrote about this experience in a coup a story which was published in granta and included in what am i doing here 1989 following his arrest and release chatwin left benin and went to brazil to continue his research on de sousa frustrated by lack of documented information on de sousa chatwin chose instead to write a fictionalised biography of him viceroy of ouidah this book was published in 1980 and werner herzog s film cobra verde 1987 is based on it thumb 300px right southern part of valley in black mountains welsh borders although viceroy of ouidah received good reviews it did not sell well nicholas shakespeare said that dismal sales caused chatwin to pursue a completely different subject for his next book in response to his growing reputation as a travel writer chatwin said he decided to write something about people who never went out his next book on black hill 1982 is a novel of twin brothers who live all of their lives in a farmhouse on welsh borders for this book chatwin won james tait black memorial prize and whitbread prize for best first novel even though he considered his previous book viceroy of ouidah a novel it was made into a film in 1987 in late 1970s chatwin spent an increasing amount of time in new york city he continued to have affairs with men but most of these affairs were short lived in 1977 he began his first serious affair with donald richards an australian stockbroker richards introduced him to gay nightclub scene in new york during this period chatwin became acquainted with robert mapplethorpe who photographed him chatwin is one of few men mapplethorpe photographed fully clothed chatwin later contributed introduction to a book of mapplethorpe s photographs lady lisa lyon 1983 although elizabeth chatwin had accepted her husband s affairs their relationship deteriorated in late 1970s and in 1980 she asked for a separation by 1982 chatwin s affair with richards had ended and he began another serious affair with jasper conran songlines in 1983 chatwin returned to topic of nomads and decided to focus on aboriginal australians he was influenced by work of ted strehlow a controversial figure who was author of songs of central australia strehlow had collected and recorded aboriginal songs and shortly before his death in 1978 he sold photographs of secret aboriginal initiation ceremonies to a magazine chatwin went to australia to learn more about aboriginal culture specifically songlines or dreaming tracks each songline is a personal story and functions as a creation tale and a map and each aboriginal australian has their own songline chatwin thought songlines could be used as a metaphor to support his ideas about humans need to wander which he believed was genetic however he struggled fully to understand and describe songlines and their place in aboriginal culture this was due to chatwin s approach to learning about songlines he spent several weeks in 1983 and 1984 in australia during which he primarily relied on non aboriginal people for information as he was limited by his inability to speak aboriginal languages he interviewed people involved in land rights movement and he alienated many of them because he was oblivious to politics and also because he was an admirer of strehlow s work while in australia chatwin who had been experiencing some health problems first read about aids then known as gay plague it frightened him and compelled him to reconcile with his wife fear of aids also drove him to finish book that became songlines 1987 his friend novelist salman rushdie said that book was an obsession too great for him his illness did him a favour got him free of it otherwise he would have gone on writing it for ten years songlines features a narrator named bruce whose biography is almost identical to chatwin s narrator spends time in australia trying to learn about aboriginal culture specifically songlines as book goes on it becomes a reflection on what chatwin stated was for me question of questions nature of human restlessness chatwin also hinted at his preoccupation over his own mortality in text i had a that travelling phase of my life might be passing i should set down on paper a resume of ideas quotations and encounters that amused me and obsessed me following this statement in songlines chatwin included extensive excerpts from his moleskine notebooks chatwin published songlines in 1987 and it became a bestseller in united kingdom and in united states book was nominated for thomas cook travel award but chatwin requested that it be withdrawn from consideration saying work was fictional after its publication chatwin became friends with composer kevin who was inspired to base a theatre score on book project evolved into an opera man with of wind 1993 illness and final works while at work on songlines between 1983 and 1986 fermor patrick leigh dashing for post letters of patrick leigh at 376 john murray 2017 chatwin visited fermor in greece in 1985 and enjoyed it so much he rented rooms in village bruce chatwin is finishing a book too next door and we go for huge strides across hills every afternoon and he and joan concoct delicious dinners every other night or so chatwin frequently came down with colds he also developed skin lesions that may have been symptoms of kaposi s sarcoma after finishing songlines in august 1986 chatwin went to switzerland where he collapsed in street at a clinic there he was diagnosed as hiv positive chatwin provided different reasons to his doctors as to how he might have contracted hiv including from a gang rape in dahomey or possibly from sam wagstaff patron and lover of robert mapplethorpe chatwin s case was unusual as he had a fungal infection which at time had rarely been seen and only in south asia it is now known as an aids defining illness but in 1986 little was known about hiv and aids doctors were not certain if all cases of hiv developed into aids rare fungus gave chatwin hope that he might be different and served as basis of what he told most people about his illness he gave various reasons for how he became infected with fungus ranging from eating a thousand year old egg to exploring a bat cave in indonesia he never publicly disclosed that he was hiv positive because of stigma at time he wanted to protect his parents who were unaware of his homosexual affairs although chatwin never spoke or wrote publicly about his disease in one instance he did write about aids epidemic in 1988 in a letter to editor of london review of books word aids is one of cruellest and silliest neologisms of our time aid means help succour comfort yet with a hissing sibilant tacked onto end it becomes a nightmare hiv human immuno deficiency virus is a perfectly easy name to live with aids causes panic and despair and has probably done something to facilitate spread of disease during his illness chatwin continued to write elizabeth encouraged him to use a letter he had written to her from prague in 1967 as an inspiration for a new story during this trip he had met konrad just an art collector this meeting and letter to elizabeth served as basis for chatwin s next work utz 1988 was a novel about obsession that leads people to collect set in prague novel details life and death of kaspar utz a man obsessed with his collection of meissen porcelain utz was well received and was shortlisted for booker prize chatwin also edited a collection of his journalism which was published as what am i doing here 1989 at time of his death in 1989 he was working on a number of new ideas for future novels including a transcontinental epic provisionally titled lydia livingstone chatwin died at a hospital in nice on 18 january 1989 a memorial service was held at greek orthodox church of saint sophia in west london on 14 february 1989 salman rushdie a close friend of chatwin s attended service paul theroux who also attended service later commented on it and chatwin in a piece for granta theroux s admiring tribute to chatwin novelist martin amis described memorial service in essay salman rushdie included in his anthology visiting mrs nabokov chatwin s ashes were scattered near a byzantine chapel above in peloponnese this was close to home of one of his mentors writer patrick leigh fermor chatwin had spent several months in 1985 near there working on songlines chatwin s papers including 85 moleskine notebooks were given to bodleian library oxford two collections of his photographs and excerpts from moleskine notebooks were published as photographs and notebooks us title far journeys in 1993 and winding paths in 1999 news of chatwin s aids diagnosis first surfaced in september 1988 although obituaries at time of his death had referred to chatwin s statements about a rare fungal infection after his death some members of gay community criticised chatwin for lack of courage to reveal true nature of his illness thinking he would have raised public awareness of aids as he was one of first high profile individuals in britain known to have contracted hiv writing style john updike described chatwin s writing as a clipped prose that compresses worlds into pages while one of chatwin s editors susannah clapp wrote although his syntax was pared down his words were not or at least not only plain his prose is both spare and flamboyant chatwin s writing was shaped by his work as a cataloguer at sotheby s which provided him with years of practice in writing concise yet vivid descriptions of objects with intention of enticing buyers in addition his writing was influenced by his interest in nomads one aspect that interested him was few possessions they had their spartan way of life appealed to his aesthetic sense and he sought to emulate it in his life and his writing striving to strip needless objects from his life and needless words from his prose chatwin experimented with format in his writing with in patagonia clapp said chatwin described book s structure of 97 vignettes as cubist i n other words she said lots of small pictures tilting away and toward each other to create this strange original portrait of patagonia songlines was another attempt by chatwin to experiment with format it begins as a novel narrated by a man named bruce but about two thirds of way through it becomes a commonplace book filled with quotations anecdotes and summaries of others research in an attempt to explore restlessness some of chatwin s critics did not think he succeeded in songlines with this approach but others applauded his effort at an unconventional structure several 19th and 20th century writers influenced chatwin s work he admitted to imitating work of robert byron when he first began making notes of his travels while in patagonia he read in our time by ernest hemingway whom he admired for his spare prose while writing in patagonia chatwin strove to approach his writing as a literary cartier bresson chatwin s biographer described resulting prose as quick snapshots of ordinary people along with hemingway and cartier bresson osip mandelstam s work strongly influenced chatwin during writing of in patagonia an admirer of noel coward chatwin found breakfast scene in private lives helpful in learning to write dialogue once chatwin began work on viceroy of ouidah he began studying work of 19th century french authors such as honore de balzac and gustave flaubert who would continue to influence him for rest of his life themes chatwin explored several different themes in his work human restlessness and wandering borders and exile and art and objects he considered human restlessness to be focus of his writing he ultimately aspired to explore subject in order to answer what he saw as a fundamental question of human existence he thought humans were meant to be a migratory species and once they settled in one place their natural urges found outlets in violence greed status seeking or a mania for new in his first attempt at writing a book nomadic alternative chatwin had tried to compose an academic exposition on nomadic culture which he believed was unexamined and unappreciated with this chatwin had hoped to discover why do men wander rather than sit still in his book proposal he admitted that interest in subject was personal why do i become restless after a month in a single place unbearable after two although chatwin did not succeed with nomadic alternative he returned to topic of restlessness and wandering in subsequent books writer jonathan chatwin no relation stated that chatwin s works can be grouped into two categories restlessness defined and restlessness explained most of his work focuses on describing restlessness such as in case of one twin in on black hill who longs to leave home another example is protagonist of utz who feels restless to escape to vichy each year but always returns to prague chatwin attempted to explain restlessness in songlines which focused on aboriginal australians walkabout for this he returned to his research from nomadic alternative borders are another chatwin theme according to elizabeth chatwin he was interested in borders where things were always changing not one thing or another patagonia subject of his first published book is an area that is in both argentina and chile viceroy of ouidah is a brazilian who trades slaves in dahomey on black hills takes place on borders of wales and england in songlines characters protagonist mostly interacts with are people who provide a bridge between aboriginal and white australian worlds main character in utz travels back and forth across iron curtain theme of exile of people living at margins is treated in a literal and metaphorical sense throughout chatwin s work stated nicholas murray he identified several examples there were people who were actual exiles like some of those profiled in in patagonia and viceroy of ouidah unable to return to brazil murray also cited main characters in on black hill although not strictly exiles they were exiles from major events of their time and its dominant values similarly murray wrote utz is trapped in a society whose values are not his own but which he cannot bring himself to leave chatwin returned to subject of art and objects during his career in his early writing for sunday times magazine he wrote about art and artists and many of these articles were included in what am i doing here main focus of utz is on impact possession of art in this case porcelain figures has on a collector utz s unwillingness to give up his porcelain collection kept him in czechoslovakia even though he had opportunity to live in west chatwin constantly struggled with conflicting desires to own beautiful items and to live in a space free of unnecessary objects his distaste for art world resulted from his days at sotheby s some of his final writing focused on this topic appears in final section of what am i doing here tales from art world which consists of four short stories at end of what am i doing here chatwin shares an anecdote of advice he received from noel coward never let anything artistic stand in your way chatwin stated i ve always acted on that advice influence with publication of in patagonia chatwin invigorated genre of travel writing according to his biographer nicholas murray he showed that an inventive writer could breathe new life into an old genre combination of his clear yet vivid prose and an international perspective at a time when many english writers were more focused on home instead of abroad helped to set him apart aside from his writing chatwin was also good looking and his image as a dashing traveller added to his appeal and helped make him a celebrity in eyes of younger writers such as rory stewart chatwin made travel writing cool in new york times andrew harvey wrote nearly every writer of my generation in england has wanted at some point to be bruce chatwin wanted like him to talk of fez and nigeria and nuristan with equal authority wanted to be talked about as he is with raucous envy wanted above all to have written his books chatwin s books also inspired some readers to visit patagonia and australia as a result patagonia experienced an increase in tourism and it became a common sight for tourists to appear in region carrying a copy of in patagonia songlines also inspired readers to travel to australia and seek out people on whom chatwin had based his characters much to their consternation as he had failed to disclose such intentions to them beyond travel chatwin influenced other writers such as claudio magris luis sepulveda philip marsden and william dalrymple nicholas shakespeare stated that some of chatwin s impact came from difficulty of his work which helped to set free other writers from conventional boundaries although he was often called a travel writer he did not identify himself as one or as a novelist i don t quite know meaning of word novel he said he preferred to call his writing stories or searches he was interested in asking big questions about human existence sharing unusual tales and making connections between ideas from various sources his friend and fellow writer robyn davidson said he posed questions we all want answered and perhaps gave illusion they were answerable posthumous influence according to his biographer nicholas shakespeare chatwin s work developed a dedicated following in years immediately after his death by 1998 a million copies of his books had been sold however his reputation diminished following revelations about his personal life and questions about accuracy of his work accuracy problem had arisen before his death and chatwin had admitted to counting up lies in in patagonia though he stated there were not many while researching chatwin s life nicholas shakespeare stated he found few cases of mere invention in in patagonia mostly these tended to be instances of embellishment such as when chatwin wrote of a nurse who loved work of osip mandelstam one of his favorite authors when in fact she was a fan of agatha christie when michael ignatieff asked chatwin his opinion of what divided fact from fiction he replied i don t think there is a division some individuals profiled in in patagonia were unhappy with chatwin s portrayals of them they included a man whom chatwin insinuated was homosexual and a woman who thought her father was unjustly accused of killing indians however chatwin s biographer found one farmer who was featured in book who thought chatwin s depictions of himself and other members of his community were truthful he stated no one likes looking at their own passport photograph but i found it accurate it s not flattering but it s truth chatwin s bestseller songlines has been focus of much criticism some describe his viewpoint as colonialist citing his lack of interviews with aboriginals and reliance instead on white australians for information about aboriginal culture other criticism comes from anthropologists and other researchers who spent years studying aboriginal culture and dismiss chatwin s work because he visited australia briefly yet others such as writer thomas keneally believe songlines should be widely read in australia where many people had not previously heard of songlines questions about veracity of chatwin s writing are compounded by revelation of his sexual orientation and true cause of his death once it became known that chatwin had been bisexual and had died of an aids related illness some critics viewed him as a liar and dismissed his work nicholas shakespeare said his denial of his aids diagnosis bred a sense that if he lied about his life he must have lied about his work some readers have taken this as a cue to pass judgement on his books or else not to bother with them in 2010 guardian s review of under sun letters of bruce chatwin opened with question does anyone read bruce chatwin these days however rory stewart has stated his personality his learning his myths and even his prose are less hypnotizing than they once were and yet he remains a great writer of deep and enduring importance in 2008 times rated chatwin no 46 on their list of 50 greatest british writers since 1945 legacy chatwin s name is used to sell moleskine notebooks chatwin wrote in songlines of little black covered
