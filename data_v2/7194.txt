punk band complains stole name from them real life band formed in 1985 and took its name from hernandez s comic book band is slated to appear at a party at bass player s upper class mother s home but performance never takes place in story rather story quickly transitions from character to character revealing details of each one s personality traits and ethnic class sexual and subcultural backgrounds story builds in complexity to a chaotic alcohol and drug fueled party in which someone almost gets killed turbulent narrative then calms and slows into a sequence of wordless panels that pan out into cosmos style and analysis artwork is abstract and cartoony cars speed along without touching ground characters expressions are sometimes reduced to simple shapes such as large enraged shouting mouths with jagged teeth and dialog balloons are sometimes filled with no more than symbols hernandez uses marginal notes to identify bands and songs played in story and to explain non english vocabulary book s various ethnic characters use he uses typographical marks such as angle brackets to mark off non english speech translated into english such as from spanish or arabic story has none of magic realist elements hernandez used in palomar stories he is best known for straightforward chronology and easily distinguished characters marked a contrast to those of complicated poison river it nevertheless shares with poison river a density that requires a relatively slow reading to follow it is condensed to quick minimal scenes with expository dialog panel rather than page is compositional unit each panel is of equal size and depending on publication work appears in hernandez arranges panels in six or nine panel grids frequent shifts from scene to scene and character to character give each character brief moments to assume focus while action in background often draws away reader s attention characters each have sympathetic and deplorable sides and hernandez often reveals sides of characters that contradicts stereotypes they appeared to live up to abrupt shifts between panel require reader to evaluate relations between them in a manner different from familiar manner of closure comics scholar douglas wolk asserts hernandez s formal concerns with time and suggestion have a moral weight in that they discourage tendency to identify with particular characters at expense of others when work s concerns lie in broader socio political issues copy on first collected edition compares book to robert altman s film nashville 1975 which features a large ensemble cast and interweaving storylines ethnicity and ethnic relations form central themes of story several characters are of mixed ethnicity such as a half jewish half muslim girl infatuated with a mexican boy and a boy who when asked for his ethnicity responds i m mexican and i m black and i m chinese and indian and aborigine and inuit and jewish and martian most of characters take part or consider taking part in inter ethnic relations even when they reject idea as in a dialogue between two african american men you best remember this son a brother will do anything to get white pussy firs i ain t yo son second fuck that tom bul shit exception is a group of white supremacists only characters portrayed as overwhelmingly negative though hernandez gives even these characters a pre racist past that other characters lament loss of story often delves into characters sexuality including homosexual relations such as that of riri and maricela daughter of luba one of central characters in hernandez s palomar stories pair have run away from palomar where maricela had endured physical abuse from her mother and where pair had to hide their relationship in us they are freer to express their affections openly but must instead hide their illegal immigrant status and avoid immigration authorities another theme that runs through book los angeles setting and themes of punk rock and ethnic and sexual relations are central in stories of hernandez s brother jaime as well f vance neill sees book as a critique of disintegration of community in which characters are self absorbed each as wolk sees it believe that they re its hero to neill hernandez underlines this in closing sequence in which he shuts down narrative development and isolates each character to one panel apiece an ending that indicates a shattering of relationships between people and reiterates importance of values of acceptance of identity integrity normalcy of supernatural and sanctity of secrets wolk interprets this ending in context of quickly shifting scenes of rest of work that it requires readers to slow down and think about sequence of events and their contexts and interrelations aside from riri and maricela other characters from earlier hernandez works include unnamed dudes who made minor appearances as tourists in palomar in human diastrophism 1989 and fritz psychiatrist from erotic birdland 1992 reception and legacy on its release reviewer anne rubenstein praised love and rockets x for expanding aesthetic possibilities of graphic narrative she recommended it as a starting point for new love and rockets readers daunted by complexity of earlier stories and called it as essential as rest of hernandez canon comics critic r fiore placed love and rockets x 7th on his list of best english non strip comics of 1990s he calls it a comics equivalent of a victor hugo style social novel and praises hernandez for successfully interweaving so many of quasi isolated ethnic social milieus of los angeles into one narrative though he found weakness in hernandez s grasp of their various speech patterns and suggested actual south americans would have been more appropriate to real political background than fictional reviewer tom knapp considered work confusing and one of low points in love and rockets series douglas wolk called love and rockets x prime example of gilbert s fascinations as a storyteller f vance neill saw it as an early example of hernandez s concern with values of trust loyalty honesty and community and consequences of failing to adhere to these values that he explored later in works such as speak of devil 2008 and troublemakers 2009 story s los angeles setting anticipated that of hernandez s post palomar stories featuring luba and her family notes
