ring are merely a skeletal framework a human ship approaches a halo under construction portions of ark are visible at bottom from video game halo 3 2007 halo array is a group of fictional megastructures and in halo science fiction franchise consisting of ringworlds known as halos built by structures known as ark they are referred to as installations by their artificial intelligence caretakers and were created by an ancient race known as forerunners series alien antagonists covenant refer to halos as sacred rings believing them to form part of a greater religious prophecy known as great journey in games stories forerunners built halo array to contain and study flood an infectious alien parasite rings act together as a weapon of last resort when fired they kill any sentient life capable of falling prey to flood starving parasite of its food installations are at crux of plot progression for halo series each halo features their own wildlife and weather constructs resemble iain m banks orbital concept in shape and design structure that halo combat evolved takes place on was initially to be a hollowed out planet but was changed to its ring design later in development a staff member provided halo as name for both ring and video game after names such as red shift were suggested overview design and development term megastructure refers to artificial structures where one of three dimensions is or larger first use of a ring shaped megastructure in fiction was larry niven s novel ringworld 1970 niven described his design as an intermediate step between dyson spheres and planets a ring with a radius of more than and a width of these are dimensions far exceeding ringworlds found in halo series which feature radii of grazier 2006 39 40 halos are closer in proportion to a bishop ring an actual proposed space habitat first explained by forrest bishop though proportions of halos do not exactly match up with bishop s idea or more accurately bigger orbital as seen in games halo installations feature a metallic exterior with interior of ring filled with an atmosphere water plant life and animal life hiatt 1999 94 96 what appear to be docking ports and windows dot exterior surface suggesting that a fraction of ring structure itself is hollow and used for maintenance living and power generation grazier 2006 41 before title for game developer bungie s next project was announced and development of game that would become halo was in its early stages megastructure that halo combat evolved took place on was a massive hollowed out planet called planet became a dyson sphere and then a dyson ring mclaughlin 2007 1 some bungie staffers felt change to a ringworld was ripping off larry niven according to bungie artist paul russel et al 2008 bungie employee frank o connor wrote in a post on bungie that specific accusation that we swiped idea of a ring shaped planet wholesale is not accurate explaining that bungie used a ringworld because it s cool and therefore type of thing a forerunner civilization would build perry 2006 6 at time game was known as blam but bungie had always expected to replace working title with something better blam was used after studio co founder jason jones could not bring himself to tell his mother their next project was dubbed monkey nuts trautmann 2004 ix titles such as crystal palace hard vacuum star maker star shield and santa machine were suggested russel suggested calling it project halo because of ring despite concerns that title seemed too religious or lacked action name stuck trautmann 2004 73 in turn halo became ring s name as well toyama 2001 61 combat evolveds halo was intended to be populated with large animal life preston 2000 19 collectively known as fauna fauna included pseudo dinosaurs and mammals as well as a chocobo like creature blind wolf that players could ride lehto et al 2002 animals were removed for technical and conceptual reasons there were difficulties in getting herd and behavior action to work and under pressure to complete game s more central aspects animals were dropped bungie also felt that desolate ring heightened sense of halo s mystery and made appearance of parasitic flood more terrifying and unexpected bungie scientific analysis thumb right five lagrangian points in a two body system for halo gas giant is yellow circle lone moon is blue circle and ringworld is positioned at physicist kevin grazier posited in a 2006 essay composition and problems associated with a halo installation complete halos seen in halo combat evolved and halo 2 orbit gas giants similar to jupiter though much larger bodies exhibit characteristics of both a jovian planet and a small star grazier 2006 44 45 in each system there are five points where a body of negligible mass would remain stationary to two much larger bodies in system gas giant and its moon these areas known as lagrange points are classified by stability while bodies at 60deg angles to gas giant would remain in same location relative to other objects in system other three lagrange points are meta stable having tendency to be unstable in one direction as halos are located at point installations must actively correct their orbits grazier 2006 46 apparent gravity of halo installations is close to earth normal a halo would have to spin with a speed of per second to match earth s gravity translating to 19 25 rotations in a day grazier 2006 49 aside from their unstable positions halos would have to contend with thousands of meteor and impacts which would destabilize or destroy ring there is no evidence in games that installations project an energy shield to prevent this occurrence because of magnetic environment around gas giant a halo would be exposed to high levels of radiation grazier 2006 47 earth is protected from such radiation by charged particles created by planet s magnetic field grazier posits that huge conductive cables could run circumference of a halo when an electric current was run through these cables a protective magnetic environment could be created to sustain life grazier 2006 48 in games spectroscopic analysis of ring s composition proved inconclusive implying that halos are constructed of an unknown material were a halo to be constructed using conventional materials a light steel alloy would be most feasible assuming that ring structure is 50 empty space a 5000 km ring composed of steel alloy at an average density of per would result in a total mass of 1 kg amount of material required to build such a ring would be akin to total material available in asteroid belt grazier 2006 42 installations installation 03 installation 03 also referred to as gamma halo appears in halo 4 it is monitored by 049 abject testament and is located in system orbiting a damaged planet whilst no gameplay takes place on installation an extremely dense asteroid field surrounding installation is site of unsc scientific research base ivanoff it is here that unsc scientists are conducting experiments on forerunner artifact called composer which has ability to convert biological forms specifically humans into ais after game s antagonist didact activates device unsc base is left uninhabited halo escalation a series of comics which follows many events after halo 4 establishes that 049 abject testament has long disappeared from ring leading a monitor to arrive at installation just to be ambushed by a still living didact using installation to use composer installation 04 installation 04 also referred to as alpha halo appears in halo combat evolved majority of gameplay takes place in areas on this installation and its exploration drives story ring was managed by an artificial intelligence known as 343 guilty spark and is located in system dominated by a gas giant known as threshold grazier 2006 43 halo orbits threshold s only satellite an extremely large moon known as basis a group of humans aboard ship pillar of autumn crash land on ring after being pursued by alien covenant trautmann 2004 viii ring holds religious significance to aliens while humans believe it is a weapon that could turn tide of war against covenant in their favor trautmann 2004 77 in reality ring is home to a virulent parasite called flood which is accidentally released by covenant and threatens to infest galaxy human soldier master chief eventually detonates pillar of autumns reactors in order to destabilize ring and cause it to break up preventing spread of flood and activation of halo network which would kill all sentient life as a fail safe to starve flood barrat 2007 2 ark was alerted to its destruction and proceeded to create another ring which too was destroyed by master chief during game s events guilty spark alludes to a previous firing of network which bungie s director of cinematics joseph staten said occurred around 100 000 years previous to events of game in year 2552 mclees et al 2006 after installation 04 was destroyed a shard of ring was sent through slipspace to orbit a red giant supernova like detonation of pillar of autumn creates a new element on ring shard which is fatal to humans appearing in halo nightfall shard is visited by a team of oni operatives and colonial militia following a terrorist attack with new element with only a limited time before shard s sunrise kills them team struggles to destroy deposits and capture smugglers mining it only two of team manage to escape while colonel randall aiken a former spartan supersoldier sacrifices himself to destroy deposits with a nuclear weapon installation 05 during events of halo 2 covenant and humans discover a second ringworld installation 05 or delta halo it was monitored by 2401 penitent tangent who completely ignored flood warnings and was captured by their leader gravemind covenant leadership wants to activate installation believing it is key to their salvation cortana that s what i thought he said prophet of regret is planning to activate halo master chief are you sure prophet of regret i shall light this sacred ring release its cleansing flame and burn a path into divine beyond cortana pretty much at same time flood lay siege to covenant s city ship high charity after 343 guilty spark informs halo s true purpose to arbiter a covenant holy warrior and warns him of danger that halos truly represent a group of humans and covenant elites prevent firing of ring barrat 2007 3 unexpected shutdown activates a fail safe protocol priming remaining halo installations for remote activation from a location known as ark 343 guilty spark fail safe protocol in event of unexpected shut down entire system will move to standby status all installations are now ready for remote activation keyes remote activation from here 343 guilty spark don t be ridiculous ark of course in halo 4 it is revealed that unsc has created an oversight base on installation or around it as they did with installation 03 ark ark also referred to as installation 00 is located outside milky way galaxy and serves as construction and control station for halo weapon system it does not share ringworld geometry of other installations during halo 3 covenant discover a portal on earth that leads to ark and are pursued by humans and a breakaway faction of covenant opposed to activating rings gravemind having hijacked high charity crash lands on installation remote firing of rings is halted by master chief and arbiter in order to end threat of flood master chief decides to activate installation 08 under construction in ark replacement for halo that he destroyed in halo combat evolved unknown to everyone but 343 guilty spark a premature firing would destroy installation monitor attempted to defend his ring but was destroyed by master chief who proceeded to fire weapon firing tears apart incomplete halo and severely damages ark as master chief cortana and arbiter try to escape through portal which closes as they enter leaving master chief and cortana drifting in space while arbiter returns to earth successfully ark appears in other halo novels and video game halo wars 2 installation 08 a replacement for installation 04 that is constructed by ark upon original s destruction in halo combat evolved identical to original ring replacement is mostly complete when ark is found a few months after destruction of installation 04 but is unfinished enough that parts of its superstructure are visible cortana describes it as so new unfinished after death of prophet of truth new ring rises from ark s foundry in front of master chief and arbiter who realize that ring disconnected from rest of network and safely outside milky way galaxy can be fired to destroy local infestation on ark without harming anything else after rescuing cortana from high charity master chief and sergeant johnson attempt to fire ring angering 343 guilty spark who knows that doing so will destroy installation in its present state and heavily damage ark spark kills johnson but is destroyed by master chief before cortana fires installation master chief and arbiter manage to escape aboard forward unto dawn but ring s firing causes portal to close severing ship in half and stranding master chief in space firing installation 08 ends flood infestation upon ark and destroys gravemind and itself however in halo wars 2 awakening nightmare flood infection forms are revealed to have survived in ruins of high charity and are accidentally unleashed again by banished before flood are contained once more installation 09 in halo wars 2 a second replacement for installation 04 is found nearly complete on ark by crew of unsc spirit of fire with no way back to human space crew decides to launch replacement ring with a distress beacon aboard to installation 04 s original position thereby signaling for help a conflict with banished occurs on installation but professor ellen anders after disarming ring s superweapon is able to take control of installation s gravity anchors and launch part of its landmass into space killing banished forces ring and anders enter slipspace but are pulled out prematurely by a
