hard to do with doctor who formula producer phil collinson remarked that gridlock displayed davies tendency to write about topical issues it is set in a dark dystopian future but is also a satire on common traffic jam while story is bleak davies showed how doctor transforms place by literally opening up sky and bringing in light davies also used hymns to signify hope and a togetherness of members

was in third filming block for series along with lazarus experiment filming took place from mid september to early october 2006 episode uses some of largest and most complex cgi effects of all series so far motorway was entirely constructed out of cgi aside from a single car set it was first time an episode was set inside a cgi world will cohen mill s visual fx producer revealed in radio times that films blade runner fifth element and star wars specifically planet of coruscant influenced look of new new york much of episode was completed in upper boat studios particularly interior car scenes for this only one car set was used with it being redecorated for each different car cars were decorated to look like they had been lived in and incorporated futuristic and well known home objects brannigan and valerie s children were played by real kittens which proved difficult to direct production team shot for four days in 6 foot by 6 foot car which davies called a nightmare because not many camera angles were available and only one crew member could adjust props and lighting at a time in addition smoke was generated around car so it would blend in with cgi smoke from cgi cars small set was intended to benefit actors as they would feel claustrophobic for scene in which doctor jumps from car to car underside of a car was built and suspended ten to fifteen feet above top of car set with a green screen all around to get as many angles as possible davies preferred action sequences that moved up and down a scale that is not seen much on television temple of peace in cardiff
