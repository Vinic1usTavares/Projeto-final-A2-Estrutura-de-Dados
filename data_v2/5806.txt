record producer of her next album however her label was not ready to give her artistic freedom and she chose nile rodgers instead to produce album due to his work with david bowie madonna wrote six songs on record five of which feature steve bray as a co writer album was recorded at power station studio in new york at a quick pace rodgers enlisted help of his former chic bandmates bernard edwards who was bassist and tony thompson who played drums jason corsaro record s audio engineer persuaded rodgers to use digital recording a new technique introduced at that time album s photographs were shot by steven meisel madonna wanted album title and cover image to make a provocative link between her own religious name madonna as roman catholic title for jesus mother mary and christian concept of virgin birth while not a substantial musical departure from madonna s first album she felt that material from like a virgin was stronger after its release like a virgin received mixed reviews from music critics but was a commercial success it became madonna s first number one album on billboard 200 and set record as first female album in history to sell over five million copies in united states recording industry association of america riaa later certified it diamond for shipment of ten million units it also reached number one in germany netherlands new zealand spain and united kingdom and remains one of best selling albums of all time with sales of over 21 million copies worldwide five singles were released from album including madonna s first us number one like a virgin and her first uk number one into groove to promote album she embarked on virgin tour which had shows in cities of north america only like a virgin has attained significance as a cultural artifact of 1980s madonna proved that she was not a one hit wonder and was able to provide herself with a permanent footing in music world her songs became a lightning rod for both criticism by conservatives and imitation by younger female population especially material girl and like a virgin according to author j randy taraborrelli every important artist has at least one album in his or her career whose critical and commercial success becomes artist s magic moment for madonna like a virgin was just such a defining moment background thumb upright nile rodgers was chosen as primary producer of album due to his work with david bowie a former dancer and fixture on new york club scene madonna louise ciccone became known to world simply as madonna with release of her 1983 self titled debut album madonna fueled by hit songs like holiday borderline and lucky star album was one of best selling of year and helped madonna become one of most exciting new artists of 1980s when she started work on her second album madonna felt that her first album had succeeded in introducing her street smart dance queen persona and she wanted to solidify and build upon that concept according to her my work my dedication stubbornness for getting madonna released had paid off now it was time to solidify my future for like a virgin madonna attempted to become one of primary record producers feeling need to control various aspects of her music she believed that depending on a particular producer for her album was not something that suited her madonna said i learnt my lesson while creating my debut album and way reggie producer of her debut project lucas left me in water with project you can t trust men referring to incident when due to a certain difference of opinion between producer reggie lucas and madonna lucas had left project half way however warner bros records was not ready to give her artistic freedom that she wanted in j randy taraborrelli s biography of madonna she commented ultimately nile rodgers was chosen by madonna as producer of album with approval of warner brothers executives madonna chose rodgers mostly because of his work as a member of 1970s band chic and his most recent production work with david bowie on his 1983 album let s dance she commented when i was making record i was just so thrilled and happy to be working with nile rodgers i idolized nile because of whole chic thing i couldn t believe that record company gave me money so that i could work with him for his part rodgers recalled that he had first seen madonna perform at a small club in new york in 1983 in an interview with time magazine rodgers explained i went to club to see another woman sing but when i got there madonna was onstage i loved her stage presence and then we met right after that i kept thinking to myself damn is she a star but she wasn t at that time i always wanted to work with her and like a virgin seemed like a perfect opportunity recording album was recorded at power station studio in new york at a quick pace rodgers enlisted help of his former chic bandmates bernard edwards who was bassist and tony thompson who played drums they appeared on several tracks of album rodgers decided to be guitarist when edwards requested him to do so in exchange for their help recording sessions did not start until afternoon as rodgers who attended late night parties was not accustomed to work in early mornings schedule was also difficult for madonna who recalled that she used to go to swim club on upper west side and go swimming and walk from there to recording studio it was impossible for me to reach there at morning rodgers recalled that madonna was a real hard worker and incredibly tenacious he commented i am always amazed by madonna s incredible judgement when it comes to making pop records i ve never seen anyone do it better and that s truth when we did that album it was perfect union and i knew it from first day in studio thing between us man it was sexual it was passionate it was creativity it was pop jason corsaro record s audio engineer persuaded rodgers to use digital recording a new technique at time which corsaro believed was going to be future of recording to ensure this corsaro used a sony 3324 24 track digital tape recorder and a sony f1 two track during mixing of tracks madonna recorded lead parts of songs in a small wooden high ceilinged piano room at back of studio c also known as power station s r b room corsaro then placed gobos around her while using top capsule of a stereo tube microphone with a microphone preamplifier and a pultec equalizer once tracks met with everybody s approval robert sabino added keyboard parts playing mostly a sequential circuits prophet 5 as well as some rhodes piano and acoustic piano while rodgers also played a synclavier madonna although not required was present every minute of recording sessions and mixing process corsaro commented nile was there most of time but she was there all of time she never left packaging and title thumb upright wedding dress worn by madonna on album s cover featuring notable boy toy belt buckle cover sleeve and images were shot by steven meisel who would become a regular collaborator with madonna in a suite at st regis hotel madonna wanted album title to make provocative link between her own religious name madonna as roman catholic title for jesus mother mary and christian concept of virgin birth with title song alluding to this concept madonna wanted album cover to have mixed messages as well author graham thompson described that reclining on a satin sheet with a bouquet on her lap and wearing a wedding dress a closer inspection reveals madonna s image as highly fetishized and sexualized he added that heavy make up pouting lips and despoiled hair along with tight fitting bustier and full length gloves turned madonna s image into a figure not of virtue but of desire this point according to thompson is further emphasized by belt she is wearing wording on which is just visible as boy toy he added image was ambiguous and was based upon fact that madonna s appeal at that point of her career was not presenting herself just as an object of desire but also as a desiring female subject erlewine commented that steven meisel shot cover was as key to her reinvention as music of album itself william mckeen author of rock and roll is here to stay an anthology felt that image was another trigger and testament to fact that madonna was last word on fashion for women and young girls of that era epitome of cool costume designer arianne phillips commented of like a virgin look this was one of most shocking liberating and influential moments in pop culture fashion history fashion has never been same madonna herself declared i have always loved to play cat and mouse with conventional stereotypes my like a virgin album cover is a classic example people were thinking who was i pretending to be virgin mary or whore these were two extreme images of women i had known vividly and remembered from childhood and i wanted to play with them i wanted to see if i can merge them together virgin mary and whore as one and all photo was a statement of independence if you wanna be a virgin you are welcome but if you wanna be a whore it s your fucking right to be so composition according to taraborrelli madonna and rodgers collective energy she wanting to score with a smash second album and he wanting to be producer to give it to her drove production of like a virgin with great precision madonna also collaborated with her former boyfriend steve bray who co wrote many of album s songs reflecting on music composition for album bray noted i ve always kind of made rib cage and skeleton of songs already she s there for last things like eyebrows and haircut opening track material girl was written by peter brown and robert rans madonna explained that concept of song was similar to her life s situation at that time according to her song was provocative hence she was attracted to it material girl incorporated new wave music and consists of synth arrangements with a robotic voice repeating hook lyrics identify with materialism with madonna asking for a rich and affluent life rather than romance and relationships written by madonna and steve bray angel is second track on album it was one of first songs developed for project and according to madonna was inspired by a girl who is saved by and subsequently falls in love with an angel angel consists of a three chord ascending hook which serves as verse and chorus it has vocal harmonies beneath main chorus and lyrics repeat angel like image of madonna s savior title track like a virgin was written by billy steinberg and tom kelly steinberg said that song was inspired by his personal experiences of romance it was chosen for madonna by michael ostin of warner bros records after listening to a demo sung by kelly however rodgers initially felt that song did not have a good enough hook and was not suitable for madonna but subsequently changed his opinion after hook was stuck in his mind he credits madonna with recognizing song s potential i handed my apology to madonna and said you know if it s so catchy that it stayed in my head for four days it must be something so let s do it like a virgin is a dance oriented song composed of two hooks madonna s voice is heard in a high register while a continuous arrangement of drums are heard along bassline according to author rikky rooksby lyrics of song are ambiguous and consist of hidden innuendo in sexual terms lyrics can be interpreted in different ways for different people in over and over madonna sings about determination and picking yourself up from disappointments song consists of instrumentation from drums synths and has a three chord progression an emotional moment occurred in recording studio when madonna covered 1978 rose royce song love don t live here anymore rodgers recalled madonna had never performed with a live orchestra before i was very much into doing everything live so i just said madonna you go out there and sing and we will follow you at first madonna was hesitant but live setting ended up producing memorable results she sang and she was overcome with emotions and she started crying but i left it on record song features madonna s vocals supported by acoustic guitars and synth strings with thompson playing drum in second verse towards end madonna emotes in voice of a soul singer thumb alt madonna dancing on a dj s desk wearing red shorts and a black sleeveless shirt

dancefloor into groove is sixth track on 1985 worldwide reissue of like a virgin it has never been part of like a virgin on any north american release madonna s inspiration behind song was dance floor

seeking susan unlike other songs on like a virgin into groove was recorded at sigma sound studios and produced by madonna and steve bray madonna s friend erika belle was present during recording and watched whole process in andrew morton s madonna biography she noted that at one point of recording bray was facing difficulties with bridge of song as melody thought by him was not syncing with rest of composition undeterred by his obvious difficulties madonna stepped up to microphone and sang words live out your fantasy here with me bray s problem was solved belle remembered experience as song seemed to come out of her i was awestruck song consists of instrumentation from drums percussion congas and whistles madonna s voice is double tracked in chorus lyrics are simple and written as an invitation to dance with singer with sexual innuendos and undertones in meaning dress you up was last track to be added to album as it was submitted late by songwriters andrea larusso and peggy stanziale although rodgers rejected it as there was no time to compose a melody and record it for album madonna pushed for song s inclusion on like a virgin as she particularly liked its lyrics song is a drum beat driven dance track featuring instrumentation of guitars and vocals from a choir lyrics are an extended metaphor for fashion and sex comparing dressing up with passion shoo bee doo contains homage to motown music beginning with a slow introduction song is in doo wop genre and resembles songs of early sixties girl groups like shirelles or crystals saxophone breakdown is played by

marilyn monroe s performance of song diamonds are a girl s best friend from 1953 film gentlemen prefer blondes mimicked scenes are interspersed with scenes of a hollywood producer trying to win heart

united kingdom critical reception according to q magazine like a virgin was album that propelled madonna into stratosphere and rightly so songs are smart funny sexy and irresistible taraborrelli said it was like a virgin which reflected madonna as a more versatile and artistic performer and vocals on this album being reflectively sharper in contrast to her early works in music industry michael paoletta from billboard commented that songs on album sustain a fevered dance rock momentum stephen thomas erlewine from allmusic commented overall album adds up to less than sum of its parts partially because singles are so good but also because on first album she stunned with style and a certain joy here calculation is apparent and while that s part of madonna s essence even something that makes her fun it throws record s balance off a little too much for it to be consistent even if it justifiably made her a star debby miller from rolling stone preferred madonna s debut album over like a virgin in village voice robert christgau was also lukewarm towards record writing madonna s so sure of herself she s asking men and women both to get hots for calculating bitch who sells fantasy even while she bids for sincerity market where long term superstars ply their trade and to make music less mechanical she s hired nile rodgers who i won t blame for making it less catchy jim farber from entertainment weekly said that in addition to raising madonna whore ante with songs like title cut virgin cradled kind of 80s hits dress you up built to transcend dynasty era alfred soto from stylus magazine remembered first time that he heard songs from album and commented lots of critics think something similar occurred when madonna followed her eponymous debut with like a virgin helmed by nile rodgers with all fixin s too calculated next to raw passion of debut this is nonsense it misses how madonna conflated notions of spontaneity and calculation rodgers is ideal collaborator stephen holden from new york times said with a tough cookie voice that s both coy and streetwise madonna s singing harks back to rock and roll girl group tradition that preceded beatles but where girl groups from shirelles to ronettes extolled their boyfriends cars haircuts and rebel poses madonna s point of view is decidedly more self interested in matters of love she is a comparison shopper with a shrewd sense of her own market value words shiny and new describe not only way love smitten singer feels in title song but sound of album matt from los angeles times commented madonna s beating vibrato sometimes makes her sound so robotic in album lou papineau while writing for providence journal said that in like a virgin madonna proves she s shallow but spunky sal cinquemani from slant magazine gave a positive review saying though not as innovative as her debut like a virgin stands as one of most definitive pop artifacts from indulgent reagan era mid tempo ballad shoo bee doo and a soulful cover of rose royce s love don t live here anymore proved madonna could churn out more than just novelty hits while sugary angel and irresistible dress you up contributed to singer s record breaking list of consecutive top 5 hits 16 in all retro infused stay and percussive over and over are album s hidden gems ed stevenson from people felt that madonna does have a sense of humor though she is buried under so many layers of self parody it s hard to tell sometimes she is backed on this by reliable rhythmic touch of veteran nile rodgers whose contributions have helped her create a tolerable bit of fluff hugo mistry from chicago tribune felt that like a virgin was madonna s breakthrough playing off her self conscious campiness with a series of hot dance tracks attention grabbing lyrics and steamy videos commercial performance left thumb madonna performing material girl from album on rebel heart tour in 2015 16 lyrically song talks about love for wealth and materialism like a virgin was recorded and finished by september 1984 but release of album was held up much to madonna s frustration by continuing sales of her debut album which was approaching two million sales in united states like a virgin debuted at number 70 on billboard 200 issued for december 1 1984 album reached top ten of billboard 200 on december 8 1984 and after one

reaching summit on november 23 1985 for two weeks like a virgin has sold more than 21 million copies worldwide as of august 2008 and became one of best selling albums of all time legacy after release of like a virgin stephen holden from new york times commented no phenomenon illustrates more pointedly how pop music history seems to run in cycles than overnight success of 24 year old pop siren known as madonna month before christmas madonna s second album like a virgin sold more than two million copies teen agers were lining up in stores to purchase album way their parents had lined up to buy beatles records in late 60 s madonna proved she was not a one hit wonder with release of album which sold 12 million copies worldwide at time of its release in 2016 billboard ranked at number nine in list of certified diamond albums from worst to best taraborrelli felt that like a virgin is really a portrait of madonna s uncanny pop instincts empowered by her impatient zeal for creative growth and her innate knack for crafting a good record he added that success of album made it clear what was madonna s real persona she was a street smart dance queen with sexy allure of marilyn monroe coy of marlene dietrich and cutting and protective glibness of a modern mae west although album received mixed reviews taraborrelli believed that mere fact that at time of its release so many couldn t resist commenting on record was a testament to continuous growing fascination with madonna every important artist has at least one album in his or her career whose critical and commercial success becomes artist s magic moment for madonna like a virgin was just such a defining moment chris smith author of 101 albums that changed popular music believed that it was with like a virgin that madonna was able to steal spotlight towards herself she asserted her sexuality as only male rock stars had done before moving well beyond limited confines of being a pop artist to becoming a focal point for nationwide discussions of power relationships in areas of sex race gender religion and other divisive social topics her songs became a lightning rod for both criticism by conservatives and imitation by younger female population consequence of sound ranked album at number two on 10 greatest sophomore albums of all time calling it album that carved out throne that would be madonna s forever queen
