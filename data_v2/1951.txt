previously hosted three finals 1978 was first year in which club brugge had reached final while liverpool were appearing in their second successive final two teams had met before in final of a european competition 1976 uefa cup final which liverpool won 4 3 on aggregate liverpool were reigning champions and were aiming to become first british team to win successive european cups liverpool had already won uefa cup twice in 1972 73 and 1975 76 seasons and had a chance to win two european cups as well brugge were first belgian team to reach final of european cup and thus were aiming to become first to win trophy as final was held in england at wembley liverpool were clear favourites to retain european cup brugge were without a number of key players such as raoul lambert whose inclusion in brugge squad was rumoured before final but never materialised liverpool were also without a few players tommy smith who had scored in previous season s final was out after dropping a pick axe on his foot and breaking a toe striker david johnson was also absent he had strained knee ligaments during a match against leicester city an injury that ruled him out for rest of season summary first half was dull brugge held back using tight marking and offside trap to restrict liverpool s attacking threat towards end of first half liverpool started to have more scoring chances ray kennedy volleyed across face of goal and jimmy case took a free kick that needed to be punched away by brugge goalkeeper birger jensen in closing minutes of first half jensen made two crucial saves he blocked david fairclough who had made a run towards goal and he tipped a header by alan hansen over crossbar so score at half time was 0 0 early in second half jensen made another save this time from terry mcdermott brugge s first significant chance came a few minutes afterwards when a cross field pass by rene vandereycken reached jan sorensen on right hand side of pitch sorensen s subsequent shot was blocked by liverpool captain emlyn hughes blocked shot was not cleared but ray clemence reached ball before brugge s lajos ku could reach it and score after this ku was substituted with dirk sanders liverpool made a substitution minutes later with steve heighway replacing case liverpool s substitution had more effect as heighway gave liverpool more width on right hand side of pitch two minutes after heighway s introduction kenny dalglish received ball in brugge penalty area from a graeme souness pass and placed his shot over a diving jensen to give liverpool a 1 0 lead brugge now needed to score but they only created one more chance ten minutes before end of match sorensen intercepted a hansen backpass and shot his shot was blocked by clemence and a goal line clearance by phil thompson prevented brugge from equalising match remained at 1 0 and liverpool won their second consecutive european cup becoming first british team to retain trophy lajos ku had defected from hungary in

match after match figures from each team were critical of other team s play liverpool defender tommy smith criticised brugge for their approach saying it was a pathetic attitude you never win anything like that liverpool manager bob paisley also criticised belgian team s tactics it takes two teams to make a game into a spectacle and bruges only seemed to be concerned with keeping score down bruges didn t come at us much apart from one mistake in our defence they never looked like scoring but they were well organised at back and it was a case of breaking them down we controlled game from start to finish meanwhile club brugge manager ernst happel was critical of quality of liverpool team liverpool seemed only a shadow of side we played in uefa cup final two seasons ago i was disappointed with them but they deserved their victory although we were handicapped by injuries to two players see also 1976 uefa cup final contested between same teams club brugge k v in european football
