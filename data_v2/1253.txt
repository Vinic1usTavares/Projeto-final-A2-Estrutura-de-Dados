commonwealth war graves commission cwgc is an intergovernmental organisation of six independent member states whose principal function is to mark record and maintain graves and places of commemoration of commonwealth of nations military service members who died in two world wars commission is also responsible for commemorating commonwealth civilians who died as a result of enemy action during world war ii commission was founded by sir fabian ware and constituted through royal charter in 1917 named imperial war graves commission change to present name took place in 1960 commission as part of its mandate is responsible for commemorating all commonwealth war dead individually and equally to this end war dead are commemorated by name on a headstone at an identified site of a burial or on a memorial war dead are commemorated uniformly and equally irrespective of military or civil rank race or creed commission is currently responsible for continued commemoration of 1 7 million deceased commonwealth military service members in 153 countries since its inception commission has constructed approximately 2 500 war cemeteries and numerous memorials commission is currently responsible for care of war dead at over 23 000 separate burial sites and maintenance of more than 200 memorials worldwide in addition to commemorating commonwealth military service members commission maintains under arrangement with applicable governments over 40 000 non commonwealth war graves and over 25 000 non war military and civilian graves commission operates through continued financial support of member states united kingdom canada australia new zealand india and south africa current president of commonwealth war graves commission is prince edward duke of kent history world war i thumb left canadian war graves near ypres belgium crosses identify graves as those of soldiers of 14th canadian battalion who were killed over several days in may 1916 alt six graves marked with white crosses located in a muddy field with trees in background at outbreak of world war i in 1914 fabian ware a director of rio tinto company found that he was too old at age 45 to join british army he used influence of rio tinto chairman viscount milner to become commander of a mobile unit of british red cross he arrived in france in september 1914 and whilst there was struck by lack of any official mechanism for documenting or marking location of graves of those who had been killed and felt compelled to create an organisation within red cross for this purpose in march 1915 with support of nevil macready adjutant general of british expeditionary force ware s work was given official recognition and support by imperial war office and unit was transferred to british army as graves registration commission new graves registration commission had over 31 000 graves of british and imperial soldiers registered by october 1915 and 50 000 registered by may 1916 when municipal graveyards began to ware began negotiations with various local authorities to acquire land for further cemeteries ware began with an agreement with france to build joint british and french cemeteries under understanding that these would be maintained by french government ware eventually concluded that it was not prudent to leave maintenance responsibilities solely to french government and subsequently arranged for france to purchase land grant it in perpetuity and leave management and maintenance responsibilities to british french government agreed under condition that cemeteries respected certain dimensions graves were to be apart with pathways no more than wide were accessible by public road were in vicinity of medical aid stations and were not too close to towns or villages similar negotiations began with belgian government as reports of grave registration work became public commission began to receive letters of enquiry and requests for photographs of graves from relatives of deceased soldiers by 1917 17 000 photographs had been dispatched to relatives in march 1915 commission with support of red cross began to dispatch photographic prints and cemetery location information in answer to requests graves registration commission became directorate of graves registration and enquiries in spring of 1916 in recognition of fact that scope of work began to extend beyond simple grave registration and began to include responding to enquiries from relatives of those killed directorate s work was also extended beyond western front and into other theatres of war with units deployed in greece egypt and mesopotamia formal establishment thumb upright carving of headstones by hand would take a week alt a man carving a maple leaf onto a gravestone in a workshop with a hammer and chisel as war continued ware and others became concerned about fate of graves in post war period following a suggestion by british army government appointed national committee for care of soldiers graves in january 1916 with edward prince of wales agreeing to serve as president national committee for care of soldiers graves was created with intention of taking over work of directorate of graves registration and enquiries after war government felt that it was more appropriate to entrust work to a specially appointed body rather than to any existing government department by early 1917 a number of members of committee believed a formal imperial organisation would be needed to care for graves with help of edward prince of wales ware submitted a memorandum to imperial war conference in 1917 suggesting that an imperial organisation be constituted suggestion was accepted and on 21 may 1917 imperial war graves commission was established by royal charter with prince of wales serving as president secretary of state for war lord derby as chairman and ware as vice chairman commission s undertakings began in earnest at end of first world war once land for cemeteries and memorials had been guaranteed enormous task of recording details of dead could begin by 1918 some 587 000 graves had been identified and a further 559 000 casualties were registered as having no known grave scale and associated high number of casualties of war produced an entirely new attitude towards commemoration of war dead previous to world war i individual commemoration of war dead was often on an ad hoc basis and was almost exclusively limited to commissioned officers however war required mobilisation of a significant percentage of population either as volunteers or through conscription an expectation had consequently arisen that individual soldiers would expect to be commemorated even if they were low ranking members of military a committee under frederic kenyon director of british museum presented a report to commission in november 1918 detailing how it envisioned development of cemeteries document was entitled war graves how cemeteries abroad will be designed two key elements of this report were that bodies should not be repatriated and that uniform memorials should be used to avoid class distinctions beyond logistical nightmare of returning home so many corpses it was felt that repatriation would conflict with feeling of brotherhood that had developed between serving ranks thumb left cover page of graves of fallen an article in times on 17 february 1919 by rudyard kipling carried commission s proposal to a wider audience and described what graves would look like article entitled war graves work of imperial commission mr kipling s survey was quickly republished as an illustrated booklet graves of fallen illustrated booklet was intended to soften impact of kenyon s report as it included illustrations of cemeteries with mature trees and shrubs contrasting bleak landscapes depicted in published battlefield photos there was an immediate public outcry following publication of reports particularly with regards to decision to not repatriate bodies of dead reports generated considerable discussion in press which ultimately led to a heated debate in parliament on 4 may 1920 sir james remnant started debate followed by speeches by william burdett coutts in favour of commission s principles and robert cecil speaking for those desiring repatriation and opposing uniformity of grave markers winston churchill closed debate and asked that issue not proceed to a vote remnant withdrew his motion allowing commission to carry out its work assured of support for its principles first cemeteries and memorials to missing in 1918 three of most eminent architects of their day sir herbert baker sir reginald blomfield and sir edwin lutyens were appointed as organization s initial principal architects rudyard kipling was appointed literary advisor for language used for memorial inscriptions thumb upright site plan for forceville communal cemetery and extension in 1920 commission built three experimental cemeteries at le treport forceville and following principles outlined in kenyon report of these forceville communal cemetery and extension was agreed to be most successful having consulted with garden designer gertrude jekyll architects created a walled cemetery with uniform headstones in a garden setting augmented by blomfield s cross of sacrifice and lutyens stone of remembrance after some adjustments forceville became template for commission s building programme cost overruns at all three experimental cemeteries necessitated some adjustments to ensure future cemeteries remained within their budget commission decided to not build shelters in cemeteries that contained less than 200 graves to not place a stone of remembrance in any cemetery with less than 400 graves and to limit height of cemetery walls to at end of 1919 commission had spent ps7 500 and this figure rose to ps250 000 in 1920 as construction of cemeteries and memorials increased by 1921 commission had established 1 000 cemeteries which were ready for headstone and burials between 1920 and 1923 commission was shipping 4 000 headstones a week to france in many cases commission closed small cemeteries and concentrated graves into larger ones by 1927 when majority of construction had been completed over 500 cemeteries had been built with 400 000 headstones a thousand crosses of sacrifice and 400 stones of remembrance thumb left upright menin gate at night commission had also been mandated to individually commemorate each soldier who had no known grave which amounted to 315 000 in france and belgium alone commission initially decided to build 12 monuments on which to commemorate missing each memorial being located at site of an important battle along western front after resistance from french committee responsible for approvals of memorials on french territory commission revised their plan and reduced number of memorials and in some cases built memorials to missing in existing cemeteries rather than as separate structures reginald blomfield s menin gate was first memorial to missing located in europe to be completed and was unveiled on 24 july 1927 menin gate was found to have insufficient space to contain all names as originally planned and 34 984 names of missing were instead inscribed on herbert baker s tyne cot memorial to missing other memorials followed helles memorial in gallipoli designed by john james burnet thiepval memorial on somme and arras memorial designed by edwin lutyens and basra memorial in iraq designed by edward prioleau warren dominions and india also erected memorials on which they commemorated their missing neuve chapelle memorial for forces of india vimy memorial by canada villers bretonneux memorial by australia delville wood memorial by south africa and beaumont hamel memorial by newfoundland programme of commemorating dead of great war was considered essentially complete with inauguration of thiepval memorial in 1932 though vimy memorial would not be finished until 1936 villers bretonneux memorial until 1938 and stonemasons were still conducting work on menin gate when germany invaded belgium in 1940 only memorial created by commission that was not in form of a monument or cemetery was institute at giza egypt complete with library and bacteriology and pathology departments as its memorial to men of egyptian labour corps and camel transport corps its erection was agreed with local political pressure world war ii thumb right kranji war memorial a world war ii memorial in singapore commemorating 24 306 casualties from start of second world war in 1939 commission organised grave registration units and planning ahead based on experience gained from first world war earmarked land for use as cemeteries when war began turning in favour of allies commission was able to begin restoring its first world war cemeteries and memorials it also began task of commemorating 600 000 commonwealth casualties from second world war in 1949 commission completed dieppe canadian war cemetery first of 559 new cemeteries and 36 new memorials eventually commission erected over 350 000 new headstones many from hopton wood stone wider scale of world war ii coupled with manpower shortages and unrest in some countries meant that construction and restoration programmes took much longer in albania graves of 52 of 54 graves of british soe personnel had been reburied in tirana before major mcintosh from cwgc florence base was expelled by new regime three quarters of original graves had been in difficult or remote locations following war commission implemented a five year horticultural renovation programme which addressed neglect by 1950 structural repairs together with backlog of maintenance tasks from before war took a further ten years to complete with increased number of civilian casualties compared with world war i winston churchill agreed to ware s proposal that commission also maintain a record of commonwealth civilian war deaths a supplemental chapter was added to imperial war graves commission s charter on 7 february 1941 empowering organisation to collect and record names of civilians who died from enemy action during second world war which resulted in creation of civilian war dead roll of honour roll eventually contained names of nearly 67 000 civilians commission and dean of westminster reached an agreement that roll would eventually be placed in westminster abbey but not until roll was complete and hostilities had ended commission handed over first six volumes to dean of westminster on 21 february 1956 it added final volume to showcase in 1958 post world war ii thumb left fromelles pheasant wood military cemetery most recently dedicated cemetery following world war ii commission recognised that word imperial within its name was no longer appropriate in spirit of strengthening national and regional feelings organization changed its name to commonwealth war graves commission in 1960 more recent conflicts have sometimes made it impossible for commission to care for cemeteries in a given region or resulted in destruction of sites altogether indian cemetery in germany was unkempt after end of world war ii and until german reunification because it was located in an area occupied by russian forces and was not entirely rebuilt until 2005 six day war and war of attrition resulted in destruction of port tewfik memorial and aden memorial and death of a commission gardener at suez war memorial cemetery during lebanese civil war two cemeteries in beirut were destroyed and had to be rebuilt maintenance of war graves and memorials in iraq has remained difficult since iran iraq war in 1980s with regular maintenance being impractical since after gulf war commission has and continues to also provide support for war graves outside its traditional mandate in 1982 british ministry of defence requested commission s assistance to design and construct cemeteries in falkland islands for those killed during falklands war although these cemeteries are not commonwealth war graves commission cemeteries commission manages administrative responsibilities for them since 2005 commission has carried out similar management duties on behalf of british ministry of defence for cemeteries and graves of british and imperial soldiers who died during second boer war in 2003 veterans affairs canada employed commission to develop an approach to locate grave markers for which canadian minister of veterans affairs has responsibility as of 2011 commission conducts a twelve year cyclical inspection programme of canadian veterans markers installed at expense of government of canada in 2008 an exploratory excavation discovered mass graves on edge of pheasant wood outside of fromelles two hundred and fifty british and australian bodies were excavated from five mass graves which were interred in newly constructed fromelles pheasant wood military cemetery this was first new commonwealth war graves commission cemetery in more than 50 years last such cemeteries having been built after second world war burial sites and memorials commission is currently responsible for continued commemoration of 1 7 million deceased commonwealth military service members in 153 countries and approximately 67 000 civilians who died as a result of enemy action during world war ii commonwealth military service members are commemorated by name on either a headstone at an identified site of a burial or on a memorial as a result commission is currently responsible for care of war dead at over 23 000 separate burial sites and maintenance of more than 200 memorials worldwide vast majority of burial sites are pre existing communal or municipal cemeteries and parish churchyards located in united kingdom however commission has itself constructed approximately 2 500 war cemeteries worldwide commission has also constructed or commissioned memorials to commemorate dead who have no known grave largest of these is thiepval memorial qualifications for inclusion commission only commemorates those who have died during designated war years while in commonwealth military service or of causes attributable to service death in service included not only those killed in combat but other causes such as those that died in training accidents air raids and due to disease such as 1918 flu pandemic applicable periods of consideration are 4 august 1914 to 31 august 1921 for first world war and 3 september 1939 to 31 december 1947 for second world war end date for first world war period is official end of war while for second world war commission selected a date approximately same period after ve day as official end of first world war was after 1918 armistice civilians who died as a result of enemy action during second world war are commemorated differently from those that died as a result of military service they are commemorated by name through civilian war dead roll of honour located in st george s chapel in westminster abbey in addition to its mandated duties commission maintains under arrangement with applicable governments over 40 000 non commonwealth war graves and over 25 000 non

principal architect for palestine and gallipoli assisted by thomas smith tait principal architect for mesopotamia was edward prioleau warren as well as these senior architects there was a team of assistant architects who were actually responsible for many of cemetery and memorial designs these architects were younger and many of them had served in war assistant architects were george gordon

architectural design features thumb right upright cross of sacrifice alt a stone cross with a metal longsword in middle on an octagonal stone base structural design has always played an important part in commission s cemeteries apart from a few exceptions due to local geological conditions cemeteries follow same design and uniform aesthetic all over world this makes cemeteries easily recognisable and distinguishes them from war graves administered by other groups or countries a typical cemetery is surrounded by a low wall or hedge and with a wrought iron gate entrance for cemeteries in france and belgium a land tablet near entrance or along a wall identifies cemetery grounds as having been provided by french or belgian governments all but smallest cemeteries contain a register with an inventory of burials a plan of plots and rows and a basic history of cemetery register is located within a metal cupboard that is marked with a cross located in either wall near cemetery entrance or in a shelter within cemetery more recently in larger sites a stainless steel notice gives details of respective military campaign headstones within cemetery are of a uniform size and design and mark plots of equal size cemetery grounds are except in drier climates grass covered with a floral border around headstones there is also an absence of any paving between headstone rows which is intended to make cemetery feel like a traditional walled garden where visitors could experience a sense of peace however carter and jackson argue that uniform aesthetics are designed to evoke a positive experience which deliberately masks and nature of war deaths cross of sacrifice and stone of remembrance thumb left stone of remembrance a feature of larger cemeteries typically cemeteries of more than 40 graves contain a cross of sacrifice designed by architect reginald blomfield this cross was designed to imitate medieval crosses found in churchyards in england with proportions more commonly seen in celtic cross cross is normally a freestanding four point limestone latin cross mounted on an octagonal base and ranging in height from a bronze longsword blade down is embedded on face of cross this cross represents faith of majority of dead and sword represents military character of cemetery intended to link british soldiers and christian concept of self sacrifice cemeteries with more than 1000 burials typically have a stone of remembrance designed by edwin lutyens with inscription their name liveth for evermore concept of stone of remembrance stone was developed by rudyard kipling to commemorate those of all faiths and none respectively in contrast to cross of sacrifice design for stone deliberately avoided shapes associated with particular religions geometry of structure was based on studies of parthenon each stone is long and high shape of stone has been compared both to that of a sarcophagus and an altar feature was designed using principle of subtle curves in design if extended would form a sphere in diameter headstones every grave is marked with a headstone each headstone contains national emblem or regimental badge rank name unit date of death and age of each casualty inscribed above an appropriate religious symbol and a more personal dedication chosen by relatives headstones use a standard upper case lettering designed by macdonald gill individual graves are arranged where possible in straight rows and marked by uniform headstones vast majority of which are made of portland stone original headstone dimensions were tall wide and thick most headstones are inscribed with a cross except for those deceased known to be atheist or non christian in case of burials of victoria cross or george cross recipients regimental badge is supplemented by victoria cross or george cross emblem sometimes a soldier employed a pseudonym because he was too young to serve or were sought by law enforcement in such cases his primary name is shown along with notation served as many headstones are for unidentified casualties they consequently bear only what could be discovered from body epitaph developed by rudyard kipling that appears on graves of unidentified soldiers for which no details are known is a soldier of great war known unto god some headstones bear text believed to be buried in this cemetery when they are believed to be buried in cemetery but exact location of grave is not known in some cases soldiers were buried in collective graves and distinguishing one body from another was not possible and thus one headstone covers more than one grave headstone does not denote any specific details of death except for its date and even then only if it is known and are deliberately ambiguous about cause of death due to local conditions it was sometimes necessary for commission to deviate from its standard design in places prone to extreme weather or earthquakes such as thailand and turkey stone faced pedestal markers are used instead of normal headstones these measures are intended to prevent masonry being damaged during earthquakes or sinking into sodden ground in italy headstones were carved from perla limestone because it was in more plentiful supply in struma military cemetery in greece to avoid risk of earthquake damage small headstones are laid flush to ground due to their smaller size markers often lack unit insignia horticulture commission cemeteries are distinctive in treating floriculture as an integral part of cemetery design originally horticultural concept was to create an environment where visitors could experience a sense of peace in a setting in contrast to traditionally bleak graveyards recommendations given by arthur william hill assistant director of royal botanical gardens at kew enabled commission to develop cemetery layouts and architectural structures that took into account placement of suitable plant life combining structural and horticultural elements was not unfamiliar to commission s architects sir edwin lutyens furthered his long standing working relationship with horticulturist gertrude jekyll whose devotion to traditional cottage garden plants and roses greatly influenced appearance of cemeteries where possible indigenous plants were utilised to enhance sentimental associations with gardens of home variety in texture height and timing of floral display were equally important horticultural considerations beds around each headstone are planted with a mixture of floribunda roses and herbaceous perennials low growing plants are chosen for areas immediately in front of headstones ensuring that inscriptions are not obscured and preventing soil from splashing back during rain in cemeteries where there are pedestal grave markers dwarf varieties of plants are used instead absence of any form of paving between headstone rows contributes to simplicity of cemetery designs lawn paths add to garden ambiance and are irrigated during dry season in countries where there is insufficient rain where irrigation is inappropriate or impractical dry landscaping is an ecological alternative favoured by commission s horticulturists as is case in iraq drier areas require a different approach not only for lawns but also to plants and styles of planting similarly there are separate horticultural considerations in tropical climates when many cemeteries are concentrated within a limited area like along western front or gallipoli peninsula mobile teams of gardeners operate from a local base elsewhere larger cemeteries have their own dedicated staff while small cemeteries are usually tended by a single gardener working part time organisation thumb headquarters of commonwealth war graves commission in maidenhead uk commissioners affairs of cwgc are
