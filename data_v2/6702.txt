thumb upright 1 5 painting of hugo de vries making a painting of an evening primrose plant which had apparently produced new forms by large mutations in his experiments by therese 1918 mutationism is one of several alternatives to evolution by natural selection that have existed both before and after publication of charles darwin s 1859 book on origin of species in theory mutation was source of novelty creating new forms and new species potentially instantaneously in sudden jumps this was envisaged as driving evolution which was thought to be limited by supply of mutations before darwin biologists commonly believed in saltationism possibility of large evolutionary jumps including immediate speciation for example in 1822 etienne geoffroy saint hilaire argued that species could be formed by sudden transformations or what would later be called macromutation darwin opposed saltation insisting on gradualism in evolution as in geology uniformitarianism in 1864 albert von kolliker revived geoffroy s theory in 1901 geneticist hugo de vries gave name mutation to seemingly new forms that suddenly arose in his experiments on evening primrose oenothera lamarckiana and in first decade of 20th century mutationism or as de vries named it mutationstheorie became a rival to darwinism supported for a while by geneticists including william bateson thomas hunt morgan and reginald punnett understanding of mutationism is clouded by mid 20th century portrayal of early mutationists by supporters of modern synthesis as opponents of darwinian evolution and rivals of biometrics school who argued that selection operated on continuous variation in this portrayal mutationism was defeated by a synthesis of genetics and natural selection that supposedly started later around 1918 with work by mathematician ronald fisher however alignment of mendelian genetics and natural selection began as early as 1902 with a paper by udny yule and built up with theoretical and experimental work in europe and america despite controversy early mutationists had by 1918 already accepted natural selection and explained continuous variation as result of multiple genes acting on same characteristic such as height mutationism along with other alternatives to darwinism like lamarckism and orthogenesis was discarded by most biologists as they came to see that mendelian genetics and natural selection could readily work together mutation took its place as a source of genetic variation essential for natural selection to work on however mutationism did not entirely vanish in 1940 richard goldschmidt again argued for single step speciation by macromutation describing organisms thus produced as hopeful monsters earning widespread ridicule in 1987 masatoshi nei argued controversially that evolution was often mutation limited modern biologists such as douglas j futuyma conclude that essentially all claims of evolution driven by large mutations can be explained by darwinian evolution developments leading up to mutationism thumb upright etienne geoffroy saint hilaire believed that monstrosities could immediately found new species in a single large jump or saltation geoffroy s monstrosities 1822 prior to charles darwin most naturalists were believing that species evolved and that speciation took place in sudden jumps jean baptiste lamarck was a gradualist but similar to other scientists of period had written that saltational evolution was possible in 1822 in second volume of his philosophie etienne geoffroy saint hilaire endorsed a theory of saltational evolution that monstrosities could become founding fathers or mothers of new species by instantaneous transition from one form to next geoffroy wrote that environmental pressures could produce sudden transformations to establish new species instantaneously darwin s anti saltationist gradualism 1859 in his 1859 book on origin of species charles darwin denied saltational evolution he argued that evolutionary transformation always proceeds gradually never in jumps natural selection acts solely by accumulating slight successive favourable variations it can produce no great or sudden modification it can act only by very short steps darwin continued in this belief throughout his life thumb upright rudolph albert von kolliker revived geoffroy s saltationist ideas calling his theory heterogenesis it depended on a nonmaterial directive force orthogenesis thomas henry huxley warned darwin that he had taken on an unnecessary difficulty in adopting natura non nature does not take leaps so unreservedly thomas henry huxley 1859 letter to charles darwin nov 23 1859 huxley feared this assumption could discourage naturalists who believed that major leaps and cataclysms played a significant role in history of life von kolliker s heterogenesis 1864 in 1864 albert von kolliker revived geoffroy s theory that evolution proceeds by large steps under name of heterogenesis but this time assuming influence of a nonmaterial force to direct course of evolution galton s sports 1892 darwin s cousin francis galton considered darwin s evidence for evolution and came to an opposite conclusion about type of variation on which natural selection must act he carried out his own experiments and published a series of papers and books setting out his views already by 1869 when he published hereditary genius he believed in evolution by saltation in his 1889 book natural inheritance he argued that natural selection would benefit from accepting that steps need not as darwin had stated be minute in his 1892 book finger prints he stated directly that progress of evolution is not a smooth and uniform progression but one that proceeds by jerks through successive sports as they are called some of them implying considerable organic changes and each in its turn being favoured by natural selection from 1860 to 1880 saltation had been a minority viewpoint to extent that galton felt his writings were being universally ignored by 1890 it became a widely held theory and his views helped to launch a major controversy thumb upright drawing of william bateson 1909 by biologist dennis g lillie bateson s discontinuous variation 1894 william bateson s 1894 book materials for study of variation treated with especial regard to discontinuity in origin of species marked arrival of mutationist thinking before rediscovery of mendel s laws he examined discontinuous variation implying a form of saltation where it occurred naturally following william keith brooks galton thomas henry huxley and st george jackson mivart early 20th century mutationism de vries and mendelian mutationstheorie 1901 hugo de vries s careful 1901 studies of wild variants of evening primrose oenothera lamarckiana showed that distinct new forms could arise suddenly in nature apparently at random and could be propagated for many generations without dissipation or blending he gave such changes name mutation part 2 1903 by this de vries meant that a new form of plant was created in a single step not same as a mutation in modern sense no long period of natural selection was required for speciation and nor was reproductive isolation in view of historian of science peter j bowler de vries used term to mean historian of science betty smocovitis described mutationism as de vries set out his position known as mutationstheorie mutation theory on creative nature of mutation in his 1905 book species and varieties their origin by mutation in view of historian of science edward larson de vries was person largely responsible for transforming victorian era saltationism into early 20th century mutation theory and in doing so pushed darwinism near verge of extinction as a viable scientific theory johannsen s pure line experiments 1903 thumb upright wilhelm johannsen s pure line experiments seemed to show that evolution could not work on continuous variation in early 1900s darwin s mechanism of natural selection was understood by believers in continuous variation principally biometricians walter weldon and karl pearson to be able to work on a continuously varying characteristic whereas de vries argued that selection on such characteristics would be ineffective wilhelm johannsen s pure line experiments on phaseolus vulgaris beans appeared to refute this mechanism using true breeding princess variety of bean carefully inbred within weight classes johannsen s work appeared to support de vries offspring had a smooth random distribution johanssen believed that his results showed that continuous variability was not inherited so evolution must rely on discontinuous mutations as de vries had argued johanssen published his work in danish in a 1903 paper om arvelighed i samfund og i rene linier on inheritance in populations and in pure lines johannsen w 1903 om arvelighed i samfund og i rene linier over det kongelige danske videnskabernes vol 3 247 270 in danish german ed in und in reinen on inheritance in populations and in pure lines 1903 gustav fischer jena scanned full text and in his 1905 book elements of heredity punnett s mimicry 1915 thumb papilio polytes has 3 forms with differing wing patterns here romulus morph reginald punnett argued that this polymorphism demonstrated discontinuous evolution however ronald fisher showed that this could have arisen by small changes in additional modifier genes in 1915 reginald punnett argued in his book mimicry in butterflies that 3 morphs forms of butterfly papilio polytes which mimic different host species of butterfly demonstrated discontinuous evolution in action different forms existed in a stable polymorphism controlled by 2 mendelian factors genes alleles of these genes were certainly discontinuous so punnett supposed that they must have evolved in discontinuous leaps undermining of mutationism yule s analysis of mendelism and continuous variation 1902 undermining of mutationism began almost at once in 1902 as statistician udny yule analysed mendel s theory and showed that given full dominance of one allele over another a 3 1 ratio of alleles would be sustained indefinitely this meant that recessive allele could remain in population with no need to invoke mutation he also showed that given multiple factors mendel s theory enabled continuous variation as indeed mendel had suggested removing central plank of mutationist theory and criticised bateson s confrontational approach however excellent paper did not prevent mendelians and biometricians from falling out nilsson ehle s experiments on mendelian inheritance and continuous variation 1908 swedish geneticist h nilsson ehle demonstrated in 1908 in a paper published in german in a swedish journal ergebnisse von bei hafer und observations on crosses in oats and wheat that continuous variation could readily be produced by multiple mendelian genes he found numerous mendelian 3 1 ratios implying a dominant and a recessive allele in oats and wheat a 15 1 ratio for a cross of oat varieties with black and white respectively implying two pairs of alleles two mendelian factors and that crossing a red grained swedish velvet wheat with a white one gave in third f3 generation complex signature of ratios expected of three factors at once with 37 grains giving only red offspring 8 giving 63 1 in their offspring 12 giving 15 1 and 6 giving 3 1 there weren t any grains giving all white but as he had only expected 1 of those in his sample 0 was not an unlikely outcome genes could clearly combine in almost infinite combinations ten of his factors allowed for almost 60 000 different forms with no need to suppose that any new mutations were involved results implied that natural selection would work on mendelian genes helping to bring about unification of darwinian evolution and genetics similar work in america by edward east on maize in 1910 showed same thing for biologists without access to nilsson ehle s work on same theme mathematician ronald fisher published correlation between relatives on supposition of mendelian inheritance in 1918 again showing that continuous variation could readily be produced by multiple mendelian genes it showed too that mendelian inheritance had no essential link with mutationism fisher stressed that small variations per gene would be sufficient for natural selection to drive evolution castle s selection experiments on hooded rats 1911 starting in 1906 william castle carried out a long study of effect of selection on coat colour in rats piebald or hooded pattern was recessive to grey wild type he crossed hooded rats with black backed irish type and then back crossed offspring with pure hooded rats dark stripe on back was bigger he then tried selecting different groups for bigger or smaller stripes for 5 generations and found that it was possible to change characteristics way beyond initial range of variation this effectively refuted de vries s claim that continuous variation could not be inherited permanently requiring new mutations by 1911 castle noted that results could be explained by darwinian selection on heritable variation of mendelian genes morgan s small mendelian genes in drosophila 1912 thumb thomas hunt morgan s work on drosophila melanogaster found many small mendelian factors for natural selection to work on by 1912 after years of work on genetics of drosophila fruit flies thomas hunt morgan showed that these animals had many small mendelian factors on which darwinian evolution could work as if variation was fully continuous way was open for geneticists to conclude that mendelism supported darwinism muller s balanced lethal explanation of oenothera mutations 1918 de vries s mutationism was dealt a serious if not fatal blow in 1918 by american geneticist hermann joseph muller he compared behaviour of balanced lethals in drosophila with de vries s supposed mutations in oenothera showing that they could work same way no actual mutations were involved but infrequent chromosome crossovers accounted for sudden appearance of traits which had been present in genes all along fisher s explanation of polymorphism 1927 in 1927 fisher explicitly attacked punnett s 1915 theory of discontinuous evolution of mimicry fisher argued that selection acting on genes making small modifications to butterfly s phenotype its appearance would allow multiple forms of a polymorphism to be established later mutationist theories understanding that mendelian genetics could both preserve discrete variations indefinitely and support continuous variation for natural selection to work on gradually meant that most biologists from around 1918 onwards accepted natural selection as driving force of evolution mutationism and other alternatives to evolution by natural selection did not however vanish entirely berg s nomogenesis 1922 lev berg proposed a combination of mutationism and directed orthogenetic evolution in his 1922 book nomogenesis or evolution determined by law he used evidence from paleontology zoology and botany to argue that natural selection had limitations which set a direction for evolution he claimed that speciation was caused by mass transformation of a great number of individuals by directed mass mutations thumb upright 1 35 john christopher willis s course of evolution by differentiation or divergent mutation rather than by selection 1940 willis s 1923 in 1923 botanist john christopher willis proposed that species were formed by large mutations not gradual evolution by natural selection and that evolution was driven by orthogenesis which he called differentiation rather than by natural selection goldschmidt s hopeful monsters 1940 thumb upright masatoshi nei argues that evolution is often mutation limited in his 1940 book material basis of evolution german geneticist richard goldschmidt argued for single step speciation by macromutation describing organisms thus produced as hopeful monsters goldschmidt s thesis was universally rejected and widely ridiculed by biologists who favoured neo darwinian explanations of fisher j b s haldane and sewall wright however interest in goldschmidt s ideas has reawakened in field of evolutionary developmental biology judson olivia 2008 monster is back and it s hopeful new york times nei s mutation driven evolution 1987 contemporary biologists accept that mutation and selection both play roles in evolution mainstream view is that while mutation supplies material for selection in form of variation all non random outcomes are caused by natural selection masatoshi nei argues instead that production of more efficient genotypes by mutation is fundamental for evolution and that evolution is often mutation limited nei s book received thoughtful reviews while wright in conservative journal evolution rejected nei s thinking as mistaken galtier weiss stoltzfus and wagner although not necessarily agreeing with nei s position treated it as a relevant alternative view contemporary approaches reviewing history of theories american evolutionary biologist douglas j futuyma notes that since 1970 two very different alternatives to darwinian gradualism have been proposed both by stephen jay gould mutationism and punctuated equilibria gould s macromutation theory gave a nod to his predecessor with an envisaged goldschmidt break between evolution within a species and speciation his advocacy of goldschmidt was attacked with highly unflattering comments by brian charlesworth and alan templeton futuyma

upright 2 0 multiple explanations have been offered since 19th century for how evolution took place given that many scientists initially had objections to natural selection many of these including mutationism led to some form of orthogenesis solid blue arrows with or without theistic intervention dotted blue arrows better understanding of mutation led instead dashed orange arrows to modern synthesis of mendelian genetics with natural selection establishing darwinian evolution throughout biology biologists at start of 20th century broadly agreed that evolution occurred but felt that mechanisms suggested by darwin including natural selection would be ineffective large mutations looked likely to drive evolution quickly and avoided difficulty which had rightly worried darwin namely that blending inheritance would average out any small favourable changes further large mutation able to create species in a single step offered a ready explanation of why fossil record should contain large discontinuities and times of rapid change these discoveries were often framed by supporters of mid 20th century modern synthesis such as julian huxley and ernst mayr as a controversy between early geneticists mendelians including bateson johannsen de vries morgan and punnett who advocated mendelism and mutation and were understood as opponents of darwin s original gradualist view and biometricians such as pearson and weldon who opposed mendelism and were more faithful to darwin in this version little progress was made during eclipse of darwinism and debate between mutationist geneticists such as de vries and biometricians such as pearson ended with victory of modern synthesis between about 1918 and 1950 according to this account new population genetics of 1940s demonstrated explanatory power of natural selection while mutationism alongside other non darwinian approaches such as orthogenesis and structuralism was essentially abandoned this view became dominant in second half of 20th century and was accepted by both biologists and historians a more recent view advocated by historians arlin stoltzfus and kele cable is that bateson de vries morgan and punnett had by 1918 formed a synthesis of mendelism and mutationism understanding achieved by these geneticists spanned action of natural selection on alleles alternative forms of a gene hardy weinberg equilibrium evolution of continuously varying traits like height and probability that a new mutation will become fixed in this view early geneticists accepted natural selection alongside mutation but rejected darwin s non mendelian ideas about variation and heredity and synthesis began soon after 1900 traditional claim that mendelians rejected idea of continuous variation outright is simply false as early as 1902 bateson and edith saunders wrote that if there were even so few as say four or five pairs of possible various homo and hetero combinations might on give so near an approach to a continuous curve that purity of elements would be unsuspected historians have interpreted history of mutationism in different ways classical view is that mutationism opposed to darwin s gradualism was an obvious error decades long delay in synthesizing genetics and darwinism is an inexplicable embarrassment genetics led logically to modern synthesis and mutationism was one of several anti darwinian blind alleys separate from main line leading from darwin to present a revisionist view is that mutationists accepted both mutation and selection with broadly same roles they have today and early on accepted and indeed offered a correct explanation for continuous variation based on multiple genes paving way for gradual evolution at time of darwin centennial in cambridge in 1909
