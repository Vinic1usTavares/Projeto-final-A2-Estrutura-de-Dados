of lincoln highway and us 30 has accommodated changing needs of traveling public early lincoln highway travelers were directed into many small towns as route traveled across state towards middle of 20th century route was straightened bypassing most downtown areas and several towns altogether more recently long sections of us 30 have been upgraded to a four lane expressway to meet needs of increasing traffic since 2006 highway has been designated an iowa heritage byway by iowa dot first highway in state with that distinction route description us 30 extends from west to east across

eighth avenue south us 30 splits away from us 67 and onto gateway bridge and crosses into illinois history path which us 30 follows has changed since it was originally planned as lincoln highway in early 1910s first path connected as many downtown areas as possible in order to create awareness about good roads movement and lincoln highway as primary highway system of iowa matured and lincoln highway yielded to us 30 highway was gradually straightened leaving many towns off route more recently new construction has routed traffic away from straighter roads and onto sections of freeway and expressway lincoln highway us 30 was created with u s highway system in 1926 but route it takes dates back to 1913 when lincoln highway association lha designated route across country brainchild of carl fisher lincoln highway was first highway to cross united states connecting new york city to san francisco in iowa it was uncertain exactly where lincoln highway would run as of august 1913 no definite route had been planned only certainty was route would pass through iowa iowans raised over 5 million equivalent to in dollars for construction of road on september 14 1913 lincoln highway association announced route it was of dirt roads connecting clinton dewitt cedar rapids tama marshalltown ames jefferson denison logan and council bluffs route was marked by a red white and blue tricolor emblazoned with an l route markers were painted upon telephone poles bridges and nearby buildings to show travelers way thumb left lincoln highway passes beneath a union pacific railroad bridge in state center with l logo painted on bridge support alt a highway passes underneath a train bridge while not ideal for transcontinental travel iowa s dirt roads were of high quality foreigners even compared them to best roads in france however same could not be said when they were wet mud was so thick and viscous it was nicknamed gumbo to show travelers obvious benefits of paved roads lincoln highway association began process of creating seedling miles of paved roads idea according to henry b joy then president of lincoln highway association was to show travelers for how fast and smooth their trip could be only to bring them back to reality at end of mile seedling miles were placed at least from nearest town and in areas where terrain was rough between august 1918 and june 1919 iowa s first seedling mile was built in linn county west of mount vernon ribbon of concrete which was wide thick and crowned for drainage cost nearly 35 000 equivalent to in dollars to build despite success of seedling miles across country iowa lagged behind other states in improving its roads before 1924 iowa s 99 counties not state highway commission were responsible for construction and maintenance of state s roads in 1920s road paving cost equivalent to in dollars a major obstacle for county boards of supervisors that wanted to pave its roads when counties could afford to build roads iowa state highway commission required extensive grading to be done before paving in 1922 only five percent of iowa s roads were paved by 1924 twenty percent of lincoln highway in iowa had been paved and by 1931 it was paved continuously from new york city to missouri valley iowa 1930s 1950s when lincoln highway became u s highway 30 in 1926 route was long and passed through every town along way starting in 1930s route s alignment began to be straightened by mid 1930s it was routed west of missouri valley on old iowa 130 us 30 alignment south of missouri valley became u s highway 30 alternate by 1952 it had moved south of marshalltown and was replaced by iowa 330 and a southern jaunt through belle plaine had been replaced by a straight road in 1955 a couple of routing changes occurred in cedar rapids it began its move to south avoiding downtown area and in clinton it was rerouted over gateway bridge allowing iowa 136 to cross lyons fulton bridge however by 1957 old alignment through clinton and across lyons fulton bridge was numbered u s highway 30 alternate 1960s 1980s in 1960 1970s iowa dot started to build freeway segments along us 30 in 1965 it was straightened and rerouted to south of ogden and boone along an four lane stretch of road by end of 1960s both of alternate routes had been turned over to local jurisdictions western route became iowa 183 and eastern route reverted to iowa 136 by 1973 that new stretch of road had been extended along a four lane bypass around ames old alignment became iowa 930 in eastern iowa a new freeway connected dewitt and clinton by 1976 by 1985 bypass of cedar rapids had been completed from 16th avenue sw to iowa 13 near bertram bypass was extended further west in 1989 between 1996 and 2000 an 8 2 million extension equivalent to in dollars was built to connect bypass to western intersection of us 218 since cedar rapids bypass was completed in 1985 on occasion traffic has had to be rerouted off of us 30 bypass s proximity to union pacific railroad mainline resulted in an elevated roadway between edgewood road and sixth street sw when strong winds come from south fog produced by an archer daniels midland plant adjacent to highway billows over road making driving dangerous iowa dot set up an emergency detour from edgewood road sw north to 16th avenue sw east to 6th street sw back to us 30 frequency of fog related detours has decreased in recent years due to improved technology and plant s expansion and relocation of cooling towers away from highway 1990s to present 1990s saw more construction of four lane roads along us 30 stretches of four lane roads that had already been constructed were extended towards other communities in story county it was widened to four lanes from i 35 interchange to us 65 at colo original 1950s era bypass of marshalltown was itself bypassed in 1997 by a freeway south of original bypass that road iowa avenue in marshalltown was designated as u s route 30 business first business route along us 30 in iowa four lane stretch southeast of cedar rapids was extended another to a point west of mount vernon costing 5 6 million equivalent to in dollars to build since beginning of 21st century iowa dot has continued to widen us 30 to four lanes in 2004 an 18 6 million equivalent to in dollars four lane section opened from east of marshalltown to meskwaki settlement west of tama bypassing le grand in 2010 two sections of expressway were completed a section from colo to state center opened to westbound travelers on november 29 while eastbound lanes opened a week later section which bypasses tama toledo area opened in two segments first of which opened on november 1 and second on november 25 on july 7 2011 a section from state center to iowa 330 opened in marshall county this created a four lane expressway from ogden to tama covering legacy of lincoln highway thumb preston s service station in belle plaine alt an old building is covered with old signs while lincoln highway has not been an official route for years it is still a source of pride in communities and regions through which it passed nearly 85 percent of original lincoln highway is still drivable although much is gravel most of what is drivable is either along us 30 or within lincoln highway bridge in tama was built in 1915 it was restored in 1980s after local officials feared losing then deteriorating bridge preston s service station a landmark of belle plaine has become a lincoln highway museum monuments were built along route to honor not only abraham lincoln but to honor iowans who were influential for planning its route thumb left lincoln highway near calamus in 1992 lincoln highway association was reformed with a chapter in each state through which highway passed new lha is a historical preservation group that wants to preserve remaining sections of highway iowa chapter of lha has since 2008 sponsored a tour of lincoln highway to keep friendly to classic cars tour does not travel upon sections of road which are gravel after years of lobbying by lha iowa department of transportation in 2006 designated lincoln highway first iowa heritage byway 2010 transportation map of iowa showed path designated as iowa heritage byway for first time major intersections see also special routes of u s route 30 references u s route 030 in iowa
