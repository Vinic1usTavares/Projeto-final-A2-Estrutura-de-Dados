coprinopsis variegata commonly known as scaly ink cap or feltscale inky cap is a species of fungus in family psathyrellaceae distributed in eastern north america it has a medium sized bell shaped to flattened cap up to in diameter with felt like patchy scales gills initially white turn black in maturity and eventually dissolve into a black ink fruit bodies grow in clusters or groups on leaf litter or rotted hardwood although wood may be buried giving appearance of growing in soil fungus is found in united states in areas east of great plains coprinus ebulbosus and coprinus quadrifidus are names assigned by charles horton peck to what he believed were species distinct from c variegata they were later shown to represent same species and are now synonyms mushroom is not recommended for consumption and has been shown to cause allergic reactions in susceptible individuals history and taxonomy left thumb 170px peck described three species now considered synonymous with coprinopsis variegata american mycologist charles horton peck described three similar species over course of a 24 year time period first coprinus variegata 1873 followed later by c ebulbosus 1895 and finally c quadrifidus 1897 c ebulbosus was initially considered a variety of european species coprinus picaceus bull ex fr s f gray currently known as coprinopsis four years later peck published a more complete description of var ebulbosus and raised it to species rank having found it to differ consistently from c picaceus in its smaller stature lack of a bulbous stem base and much smaller spores three species described by peck were distinguished on basis of physical features that were later found to be somewhat overlapping in terms of microscopic characters spore sizes were not sufficiently different between them to be used as discriminating taxonomic characters subsequent investigators of north american mushroom flora had difficulties in interpreting peck s concepts of these three taxa and in confirming their presence in their regional investigations for example mcilvaine 1902 hard 1908 and mcdougall 1925 reported as variety or species only c ebulbosus 1938 christensen 1946 smith 1958 and groves 1962 mentioned only c quadrifidus both kauffman 1918 and graham 1944 described c ebulbosus and c quadrifidus graham however only included c quadrifidus in his key to his descriptions of coprinus species in 1979 w patrick published a comparative analysis of three taxa from material collected by peck and after concluding that three were not sufficiently distinct to be considered separate species reduced them to synonymy with coprinopsis variegata earliest name specific epithet variegata derives from latin passive verb participle variegatus meaning to have different colors to synonym name quadrifidus refers to four segments into which cap frequently split when mature while ebulbosus means not being bulbous mushroom is commonly known as scaly ink cap or feltscale inky cap description thumb 140px left young fruit bodies are oval or egg shaped cap of c variegata is thin initially oval shaped then bell shaped and then flattened with margin turned upward it reaches diameters of up to when young surface of cap is covered with a woolly whitish or yellowish veil that breaks up into short lived flakes or scales this process reveals radially striate grooved gray to grayish brown cap surface gills are broad thin crowded closely together and free from attachment to stem they are initially white but turn to dark purplish brown as spores mature stem is and up to thick hollow and whitish it is roughly same width throughout length of stem and may have a wispy cotton like ring present near base clusters of fruit bodies have a mass of rhizomorphs at base called an in deposit spores are dark brown a light microscope may be used to reveal more features of spores including smooth surfaces a dark brown color an ellipsoid shape in face view and an egg shape in side view and dimensions of 7 5 9 5 by 4 4 5 um apex of spore appears truncated because of presence of a germ pore basidia spore bearing cells are hyaline translucent with dimensions of 14 16 by 6 5 7 5 um paraphyses are 9 11 by 8 10 um hyaline and collapse readily pleurocystidia cystidia present on gill face are abundant roughly cylindrical hyaline and measure 100 150 by 20 35 um cheilocystidia cystidia on edge of an gill are present in young specimens and are roughly ellipsoid measuring 50 80 by 15 25 um clamp connections are abundant in hyphae in all tissues through fruit body edibility of coprinopsis variegata has not been clearly established and opinions differ as to its desirability one 1987 field guide to north american species warns against consumption calling it not recommended a conclusion shared in a 2006 field guide to pennsylvanian and mid atlantic mushrooms but not before describing it as best of inky caps with a richer flavor and better texture than famous shaggy mane bitter tasting mushroom is not considered poisonous however fruit bodies are suspected to contain antabuse like chemical coprine which causes a poisoning reaction when consumed with alcohol additionally cases of allergic reactions against extracts from mushroom tissues have been reported in skin tests similar species thumb right coprinopsis atramentaria coprinopsis atramentaria is a cosmopolitan species that is roughly similar in size color and stature but does not have patchy woolly tufts on cap like c variegata ecology habitat and distribution species is saprobic deriving nutrients by decomposing and digesting organic matter and grows in clusters or in groups on decaying leaf litter or well decayed wood it typically fruits in a narrow window from june to july this spring and early summer fruiting distinguishes it from more common coprinus and coprinopsis atramentaria which produce fruit bodies in late autumn it is found in united states in areas east of great plains coprinopsis variegata can attack soil bacteria such as species of pseudomonas and agrobacterium and use them as nutrient sources fungus achieves this by growing specialized hyphae in direction of bacteria sensing them with some chemoattractive mechanism not yet fully understood fungus then secretes compounds to digest bacteria while growing assimilative hyphae to absorb nutrients process is relatively rapid and bacterial colonies can be assimilated in less than 24 hours see also list of coprinopsis species references external links variegata category fungi described in 1873 category
