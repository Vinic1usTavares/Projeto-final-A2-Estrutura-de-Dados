stinnett programming was led by ray gresko and graphics and storyline by justin chin production began in september 1993 at a time when first person shooter genre was very popular idea of creating a first person shooter in star wars universe was inspired by fan mods of doom which had levels set on death star developers of dark forces wanted to adapt fps format into an adventure game to do this they introduced puzzles and strategy along with a star wars plot originally luke skywalker was intended to be main character in game however developers realized that this would add constraints to gameplay and storyline instead a new character kyle katarn was created thumb right jedi game engine used in dark forces allows atmospheric effects such as red haze upon release dark forces was commonly called a doom clone but game makes significant expansions upon gameplay features present in doom new gameplay mechanisms that were not common at time of release include ability to look up and down duck jump and swim use of multiple floor levels is another technical advance in first person shooter genre to produce these new features developers wrote a game engine from scratch jedi game engine can create gameplay and graphical elements such as fully 3d objects atmospheric effects such as fog and haze animated textures and shading stinnett indicated that developers wanted these elements to be part of an active environment and features were included to create this ships come and go at flight decks rivers sweep along platforms and conveyor belts move and much of machinery functions dark troopers in dark forces were created specifically for game by justin chin and paul mica chin notes that they were designed as a more advanced enemy when compared to standard stormtroopers instead of just up stormtroopers i designed them to be more efficient i wanted something more terrifying and more omnipotent three designs for dark troopers were produced for dark forces lucasfilm licensing department initially rejected two of designs for looking too much out of character so chin produced new designs which were ultimately approved development team collaborated with staff at skywalker ranch for sounds music and costumes used in cutscenes dark forces was ported from dos to apple macintosh this presented several challenges for developers lucasarts requested game to be produced for both dos and macintosh with same system requirements specifically random access memory ram mac os runs a graphical user interface which uses up ram while dos does not meaning macintosh version has less ram available for dark forces to use aaron giles who was macintosh programmer for dark forces explained that to resolve this problem memory had to be managed more efficiently although set in star wars universe lead artist and author justin chin invented new weapons for game such as bryar pistol and mortar gun which were named after his personal favorites such as composer gavin and 1950s packard automobiles respectively music music for star wars dark forces was mostly original works composed by clint bajakian though they are based on cues from john williams original star wars

significant video game in first person shooter genre at time but also indicated that dark forces improved upon dooms features criticisms tended to focus on game being too short as well as lacking a multiplayer feature steven kent of seattle times believed that general aspects of game appeal to most computer gamers not just star wars fans kent argued that star wars setting is a high point for game saying that level designs recreate star wars style well though most of dark forces sets are original to game they were created in star wars spirit dark forces gameplay has been described as challenging and has generally received praise ron dulin reviewing game for gamespot highlights implementation of puzzles within levels levels are diverse and ingenious with plenty of creative obstacles standing between you and your goal while they can be occasionally frustrating dark forces diverse gameplay requirements make this title more mentally challenging than your average key hunt graphics and sound were both praised as helping to immerse player in environment playstation version of dark forces received less positive reviews it holds an aggregate score on gamerankings of 59 57 gamespot wrote though speed of playstation allows for smooth movement dark forces boasts a horrendously choppy frame rate ign made a similar point unlike pc and mac versions playstation dark forces is than a loaf of bread close up everything is blocky and pixelated but even from far away walls and textures look like big chunky blocks even worse than graphics though is frame rate or lack thereof choppy motion takes so much away from enjoyment of actually playing game four reviewers of electronic gaming monthly agreed that choppy frame rate interferes with gameplay which in combination with some control issues make game frustrating to play and a disappointment in light of its strong performance on pc alex of computer and video games offers same view saying that game is visually dated gamepros major mike praised action depth of gameplay weapons sound effects music and graphic effects but said choppy frame rate and slowdown plague most of game and compared game unfavorably to doom and next generation noted that dark forces fails on some technical levels as a port but commented positively on variety of level designs challenge level and use of audio and concluded more favorably not quite as intense as doom or disruptor but surely better than crap like dark forces will certainly satisfy star wars fans looking for their own little touch of force next generation reviewed pc version of game and stated that dark forces will be judged by doom s standards and in most of crucial areas it falls just short next generation reviewed macintosh version of game and stated that
