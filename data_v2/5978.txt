tree swallow tachycineta bicolor is a migratory bird of family hirundinidae found in americas tree swallow was first described in 1807 by french ornithologist louis vieillot as hirundo bicolor it has since been moved to its current genus tachycineta within which its phylogenetic placement is debated tree swallow has glossy blue green with exception of blackish wings and tail and white bill is black eyes dark brown and legs and feet pale brown female is generally duller than male and first year female has mostly brown upperparts with some blue feathers juveniles have brown upperparts and a grey brown washed breast tree swallow breeds in us and canada it winters along southern us coasts south along gulf coast to panama and northwestern coast of south america and in west indies tree swallow nests either in isolated pairs or loose groups in both natural and artificial cavities breeding can start as soon as early may although this date is occurring earlier because of climate change and it can end as late as july this bird is generally socially monogamous although about 8 of males are polygynous with high levels of extra pair paternity this can benefit male but since female controls copulation lack of resolution on how this behaviour benefits females makes high level of extra pair paternity puzzling female incubates clutch of two to eight but usually four to seven pure white eggs usually for 14 to 15 days chicks hatch slightly asynchronously allowing for female to prioritize which chicks to feed in times of food shortage they generally fledge about 18 to 22 days after hatching tree swallow is sometimes considered a model organism due to large amount of research done on it an aerial tree swallow forages both alone and in groups eating mostly insects in addition to molluscs spiders and fruit nestlings like adult primarily eat insects fed to it by both sexes this swallow is vulnerable to parasites but when on nestlings these do little damage effect of disease can become stronger as a tree swallow gets older as some parts of immune system decline with age acquired t cell mediated immunity for example decreases with age whereas both innate and acquired humoral immunity do not because of its large range and stable population tree swallow is considered to be least concern by international union for conservation of nature in us it is protected by migratory bird treaty act of 1918 and in canada by migratory birds convention act this swallow is negatively affected by human activities such as clearing of forests acidified lakes can force a breeding tree swallow to go long distances to find calcium rich food items to feed to its chicks taxonomy and etymology tree swallow was described as hirundo bicolor by louis pierre vieillot in his histoire naturelle des oiseaux de l amerique septentrionale published in 1807 it was then placed in its current genus tachycineta when jean cabanis established it in 1850 in 1878 elliott coues suggested that tree swallow at very least be put in its own subgenus iridoprocne on basis of its plumage along with white winged swallow chilean swallow white rumped swallow and mangrove swallow by 1882 he had upgraded this to a full genus some authors continued to use this classification with addition of swallow however genetic evidence supports existence of a single genus tachycineta tree swallow is also called white bellied swallow for its white underparts generally accepted genus name is from ancient greek moving quickly and specific bicolor is latin and means two coloured other genus name iridoprocne comes from greek iris meaning rainbow and procne a figure who supposedly turned into a swallow how exactly tree swallow is related to other members of tachycineta is unresolved in studies based on mitochondrial dna it was placed basal meaning it was first offshoot in species tree within north american caribbean clade consisting of violet green swallow golden swallow and bahama swallow although mitochondrial dna is advocated as a better indicator of evolutionary changes because it evolves quickly analyses based on it can suffer because it is only inherited from mother making it worse than nuclear dna from multiple loci at representing phylogeny of a whole group a study based on such nuclear dna placed tree swallow in most basal position within tachycineta as a whole as a sister group to rest of genus description thumb a juvenile tree swallow tree swallow has a length between about and a weight of approximately male has mostly glossy blue green wings and tail being blackish and cheek patch are white although coverts are grey brown bill is black eyes dark brown and legs and feet pale brown female is duller in colour than male and sometimes has a brown forehead second year female also has brown upperparts with a variable number of blue feathers some third year females also retain a portion of this subadult plumage according to a 1987 study this likely allows a younger female to explore nest sites as resident male is usually less aggressive to a subadult female a 2013 study found that resident female was less aggressive towards second year female models when they were presented separately from older models why female eventually replaces its subadult plumage is unknown it may allow males to assess female quality as pairs mate based on plumage brightness juvenile tree swallow can be distinguished by its brown upperparts and grey brown washed breast voice tree swallow s song consists of three parts chirp whine and gurgle these sections may be repeated or omitted and all can stand alone first as call sometimes divided into contact call and solicitation call is made by female during copulation and in both sexes to stimulate nestlings to beg or in some populations when their mate leaves or enters next cavity whine generally consisting of a downward shift in frequency followed by an upward shift may be given alone as anxiety call occasionally made in response to certain predators gurgle as when it appears at end of song is usually uttered twice it is likely involved in pair bonding chatter call is used to advertise nest sites reason it is also known as nest site advertising call and is also given to intruding conspecifics a short high pitched submission call is sometimes uttered after an aggressive encounter with another tree swallow while being physically restrained or in pain a distress call may be given male often utters a ticking or rasping aggression call during copulation and both sexes use it at end of mobbing dives alarm call is given in reaction to predators and other intruders and can serve to induce older nestlings to crouch and stop begging when a predator is near communication between parents and offspring can be disrupted by human generated noise a 2014 study for example found that broods for whom white noise was played were less likely to crouch or stop begging in response to alarm calls parents did not alter their calls to compensate likely increasing predation risk noise can also disrupt whether parents respond to begging but this may be balanced out by louder calls nestlings give when exposed to it increased begging effort however may be ineffective or costly for louder levels of noise distribution and habitat tree swallow breeds in north america its range extends to north central alaska and up to tree line in canada it is found as far south as tennessee in eastern part of its range california and new mexico in west and kansas in centre it occasionally breeds further south in us and vagrants are sometimes found in arctic circle northern pacific greenland and europe wintering range is from california and southwestern arizona in west and southeastern virginia in east south along gulf coast to west indies panama and northwestern south american coast when a swallow returns to nest it usually does not change breeding sites breeding habitat of this swallow is primarily in open and wooded areas especially those near water it roosts every night during non breeding season preferring to rest in cane or reed beds over water but it is also found over land and on trees and wires roosting sites are generally apart behaviour thumb right tree swallows fighting because of large amount of research on tree swallow and how it willingly breeds in nest boxes biologist jason jones recommended that it be considered a model organism although it is aggressive during breeding season this swallow is sociable outside of it forming flocks sometimes numbering thousands of birds breeding thumb left a natural nest hole tree swallow nests in structures with pre existing holes both natural and artificial these were once found only in forested regions but building of nest boxes has allowed this bird to expand into open habitats this swallow usually nests in area it bred year before only about 14 of females and 4 of males disperse to breed at a new site per year most do not go far usually breeding at sites less than away from their original grounds dispersal is influenced by breeding success of adult females that fail to fledge a chick about 28 disperse compared to 5 of successful breeders natal dispersal when a bird does not return to site it was born at to breed is common in tree swallow and occurs more frequently than breeding dispersal it nests both in loose groups and isolated pairs when nesting in loose groups nests are usually spaced at least apart and those that are closer in distance are usually further apart in terms of laying date in natural cavities tree swallow nests about apart from its neighbor nest hole in these situations is on average above ground level although about 45 of them are less than above ground higher cavities are likely favoured because they reduce predation while lower nest holes may be chosen to avoid competition entrance widths are often between whereas entrance heights are more variable a 1989 study found openings ranging from cavity volume is generally below after finding a suitable place to nest male perches near it and calls frequently a lack of sites can cause fights between birds sometimes resulting in deaths this swallow usually defends an area around nest with a radius of about as well as extra nests inside of that by blocking entrance to nest and chasing intruders nest cup itself is made from grass moss pine needles and aquatic plants collected mostly by female and is lined with feathers gathered primarily by male in fights feathers may function to insulate nest decreasing incubation time and likely preventing hypothermia in chicks in addition to faster growth for chicks eggs cool slower in nests with feathers than those without however a study published in 2018 did not find a significant correlation between number of feathers in nests that were artificially warmed versus those that were not additionally it found that nests in st denis saskatchewan used significantly less feathers than those in annapolis valley despite former being further north however temperatures in nova scotia where annapolis valley is are generally lower than those in saskatchewan possibly explaining unexpected result thumb right a pair mating during courtship a male tree swallow attacks an unknown female this can be stimulated through wing fluttering flight by female which may be an invitation to court male may then take a vertical posture with a raised and slightly spread tail and wings flicked and slightly drooped this prompts female to try to land on male s back but he flies to prevent this this is repeated after court female male flies to his chosen nest site which female inspects during copulation male hovers over female and then mounts her giving ticking calls he then makes with female while holding her neck feathers in his bill and standing on her slightly outstretched wings copulation occurs multiple times eggs are laid from early may to mid june although this is happening earlier due to climate change and chicks fledge between mid june and july latitude is positively correlated with laying date while female age and wing length longer wings allow more efficient foraging are negatively correlated tree swallow is likely an income breeder as it breeds based on food abundance and temperatures during laying season this species is generally socially monogamous but up to 8 of breeding males are polygynous polygyny is influenced by territory males having territories with nestboxes at least apart are more likely to be polygynous it is suggested that this polygyny depends on conditions during laying season better conditions such as an abundance of food allow females in polygyny who do not receive help foraging to lay more eggs thumb left inside of a tree swallow nest tree swallow has high rates of extra pair paternity 38 to 69 of nestlings being a product of extra pair paternity and 50 to 87 of broods containing at least one nestling that was result of an extra pair copulation one factor that might contribute to this is that females have control over copulation making paternity guards ineffective this may be mitigated by more frequent copulations just before egg laying according to a 2009 study which found that within pair copulation attempts peaked three to one days before first egg was laid and that more successful attempts during this period increased share of within pair young males had this latter finding contradicts those of a 1993 and a 1994 study extra pair paternity does not change level of parental care male contributes in tree swallow a significant number of extra pair fathers may be floaters those present at breeding grounds that presumably do not breed a 2001 study found that out of 35 extra pair nestlings 25 were sired by local residents three by residents of nearby sites and seven by male floaters in tree swallow floating thus helps males in good condition produce more chicks while allowing males in bad condition to be successful by investing in parental care there is also a significant population of female floaters a 1985 study estimated that around 23 to 27 of females were floaters of which about 47 to 79 were subadults how extra pair fathers are chosen and why females even breed with other males because they can control copulation is controversial one theory called genetic compatibility hypothesis states that increased offspring fitness results from increased heterozygosity and thus that female tree swallows would prefer to mate with males that have more different alleles from them this theory is justified on basis that young produced from extra pair mates usually are more heterozygous than within pair offspring further supporting this theory females are likely able to judge after copulation whether or not a male s sperm is of high quality and whether she should allow it to impregnate her another theory called good genes theory says that females choose extra pair males based on if they have good genes that would influence survival and mating success this is supported on basis that it is able to explain why some tree swallows do not have any extra pair young whereas others do although this is true there is criticism for a lack of phenotypic difference between extra pair males and pair bonded males but there are results that may be in support of this theory for example in a 2007 study it was found that increased plumage brightness and increased age in extra pair males together increased number of extra pair young another theory suggests that extra pair paternity is context dependent meaning that extra pair young outperform within pair young in certain situations whereas within pair young do better than extra pair young in other environments a 2017 study for example found that extra pair young were larger heavier and longer winged than within pair young when both were exposed to predator mounts while within pair young were heavier than extra pair young when they were shown non predator mounts this study also found that within pair young outperformed extra pair young in terms of life time fitness when they were raised in less variable environments suggesting that extra pair offspring have less developmental plasticity than within pair offspring a 2018 study weakly supported this context dependent hypothesis finding that extra pair offspring were more likely to fledge than within pair offspring in experimentally enlarged broods however there was no significant difference between two types in non enlarged broods and in terms of telomere length a correlate of survival and reproductive success and size 12 days after hatching studies attempting to prove adaptability of extra pair paternity for females have been criticized for lack of positive effect that increased offspring fitness would have when compared with potential cost of decreased fitness for female thus theories based on non adaptivity of extra pair paternity for females have been postulated these theories are based on genetic constraint where pleiotropic effects when an allele affects multiple phenotypes produce benefits to behaviours that are otherwise maladaptive theory of intersexual antagonistic pleiotropy says that strong selection for extra pair paternity in males as seen in this bird overrides weak selection against extra pair paternity in females hypothesis of intrasexual antagonistic pleiotropy meanwhile argues that extra pair paternity is present because genes regulating it have pleiotropic effects on aspects of female fitness like within pair copulation rate thumb right a tree swallow egg tree swallow lays a clutch of two to eight although usually four to seven pure white and translucent at laying eggs that measure about these eggs are incubated by female usually after second to last egg is laid for 11 to 20 days although most hatch after 14 to 15 days about 88 of nests produce at least one nestling although this is lowered by poor weather and a younger breeding female they hatch slightly asynchronously with an average of 28 hours between time first and final egg is laid laying order predicts hatching order eggs generally hatching in order they were laid when a brood hatches asynchronously a weight hierarchy is established nestlings hatched earlier weighing more than those hatched later this allows for female to prioritize which chick to give food to in times of food shortage although this weight difference is less pronounced about 12 days into nesting suggesting that this brood reduction only has a significant effect early in nestling period infanticide of chicks and eggs sometimes occurs when a male is replaced by another male infanticide usually does not occur when clutch is not complete as replacement males then have a chance to fertilize at least one egg when male arrives during incubation it sometimes commits infanticide but other times adopts eggs as there is a chance that some eggs were sired from replacement male if replacement male arrives after chicks hatch infanticide is usually committed though female will sometimes prevent this nests produced by females of better condition often have sex ratios skewed towards high quality males this is hypothesized to be because males have more variability in reproductive success thus meaning a female in better condition can produce a male in good condition that may have better reproductive success more than that of a female of similar condition growth of nestling tree swallows is influenced by their environment growth of younger nestlings those two to four days old is positively influenced by a higher maximum temperature and an older age and negatively influenced by a later hatching date in older nestlings those from nine to eleven days of age growth is positively influenced albeit to a lesser extent by a higher maximum temperature and more abundant insects and negatively influenced again to less effect by a later hatching date and an older age in terms of thermoregulation nestling tree swallows are able to thermoregulate at a capacity of 75 compared to adult at an average age of 9 5 days when out of nest and from nine to four days when in nest depending on size of brood these nestlings generally fledge after 18 to 22 days with about 80 fledging success like hatching success this value is reduced by unfavourable weather and a younger female chicks may be preyed on by snakes and raccoons this predation can be exacerbated by begging calls feeding thumb left flying in central new york us tree swallow forages up to above ground singly or in groups its flight is a mix of flapping and gliding during breeding season this is mostly within of nest site when it is foraging for nestlings though it usually goes up to from nest mostly staying in sight of it and forages at a height up to as well as being caught in flight insects are sometimes taken from ground water vegetation and vertical surfaces tree swallow eats mostly insects with some molluscs spiders and fruit in north america flies make up about 40 of diet supplemented with beetles and ants otherwise diet is about 90 flies insects taken are a mix of aquatic and terrestrial organisms former is an important source of omega 3 highly unsaturated fatty acids this is because although tree swallow can convert precursor a linolenic acid into high unsaturated fatty acids like acid it cannot do so in quantities needed seed and berry food is mainly from genus myrica which is mainly taken in all four of northern hemisphere seasons except summer crustaceans were also found to be important in wintering diet in a study on long island new york thumb right a chick being fed both sexes feed nestlings although male feeds chicks less than females resulting in about 10 to 20 feedings per hour parents often use chirp call to stimulate nestlings to beg this is used more frequently with younger chicks as they beg less than older chicks when parent arrives with food but does not call likelihood of begging in absence of parents also increases with age hatching order affects how much a chick is fed last hatched nestlings in cases where hatching is asynchronous are likely fed less than those hatched earlier nestlings closer to entrance of nest are also more likely to be fed as are those who beg first and more frequently overall rate at which a brood is fed also increases with more begging diet itself is composed mostly of insects those in orders diptera hemiptera and making up most of diet these insects are mostly up to in size but sometimes are up to in length in nests near lakes acidified by humans calcium supplements primarily fish bones crayfish exoskeletons clam shells and shells of bird eggs are harder to find this forces adult tree swallow to travel further than usual sometimes up to away from nest to get these calcium supplements survival tree swallow has an average lifespan of 2 7 years with a maximum of 12 years about 79 of individuals do not survive their first year and those that do survive face an annual mortality rate of 40 to 60 most deaths are likely result of cold weather which reduces insect availability leading to starvation this value is likely related to telomere length a 2005 study that used return rates to breeding site of previous year as a proxy for survival found that those with longest telomeres at one year of age had a predicted lifespan of 3 5 years compared to 1 2 years for those with shortest telomeres whether telomeres cause a reduction in fitness or are simply an indicator of it is unknown regardless a 2016 thesis found that measures of both condition and wing length were positively correlated with telomere length however it did not find a link between this last variable and return rates likely due to study conditions and samples used individuals with shorter telomeres may compensate for potential losses in fitness by increasing reproductive effort whereas those with longer telomeres may decrease their investment as evidenced by smaller proportion of chicks females with longer telomeres fledged telomere length is highly heritable with that of chick being especially well correlated with that of mother predation tree swallow is susceptible to a wide range of predators eggs nestlings and adults in nest fall victim to black rat snakes american crows american kestrels common grackles northern flickers chipmunks domestic cats weasels winkler d w k k d r robertson r j stutchbury b j r r 2011 poole a f ed tree swallow

great horned owls merlins peregrine falcons and sharp shinned hawks whilst evasive flight is usual response to predators in free flying swallows mobbing behavior is common around nest and is directed not just towards predators but also towards nest site competitors who might be scared off by it this behaviour involves swallow swarming and diving towards but not actually striking intruder from around above ground usually giving soft ticking calls near end and coming within about of predator it seems to alter intensity of its attacks based on which predator approaches a 1992 study found that ferrets elicited a more vigorous defence than black rat snakes and a 2019 thesis similarly discovered that black rat snake models were dived at least and eastern chipmunk models most it is suggested that snake prompted a weaker response because defence behaviours may be less effective and more dangerous against it parasites thumb blow fly in genus protocalliphora tree swallow is vulnerable to various parasites such as blood parasite trypanosoma it is also susceptible to flea ceratophyllus and feather mites and likely it is also probably afflicted by lice of genera brueelia and there is a correlation between number of fleas on a bird and number of young it is caring for this relationship is speculated to be a cause of an improved microclimate for fleas due to a larger clutch nestlings also suffer from parasites like blow flies of genus protocalliphora which results in a loss of blood by nestlings these parasites though do not seem to have a significant effect on nestlings and are found in a majority of nests a study published in 1992 found that only 5 5 of variation in nestling mass could be explained by effects of parasitism immunology in breeding female tree swallow humoral immunocompetence hic is inversely correlated with laying date this means that on average a bird that lays its eggs earlier has a stronger antibiotic response to an antigen than a bird that lays later a tree swallow that is handicapped by wing clipping generally has a lower hic these relationships could be interpreted as supporting conclusion that a female that lays earlier acquires a higher hic but authors of study that found correlations believed this unlikely instead they thought it showed that a better quality female is able to lay earlier due to that quality fact that a handicapped bird usually has a lower hic suggests that it is sensitive to increases in workload higher quality female tree swallows as measured by laying date are able to maintain their reproductive effort while diverting resources to fight an immune challenge lower quality swallows are less able to do so a 2005 study in ithaca new york found that late laying females with an artificially enlarged brood although able to maintain offspring quality had lower responses to an immune challenge than those that were of higher quality or did not have an enlarged brood whether a female chooses to prioritize offspring quality or immunocompetence is likely related to survival probabilities a 2005 study discovered that females with an enlarged brood in alaska where survival rates are lower had weaker immune responses but kept reproductive effort steady whereas those in tennessee with higher survival rates had a stronger response but lower quality offspring in tree swallow some components of immune system deteriorate with age acquired t cell mediated immunity for example declines with age in female tree swallow but age of a female does not affect both acquired and innate humoral immunity lack of deterioration in former contrasts with some other studies of passerines because of this a decrease in immune function with age older females infected with a disease can visit their nest less and this can have a more pronounced effect on growth of nestlings than an infection in a younger female older females are also likely to lose weight because of an infection status tree swallow is considered to be least concern by international union for conservation of nature this is due to bird s large range of about and its stable population estimated to be about 20 000 000 individuals it is protected in us by migratory bird treaty act of 1918 and in canada by migratory birds convention act in some parts of us range of this swallow has extended south likely due to changes in land use reintroduction of beavers and nestboxes installed for bluebirds tree swallow is negatively impacted by clearing of forests and reduction of marshes latter reducing habitat available for wintering this swallow has to compete for nest sites with common starling house sparrow both introduced to north america bluebirds and house wren which also destroys nests without occupying them acidification of lakes can force this swallow to go relatively long distances to find calcium rich items and can result in chicks eating plastic other chemicals like pesticides and other pollutants can become highly concentrated in eggs and pcbs are associated with abandonment of a pair s clutch effects of contamination can be exacerbated by unseasonable weather a 2006 study found that nestlings from wetlands most polluted by oil sands processing material were more than 10 times more likely to die than those from a control site during periods of synchronized cold temperatures and heavy rainfall compared to lack of difference in mortality between groups when weather was less extreme in another study birds exposed to mercury fledged on average one less chick than those not an effect amplified by warm weather
