first leg of tie took place in glasgow with celtic winning 3 1 courtesy of goals from jimmy johnstone and a willie wallace brace in respect of his opponents quality stein set up celtic to be ultra defensive for second leg and forsake temporarily their philosophy of attacking football tactics worked as celtic secured a 0 0 draw to put them in final stein however was almost apologetic about manner of celtic s success in that game and he felt uncomfortable in later years discussing matter final saw celtic play inter milan with match taking place at estadio nacional on outskirts of lisbon

constant attack after that but found inter goalkeeper giuliano sarti in outstanding form with 63 minutes played after incessant pressure celtic finally equalised when tommy gemmell scored with a powerful 25 yard shot balance of play remained constant with inter defending deeply against sustained celtic attacking with about five minutes remaining a long range shot from bobby murdoch was diverted by stevie chalmers past a wrong footed sarti it proved to be winning goal and thus celtic became first british team and first from outside spain portugal or italy to win competition cup

as celtic players lost their composure and discipline six players were sent off four from celtic and two from racing club with racing scoring only goal to win cup in a match described by reuters as a bar room brawl following two seasons in european cup were a disappointment for celtic going out to dynamo kyiv in first round in their defence of trophy in autumn of 1967 then reaching quarter finals following season only to lose their home leg against ac milan having achieved a credible no scoring draw in first game in italy earlier in season celtic set off a controversy in wake of soviet union s invasion of czechoslovakia in august 1968 at chairman robert kelly s behest club sent uefa a telegram condemning military action and expressing concern that any team from western europe having to play a tie in an eastern bloc country celtic s stance received support from several clubs throughout western europe although others such as leeds united publicly criticised celtic s intervention in response uefa redid draw for first round of european cup and european cup winners cup to avoid pairing eastern european sides with clubs from west this elicited a furious response from clubs and football authorities in east majority of whom withdrew in protest celtic reached european cup final again in 1970 celtic knocked out basel in first round then defeated portuguese side benfica 3 0 at parkhead in first leg of second round celtic s performance was impressive and they were unfortunate not to score more benfica rallied in return match and put celtic under intense pressure from start john fallon was outstanding in goal for celtic and with game nearing its end had limited score to 2 0 for portuguese side however scored direct from a free kick in final minute to level tie on aggregate and force extra time no further goals were scored in additional 30 minutes and tie was decided by toss of a coin captain billy mcneill successfully called and celtic progressed to quarter finals celtic were unhappy that tie had been decided in this manner and suggested to uefa an alternative of using a scoreline based on number of corners forced in extra time uefa rejected this proposal but soon afterwards introduced penalty kick shoot outs in european cup to decide drawn ties after extra time celtic went on to face italian champions fiorentina in quarter finals winning 3 1 on aggregate semi finals saw celtic drawn against english champions leeds united this was first occasion that reigning champions of england and scotland had played each other in a fully competitive

murdoch to score with a powerful shot sealing a 2 1 win for celtic on night and their progression to final final took place on 6 may 1970 at san siro in milan against dutch side feyenoord celtic were overwhelming favourites but despite tommy gemmell opening scoring after 30 minutes they were comprehensively outplayed by dutch side feyenoord manager ernst happel ensured jimmy johnstone was double

penalty celtic s first but fired his shot over crossbar italians scored all of their remaining penalties to eliminate celtic two years later in 1974 celtic again made a european cup semi final this

by england manager alf ramsey in first leg at parkhead atletico players continually kicked and hacked their opponents three atletico players were sent off but their incessant foul play made it impossible indeed physically dangerous for celtic to play their normal game match finished 0 0 and sour evening was completed with a punch up between two sets of players as they made their way up tunnel at full time in buildup for second leg in spain jimmy johnstone received a death threat over hotel phone and a hate campaign from spanish media prevented celtic players from relaxing or training effectively atletico won match 2 0 winning tie on aggregate and progressing to final against bayern munich where spanish side lost 4 0 after a replay decline mid to late 1970s saw a decline in celtic s european achievements with first round exits in european cup against olympiacos in 1974 and in uefa cup against wisla krakow in 1976 in between these very brief campaigns celtic reached quarter finals of cup winners cup in season 1975 76 but disappointingly were knocked out by east german side sachsenring zwickau whose play was unimpressive despite winning tie tie is best remembered for bizarre situation where young roy aitken had to be adopted by celtic to be allowed to enter east germany to play away leg at only 17 years old authorities there did not consider him to be an adult celtic s last european campaign under jock stein was again very short a second round exit against wacker innsbruck in 1977 78 european cup however in 1979 80 under former player and new manager billy mcneill they reached quarter finals of european cup celtic were drawn against real madrid and goals from george mccluskey and johnny doyle gave celtic a 2 0 win in first leg at parkhead goalkeeper

place two weeks later at santiago bernabeu stadium in front of approximately 120 000 fans johnny doyle missed an excellent chance to score early in first half and then just before half time santillana pulled a goal back for real uli stielike levelled tie in second half with a powerful volley past latchford before juanito added a third near end to send celtic out 3 2 on aggregate 1980s and 1990s

series of controversial matches in second round against rapid wien celtic lost first leg 1 3 in vienna but despite rough house tactics from austrians it was only celtic s alan who found himself red

and helsingborgs if celtic as fourth ranked seeds found themselves drawn in group g with barcelona benfica and spartak moscow on 2 october 2012 celtic achieved their first ever away win in group stages of champions league with a 3 2 win in russia over spartak moscow georgios samaras scoring winning goal in 90th minute celtic s home match with barcelona in november 2012 coincided with week of

muralla great wall celtic secured their progress to knock out stages of champions league on 5 december 2012 with a 2 1 home win over spartak moscow kris commons scoring winning goal in 82 minutes with a penalty celtic were drawn against juventus but succumbed to 5 0 aggregate defeat in spring of 2013 to go out of tournament despite emphatic scoreline over two legs celtic were not outclassed by their italian opponents in terms of general play but while juventus defended with a ruthless defiance celtic in contrast shipped their goals all far too easily despite result against juventus celtic and neil lennon won praise for their champions league campaign celtic began 2013 14 season with further champions league success in their sights celtic were drawn with cliftonville in their first qualifying round and easily disposed of northern irish champions 5 0 on aggregate they were next drawn with if elfsborg and squeezed by with a 1 0 aggregate win with kris commons scoring only goal in first leg at celtic park although favoured to qualify for group stages with minimal challenge after being drawn with kazakh champions shakhter karagandy celtic found themselves losing first leg in karagandy 2 0 celtic returned to scotland to an electric atmosphere at celtic park in home leg in what proved to be high point of their 2013 14 champions league campaign they overcame 2 0 deficit to level aggregate thanks to goals by kris commons and georgios samaras james forrest completed comeback for celtic with a 90th minute strike sending celtic park into a frenzy thereafter celtic found themselves drawn with ac milan ajax and again barcelona in group stage campaign was dismal winning only once with a 2 1 home win over ajax and slumping to a 6 1 rout away against barcelona in final group match that game saw celtic concede most goals they had ever done in a single european tie and equalled their previous heaviest defeat in europe a 5 0 loss to artmedia bratislava ronny deila s first competitive match in charge of celtic was a champions league qualifying tie away against kr reykjavik on 15 july 2014 which ended in a 1 0 win with midfielder callum mcgregor scoring decisive goal on 84 minutes celtic eased to a 4 0 win in return match in scotland but were comprehensively beaten and outplayed in next qualifying round losing 6 1 on aggregate to legia warsaw despite this celtic were given a reprieve when it was discovered that legia had fielded an ineligible player in second leg bartosz bereszynski coming on as a substitute in last four minutes uefa punished polish club by awarding game a 3 0 to celtic levelling aggregate score at 4 4 and seeing scottish champions progress on away goals despite this astonishing piece of luck celtic failed abjectly to take advantage in final qualifier against maribor losing 2 1 on aggregate to drop down to europa league celtic qualified from their europa league group they played inter milan in last 16 stage of europa league rallying to draw 3 3 at parkhead from an early 0 2 deficit in a pulsating encounter then losing 1 0 in milan to go out on aggregate despite a highly credible performance celtic began 2015 16 season again attempting to qualify for champions league they knocked out stjarnan from iceland and qarabag from azerbaijan in early qualifying rounds but lost 4 3 on aggregate to swedish side malmo ff in final play off round this meant for second successive season celtic dropped into europa league celtic s europa league campaign was poor and littered with individual errors which contributed to dropped points in every match celtic failed to qualify after finishing bottom of their group and was first time celtic went through a group stage of a european competition without recording a single victory brendan rodgers celtic s first competitive match under new manager brendan rodgers saw team lose 1 0 against gibraltarian minnows lincoln red imps in first leg of second round 2016 17 champions league qualifiers a result described by scotsman as a humiliation celtic won second leg 3 0 to progress on aggregate and went on to eliminate fc astana and hapoel be er sheva in subsequent qualifying rounds to progress into champions league group stages for first time since 2013 team s opening match in champions league proper on 13 september 2016 proved to be a humbling experience though as barcelona delivered a footballing lesson in a 7 0 rout club s heaviest ever european defeat and second heaviest in club s history a level of pride was restored in next champions league tie celtic holding manchester city to a 3 3 draw at celtic park with new signing moussa dembele scoring twice and ending high spending english club s run of 10 consecutive wins further draws away at borussia monchengladbach and in return match at manchester city saw celtic finish group on three points coming fourth and going out of europe celtic entered 2017 18 uefa champions league at 2nd qualifying round they defeated linfield 6 0 rosenborg 1 0 and astana 8 4 on aggregate to enter group stages celtic gained only three points over six games with a 3 0 away win their first european

knockout round of 32 in europa league where they were drawn against zenit saint petersburg celtic won first leg 1 0 after a late winner by callum mcgregor but succumbed to a disappointing 3 0 defeat in saint petersburg and were subsequently knocked out of competition celtic were eliminated from 2018 19 champions league qualifying phase by aek athens in penultimate round subsequently progressing to group stage of europa league where they were drawn alongside two clubs with strong links to red bull company rb leipzig and fc red bull salzburg along with rosenborg in opening round of fixtures celtic secured a narrow 1 0 home victory over norwegian champions through a header by leigh griffiths in closing minutes in doing so they achieved a win on matchday 1 for first time in fifteen group stage participations across two uefa competitions dating back to 2001 as well as a first group stage win at celtic park in eleven attempts since dinamo zagreb were beaten in 2014 celtic exchanged wins with rb leipzig and red bull salzburg defeated their sister team leipzig and celtic in both home and away ties rosenborg helped celtic to qualify from group despite scottish champions losing at home to salzburg norwegians scoring a late equaliser against leipzig in germany which put hoops ahead on points when they had been behind german side on tiebreak methods in last 32 they were drawn to face valencia with spanish side subsequently winning tie 3 0 on aggregate to knock celtic out return of neil lennon early rounds of 2019 20 champions league qualifying phase saw celtic ease past fk sarajevo and nomme kalju with comfortable aggregate victories however chaotic defending in following round against romanian champions cluj saw celtic lose 4 3 at home despite leading 2 1 and 3 2 at stages during second half to go out 5 4 on aggregate and drop down to play off round for europa league was particularly influential for romanians scoring twice and providing an assist for their
