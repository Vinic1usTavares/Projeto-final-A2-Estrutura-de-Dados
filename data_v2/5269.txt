crater lake klamath giiwas is a crater lake in south central oregon in western united states it is main feature of crater lake national park and is famous for its deep blue color and water clarity lake partly fills a nearly deep caldera that was formed around 7 700 150 years ago by collapse of volcano mount mazama there are no rivers flowing into or out of lake evaporation is compensated for by rain and snowfall at a rate such that total amount of water is replaced every 250 years with a depth of lake is deepest in united states in world it ranks ninth for maximum depth and third for mean average depth see further details in prose and citations of dimensions and depth crater lake features two small islands wizard island located near western shore of lake is a cinder cone approximately 316 acres 128 ha in size phantom ship a natural rock pillar is located near southern shore since 2002 one of state s regular issue license plate designs has featured crater lake and a one time plate surcharge is used to support operation of crater lake national park commemorative oregon state quarter which was released by united states mint in 2005 features an image of crater lake on its reverse lake and surrounding park areas offer many recreational activities including hiking biking snowshoeing fishing and cross country skiing are available and during summer campgrounds and lodges at crater lake are open to visitors location crater lake is in klamath county approximately northwest of county seat of klamath falls and about northeast of city of medford in june 1853 john wesley hillman became first non native american explorer to report sighting lake he named deep blue lake lake was renamed at least three times as blue lake lake majesty and finally crater lake thumb left upright 2

which fluctuates slightly as weather changes on basis of maximum depth crater lake is deepest lake in united states second deepest in north america after great slave lake in canada and ninth deepest lake in world crater lake is often cited as seventh deepest lake in world but this ranking excludes lake vostok in antarctica which is beneath about of ice and recent depth soundings of o higgins san martin lake which is along border of chile and argentina when considering mean or average depth of lakes crater lake becomes deepest lake in western hemisphere and third deepest in world crater lake institute director and owen hoffman states crater lake is deepest when compared on basis of average depth among lakes whose basins are entirely above sea level average depths of lakes baikal and tanganyika are deeper than crater lake however both have basins that extend below sea level geology thumb right 260px geologic map of lake floor thumb crater lake from space mount mazama part of cascade range volcanic arc was built up mostly of andesite dacite and rhyodacite over a period of at least 400 000 years caldera was created in a massive volcanic eruption between 6 000 and 8 000 years ago that led to subsidence of mount mazama about of rhyodacite was erupted in this event since that time all eruptions on mazama have been confined to caldera jewell and mcrae p 571 lava eruptions later created a central platform wizard island merriam cone and other smaller volcanic features including a rhyodacite dome that was eventually created atop central platform sediments and landslide debris also covered caldera floor eventually caldera cooled allowing rain and snow to accumulate and form a lake landslides from caldera rim thereafter formed debris fans and sediments on lake bed fumaroles and hot springs remained common and active during this period also after some time slopes of lake s caldera rim more or less stabilized streams restored a radial drainage pattern on mountain and dense forests began to revegetate barren landscape it is estimated that about 720 years was required to fill lake to its present depth of much of this occurred during a period when prevailing climate was less moist than at present some hydrothermal activity remains along lake floor suggesting that at some time in future mazama may erupt once again in 2008 scientists submerged a robot into lake to collect more geological information to compare to data obtained in 1980s scientists hypothesized that moss was about 6 000 years old by measuring age of pollen that blew into lake and mixed with sediment climate crater lake features a subalpine climate with rare dry summer type koppen classification dsc owing to its high elevation and like all of oregon strong summer influence of north pacific high in summer weather is mild and dry but in winter is cold and powerful influence of aleutian low allows for enormous snowfalls averaging per year and maximum snow cover averaging this snow does not usually melt until mid july and allows for substantial glaciers on adjacent mountains in winter of 1949 1950 as much as of snow fell while less complete snow cover records show cover as high as occurred during another particularly unsettled winter in 1981 1982 national oceanic and atmospheric administration climate at a glance oregon climate division 5 high plateau october

and average window for freezing temperatures is august 19 through july 7 while for measurable snowfall october 1 through june 15 surface temperatures of lake range between and in summer lake temperature falls between and ecology thumb right upright 1 69 panorama of crater lake and wizard island since collapse of mount mazama due to a volcanic eruption formed crater lake no fish inhabited lake until william g steel decided to stock it in 1888 to allow for fishing regular stocking continued until 1941 when it was evident that fish could maintain a stable population without outside interference six species of fish were originally stocked but only two species have survived kokanee salmon and rainbow trout with kokanee being most plentiful fishing in crater lake is promoted because fish species are not indigenous to lake crater lake is also known for old man of lake a full sized tree which is now a log that has been bobbing vertically in lake for over a century low temperature of water has slowed decomposition of wood hence its longevity in 1987 scientists sent a submersible down to depths of crater lake to obtain more information about geology at bottom of lake and inspect moss samples found in moss beds as deep as due to several unique factors mainly that lake has no inlets or tributaries waters of crater lake are some of purest in world because of absence of pollutants clarity readings from a secchi disk have consistently been in high 30 meter to mid 20 meter 80 to 115 foot range which is very clear for any natural body of water in 1997 scientists recorded a record clarity of lake has relatively high levels of dissolved salts total alkalinity and conductivity average ph has generally ranged between 7 and 8 sacred significance right thumb upright llao rock klamath tribe of native americans whose oral history describes their ancestors witnessing collapse of mount mazama and formation of crater lake regard lake as an abode to great spirit diller j s 1898 crater lake oregon klamath oral history tells of a battle between sky god and god of underworld llao a prominent feature at crater lake is llao rock mount mazama was destroyed in battle creating crater lake called giiwas in klamath language klamath people used crater lake in vision quests which often involved climbing caldera walls and other dangerous tasks those who were successful in such quests were often regarded as having more spiritual powers tribe still holds crater lake in high regard as a spiritual site recreation located north of city of klamath falls and northeast of medford crater lake can be reached from u s route 97 on east on southwest by highway 62 and on northwest by highway 138 crater lake and remnants of mount mazama can be seen from rim drive a road that surrounds caldera which is only part within crater lake national park where vehicles are permitted garfield peak trail which runs east from crater lake lodge offers views from above lake s surface with mount shasta visible southward another trail runs for from rim drive s eastern edge to mount scott which offers views of central and southern oregon such as three sisters located north of mazama and mount thielsen also to north cleetwood trail leads for down northern flank of caldera rim eventually reaching cleetwood cove where boat trips run from late june or early july throughout summer season to wizard island wizard island can be climbed offering views of crater lake swimming is permitted in crater lake but only way to safely and legally get to shore is by following cleetwood cove trail and people can enter water from there other activities include fishing and a 2 hour boat tour around lake provided by a park ranger from crater lake national park as region lies within a national park area collecting rocks within vicinity is prohibited unless a permit is obtained park s facilities lie at rim village at southern edge of caldera lodging and camping facilities open during summer season between may and october no lodges gas stations or camping areas remain open from october through late may popular activities within crater lake national park include biking fishing cross country skiing and snowshoeing see also list of lakes in oregon volcanic legacy scenic byway notes references fire mountains of west cascade and mono lake volcanoes stephen l harris
