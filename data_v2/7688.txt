watched program of week in australia episode was watched by 1 44 million viewers making laryngitis 15th most watched program of week critical response episode received mixed reviews from critics lisa respers france of cnn felt that laryngitis highlighted a trend of glee storylines becoming progressively sadder rather than comedic she wrote that plotlines came across as lecturing and concluded i still heart glee which is clearly one of best shows on television right now i just think they may want to lighten life lessons a bit or spread them out more over several episodes rather than us all at once henrik batallones of buddytv wrote that he was uncertain what to make of episode noting sure there were some high points and it was a pretty enjoyable watch but unlike last few episodes this one left me a little high and dry batallones observed that sean storyline felt totally forced into episode making rachel s epiphany very forced and unnatural entertainment weekly darren franich was also troubled by storyline noting it seems like height of vanity to basically use this storyline to teach rachel an important lesson about being herself glee has used disabled actors before and i think it s worth debating whether show honors that or uses it shamelessly emily vanderwerff of a v club graded episode b while she had been disappointed with several episodes since show s mid season break vanderwerff noted glee still has its inconsistencies but it s getting back to show i so enjoyed last fall she wrote of sean storyline that it should feel offensive but mostly skates away from actually being so because it treats paralyzed character with a great deal of respect bobby hankinson of houston chronicle also noted that he had been underwhelmed with show since its return but loved laryngitis writing story focused exclusively on kids not mr shue or sue sylvester and performances were realistically small scale all that classic glee charm came washing over me once more and it was glorious gerrick d kennedy of los angeles times similarly stated when glee is at its best you get episodes like this week s there were no gimmicks no over top productions no unnecessary stars it was just great storytelling and superb finger snapping music vanity fair brett berk deemed laryngitis a truly successful episode but also highlighted show s inconsistency in quality since its return james poniewozik of time called laryngitis first episode of glee since its mid season break that he enjoyed mostly without reservation eric goldman of ign rated episode 8 8 10 deeming it one of his favorite
