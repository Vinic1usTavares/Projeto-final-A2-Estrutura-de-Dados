p 63 it was produced in co operation with philips media susan brand studios handled art and animation other companies involved in development included r ga interactive s parent company r ga digital studios and elias associates windows and mac os versions were released in june 1996 a super nintendo entertainment system snes version was developed and scheduled for late 1996 but never released game took 18 months to develop early in design process designers were able to create new toys and tweak their attributes using a playable prototype prototype had menus that showed statistics for each toy alterations took effect immediately allowing designers to see what effect a change would have even during a game there was an iterative game testing process that assisted in balancing game an important aspect of game s design was interaction between toys due to discovery of effective toy combinations zimmerman and lantz coined term engine to describe them engines were given names including punching roaches bomb shield and perpetual motion toy attributes were set to make certain engines possible although most were discovered as development progressed artificial intelligence ai included engine based heuristics so ai was aware of advantageous combinations engines were not written into game s rules but were playing patterns that arose from attributes that defined toys during testing zimmerman and lantz kept increasing difficulty so game would challenge them and at one point made game too difficult reception gearheads received mixed reviews reviewers praised game s addictiveness visuals and entertainment value but were conflicted over sound and music pc zone lauded game s addictiveness saying it features planning aspects of tetris and plenty of options including bizarre powerups another reviewer who found game addictive wrote in computer gaming world that this was due to its eclectic cast of characters michael bertrand of gamer s zone also agreed game was addictive steve wartofsky of computer games strategy plus said that gearheads is just what it claims to be a furious war of wind up toys computer gaming world agreed with this view of its entertainment value describing game as hilarious and addictive pc teams reviewers called game great fun and liked gameplay s facility these sentiments were echoed by garrett rowe of irish times who said multiplayer mode s fun factor was endless and chaotic critics thought highly of graphics pc gamers dean evans believed they were pretty this sentiment was echoed by other reviewers including bob strauss of

those of mike mcgrath of coming soon magazine who commented that game is far too mindless describing sound and music as annoying michael bertrand of gamer s zone also criticised sound and music as repetitive and disliked that game only has four arenas pc gamers dean evans believed that gearheads has a childish nature and is dull and overpriced bob strauss of entertainment weeklys criticism was difficulty of controlling game with a keyboard due to speed of action another complaint came from gamepros air hendrix who criticised artificial intelligence as moronic concept was found to be uninteresting for hardcore gamers by joysticks reviewers and one was not optimistic about game s life span generation 4 cited inability to increase size of game board as a fault hendrix of gamepro reviewed snes version and said graphics were colourful and humorous it was criticised by electronic gaming monthly for having a lack of strategic depth references sources external links eric zimmerman
