first full episode of show that daniels wrote simpsons writers al jean and mike reiss who were show runners during previous two seasons came up with idea for episode they left idea with david mirkin who took over job as show runner during this season mirkin said he was very excited and intrigued with idea of episode soon thereafter he assigned daniels to write script because he knew that daniels would step up and throw himself into it in an interview with chicago tribune mirkin stated that when he took over show he wanted to bring it back to character and story unlike previous season which got so fast moving and so full of cutaway gags mirkin added i explored characters a little more took them a little further i had one of first episodes where homer was really tempted by another woman last temptation of homer and bart having a girlfriend even nastier than himself bart s girlfriend plus more of a focus on side characters we did first episode to really feature apu as a main character those were my goals kirkland said he was grateful that he got to work with a wonderful crew on episode including bob anderson who he thought was a wonderful director kirkland said that anderson assisted him on episode and did fine animation throughout when mirkin took over as show runner he listed actor james woods as one of people he would most like to guest star on show michael caine was originally supposed to be actor in episode who takes over apu s job at kwik e mart but he rejected role story was therefore rewritten so that woods received apu s job instead when season was in production producer bill oakley wrote on online fan forum alt tv simpsons that david bowie was being considered for guest role in this episode woods was one of animation director david silverman s favorite guest stars mirkin said he provided one of most fantastic performances ever on show and commented that he nailed all of his lines and was so funny right at top of his head mirkin said that when most guest stars come in to record their lines for show they are a little nervous because they have never done voice over before mirkin noted however that woods was a fearless guy and he was so excited to do it because he was a huge fan of show silverman noted that in addition to his humorous ad libbing woods s tendency to hesitate while speaking was great for animation explaining that it made character feel more realistic homer and apu features popular simpsons song who needs kwik e mart sung by apu and simpson family song was written by all of show s writers in writer s room and it was composed by alf clausen song later appeared on soundtrack album songs in key of springfield which was released on march 18 1997 and compiled many musical numbers from show cultural references episode features cultural references to many american and british films woods becoming a convenience store clerk to prepare for a film is similar to nick lang michael j fox becoming a police officer in 1991 film hard way which woods also starred in this is a reversal of roles woods played cop that lang was saddled with in film when kent asks homer if he is willing to go undercover to nail apu homer replies no way man get yourself another patsy this is a reference to a line in 1991 film jfk scene of homer and apu riding on mules to springfield airport with their luggage strapped to mules backs is similar to a scene from 1962 film lawrence of arabia in his kwik e mart job interview interviewer asks woods why he would want to work at kwik e mart to which he replies to be honest in my upcoming movie i m going to be playing this tightly wound convenience store clerk and i kind of like to research my roles and really get into it for instance in true believer i actually worked in a law firm for two months and then film chaplin i had a little cameo in that i actually traveled back in time back to twenties where well i ve said too much referencing 1989 film true believer and 1992

a score of 5 out of 5 analysis episode has become study material for sociology courses at university of california berkeley where it is used to examine issues of production and reception of cultural objects in book leaving springfield duncan beard said episode served as a parody of peculiarities of american convenience store beard particularly cited muzak and bell as homer and apu entered kwik e mart in india and sign that read master knows all except combination to safe beard said here show presents its own instance of global culture of consumer capitalism transplanted intact and unaltered from suburbs of america to a mountain top in some indefinable region of post partitioned commonwealth nation of india purely for purpose of parodically criticizing banality of quick stop stores paul cantor who analyzed episode in his book gilligan unbound pop culture in age of globalization said simpsons could offer no better image of bizarre logic of contemporary globalization than a worldwide convenience store empire run by an enlightened guru from sacred mountains of india cantor also specifically cited master knows sign which he said combined perceived wisdom of east with business acumen of west shakur and karen d souza write in their book picturing south asian culture in english that homer and apu typifies key articulation of character of apu juxtaposed to homer something like his alter ego where homer is all american duff drinking rather lazy nuclear plant worker and apu is immigrant clean living hard working small businessman their friendship authors added is typically of a strong degree of mutual respect and a kind of admiration for what other represents references external links homer and apu at simpsons com category simpsons season 5 episodes category 1994 american
