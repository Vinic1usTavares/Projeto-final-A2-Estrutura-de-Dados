bay freeway also referred to as mercer street connection was a proposed elevated freeway in south lake union neighborhood of seattle washington freeway would have run parallel to a section of mercer street between interstate 5 i 5 and aurora avenue north at seattle center planning for freeway began in 1954 with proposal for a freeway from elliott bay to central freeway later i 5 via broad and mercer streets added to city s comprehensive plan in 1957 funded by a bond measure passed by seattle voters in 1960 plans were drawn for newly renamed bay freeway to serve a multi purpose stadium at seattle center via an elevated structure citizen groups voiced their opposition to project at public hearings in 1967 forcing seattle engineering department to consider other designs after determining that a cut and cover tunnel would not be feasible a second series of public hearings to discuss impact of an elevated option were held in 1970 leading to widespread controversy and a civil suit launched in opposition to freeway lawsuit ended in november 1971 with a king county superior court judge ruling that a major deviation from voter approved 1960 plan occurred forcing a referendum to be held on whether to continue project on february 8 1972 bay freeway project was rejected by a 10 000 vote margin in a municipal referendum alongside repeal of r h thomson expressway mercer street would later undergo several projects that attempted to provide congestion relief promised by rejected freeway culminating in mercer corridor project in 2012 which widened street into a boulevard route description thumb left i 5 s interchange with mercer street proposed eastern terminus of bay freeway under construction in 1962 bay freeway as proposed in 1972 would have been a six lane elevated freeway on a curved box beam bridge measuring at its widest point freeway would have begun at seattle center in lower queen anne as through lanes for broad street under aurora avenue north roadway would have immediately merged with ramps connecting to roy and mercer couplet and to a parking garage for a multipurpose domed stadium later relocated and built south of downtown in 1976 to form bay freeway lanes then would have then turned southeastward next to a park on lake union passing only over westlake avenue north and over fairview avenue north before splitting into ramps at an interchange with i 5 valley street located north of planned right of way was to be moved under bay freeway structure and replaced with additional park space earlier plans called for an extension traveling southwest on broad street through belltown including a tunnel between 5th avenue and denny way to proposed northwest expressway and an extension of existing alaskan way viaduct on elliott bay waterfront extension was deferred in 1969 but remained a possible future plan until entire project was canceled history mercer street expansion city of seattle began planning for bay freeway in 1954 with planning studies determining that broad and mercer streets should become northern east west link of proposed downtown freeway system seattle city council adopted city s comprehensive plan in 1957 proposing a major highway in vicinity of broad and mercer streets from northwest expressway along elliott bay to central freeway at foot of capitol hill in anticipation of bay freeway underpasses of aurora avenue north on broad and mercer streets were completed in july 1958 using funds from a 1954 bond issue for construction of arterial roadways a special municipal election concerning a 26 6 million bond measure for traffic improvement was held on march 8 1960 passed by 71 000 of 109 000 voters in king county funds matched by 31 million from state of washington and federal government were

center grounds from april to october 1962 generating heavy traffic equivalent to rush hour loads on mercer street where a city owned 1 500 stall parking garage was located use of mercer street as one of primary routes to fairgrounds and its selection as one of sites for a proposed multi purpose stadium convinced city officials that construction of bay freeway was a necessity mercer exit on i 5 was partially opened in november 1963 with northbound ramps open to traffic and southbound ramps remaining closed until 1968 a design team led by perry johanson was formed in 1966 for bay freeway project intending to blend freeway with its surroundings and encourage mixed use development to lower its impact on south lake union neighborhood first public hearing on project was held by seattle city council on february 17 1967 where city engineer roy morse said that mercer mess would be solved with opening of bay freeway in 1969 three proposed elevated alternatives were criticized by public and local architects ibsen nelsen and victor for blocking views of lake union forcing morse to reconsider subsurface designs despite his declaration that a depressed roadway with freeway would require excessively steep traffic grades freeway proposals thumb right a map of elevated option for bay freeway subject to public hearings in 1970 project was officially designated bay freeway by seattle city council on april 12 1967 as part of an ordinance that also renamed part of state route 99 to alaskan freeway and officially named proposed r h thomson expressway as thomson freeway during second

cover tunnel was rejected because of its 16 million cost steep grades and larger disruption of local businesses and railroads seattle center was selected as preferred site of multi purpose domed stadium in 1968 assuming that bay freeway was built to prevent event congestion forcing project to be redesigned for next two years design report for bay freeway project was published on february 10

seattle center five additional public hearings were held by seattle city council in 1970 as support for r h thomson expressway and other proposed freeways were subject of highway revolts similar to those in other american cities during april hearing former state department of highways director charles spoke out against bay freeway and predicted that it would cause traffic to back up onto i 5 during rush hour voters rejected a forward thrust initiative that would have built proposed domed stadium at seattle center on may 19 removing one of main reasons to build freeway and forcing city council to consider scaling down proposal june hearing resulted in removal of r h thomson freeway from comprehensive plan as well as widening of bay freeway to six lanes to support an expected 2 610

acquisition began following march with 6 million appropriated to purchase and condemn properties on seven blocks between mercer and valley streets civil suit and special election thumb a model of elevated bay freeway option produced for a public hearing 6 lane proposal caused several opposition groups led by citizens against r h thomson carht to launch a civil suit to halt further planning for bay freeway two citizens groups opposed what they claimed was improper planning and financing described as a series of shortcut procedures and hearings to give design rubber stamp approval and that project did not conform to voter approved 1960 proposal for a mercer street connection carht was named plaintiff in case using funds largely from an anonymous single donor that were originally meant for opposing r h thomson expressway on november 3 1971 king county superior court judge solie m ruled in favor of opposition and prohibited city from moving forward with bay freeway project citing

date in early 1975 a rapid transit alternative was deemed not probable in near future for corridor though express bus service was considered a depressed roadway was rejected outright as it could only achieve a grade of 6 at required a larger amount of right of way acquisition and relocation of utilities and it was located below water table making it too expensive to be feasible referendum 1 which sought approval of bay freeway was rejected by a margin of 52 748 to 42 502 on february 8 1972 effectively cancelling project in aftermath of vote opponents of project urged city council to look into alternate solutions for mercer street mess seattle city council officially terminated bay freeway project by passing an ordinance on may 1 1972 to halt condemnation proceedings related to properties

particularly in serving freight traffic near industrial district seattle mayor wes uhlman predicted that congestion on mercer street would continue to worsen stating that there is no real alternative to bay freeway criticizing rejection as a part of a nationwide reaction to freeways and concrete mercer street had previously been split into a couplet with westbound traffic diverted to valley street one block north as a temporary solution to seattle center congestion in 1968 between then and 1990 city of seattle has had 58 studies proposing various methods of reducing congestion on mercer street
