michael viii palaiologos or palaeologus 1223 11 december 1282 reigned as co emperor of empire of nicaea from 1259 to 1261 and as byzantine emperor from 1261 until his death michael viii was founder of palaiologan dynasty that would rule byzantine empire until fall of constantinople in 1453 he recovered constantinople from latin empire in 1261 and transformed empire of nicaea into a restored byzantine empire his reign would see considerable recovery of byzantine power including enlargement of byzantine army and navy it would also include reconstruction of city of constantinople and increase of its population he reestablished university of constantinople which would lead to what is regarded as renaissance during 14th and 15th centuries it would also be at this time that focus of byzantine military shifted to balkans against bulgarians leaving anatolian frontier neglected his successors would also not fix this issue and byzantine civil war made this situation much worse draining empire s strength economy and resources these internal conflicts lead to permanent losses of important provinces such as epirus to serbian empire eventually consequences of these conflicts would allow for anatolian beyliks to rise in power most notably one of osman later called ottoman empire his successors would conquer more parts of empire until finally city of constantinople itself in 1453 under leadership of mehmed ii road to throne michael viii palaiologos was son of megas domestikos andronikos palaiologos by theodora angelina palaiologina granddaughter of emperor alexios iii angelos and euphrosyne doukaina according to deno john geanakoplos michael s ancestry could be traced back to all three imperial houses that ruled empire in centuries before capture of constantinople in 1204 by fourth crusade geanakoplos emperor michael palaeologus and west harvard university press 1959 p 17 his mother does not appear to have played a significant role in his early life at least for a time he was brought up by his elder sister martha wife of megas domestikos nikephoros tarchaneiotes although she was only ten years older than him geanakoplos michael palaeologus pp 18f michael rose to distinction at an early age serving as governor of thracian towns of melnik and serres under command of his father andronikos however in autumn of 1253 michael was accused before emperor john iii vatatzes of plotting against throne only way michael was allowed to prove his innocence was through trial by ordeal holding a red hot iron when emperor ordered him to take hold of red hot metal young michael answered to use geanakoplos words with astuteness that was to characterize his later career as emperor if metropolitan phokas of philadelphia who evidently supported this proposal could take iron from altar with his own hands and place it in michael s he would gladly receive it in faith that truth would be revealed geanakoplos michael palaeologus pp although michael avoided punishment and afterwards was married to emperor s granddaughter and appointed megas konostaulos of latin mercenaries in employment of emperors of nicaea he was still mistrusted following death of john vatatzes michael crossed river with a few close friends and took service with seljuk sultanate of rum from late 1256 to 1258 he served as commander of christian mercenaries fighting for sultan kaykaus ii in that later year emperor theodore ii doukas laskaris recalled michael and after both exchanged oaths of loyalty and guarantees of safety michael returned to service of emperor geanakoplos michael palaeologus pp 26 30 a few days after death of emperor theodore laskaris in 1258 michael palaiologos instigated a coup against influential bureaucrat george mouzalon seizing from him guardianship of eight year old emperor john iv doukas laskaris michael was invested with titles of megas doux and in november 1258 of despotes on 1 january 1259 michael viii palaiologos was proclaimed co emperor at nymphaion geanakoplos michael palaeologus pp 39 46 constantinople thumb michael palaiologos in 1259 michael viii defeated alliance of william of villehardouin prince of achaea and michael ii komnenos doukas of epirus at battle of pelagonia according to geanakoplos i n period immediately preceding nicene reconquest of constantinople in 1261 no event was of greater importance than michael palaeologus victory at pelagonia geanakoplos michael palaeologus p 47 this not only neutralized for immediate time possibility of an attack from enemies on his western borders but also improved michael s legitimacy by showing him as a competent leader a detailed account and analysis of battle of pelagonia can be found in deno john geanakoplos greco latin relations on eve of byzantine restoration battle of pelagonia 1259 dumbarton oaks papers 7 1953 pp 99 141 geanakoplos chapter in his michael palaeologus offers little new on his earlier paper despite this brilliant victory only one event could remove stigma of usurper completely from eyes of his subjects recovery of constantinople itself in 1260 michael personally led an unsuccessful attempt to capture city rumors of reinforcements for beleaguered city forced michael to sign a one year truce with latin emperor baldwin ii that august geanakoplos michael palaeologus p 78 realizing that he needed a navy to effectively besiege constantinople michael concluded treaty of nymphaeum with genoa in march of following year genoese help proved to be unneeded when michael viii s general alexios strategopoulos captured constantinople from baldwin ii through treachery on 25 july 1261 news of captured city first reached michael s sister eulogia who awoke her brother at dawn he was not convinced until a messenger arrived from strategopoulos bearing crown and sword baldwin had abandoned in his flight from his palace geanakoplos michael palaeologus p 119 michael viii entered city on 15 august and had himself crowned together with his infant son andronikos ii palaiologos once in control of constantinople michael abolished all latin customs and reinstated most byzantine ceremonies and institutions as they had existed before fourth crusade he repopulated capital building its population from when he took power to by end of his reign and restored damaged churches monasteries and public buildings he was acutely aware of danger posed by possibility that latin west particularly his neighbors in italy would unite against him and attempt restoration of latin rule in constantinople in december john iv who had been left behind at nicaea was blinded and relegated to a monastery after rendering him ineligible for throne michael viii quickly married off john s sisters to two italians and a bulgarian noble so their descendants could not threaten his own children s claim to imperial succession although michael tried to keep blinding of john a secret news eventually leaked out and patriarch arsenios autoreianos excommunicated michael viii this ban was not lifted until six years later 1268 on appointment of patriarch joseph i donald nicol last centuries of byzantium 1261 1453 second edition cambridge university press 1993 pp diplomacy and conquest in words of geanaklopos with fall of constantinople papacy suffered not only a loss of political prestige but severe damage to its spiritual authority as well for greeks had now effectively reasserted their right to a church divorced from rome thus it became task of each of six successive popes of michael s reign to accomplish return of schismatics to roman fold geanakoplos michael palaeologus p 140 michael was aware of immense influence curia had in west so he immediately dispatched an embassy to pope urban iv consisting of two envoys upon reaching italy men were seized and one was flayed alive while other succeeded in escaping back to friendlier territories geanakoplos michael palaeologus pp thumb left imperial eagle in mystras in 1263 latins ceded mystras as ransom for william ii of villehardouin and michael viii palaeologus made city seat of new despotate of morea ruled by his relatives michael also approached manfred of sicily to achieve some kind of accord in summer of 1262 michael offered to divorce his wife theodora and marry manfred s sister anna this offer failed spectacularly not only did anna reject his proposal theodora turned to patriarch arsenios for help patriarch confronted emperor and pressured him to abandon his plans michael yielded and sent anna back to her brother with gifts this gesture helped to secure release of his general alexios strategopoulos geanakoplos michael palaeologus pp it was around this time that michael was presented with a dangerous distraction izz ad din who had been deposed as sultan of seljuk turks by a coalition led by pervane mu in al din suleyman arrived seeking help from his old friend but as claude cahen notes he was to be cruelly disappointed michael favored mongols of iran who supported izz ad din s enemy pervane against those of russia further he could not risk a war on his asian frontier while western europe infinitely more dangerous was opposed to him cahen believes that either izz ad din became an embarrassment or perhaps former sultan indulged in too open of criticism in either case izz ad din was imprisoned mongol troops from russia eventually freed him and carried him off to crimea where he lived out his life cahen pre ottoman turkey a general survey of material and spiritual culture and history trans j jones williams 1968 new york american council of learned societies 2004 p 279 a series of military setbacks followed in 1263 michael sent men including seljuk mercenaries to morea with goal of conquering principality of achaea but this expedition failed in a surprise rout at later that year a mixed fleet of 48 imperial and genoese ships was defeated by a smaller venetian force at battle of settepozzi following year imperial forces in morea were again defeated at after seljuk mercenaries who had not been paid changed sides geanakoplos michael palaeologus pp 151 60 nadir of michael s disasters came in spring of 1265 when an army of tatars and bulgars under nogai khan ravaging thrace ambushed michael when he was returning to constantinople accompanied by only a few troops deserted by even his own officers who fled to save their own lives michael was able to escape by crossing mountains and reaching marmora coast where he happened upon two latin ships he quickly boarded vessels and two days later safely arrived at constantinople thus did michael survive one of narrowest escapes of his career notes geanakoplos geanakoplos michael palaeologus pp military advantages michael enjoyed after capturing constantinople had evaporated but he would demonstrate his diplomatic skills to successfully recover from these drawbacks after settepozzi michael viii dismissed 60 genoese galleys that he had hired earlier and began a rapprochement with venice michael secretly negotiated a treaty with venetians to grant terms similar to those in case of nymphaeum but doge raniero zeno failed to ratify agreement geanakoplos michael palaeologus pp 182 85 he also signed a treaty in 1263 with egyptian mamluk sultan baibars and berke mongol khan of kipchak khanate cambridge illustrated history of middle ages 1250 1520 p 304 michael and charles of anjou thumb restored byzantine empire in 1265 william r shepherd historical atlas 1911 battle of benevento on 26 february 1266 brought forth a new challenger to michael one with whom he would struggle for rest of his life charles of anjou michael as geanaklopos emphasizes from 1266 until shortly before his death in 1282 was constrained to devote almost complete attention to defeat of charles fulfillment of whose ambition would have brought about destruction of byzantine empire and of latin rule in constantinople geanakoplos michael palaeologus pp charles strengthened his hold on kingdom of sicily by defeating at battle of tagliacozzo on 23 august 1268 and looking for help to restore latin empire on may 1267 charles concluded treaty of viterbo with exiled baldwin ii of constantinople and william ii villehardouin under guidance of pope clement iv geanaklopos michael palaeologus pp 195 200 in many ways michael and charles were alike geanakoplos quotes nicephorus gregoras s comparison of two men at length michael was also faced with a challenge on his asian frontier although peace treaty with seljuk turks continued to be honored by both parties nomadic turkmen had begun to infiltrate byzantine territories and because of michael s preoccupation with his western foes there was no organized response to this threat vryonis also points out that due to his treatment of john iv laskaris there resulted an outright alienation from constantinople of large segments of greek society in bithynia and elsewhere vryonis decline of medieval hellenism in asia minor and process of islamization from eleventh through fifteenth century berkeley university of california 1971 p 136 in 1269 michael sent his brother despotes john palaiologos into southern part of byzantine anatolia to clear maeander and valleys of turkmen their response was to fall back before byzantine army and when he was eventually recalled to face foes in europe turkmen pushed back and resumed their conquests and settlement thus by 1269 cities of studia and on carian coast were firmly turkish possessions vryonis decline of medieval hellenism pp michael s response to treaty of viterbo was to attempt to weaken papal support for it if pope was convinced charles of anjou s invasion was a just and holy war then forces michael could call on could not prevent its success michael returned to negotiating a union of churches with pope clement iv which he had allowed to but latter s death in november 1268 put an end to this approach according to geanakoplos only a lack of resources prevented charles from immediately launching an attack against michael geanakoplos michael palaeologus p 216 looking for some restraint on charles michael made a shrewd appeal to leading ruler of west king louis ix of france and elder brother of charles louis was more interested in a crusade against muslims controlling holy land than a schismatic christian so he convinced charles to accompany him on his tunisian crusade in 1270 so when king louis died 24 august 1270 charles came into control of french forces after negotiating a peace with emir of tunis charles sailed with his troops to port of trapani in sicily at last able to attack byzantium unblocked by any man at this point a miracle saved michael a violent storm arose 22 november that practically demolished entire fleet to greeks of byzantium writes geanakoplos it must have seemed as if virgin their protector had saved them from disaster geanakoplos michael palaeologus p 228 after a three year interregnum during which charles of anjou attempted to sway election a new pope was elected gregory x when michael restarted talks of union gregory proved to be less accommodating and negotiated from a position of strength michael attempted to reason with patriarch joseph and synod of importance of agreeing to this union and that principle of which geanakoplos suggests is best translated here as considerations of self interest required them to accede to papal demands but despite a propaganda campaign over winter of 1274 1275 michael was forced to depose patriarch joseph and replace him with his own supporter john in order to obtain a grudging consent to union nicol last centuries p 56 council of lyons and after thumb coin of michael viii depicting virgin mary rising over walls of constantinople in commemoration of capture of city over latins byzantine envoys presented themselves at second council of lyons 24 june 1274 where they presented a letter from emperor sealed with imperial golden bull and two others from his son andronikos and byzantine clergy on fourth session of council formal act of union was performed letters were read and for first time in two centuries representatives of major eastern and western branches of christianity were again in communion geanakoplos michael palaeologus pp 258 264 michael viii achieved an important advantage by this union for now he gained legitimacy both for possessing constantinople and for his claims to lands occupied by western invaders further his antagonist charles could not rely on power of pope calling for a crusade against his realm geanakoplos michael palaeologus p 278 lastly pope gregory was very favorable to michael s proposal for a crusade against turks to restore ancient christian cities of anatolia however with gregory s death january 1276 these plans remained nothing more than talk geanakoplos michael palaeologus pp 286 290 more disappointments followed as news of council filtered through former byzantine territories while union was opposed at all levels of society it was especially opposed by greater populace led by monks and adherents of deposed patriarch arsenios known as one of chief anti unionist leaders was michael s own sister eulogia aka irene who fled to court of her daughter maria palaiologina kantakouzene tsarina of bulgars from where she intrigued unsuccessfully against michael more serious was opposition of sons of michael of epirus nikephoros i komnenos doukas and his half brother john bastard they posed as defenders of orthodoxy and gave support to anti unionists fleeing constantinople michael at first responded with comparative leniency hoping to win anti unionists through persuasion but eventually virulence of protests led him to resort to force many anti unionists were blinded or exiled two prominent monks meletios and ignatios were punished first had his tongue cut out second was blinded even imperial officials were harshly treated and death penalty was decreed even for simply reading or possessing pamphlets directed against emperor geanakoplos michael palaeologus pp 264 275 from intensity of these disorders tantamount almost to civil wars concludes geanakoplos it might appear that too great a price had been paid for sake of union geanakoplos michael palaeologus p 276 religious situation only worsened for michael party found widespread support amongst discontented in anatolian provinces and michael responded there with similar viciousness according to vryonis these elements were either removed from armies or else alienated they deserted to turks vryonis decline of medieval hellenism p 136 another attempt to clear encroaching turkmen from valley in 1278 found limited success but antioch on maeander was irretrievably lost as were tralles and nyssa four years later vryonis decline of medieval hellenism p 137 on 1 may 1277 john bastard convoked a synod at neopatras that anathematized emperor patriarch and pope as heretics geanakoplos michael palaeologus p 275 in response a synod was convoked at hagia sophia on 16 july where both nikephoros and john were anathematized in return john called a final synod at neopatras in december 1277 where an anti unionist council of eight bishops a few abbots and one hundred monks again anathematized emperor patriarch and pope geanakoplos michael palaeologus p 309 michael s achievements on battlefield were more positive although still mixed he tried to take advantage of a civil war in bulgaria in late 1270s but byzantine armies suffered several major defeats at hands of peasant emperor emperor managed to temporarily impose his son in law ivan asen iii on bulgarian throne but after byzantine defeat at he had to flee however michael viii later managed to conquer bulgarian portion of thrace while internal situation of bulgarian empire remained unstable in 1275 michael viii sent an army against thessaly and fleet of 73 ships to harass latin states in greece army was crushingly defeated at battle of neopatras but fleet won a similarly comprehensive victory at battle of demetrias last was his victory over charles of anjou in western greece charles general hugh of sully with 8 000 men including 2 000 cavalry captured butrinto in 1280 and besieged berat a byzantine army of relief under michael tarchaneiotes arrived in march 1281 hugh of sully was ambushed and captured and his army put to flight geanaklopos considers that most scholars do not appreciate fully importance of this victory this victory marked complete failure of attempt to launch a land expedition against capital thus charles had to shift his strategy to a sea attack against constantinople geanakoplos michael palaeologus p 334 sicilian vespers thumb gold hyperpyron

describes as blindly subservient to charles of anjou geanakoplos michael palaeologus p 340 once again charles had no clear brake on his ambitions to conquer constantinople and he moved swiftly to prepare for this new offensive one early move was taken by pope martin who on 18 october 1281 excommunicated michael without any warning or provocation thus disrupting union of lyons geanakoplos michael palaeologus p 341 charles had prepared a military force far larger than michael could muster according to marino sanudo charles had 100 ships in sicily and 300 more in naples provence and his greek territories which were to carry no less than 8 000 cavalrymen geanakoplos cites surviving documents that attest to supplies charles had accumulated one angevin rescript dated 28 october 1281 lists a collection of tools to be gathered for expedition which includes two thousand iron mattocks three thousand iron stakes sledges for smashing rocks ropes iron shovels axes and kettles for boiling pitch another orders delivery of four thousand iron stakes that are under construction in venice a third consists of instructions to a pisan merchant for 2 500 shields of various sizes all to

as well as rulers of epirus and dissidents of byzantine empire and leading naval power of europe venice geanakoplos michael palaeologus pp obviously michael sought allies against charles of anjou but

more welcoming for he had his own reasons to hate charles according to geanakoplos peter s wife constance was daughter of manfred and for this reason peter considered charles a usurper and sicily rightful property of constance peter welcomed refugees from sicily most notably john of procida whom he made secretary of royal chancery geanakoplos michael palaeologus pp yet aragon was at other end of mediterranean far from michael before charles of anjou could start for constantinople however sicilian vespers rebellion struck on 30 march 1282 charles sent four ships to handle revolt but when rebels took control of messina he ordered men and materiel assembled for use against michael to besiege that city meanwhile seventy angevin ships at arsenal of messina were destroyed eventually charles lifted siege and peter of aragon landed in sicily to reclaim island for his wife geanakoplos michael palaeologus pp beginning with pope martin s bull dated 18 november 1282 wherein he again excommunicated michael as well as peter of aragon john of procida and michael s emissary benedetto zaccaria as author of conspiracy that led to sicilian vespers michael has been seen as instigator geanakoplos michael palaeologus pp geanakoplos while admitting that michael was in contact with leaders of revolt beforehand asserts that michael palaeologus on his part had nothing to do with incident at church of santo spirito is beyond question furthermore michael viii was instrumental in instigating revolts in crete against venetians most famous of which was led by brothers georgios and theodore of in with a duration of six years causing most significant harm to venetian occupants and economic interests of venice michael viii had aimed to eventually bring venice an ally of charles of

bands even before death of michael viii in village thrace in december 1282 palaiologan dynasty he established ruled byzantine empire for almost two centuries longer than any other in roman history
