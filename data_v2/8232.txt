mcmillen was a member of independent development studio cryptic sea and co creator of award winning gish glaiel runs his own independent studio glaiel games and develops flash games for game and animation website newgrounds game s graphics and story were created by mcmillen while glaiel wrote game s music and code game was developed in 14 days mcmillen found he could ride off glaiel s inspiration and allowed project to be completed quickly people being creative and taking risks with their work always is inspiring to me honesty in art is also very inspiring he stated mcmillen s childhood experiences and fears were used for game s themes of loneliness nervousness and fear of abandonment or rejection boy s journeys through space represent inward thinking and imagination planets represent fears and inhabitants personify mcmillen s childhood inner demons he was initially unsure as to whether or not he wished to release aether since it was based on personal experiences and made him feel vulnerable glaiel created game s planets and gameplay designing layout of planets to convey emotions involved in game but he did not know which planets would ultimately be used to relate to each emotion he felt that game s sense of emotion and mood was improved because development was not thoroughly planned from outset both developers expressed a wish to port game to wiiware service on wii video game console aether was released as part of mcmillen s game and comic compilation cd this is a cry for help in early november 2008 reception game was positively received by gaming blogs though reviewers held mixed opinions about controls story was compared to little prince antoine de saint exupery s 1943 novella aether s graphics were praised by reviewers alec meer of website rock paper shotgun described them as beautiful to look at justin mcelroy of joystiq said game has a unique visual style and described pastel shades as attractive and peter cohen of macworld described them as a unique look composed of cute characters with sometimes grotesque imagery staceyg of jay is games found music relaxing and called game a truly compelling experience with excellent atmosphere meer also enjoyed game but found looped piano music irritating nate ralph of wired found game hauntingly beautiful if short reviewers noted that solution to some of puzzles were unclear further hindered by planets inhabitants whose dialogue does not change when planet s puzzle is completed tongue propulsion physics were said to be clumsy by staceyg who stated that in conjunction with gravity exerted by planets it is more difficult to leave planets surfaces than to navigate through space both meer and staceyg enjoyed spacefaring aspect of game and derek yu of website stated controls sometimes felt brilliant at other times felt unresponsive and awkward patrick dugan of play this thing saw potential in tongue swinging gameplay noting that aether appeared to be first of a series he suggested that more spatial elements such as nebulae and black holes would have made space flight more interesting mcmillen described aether as just prelude to a larger experience while yu suggested that a larger game with improved controls could be something better than great aether received an honorable mention at indiecade in 2009 references external links aether at google sites aether at
