severe tropical cyclone ada was a small but intense tropical cyclone that severely impacted whitsunday region of queensland australia in january 1970 it has been described as a defining event in history of whitsunday islands and was most damaging storm in mainland town of proserpine s history at time forming over far eastern coral sea in early january weather disturbance that would become ada remained weak and disorganised for nearly two weeks as it slowly moved in a clockwise loop accelerating toward southwest system was named ada on 15 january all observations of fledgling cyclone were made remotely with weather satellite imagery until it passed over an automated weather station on 16 january extremely compact cyclone with a gale radius of just intensified into a category 3 severe tropical cyclone just before striking whitsunday islands at 14 00 utc on 17 january at 18 30 utc ada s eye crossed coast at shute harbour cyclone made little inland progress before stalling northwest of mackay and dissipating on 19 january ada devastated multiple resort islands in whitsundays in some cases destroying virtually all facilities and guest cabins biggest resort located on daydream island was obliterated with similar destruction seen on south molle hayman and long islands since most boats docked on these islands were destroyed hundreds of tourists in these resorts became stranded and required emergency rescue based on severity of damage wind gusts were later estimated at 220 km h 140 mph as ada moved ashore most homes were damaged or destroyed in communities near storm s landfall point including cannonvale airlie beach and shute harbour extreme rainfall totals as high as caused massive river flooding in coastal waterways between bowen and mackay floodwaters washed out roads and left some locations isolated for days offshore seven people were missing and presumed dead after their fishing trawler encountered cyclone ada killed a total of 14 people including 11 at sea and caused a 12 million in damage cyclone revealed inadequacies in warning broadcast system and served as impetus for enhanced cyclone awareness programs that have been credited with saving lives in subsequent cyclones meteorological history cyclone ada was first noted by weather satellite imagery as a disorganised area of disturbed weather over eastern coral sea on 5 january in early stages of its life system was far from ships and only peripherally detected by weather stations more recent analyses have determined tropical low originated on 3 january just west of vanuatu for about ten days between 5 and 15 january observations of low remained scarce but infrequent satellite imagery revealed that it slowly completed a cyclonic loop nearing solomon islands before curving back toward southwest while remaining weak on 15 january bureau of meteorology s bom tropical cyclone warning centre in brisbane named storm ada and issued first warning to shipping interests ada reached tropical cyclone status on modern day australian cyclone scale next day while centered near cyclone continued tracking west southwest toward queensland and at 14 00 utc on 16 january it passed over an automated weather station on marion reef about east of bowen site recorded sustained winds of up to with first direct confirmation of storm s growing strength bom issued its initial public cyclone warning at 19 00 utc cyclone s centre moved within range of weather radar site in mackay around 06 00 utc on 17 january over next several hours radar revealed system was moving slower and more erratically than expected occasionally jogging to east ada was an exceptionally compact cyclone with a radius of gale force winds compared to 150 km 100 mi radius generally considered small for tropical cyclones between 11 00 and 17 00 utc on 17 january cyclone s eye shrank from to just across as measured by radar as a result of its small size storm s onslaught was much more sudden than normal with little rain and steady barometric pressures in hours before landfall at 12 00 utc on 17 january ada reached its peak intensity with 10 minute average maximum sustained winds of 150 km h 90 mph this made it a category 3 severe tropical cyclone beginning around 14 00 utc core of ada crossed whitsunday islands as eye passed overhead pressure fell to on hayman island just under northeast of shute harbour on mainland and although peak winds were not measured gusts on hayman island were estimated at over similar estimates were made by a ship in whitsunday passage dent island recorded a pressure of as centre made its closest approach at 17 30 utc at 18 30 utc system made landfall at shute harbour on whitsunday coast while still at peak intensity air pressure at airlie beach about away from centre of circulation fell to suggesting that storm s minimum central pressure was slightly lower upon moving ashore system slowed and curved toward south and after reaching a point about northwest of mackay on 18 january it became nearly stationary around same time cyclone s structure began to deteriorate with multiple circulation centres appearing on radar imagery just after 06 00 utc on 19 january bom issued its final advisory on ada and system dissipated shortly after preparations as ada reached north queensland bom issued cyclone warnings on a three hour cycle with more frequent bulletins occasionally released as needed flood warnings were issued for watersheds of susceptible rivers like pioneer and connors bureau s post storm assessment of disaster revealed that local broadcasts of advisories were sometimes delayed by several hours or not made at all and public awareness was generally inadequate in a misguided attempt to quell panic one radio station appended bom s warning with an unapproved message that there was no cause for alarm because of cyclone s small size due to unusual nature of storm including its delayed arrival in some areas many residents criticised or disregarded forecasts additionally many tourists in region were unfamiliar with dangers of tropical cyclones findings from studies of public response to ada were used as basis for upgraded warning systems and introduction of more cyclone education campaigns these initiatives were credited with saving lives and property in later storms such as cyclone althea in december 1971

scattered over ground and beach offshore concrete fishing trawler whakatane went missing while en route from mackay to townsville search for vessel and her seven occupants was suspended on 26 january around same time that wreckage believed to be from whakatane was identified near long island according to bom maritime tragedies during ada were likely caused by delayed or insufficient response to warnings some remained aboard their vessels throughout cyclone and others attempted to move their boats to different locations during lull at storm s eye in one instance five men were reported missing after they ventured into storm to secure a boat anchored at hayman island overall storm damage was estimated at a 12 million equivalent of over 1 billion in 2012 values when accounting for growth and inflation ada is believed to have killed 14 people 11 of them at sea whitsunday islands in whitsundays ada s impact was most severe on hayman long daydream south molle and hook islands peak winds in storm s path were not recorded but based on severity of damage it is estimated that gusts may have exceeded many trees were either blown over or debarked and stripped of their foliage with scraps of roofing material left hanging from their limbs throughout islands ada ravaged resorts and boats forcing hundreds of holidaymakers to await emergency rescue most of accommodation cabins were destroyed on south molle island where a woman in one of structures was killed and her partner severely injured damage on south molle amounted to 500 000 on hayman island winds unroofed most cabins and other buildings accounting for an estimated 1 million in damage long island was subjected to ada s left front quadrant most intense part of storm and palm bay resort there was devastated with only a few huts remaining however another resort on western side of island escaped relatively unscathed biggest resort in whitsundays at time on daydream island was destroyed requiring 400 000 to rebuild about 150 tourists sought shelter in part of a recreation hall which was only major portion of a building left intact on daydream nearly every building on hook island was lost and four men remained sheltered there for a week after storm farther south rough seas broke apart a stone jetty at brampton island in cumberland group mainland torrential rains extended along mostly rural areas of coast from bowen to mackay while strongest winds were concentrated in area from cannonvale to shute harbor and extending inland to proserpine nine hours of damaging winds unroofed or otherwise damaged around 40 of houses in proserpine in what was described as worst storm in town s history at time trees were uprooted crops were flattened and residential outhouses were blown apart elsewhere in shute harbour a motel and few houses there were demolished along with 85 of homes in airlie beach and nearly all of cannonvale s 200 houses according to minister for mines and main roads ron camm cyclone forced 750 people from their homes around 200 storm victims sought refuge in a school in cannonvale that was converted into an emergency shelter as winds subsided weakening cyclone dropped as much as of rain resulting in massive river flooding near coast some locations received up to of precipitation in just 24 hours pioneer river in mackay and don river in bowen both experienced severe flooding latter overtopped a bridge by while at one point former was well above flood stage and rising by per hour a shopping centre in mackay was flooded to a depth of 1 meter some waterways approached all time record levels with one creek north of proserpine swelling to across many farms were inundated by floodwaters losing livestock machinery and crops torrents washed out bridges and roads and severed communications isolating communities such as proserpine and airlie beach for several days as a result of widespread flooding hundreds of motorists became stranded on a long stretch of bruce highway two people died in flood ravaged area including one soldier who drowned near proserpine from bowen north to townsville more modest rainfall associated with upper level remnants of ada proved beneficial helping to alleviate persistent drought conditions aftermath following storm looters traveled to proserpine to pick through ruined homes and boats nine officer police force were unable to manage outbreak of crime and an anti looting squad soon arrived in town australian army soldiers and air force planes dispatched to whitsunday islands evacuated around 500 people from devastated resort islands meanwhile navy boats retrieved injured individuals requiring urgent medical treatment private citizens also rushed to aid of stranded resort guests in january 2014 a local boat captain was formally honoured by mp george christensen and premier campbell newman for his role in evacuating 180 people from daydream island with queensland s resources already strained by an ongoing severe drought commonwealth government of australia agreed to evenly split cost of restoring government assets damaged by ada this expenditure would normally fall to state alone by august 1970 state and federal governments had issued a combined 708 000 in grants for repairing flood damage in bowen name ada was later retired from australian tropical cyclone naming list due to cyclone s severe impact in islands about 400 workers rushed to repair resorts before peak tourism season by mid may about 100 holiday cabins had been rebuilt and 20 boats restored to service hayman and daydream islands reopened to guests in june and august 1970 respectively south molle island changed ownership multiple times during 1970s as it struggled to reattain its pre ada success and many of other resort islands were also sold as their owners were unable to meet cost of renovations destruction of resorts in whitsundays triggered a sharp decline in australian tourism revenue decades later ada is still regarded as a defining event in development of whitsunday region in 2016 whitsunday mp jason costigan advocated for erecting a memorial to ada s victims and community members formed a small committee exploring this possibility in early 2017 in april 2019 whitsunday regional council voted unanimously to approve 15 000 in funding for a memorial at airlie beach to be unveiled in time for 50th
