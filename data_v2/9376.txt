other side gone party return to their normal lives development concept for eternal punishment emerged during writing for persona 2 innocent sin halfway through writing latter s script tadashi satomi felt that draft gave him impression of needing an alternate point of view to that of main hero this concept formed basis for eternal punishments plot to foreshadow this team showed main characters from eternal punishment through minor roles in innocent sin eternal punishment began full development after release of innocent sin innocent sin and eternal punishment both used same game engine and structure kouji okada innocent sins producer returned in same role when developing eternal punishment development team took what they learned from innocent sin and used it to improve gameplay and rumor system one of biggest concerns when making eternal punishment was how much development staff wanted to include which went well beyond their original plans interview with cozy okada and kazuma kaneko overarching theme of eternal punishment as with persona and innocent sin was exploration of human psyche and main characters discovering their true selves while innocent sin focused on protagonists as teenagers eternal punishment looked at protagonists as adults for its central character theme eternal punishment focused on how people realize their true selves as adults faced with reality a theme carried over from innocent sin was power of kotodama japanese belief that words can influence physical and spiritual world with this power manifesting through spreading of rumors terms and concepts used in games including persona shadows and character philemon were drawn from jungian psychology and archetypes character of nyarlathotep who had made a cameo appearance as a persona in original game was inspired by character of same name from h p lovecraft s cthulhu mythos other antagonists and enemy creatures in games were also drawn from cthulhu mythos and played a key role in narrative main characters were designed by kazuma kaneko while secondary characters were designed by shigenori soejima protagonists of eternal punishment were adults and so could not be given a single standardized outfit as high school protagonists of innocent sin had been while designing outfits for eternal punishment kaneko tried to keep an image of normal adults in mind but in doing so was restricted when trying to portray characters heroism in end he designed characters to look normal while having a different feeling from other people one of characters that helped drive this style home was ulala who was a minor character in innocent sin and a main protagonist in eternal punishment joker character from innocent sin was carried over into eternal punishment new joker s actions were made increasingly murderous creating a contrast between two incarnations port and localization eternal punishment was first announced in april at 2000 tokyo game show during show atlus held a talk spot hosted by kouji okada and kazuma kaneko and featuring an appearance by elisha la verne singer responsible for game s theme song unlike innocent sin eternal punishment was chosen for release in west its localization was significantly different to that done for original persona released in 1996 persona received numerous alterations for its overseas release including altering character and location names for eternal punishment and future titles atlus decided to remain as faithful as possible to japanese version according to atlus game marks a halfway point in their localization history while more faithful to japanese version than original persona it still needed to take that previous localization into account for naming of returning characters its release in west was officially announced following month at that year s electronic entertainment expo with atlus previously teasing it as a secret rpg eternal punishment received a limited reprint exclusive to amazon com in 2008 to celebrate release of persona 4 eternal punishment was remade for playstation portable like remake of innocent sin it was directed by shoji meguro original plan at atlus was to have innocent sin and eternal punishment released as a single game but both could not fit onto a single umd even before completion of innocent sins remake when there were no plans for a remake of eternal punishment meguro was keen to make one if opportunity arose for remake team had two points of reference original version and remake of innocent sin team carried over most of features implemented innocent sins remake while further simplifying and streamlining mechanics aiming for a culmination to persona 2 as a whole a large portion of initial work was playing through original version a new opening animation was created by anime production company madhouse in addition to gameplay modifications a new scenario was added focusing on tatsuya s activities before he joined party satomi after having written script for a downloadable quest for innocent sins remake was asked whether he would like to write a new scenario for eternal punishments remake and accepted willingly during writing process satomi suggested giving maya dialogue but this was vetoed as persona protagonists were silent without exception scenario s new characters were designed by masayuki doi remake was announced in february 2012 by famitsu for packaging kaneko was asked to design a new piece of key art artwork features maya and her initial persona maia remake was not released outside japan due to unusual circumstances game informer included game on its list of rpgs released late in psp s life cycle games that were likely never to see a release due to flagging western psp market in response to decision not to localize remake original version was released on playstation network in 2013 as part of announcement playstation blog released a guide showing which characters had received name changes in original localization intended to be playable on psp playstation vita and playstation 3 a fault at release meant only ps3 version was playable which was fixed after players complained about it music original music for eternal punishment was composed by toshiko tasaki kenichi tsuchiya and masaki kurokawa composers for innocent sin as with innocent sin tsuchiya found writing process difficult for a number of reasons tsuchiya s favorite piece for score which was carried over from innocent sin was maya s theme tune has remained popular with persona fan base tsuchiya has attributed its popularity to enduring nature of persona series as a whole and compared it to a fashionable item of time that now requires a certain courage to wear in later times game s theme song change your way was written and sung by british singer songwriter elisha la verne and music was composed by t kura atlus persona 2 eternal punishment liner notes in japanese king records 2012 07 27 1513 7 scans retrieved on 2015 05 26 la verne wrote song with premise of eternal punishment in mind and so she wanted song to sound positive for inspiration she drew on her experiences of walking round london and seeing homeless people who appeared unable to improve their status song s theme is that there is always a way out of a bad situation and you can change that situation for better title also stemmed from this concept interview with elisha la verne together with innocent sin eternal punishment is one of first entries in megami tensei series to feature voice acting for psp version music was remixed by toshiki konishi ryota kozuka and atsushi kitajoh who also worked on remixed music for innocent sins port team while remixing music did not want to destroy original s foundation ruling concept as defined by konishi was not to far and not too close to original for opening animation meguro requested konishi to personally remix game s original opening theme it was first time he had been put in charge of an opening theme and it proved troublesome for him as he needed to rerecord vocals and make sure he did justice to original version for kitajoh one of most notable arrangements he did was for maya s theme meguro who had previously remixed this track for persona 3 fes asked for a remix with a faster tempo and incorporated hard rock elements new scenario also used remixed music from original game instead of new tracks reception during its first week of release in japan eternal punishment reached top of japanese sales charts selling 106 563 copies following week game was still in top five selling a further 16 333 and bringing sales to 122 896 by end of year it ranked at 60 in japan s best selling titles of year with final sales totaling 200 103 units psp remake debuted at 3 in japanese sales charts selling 24 547 copies following week it sold a further 4 885 but had dropped to 20 by october 2012 as stated in index holding s announced sales data game had sold just 60 000 copies putting it well behind other atlus titles such as odyssey iv legends of titan for nintendo 3ds and persona 4 golden for vita famitsu praised improvements made to gameplay over innocent sin calling experience thrilling and citing story as generally enjoyable one comment was that game s aesthetics did not deviate much from those of innocent sin magazine s later review of remake was also fairly positive finding atmosphere somber and battles entertaining stating that reviewers appreciated being able to play both parts of persona 2 on psp ign s david smith while noting game s slower pace than other contemporary rpgs he generally enjoyed plot s mature themes and rumor and persona systems summing up he said its unique visual style its unusual characters and its absorbing gameplay systems make it a game to kill plenty of hours with this winter rpgfan s ken chu despite finding camera s movement speed awkward and disliking some aspects of graphics found characters reasonably strong and generally praised gameplay he rounded off review by saying that because if its difficulty it may put off more casual rpg players but that other players were strongly recommended to check it out gamespot s jeff gerstmann generally shared these points of praise with other reviewers despite finding some aspects of gameplay potentially unbalanced and graphics unappealing said that if players can manage to get over these flaws you ll find an rpg that dares to be different but not at sake of an interesting story and exciting gameplay a common point of praise with reviewers was improved localization when compared to that of persona although opinions on voice acting varied and faults in grammar were mentioned legacy eternal punishment was enough of a success to firmly establish persona franchise in west and was also to be last persona game to not carry shin megami tensei moniker in those regions until release of persona 5 in 2017 next title in series persona 3 for playstation 2 was released in 2006 game along with innocent sin received a spin off manga titled featuring new characters from seven sisters its 2011 reprint featured new content connecting manga to innocent sin in 2009 atlus and bbmf developed and published a mobile version of game titled similar to mobile port of innocent sin it incorporates gameplay functions of console version while tailoring them to a mobile device maya amano was later
