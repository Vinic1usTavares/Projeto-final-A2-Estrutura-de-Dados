hans albrecht bethe july 2 1906 march 6 2005 was a german american nuclear physicist who made important contributions to astrophysics quantum electrodynamics and solid state physics and won 1967 nobel prize in physics for his work on theory of stellar nucleosynthesis for most of his career bethe was a professor at cornell university available at www org are class notes taken by one of his students at cornell from graduate courses on nuclear physics and on applications of quantum mechanics he taught in spring of 1947 during world war ii he was head of theoretical division at secret los alamos laboratory which developed first atomic bombs there he played a key role in calculating critical mass of weapons and developing theory behind implosion method used in both trinity test and fat man weapon dropped on nagasaki in august 1945 after war bethe also played an important role in development of hydrogen bomb though he had originally joined project with hope of proving it could not be made bethe later campaigned with albert einstein and emergency committee of atomic scientists against nuclear testing and nuclear arms race he helped persuade kennedy and nixon administrations to sign respectively 1963 partial nuclear test ban treaty and 1972 anti ballistic missile treaty salt i his scientific research never ceased and he was publishing papers well into his nineties making him one of few scientists to have published at least one major paper in his field during every decade of his in bethe s case spanned nearly seventy years freeman dyson once one of his students called him supreme problem solver of 20th century early years bethe was born in strasbourg which was then part of germany on july 2 1906 only child of anna nee kuhn and albrecht bethe a privatdozent of physiology at university of strasbourg although his mother daughter of a professor at university of strasbourg was jewish he was raised a protestant like his father despite having a religious background he was not religious in later life and described himself as an atheist thumb left hans bethe aged 12 with his parents his father accepted a position as professor and director of institute of physiology at university of kiel in 1912 and family moved into director s apartment at institute he was initially schooled privately by a professional teacher as part of a group of eight girls and boys family moved again in 1915 when his father became head of new institute of physiology at university of frankfurt am main bethe attended goethe gymnasium in frankfurt germany his education was interrupted in 1916 when he contracted tuberculosis and he was sent to bad kreuznach to recuperate by 1917 he had recovered sufficiently to attend local realschule and following year he was sent to a private coeducational boarding school he attended goethe gymnasium again for his final three years of secondary schooling from 1922 to 1924 having passed his abitur bethe entered university of frankfurt in 1924 he decided to major in chemistry instruction in physics was poor and while there were distinguished mathematicians in frankfurt like carl ludwig siegel and otto szasz bethe disliked their approaches which presented mathematics without reference to other sciences bethe found that he was a poor experimentalist who destroyed his lab coat by spilling sulfuric acid on it but he found advanced physics taught by associate professor walter gerlach more interesting gerlach left in 1925 and was replaced by karl meissner who advised bethe that he should go to a university with a better school of theoretical physics specifically university of munich where he could study under arnold sommerfeld bethe entered university of munich in april 1926 where sommerfeld took him on as a student on meissner s recommendation sommerfeld taught an advanced course on differential equations in physics which bethe enjoyed because he was such a renowned scholar sommerfeld frequently received advance copies of scientific papers which he put up for discussion at weekly evening seminars when bethe arrived sommerfeld had just received erwin schrodinger s papers on wave mechanics for his phd thesis sommerfeld suggested that bethe examine electron diffraction in crystals as a starting point sommerfeld suggested paul ewald s 1914 paper on x ray diffraction in crystals bethe later recalled that he became too ambitious and in pursuit of greater accuracy his calculations became unnecessarily complicated when he met wolfgang pauli for first time pauli told him after sommerfeld s tales about you i had expected much better from you than your thesis i guess from pauli bethe later recalled that was a compliment early work after bethe received his doctorate erwin madelung offered him an assistantship in frankfurt and in september 1928 bethe moved in with his father who had recently divorced his mother his father met vera earlier that year and married her in 1929 they had two children doris born in 1933 and klaus born in 1934 bethe did not find work in frankfurt very stimulating and in 1929 he accepted an offer from ewald at technische hochschule in stuttgart while there he wrote what he considered to be his greatest paper zur theorie des schneller durch theory of passage of fast corpuscular rays through matter starting from max born s interpretation of schrodinger equation bethe produced a simplified formula for collision problems using a fourier transform which is known today as bethe formula he submitted this paper for his habilitation in 1930 sommerfeld recommended bethe for a rockefeller foundation travelling scholarship in 1929 this provided 150 a month about 000 in dollars to study abroad in 1930 bethe chose to do postdoctoral work at cavendish laboratory at university of cambridge in england where he worked under supervision of ralph fowler at request of patrick blackett who was working with cloud chambers bethe created a relativistic version of bethe formula bethe was also known for his sense of humor and with guido beck and wolfgang two other postdoctoral research fellows created a hoax paper on quantum theory of temperature of absolute zero where he calculated fine structure constant from absolute zero temperature in celsius units paper poked fun at a certain class of papers in theoretical physics of day which were purely speculative and based on spurious numerical arguments such as arthur eddington s attempts to explain value of fine structure constant from fundamental quantities in an earlier paper they were forced to issue an apology for second half of his scholarship bethe chose to go to enrico fermi s laboratory in rome in february 1931 he was greatly impressed by fermi and regretted that he had not gone to rome first bethe developed bethe a method for finding exact solutions for eigenvalues and of certain one dimensional quantum many body models he was influenced by fermi s simplicity and sommerfeld s rigor in approaching problems and these qualities influenced his own later research rockefeller foundation offered an extension of bethe s fellowship allowing him to return to italy in 1932 in meantime bethe worked for sommerfeld in munich as a privatdozent since bethe was fluent in english sommerfeld had bethe supervise all his english speaking postdoctoral fellows including lloyd p smith from cornell university bethe accepted a request from karl scheel to write an article for handbuch der physik on quantum mechanics of hydrogen and helium reviewing article decades later robert bacher and victor weisskopf noted that it was unusual in depth and breadth of its treatment of subject yet required very little updating for 1959 edition bethe was then asked by sommerfeld to help him with handbuch article on electrons in metals article covered basis of what is now called solid state physics bethe took a very new field and provided a clear coherent and complete coverage of it his work on handbuch articles occupied most of his time in rome but he also co wrote a paper with fermi on another new field quantum electrodynamics describing relativistic interactions of charged particles in 1932 bethe accepted an appointment as an assistant professor at university of tubingen where hans geiger was professor of experimental physics one of first laws passed by new national socialist government was law for restoration of professional civil service due to his jewish background bethe was dismissed from his job at university which was a government post geiger refused to help but sommerfeld immediately gave bethe back his fellowship at munich sommerfeld spent much of summer term of 1933 finding places for jewish students and colleagues bethe left germany in 1933 moving to england after receiving an offer for a position as lecturer at university of manchester for a year through sommerfeld s connection to william lawrence bragg he moved in with his friend rudolf peierls and peierls wife genia peierls was a fellow jewish german physicist who had also been barred from academic positions in germany this meant that bethe had someone to speak to in german and did not have to eat english food their relationship was professional as well as personal peierls aroused bethe s interest in nuclear physics after james chadwick and maurice goldhaber discovered photodisintegration of deuterium chadwick challenged bethe and peierls to come up with a theoretical explanation of this phenomenon this they did on four hour train ride from cambridge back to manchester bethe would investigate further in years ahead in 1933 physics department at cornell was looking for a new theoretical physicist and lloyd smith strongly recommended bethe this was supported by bragg who was visiting cornell at time in august 1934 cornell offered bethe a position as an acting assistant professor bethe had already accepted a fellowship for a year to work with nevill mott at university of bristol for a semester but cornell agreed to let him start in spring of 1935 before leaving for united states he visited niels bohr institute in copenhagen in september 1934 where he proposed to hilde levi who accepted however match was opposed by bethe s mother who did not want him marrying a jewish girl despite being jewish herself and bethe broke off their engagement a few days before their wedding date in december niels bohr and james franck were so shocked by bethe s behavior that he was not invited to institute again until after world war ii united states bethe arrived in united states in february 1935 and joined faculty at cornell university on a salary of 3 000 bethe s appointment was part of a deliberate effort on part of new head of its physics department roswell clifton gibbs to move into nuclear physics gibbs had hired stanley livingston who had worked with ernest lawrence to build a cyclotron at cornell to complete team cornell needed an experimentalist and on advice of bethe and livingston recruited robert bacher bethe received requests to visit columbia university from isidor isaac rabi princeton university from edward condon university of rochester from lee dubridge purdue university from karl lark horovitz university of illinois at urbana champaign from francis wheeler loomis and harvard university from john hasbrouck van gibbs moved to prevent bethe from being poached by having him appointed as a regular assistant professor in 1936 with an assurance that promotion to professor would soon follow together with bacher and livingston bethe published a series of three articles which summarized most of what was known on subject of nuclear physics until that time an account that became informally known as bethe s bible and remained standard work on subject for many years in this account he also continued where others left off filling in gaps in older literature loomis offered bethe a full professorship at university of illinois at urbana champaign but cornell matched offer and salary of 6 000 he wrote to his mother on march 17 1938 bethe attended carnegie institute and george washington university s fourth annual washington conference of theoretical physics there were only 34 invited attendees but they included gregory breit subrahmanyan chandrasekhar george gamow donald menzel john von neumann bengt stromgren edward teller and merle bethe initially declined invitation to attend because conference s topic stellar energy generation did not interest him but teller persuaded him to come at conference stromgren detailed what was known about temperature density and chemical composition of sun and challenged physicists to come up with an explanation gamow and carl friedrich von weizsacker had proposed in a 1937 paper that sun s energy was result of a proton proton chain reaction but this did not account for observation of elements heavier than helium by end of conference bethe working in collaboration with charles critchfield had come up with a series of subsequent nuclear reactions that explained how sun shines 2 2 that this did not explain processes in heavier stars was not overlooked at time there were doubts about whether proton proton cycle described processes in sun but more recent measurements of sun s core temperature and luminosity show that it does when he returned to cornell bethe studied relevant nuclear reactions and reaction cross sections leading to his discovery of carbon nitrogen oxygen cycle cno cycle border 0 align center style height 2em style height 2em style height 2em style height 2em style height 2em style height 2em two papers one on proton proton cycle co authored with critchfield and other on carbon oxygen nitrogen cno cycle were sent to physical review for publication after kristallnacht bethe s mother had become afraid to remain in germany taking advantage of her strasbourg origin she was able to emigrate to united states in june 1939 on french quota rather than german one which was full bethe s graduate student robert marshak noted that new york academy of sciences was offering a 500 prize for best unpublished paper on topic of solar and stellar energy so bethe in need of 250 to release his mother s furniture withdrew cno cycle paper and sent it in to new york academy of sciences it won prize and bethe gave marshak 50 finder s fee and used 250 to release his mother s furniture paper was subsequently published in physical review in march it was a breakthrough in understanding of stars and would win bethe nobel prize in physics in 1967 in 2002 at age 96 bethe sent a handwritten note to john n bahcall congratulating him on use of solar neutrino observations to show that cno cycle accounts for about 7 of sun s energy neutrino observations had started with raymond davis jr whose experiment was based on bahcall s calculations and encouragement and led to davis s receiving a share of 2002 nobel prize bethe married rose ewald daughter of paul ewald on september 13 1939 in a simple civil ceremony they had two children henry and monica henry was a contract bridge expert and former husband of kitty munson cooper truscott alan bridge son of nobel prize winner is famed in his own right new york times february 24 1988 retrieved april 11 2015 he became a naturalized citizen of united states in march 1941 writing to sommerfeld in 1947 bethe confided that i am much more at home in america than i ever was in germany as if i was born in germany only by mistake and only came to my true homeland at 28 manhattan project right thumb bethe s los alamos laboratory id badge when second world war began bethe wanted to contribute to war effort but was unable to work on classified projects until he became a citizen following advice of caltech aerodynamicist theodore von karman bethe collaborated with his friend edward teller on a theory of shock waves which are generated by passage of a projectile through a gas bethe considered it one of their most influential papers he also worked on a theory of armor penetration which was immediately classified by army thus making it impossible for bethe who was not an american citizen at time to access further research on theory after receiving security clearance in december 1941 bethe joined mit radiation laboratory where he invented bethe hole directional coupler which is used in microwave waveguides such as those used in radar sets in chicago in june 1942 and then at university of california berkeley in july he participated in a series of meetings at invitation of robert oppenheimer which discussed first designs for atomic bomb they went over preliminary calculations by robert serber stan frankel and others and discussed possibilities of using uranium 235 and plutonium teller then raised prospect of a thermonuclear device teller s super bomb at one point teller asked if nitrogen in atmosphere could be set alight it fell to bethe and emil konopinski to perform calculations demonstrating virtual impossibility of such an occurrence fission bomb had to be done he later recalled because germans were presumably doing it when oppenheimer was put in charge of forming a secret weapons design laboratory los alamos he appointed bethe director of t theoretical division laboratory s smallest but most prestigious division this move irked equally qualified but more difficult to manage teller and felix bloch who had coveted job a series of disagreements between bethe and teller between february and june 1944 over relative priority of super research led to teller s group being removed from t division and placed directly under oppenheimer in september it became part of fermi s new f division bethe s work at los alamos included calculating critical mass and efficiency of uranium 235 and multiplication of nuclear fission in an exploding atomic bomb along with richard feynman he developed a formula for calculating bomb s explosive yield after august 1944 when laboratory was reorganized and reoriented to solve problem of implosion of plutonium bomb bethe spent much of his time studying hydrodynamic aspects of implosion a job which he continued into 1944 in 1945 he worked on neutron initiator and later on radiation propagation from an exploding atomic bomb trinity nuclear test validated accuracy of t division s results when it was detonated in new mexico desert on july 16 1945 bethe s immediate concern was for its efficient operation and not its moral implications he is reported to have commented i am not a philosopher hydrogen bomb after war bethe argued that a crash project for hydrogen bomb should not be attempted though after president harry truman announced beginning of such a project and outbreak of korean war bethe signed up and played a key role in weapon s development though he would see project through to its end bethe hoped that it would be impossible to create hydrogen bomb he would later remark in 1968 on apparent contradiction in his stance having first opposed development of weapon and later helping to create it as for his own role in project and its relation to dispute over who was responsible for design bethe later said that in 1954 bethe testified on behalf of j robert oppenheimer during oppenheimer security hearing specifically bethe argued that oppenheimer s stances against developing hydrogen bomb in late 1940s had not hindered its actual development a topic which was seen as a key motivating factor behind hearing bethe contended that developments which led to successful teller ulam design were a matter of serendipity and not a question of manpower or logical development of previously existing ideas during hearing bethe and his wife also tried hard to convince edward teller against testifying however teller did not agree and his testimony played a major role in revocation of oppenheimer s security clearance while bethe and teller had been on very good terms during prewar years conflict between them during manhattan project and especially during oppenheimer episode permanently marred their relationship later work lamb shift thumb hans bethe lecturing at dalhousie university 1978 after war ended bethe returned to cornell in june 1947 he participated in shelter island conference sponsored by national academy of sciences and held at ram s head inn on shelter island new york conference on foundations of quantum mechanics was first major physics conference held since war it was a chance for american physicists to come together pick up where they had left off before war and establish direction of post war research a major talking point at conference was discovery by willis lamb and his graduate student robert retherford shortly before conference began that one of two possible quantum states of hydrogen atoms had slightly more energy than predicted by paul dirac s theory this became known as lamb shift oppenheimer and weisskopf suggested that this was a result of quantum fluctuations of electromagnetic field pre war quantum electrodynamics qed gave absurd infinite values for this but lamb shift showed that it was both real and finite hans kramers proposed renormalization as a solution but no one knew how to do calculation bethe managed to work it out on train from new york to schenectady he arrived at a value of 1040 mhz extremely close to that obtained experimentally by lamb and retherford he did so by realising that it was a non relativistic process which greatly simplified calculations his paper published in physical review in august 1947 was only two pages long and contained just 12 mathematical equations but was enormously influential hitherto it had been assumed that infinities meant that qed was fundamentally flawed and that a new radical theory was required bethe demonstrated that this was not necessary one of bethe s most famous papers is one he never wrote 1948 alpher bethe gamow paper george gamow added bethe s name in absentia without consulting him knowing that bethe would not mind and against ralph alpher s wishes this was apparently a reflection of gamow s sense of humor wanting to have a paper title that would sound like first three letters of greek alphabet as one of physical reviews reviewers bethe saw manuscript and struck out words in absentia astrophysics bethe believed that atomic nucleus was like a quantum liquid drop he investigated nuclear matter problem by considering work done by keith brueckner on perturbation theory working with jeffrey goldstone he produced a solution for case where there was an infinite hard core potential then working with baird and albert he came up with an approximation that converted scattering equation into an easily solved differential equation this then led him to bethe faddeev equation a generalisation of ludvig faddeev s approach to three body scattering he then used these techniques to examine neutron stars which have densities similar to those of nuclei bethe continued to do research on supernovae neutron stars black holes and other problems in theoretical astrophysics into his late nineties in doing this he collaborated with gerald e brown of stony brook university in 1978 brown proposed that they collaborate on supernovae these were reasonably well understood by this time but calculations were still a problem using techniques honed from decades of working with nuclear physics and some experience with calculations involving nuclear explosions bethe tackled problems involved in stellar gravitational collapse and way in which various factors affected a supernova explosion once again he was able to reduce problem to a set of differential equations and solve them at age 85 bethe wrote an important article about solar neutrino problem in which he helped establish conversion mechanism for electron neutrinos into muon neutrinos proposed by stanislav alexei smirnov and lincoln wolfenstein to explain a vexing discrepancy between theory and experiment bethe argued that physics beyond standard model was required to understand solar neutrino problem because it assumed that neutrinos have no mass and therefore cannot into each other whereas msw effect required this to occur bethe hoped that corroborating evidence would be found by sudbury neutrino observatory sno in ontario canada by his 90th birthday but he did not get call from sno until june 2001 when he was nearly 95 in 1996 kip thorne approached bethe and brown about ligo laser interferometer gravitational wave observatory designed to detect gravitational waves from merging neutron stars and black holes since bethe and brown were good at calculating things that could not be seen could they look at mergers 90 year old bethe quickly became enthused and soon began required calculations result was a 1998 paper on evolution of binary compact objects which merge which brown regarded as best that two produced together political stances thumb bethe being interviewed by journalists in 1968 bethe along with ibm physicist richard garwin published an article criticising in detail anti icbm defense system proposed by department of defense two physicists described in article that nearly any measure taken by us would be easily thwarted with deployment of relatively simple decoys bethe was one of primary voices in scientific community behind signing of 1963 partial test ban treaty prohibiting further atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons during 1980s and 1990s bethe campaigned for peaceful use of nuclear energy after chernobyl disaster bethe was part of a committee of experts that analysed incident they concluded that reactor suffered from a fundamentally faulty design and human error also had significantly contributed to accident my colleagues and i established he explained that chernobyl disaster tells us about deficiencies of soviet political and administrative system rather than about problems with nuclear power throughout his life bethe remained a strong advocate for electricity from nuclear energy which he described in 1977 as a necessity not merely an option in 1980s he and other physicists opposed strategic defense initiative missile system conceived by ronald reagan administration in 1995 at age of 88 bethe wrote an open letter calling on all scientists to cease and desist from working on any aspect of nuclear weapons development and manufacture in 2004 he joined 47 other nobel laureates in signing a letter endorsing john kerry for president of united states as someone who would restore science to its appropriate place in government historian gregg herken wrote personal life bethe s hobbies included a passion for stamp collecting he loved outdoors and was an enthusiastic hiker all his life exploring alps and rockies he died in his home in ithaca new york on march 6 2005 nobel laureate hans bethe passes away at age of 98 march 7 2005 wikinews of congestive heart failure he was survived by his wife rose and two children at time of his death he was john wendell anderson professor of physics emeritus at cornell university honors and awards bethe received numerous honors and awards in his lifetime and afterwards he became a fellow of american academy of arts and sciences in 1947 and that year was received national academy of sciences s henry draper medal he was awarded max planck medal in 1955 franklin medal in 1959 royal astronomical society s eddington medal and united states atomic energy commission s enrico fermi award in 1961 rumford
