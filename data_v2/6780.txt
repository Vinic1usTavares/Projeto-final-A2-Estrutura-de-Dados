marchminister of tribal april27 marchminister of border affairssahibjan august27 march taraki was appointed chairman of revolutionary council and chairman of council of ministers while retaining his post as pdpa general secretary he initially formed a government which consisted of both khalqists and parchamites karmal became deputy chairman of presidium of revolutionary council while amin became minister of foreign affairs and deputy chairman of council of ministers internal problems soon arose and several prominent khalqists accused parcham faction of conspiring against taraki government a purge of parcham then began with faction s most prominent members being sent out of country karmal became afghan ambassador to czechoslovakia and mohammad najibullah became afghan ambassador to iran internal struggle was not only to be found between khalqist and parchamites tense rivalry between taraki and amin had begun in khalq faction with both vying for control karmal was recalled from czechoslovakia but rather than returning to afghanistan he went into hiding with anahita ratebzad his friend and former afghan ambassador to yugoslavia as he feared execution if he returned muhammad najibullah followed them taraki consequently stripped them of all official titles and political authority socio economic changes land reform taraki s government initiated a land reform on 1 january 1979 which attempted to limit amount of land a family could own those whose landholdings exceeded limit saw their property requisitioned by government without compensation afghan leadership believed reform would meet with popular approval among rural population while weakening power of bourgeoisie reform was declared complete in mid 1979 and government proclaimed that 665 000 hectares approximately 1 632 500 acres had been redistributed government also declared that only 40 000 families or 4 percent of population had been negatively affected by land reform contrary to government expectations reform was neither popular nor productive agricultural harvests plummeted and reform itself led to rising discontent amongst afghans when taraki realized degree of popular dissatisfaction with reform he quickly abandoned policy however land reform was gradually implemented under later karmal administration although proportion of land area impacted by reform is unclear other reforms in months following coup taraki and other party leaders initiated other radical marxist policies that challenged both traditional afghan values and well established traditional power structures in rural areas taraki introduced women to political life and legislated an end to forced marriage however he ruled over a nation with a deep islamic religious culture and a long history of resistance to any type of strong centralized governmental control and consequently many of these reforms were not actually implemented nationwide popular resentment of taraki s drastic policy changes triggered surging unrest throughout country reducing government control to only a limited area strength of this anti reform backlash would ultimately lead to afghan civil war traditional practices that were deemed feudal such as usury bride price and forced marriage were banned and minimum age of marriage was raised government stressed education for both women and men and launched an ambitious literacy campaign sharia law was abolished and men were encouraged to cut off their beards under previous administration of mohammad daoud khan a literacy program created by unesco had been launched with objective of eliminating illiteracy within 20 years government of taraki attempted to reduce this time frame from 20 to four years an unrealistic goal in light of shortage of teachers and limited government capacity to oversee such an initiative duration of project was later lengthened to seven years by soviets in aftermath of soviet intervention cultural focus of unesco programme was declared rubbish by taraki who instead chose to introduce a political orientation by utilizing pdpa leaflets and left wing pamphlets as basic reading material afghan soviet relations taraki signed a twenty year treaty of friendship with soviet union on 5 december 1978 which greatly expanded soviet aid to his regime following herat uprising taraki contacted alexei kosygin chairman of ussr council of ministers and asked for practical and technical assistance with men and armament kosygin was unfavorable to proposal on basis of negative political repercussions such an action would have for his country and he rejected all further attempts by taraki to solicit soviet military aid in afghanistan following kosygin s rejection taraki requested aid from leonid brezhnev general secretary of communist party of soviet union and soviet head of state who warned him that full soviet intervention would only play into hands of our enemies both yours and ours brezhnev also advised taraki to ease up on drastic social reforms and to seek broader support for his regime in 1979 taraki attended a conference of non aligned movement in havana cuba on his way back he stopped in moscow on 20 march and met with brezhnev foreign minister andrei gromyko and other soviet officials it was rumoured that karmal was present at meeting in an attempt to reconcile taraki s khalq faction and parcham against amin and his followers at meeting taraki was successful in negotiating some soviet support including redeployment of two soviet armed divisions at soviet afghan border sending of 500 military and civilian advisers and specialists and immediate delivery of soviet armed equipment sold at 25 percent below original price however soviets were not pleased about developments in afghanistan and brezhnev impressed upon taraki need for party unity despite reaching this agreement with taraki soviets continued to be reluctant to intervene further in afghanistan and repeatedly refused soviet military intervention within afghan borders during taraki s rule as well as later during amin s short rule taraki amin break thumb 200px presidential palace under taraki c 1979 in first months after april 1978 revolution hafizullah amin and taraki had a very close relationship taraki reportedly remarked amin and i are like nail and flesh not separable amin set about constructing a personality cult centered on taraki in party and government meetings amin always referred to taraki as great leader star of east or great thinker among other titles while amin was given such titles as true disciple and student amin would later come to realize he had created a monster when kim il sung like personality cult he had created inspired taraki to become overly confident and believe in his own brilliance taraki began discounting amin s suggestions fostering in amin a deep sense of resentment as their relationship turned increasingly sour a power struggle developed between them for control of afghan national army their relations came to a head later that year when taraki accused amin of nepotism after amin had appointed several family members to high ranking positions taraki could count on support of four prominent army officers in his struggle against amin aslam watanjar sayed mohammad gulabzoy sherjan mazdoryar and assadullah sarwari these men had joined pdpa not because of ideological reasons but instead due to their lofty political ambitions they also had developed a close relationship with alexander puzanov soviet ambassador in afghanistan who was eager to use them against amin after herat city uprising on 17 march 1979 pdpa politburo and revolutionary council established homeland higher defence council to which taraki was elected its chairman while amin became its deputy at around same time taraki left his post as council of ministers chairman and amin was elected his successor amin s new position offered him little real influence however as chairman of council of ministers amin had power to elect every member of cabinet but all of them had to be approved by head of state taraki in reality through this maneuver taraki had effectively reduced amin s power base by forcing him to relinquish his hold on afghan army in order to take on supposedly heavy responsibilities of his new but ultimately powerless post during taraki s foreign visit to non aligned conference in cuba his gang of four had received an intelligence report that amin was planning to arrest or kill them this report it turned out was incorrect nonetheless gang of four were ordered to assassinate amin its leader sarwari selecting his nephew aziz akbari to conduct assassination however akbari was not informed that he was chosen assassin or that it was a secret mission and he confided information to contacts in soviet embassy embassy responded by warning amin of assassination attempt thereby saving him from certain death assassination on 11 september 1979 taraki was greeted by amin at airport on his return to kabul from moscow flight was scheduled to land at 2 30 but amin forced delay of landing by an hour as a demonstration to taraki of his control over government shortly afterward taraki instead of reporting to cabinet about havana summit indirectly tried to dismiss amin from his position as per plot of soviets he sought to neutralize amin s power and influence by requesting that he serve overseas as an ambassador but amin turned down proposal shouting you are one who should quit because of drink and old age you have taken leave of your senses following day taraki invited amin to presidential palace for lunch with him and gang of four amin turned down offer stating he would prefer their resignation rather than lunching with them soviet ambassador puzanov managed to persuade amin to make visit to palace along with sayed daoud tarun chief of police and nawab ali an intelligence officer inside palace on 14 september bodyguards within building opened fire on visitors tarun was killed but amin only sustained injuries and escaped to his car driving to ministry of defence shortly afterwards amin placed army on high alert ordered detainment of taraki and telephoned puzanov about incident that evening at 6 30 tanks from 4th armoured corps entered city and stood at government positions amin returned to palace with a contingent of army officers and placed taraki under arrest gang of four however had disappeared taking refuge at soviet embassy soviets tried to dissuade amin from expelling taraki and his associates from their positions but amin refused on 15 september a soviet battalion at bagram air base and embassy were put in position in an attempt to rescue taraki but they were never ordered to make a move as they felt that amin s forces had edge

i do with him brezhnev replied that it was his choice amin who now believed he had full support of soviets ordered death of taraki taraki s death occurred on 8 october 1979 when he was according to
