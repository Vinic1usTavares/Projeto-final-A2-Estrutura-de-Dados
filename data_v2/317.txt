human nature had been condemned as a heresy by council of chalcedon in 451 and tolerant policies towards monophysitism of zeno and anastasius i had been a source of tension in relationship with bishops of rome justin reversed this trend and confirmed chalcedonian doctrine openly condemning monophysites justinian who continued this policy tried to impose religious unity on his subjects by forcing them to accept doctrinal compromises that might appeal to all parties a policy that proved unsuccessful as he satisfied none of them near end of his life justinian became ever more inclined

had strongholds in egypt and syria and by tolerating appointment of monophysites to church offices popes reacted by severing ties with patriarch of constantinople who supported these policies emperors

papal elections as he did when he favoured vigilius and had his rival deported this new found unity between east and west did not however solve ongoing disputes in east justinian s policies switched between attempts to force monophysites to accept chalcedonian creed by persecuting their bishops and monks thereby their sympathizers in egypt and other provinces and attempts at a compromise that would win over monophysites without surrendering chalcedonian faith such an approach was supported by empress theodora who favoured monophysites unreservedly in condemnation of three chapters three theologians that had opposed monophysitism before and after council of chalcedon justinian tried to win over opposition at fifth ecumenical council most of eastern church yielded to emperor s demands and pope vigilius who was forcibly brought to constantinople and besieged at a chapel finally also gave his assent however condemnation was received unfavourably in west where it led to new albeit
