fifteen minutes ahead of previous race leader gabriele bosisio race s overall classification had been headed for several days beforehand by giovanni visconti who participated in a breakaway in sixth stage which won him sufficient time to hold race leader s pink jersey for more than a week in race s final week contador faced stern challenges from ricco and defending giro champion danilo di luca though contador did not win any stage his performances were consistently strong enough to remain ahead through to conclusion of race team appeared to perform quite well in race coming away with four stage wins and victory in mountains classification and trofeo fast team in august 2008 mountains classification winner emanuele sella was announced to have tested positive for methoxy polyethylene glycol epoetin beta better known as mircera an erythropoietin derivative at an out of competition control held by union cycliste internationale uci he subsequently admitted his doping and named teammate matteo priamo as his supplier both riders were subsequently suspended though as of april 2010 no definitive positive results have come to light from samples taken during giro of those samples has reportedly revealed six to seven presumptive positives for mircera ricco who tested positive for drug at 2008 tour de france is among those suspected of having given positive tests in giro as is sella teams twenty two teams participated in 2008 giro these included 16 uci protour teams and six uci professional continental teams of 18 protour teams two left out were and two other protour teams

both later added with astana s invitation coming just six days before event began 22 teams who took part in race were race previews and favorites 2008 giro featured an assortment of contenders for overall victory defending champion danilo di luca had faced potential bans which would have kept him out of race after investigations into his involvement with oil for drugs scandal and an irregular doping test given after stage 17 of 2007 giro d italia either of which could have resulted in a two year suspension though he was suspended for three months because of oil for drugs he was cleared by italian national olympic committee of any wrongdoing in 2007 giro and was thus permitted to start thumb right s andreas kloden was considered among race s overall favorites alt a cyclist in a blue and

three potential contenders 2007 tour de france winner alberto contador third place finisher from that race levi leipheimer and andreas kloden one analysis of pre race favorites considered kloden to be strongest of them while another considered contador to be race s biggest favorite after his wins at recently run vuelta al pais vasco and vuelta a castilla y leon both di luca and contador had strong support riders by their sides with di luca joined by two time giro d italia champion paolo savoldelli gabriele bosisio and alessandro and contador by leipheimer and kloden other riders named as

odds on favorite was kloden 2004 giro d italia winner damiano cunego chose to skip race to better prepare for tour de france adding to speculation that this would be first giro since 1996 to feature a non italian winner six stages were classified as flat and likely to be contested by sprinters italian sprinter alessandro petacchi who had notably won nine stages in 2004 race did not plan to enter this giro because of bouts with influenza and bronchitis which hindered his training he was later suspended from sport and his contract with team terminated as a result of his controversial doping case from 2007 giro sprinters identified as being favorites in bunch finishes that giro would offer included alexandre usov dimitry muravyev enrico gasparotto maximiliano richeze robert forster mark cavendish andre greipel daniele bennati paolo bettini graeme brown robbie mcewen julian dean erik zabel and alberto richeze was withdrawn by his team day before race began after a positive doping test though he would later be cleared of any wrongdoing his name remained on start list and he was not replaced meaning entered race with only eight riders instead of customary nine route and stages race began for second year in succession with a team time trial on one of italy s islands in this case sicily in 2007 it had been sardinia route contained only four stages that were officially deemed mountain stages but several of seven intermediate stages contained selective climbs giro had four time trials three of which were individual and one a team event six stages were classified as flat sixth stage was originally scheduled to be in length but it was shortened day before it was to be run this decision was made because many riders in race had become upset over lengths of transfers from end of one stage to beginning of next and that this afforded them little rest to prepare for such long stages circuito del gargano was eliminated of four official mountain stages three ended with climbs stage 14 to alpe di pampeago stage 15 to passo fedaia and stage 19 to presolana stage 20 earned its mountain designation by way of passo di gavia and passo del respectively highest point reached and steepest climb of this year s giro two other stages had summit arrivals stage 7 to pescocostanzo and demanding stage 16 climbing time trial to plan de corones summit of which giro had never before visited it was hoped that number of time trials including one on race s last day would keep race hotly contested to end 10 22px link alt team time to agrigento link alt intermediate to

american rider wearing pink jersey for first time in twenty years as and were among biggest favorites to win and all had strong american time trialists on their squads victory went to which put their team leader american christian vande velde in first pink jersey with a hilly stage ahead on day two of giro vande velde s race lead was far from secure he lost it to franco pellizotti who finished sufficiently ahead of vande velde on stage to take a lead of a single second in overall classification pellizotti retained race lead for next three days as those stages were flat and were contested by

giovanni visconti assumed race lead by a margin of less than one second over fellow breakaway member matthias russ russ had begun stage 13 seconds ahead of visconti in overall classification but with visconti gaining seven seconds on russ at finish line and six in on stage s intermediate sprint young italian became next to wear pink jersey visconti and his team ably defended jersey for nine days keeping it through hilly seventh and eighth stages as well as in individual time trial in stage 11 and in three flat stages visconti eventually lost lead on stage 14 giro s first stage categorized as high mountain as he finished more than eighteen minutes behind stage winner emanuele sella race lead passed to gabriele bosisio after that stage but he was unable to hold it next day finishing fifteen minutes behind sella again stage winner it was on this stage that alberto contador took lead that he would never relinquish thumb giro champion alberto contador during stage 21 individual time trial alt a cyclist wearing a pink and shoes sitting crouched in an aerodynamic position over his bicycle spectators watch from roadside contador faced repeated challenges from riccardo ricco and danilo di luca in race s final week they were separated by less than a minute after stage 15 and though di luca would falter slightly in giro s second individual time trial time gap among three of them was just 21 seconds heading in to giro s final mountain stage di luca faltered further in that last mountain stage losing almost five minutes and any chance to repeat as giro champion but contador and ricco finished together and were separated by only four seconds going into giro s final stage another individual time trial contador s superior time trial skills provided difference in giro s finale though he finished 11th on stage he gained almost two minutes over ricco winning giro overall without taking any individual stage emanuele sella of won three stages in race s final week and took a convincing victory in mountains classification leading it for entire race his subsequent positive tests and confessions to use of performance enhancing drugs outside giro cast serious doubt on legitimacy of these results however daniele bennati was nearly as dominant in winning points classification taking three stage wins and six other top ten finishes he led classification after every stage except second and eighth which were both won by ricco who thereby gained mauve jersey for one day on two separate occasions though ricco was never able to take overall race lead he was winner of youth

daniele bennati in stages 3 9 and 12 and mark cavendish in stages 4 and 13 also won multiple stages with pavel brutt in stage 5 and vasil kiryienka in stage 19 after both figured into early morning

alessandro bertolini took stage 11 from a breakaway and veteran jens voigt was winner of stage 18 success was achieved by only a handful of teams meaning that other teams did not achieve much in race though they nearly took race lead with matthias russ in stage 6 had just two riders finish race and were never otherwise close to a notable result had only four riders finish race two other protour teams and similarly failed to be at all competitive in giro none of them would return to giro in 2009 folded in 2008 after being unable to locate a new sponsor while and all made it known that they did not wish to participate and were thus declined invitations doping thumb emanuele sella pictured here in 2004 won climber s prize and three stages in giro but is suspected to have used performance enhancing drugs to achieve those results alt a cyclist in an orange jersey with purple trim with many logos on it he also wears sunglasses and a blue helmet and sits crouched over his bicycle in an aerodynamic position spectators watch from behind barricades and a cameraman follows on a motorbike several notable riders in giro were announced to have tested positive for banned performance enhancing drugs after race concluded prominent amongst them was rider emanuele sella a triple stage winner winner of mountains classification and a key rider to s victory in teams classification it was announced on 5 august that sella had tested positive for methoxy polyethylene glycol epoetin beta better known as mircera a third generation form of banned blood booster erythropoietin at time giro was run test for mircera was still in development an out of competition control was taken on 23 july just days after positives from 2008 tour de france had come to light and samples were sent to labs in paris for analysis uci president pat mcquaid said that sella had been targeted in control and that i t wasn t rocket science to conclude that sella s performances in giro could have been artificially enhanced sella confessed his doping to italian national olympic committee coni and named teammate matteo priamo also a stage winner in this giro as his supplier though priamo never tested positive for anything and though italian national anti doping tribunal originally exonerated him court of arbitration for sport ruled upon appeal by coni that he should be suspended for four years riccardo ricco a double stage winner and best young rider tested positive for mircera during tour de france and was subsequently expelled with his team this control was taken just days before one at which sella gave his positive since it took place during tour de france ricco s results from that race have been removed but results for sella priamo and ricco all still stand as no positive tests from controls taken during giro have come to light ricco claims to have only taken drug before tour but there has been speculation that his performances in giro were not legitimate sella has similarly confessed to taking drug while not confessing to have used it during giro after repeated positives over summer including tests from leonardo and bernhard kohl at tour de france and davide rebellin and stefan schumacher from 2008 olympic games uci has sought to have samples taken during giro retested in october 2009 it was announced that six to seven riders from this giro had presumptive positives while further untestable doping involving ozone was also suspected in total 82 samples were retested and presumptive positives have been compared to values stored at an anti doping lab in lausanne switzerland identities of those riders who tested positive have not yet been revealed it is believed that rebellin and sella are among riders to have presumptive positives classification leadership in 2008 giro d italia four different jerseys were awarded for general classification calculated by adding each cyclist s finishing times on each stage and allowing time bonuses for first three finishers
