juno minor planet designation 3 juno is an asteroid in asteroid belt juno was third asteroid discovered in 1804 by german astronomer karl harding it is 11th largest asteroid and one of two largest stony s type asteroids along with 15 eunomia it is estimated to contain 1 of total mass of asteroid belt history discovery juno was discovered on 1 september 1804 by karl ludwig harding it was third asteroid found but was initially considered to be a planet it was reclassified as an asteroid and minor planet during 1850s name juno is named after mythological juno highest roman goddess adjectival form is junonian junonius with two exceptions juno is international name subject to local variation italian french junon russian etc its planetary symbol is 3 an older symbol still occasionally seen is old symbol of juno characteristics juno is one of larger asteroids perhaps tenth by size and containing approximately 1 mass of entire asteroid belt e v precise determination of motion of planets and some astronomical constants from modern observations in kurtz d w ed proceedings of iau colloquium no 196 transits of venus new views of solar system and galaxy 2004 it is second most massive s type asteroid after 15 eunomia even so juno has only 3 mass of ceres thumb left size comparison first 10 asteroids discovered profiled against earth s moon juno is third from left orbital period of juno is 4 years amongst s type asteroids juno is unusually reflective which may be indicative of distinct surface properties this high albedo explains its relatively high apparent magnitude for a small object not near inner edge of asteroid belt juno can reach 7 5 at a favourable opposition which is brighter than neptune or titan and is reason for it being discovered before larger asteroids hygiea europa davida and at most oppositions however juno only reaches a magnitude of around 8 7 only just visible with binoculars and at smaller elongations a telescope will be required to resolve it archived it is main body in juno family planets 1807 1845 1 2 3 earth 14px 4 5 vesta juno ceres pallas 10 saturn 14px 11 juno was originally considered a planet along with 1 ceres 2 pallas and 4 vesta in 1811 schroter estimated juno to be as large as 2290 km in diameter all four were reclassified as asteroids as additional asteroids were discovered juno s small size and irregular shape preclude it from being designated a dwarf planet juno orbits at a slightly closer mean distance to sun than ceres or pallas its orbit is moderately inclined at around 12deg to ecliptic but has an extreme eccentricity greater than that of pluto this high eccentricity brings juno closer to sun at perihelion than vesta and further out at aphelion than ceres juno had most eccentric orbit of any known body until 33 was discovered in 1854 and of asteroids over 200 km in diameter only 324 has a more eccentric orbit juno rotates in a prograde direction with an axial tilt of approximately 50deg north pole points towards ecliptic coordinates b l 27deg within a 10deg uncertainty maximum temperature on surface directly facing sun was measured at about 293 k on october 2 2001 taking into account heliocentric distance at time this gives an estimated maximum temperature of 301 k 28 degc at perihelion spectroscopic studies of junonian surface permit conclusion that juno could be progenitor of chondrites a common type of stony meteorite composed of iron bearing silicates such as olivine and pyroxene infrared images reveal that juno possesses an approximately 100 km wide crater or ejecta feature result of a geologically young impact based on midas infrared data using hale telescope an average radius of 135 7 11 was reported in 2004 observations juno was first asteroid for which an occultation was observed it passed in front of a dim star sao on february 19 1958 since then several occultations by juno have been observed most fruitful being occultation of sao on december 11 1979 which was registered by 18 observers juno occulted magnitude 11 3 star on july 29 2013 asteroid occultation updates jul 29 2013 and on july 30 2013 asteroid occultation updates jul 30 2013 radio signals from spacecraft in orbit around mars and on its surface have been used to estimate mass of juno from tiny perturbations induced by it onto motion of mars juno s orbit appears to have changed slightly around 1839 very likely due to perturbations from a passing asteroid whose identity has not been determined in 1996 juno was imaged by hooker telescope at mount wilson observatory at visible and near ir wavelengths using adaptive optics images spanned a whole rotation period and revealed an irregular shape and a dark albedo feature interpreted as a fresh impact site seen at four wavelengths with a large crater in dark hooker telescope 2003 moving across background during opposition in of juno taken as part of alma s long baseline campaign oppositions juno reaches opposition from sun every 15 5 months or so with its minimum distance varying greatly depending on whether it is near perihelion or aphelion sequences of favorable oppositions occur every 10th opposition i e just over every 13 years last favorable oppositions were on december 1 2005 at a distance of 1 063 au magnitude 7 55 and on november 17 2018 at a minimum distance of 1 036 au magnitude 7 45
