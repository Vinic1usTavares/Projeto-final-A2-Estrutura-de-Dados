still in force that is christians were only to be punished if they refused to worship emperor and gods but they were not to be sought out therefore persecution was inconsistent local and sporadic faced with internal dissidence and external threats severus felt need to promote religious harmony by promoting syncretism he possibly issued an augusta septimius severus 17 1 that punished conversion to judaism and christianity a number of persecutions of christians occurred in roman empire during his reign and are traditionally attributed to severus by early christian community this is based on decree mentioned in augustan history an unreliable mix of fact and fiction early church historian eusebius described severus as a persecutor eusebius historia ecclesiastica vi 1 1 christian apologist tertullian stated that severus was well disposed towards christians tertullian ad iv 5 6 employed a christian as his personal physician and had personally intervened to save several high born christians known to him from mob eusebius description of severus as a persecutor likely derives merely from fact that numerous persecutions occurred during his reign including those known in roman
