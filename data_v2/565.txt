and he was elected to ioc that year he quickly became a major figure in olympic movement and was elected ioc president in 1952 as president of american olympic committee brundage fought strongly for amateurism and against commercialization of olympic games even as these stands increasingly came to be seen as incongruous with realities of modern sports advent of state sponsored athlete of eastern bloc countries further eroded ideology of pure amateur as it put self financed amateurs of western countries at a disadvantage 1972 summer olympics at munich west germany were his final games as president of ioc event was marred by tragedy and controversy when eleven israeli team members were murdered by palestinian terrorists at memorial service brundage decried politicization of sports and

dropped out of decathlon which he always regretted he later moved up one spot in standings in each event when his fellow american jim thorpe who had won both events was disqualified after it was shown that he had played semi professional baseball this meant thorpe was considered a professional not an amateur as was required for olympic participation throughout his tenure as president brundage refused to ask ioc to restore thorpe s medals despite advocacy by thorpe supporters committee eventually did so in 1982 after deaths of both men brundage s refusal led to charges that he held a grudge

ranked in top ten in country and even in 1934 at age of 46 he won one game out of two against angelo who had recently been us national champion sports administrator rise to leadership as brundage approached end of his track career he began to involve himself in sports administration at first through caa then through central association of amateur athletic union of which caa was a member and then beginning in 1919 in aau that group was involved in an ongoing battle for dominance over us amateur sports with national collegiate athletic association ncaa athletes were often used as pawns in battle with one organization threatening to suspend those who participated in events sponsored by other another venue for conflict was in united states national olympic committee noc which was then called american olympic committee aoc and which was aau dominated in 1920 there was public outcry when aoc chartered a disused troopship to carry home america s representatives in 1920 olympic games in antwerp much of team instead booked passage by ocean liner in response aau founded an american olympic association as a separate group although it was still initially dominated by aau representatives it then selected aoc in 1928 on resignation of then aoa president general douglas macarthur brundage was elected president of aoa he was also elected president of aoc a post he held for over 20 years in 1925 brundage became vice president of aau and chairman of its handball committee after a year as first vice president he became president in 1928 and kept post except for a one year break in 1933 through 1935 in that capacity he was able to secure peace between ncaa and aau with former gaining right to certify college students as amateurs and greater representation on aoa s executive board brundage quickly displayed what writer roger butterfield had termed a dictatorial temperament in a 1948 article for life magazine in 1929 american track star charlie paddock stated that brundage and other sports officials were making money for aoc by using him as a gate attraction while treating him badly brundage shot back accusing paddock of untruths and sensationalism of sort runner turned professional escaping brundage s jurisdiction in 1932 soon after winning three medals at 1932 summer olympics in los angeles track star mildred babe didrikson appeared in an automobile advertisement and brundage led aau quickly suspended her amateur status didrikson objected that she had not been paid and that regardless rules for maintaining amateur status were in first of several well publicized run ins he had with female athletes brundage replied that he had not had any problem with rules when an olympic athlete himself and stated you know ancient greeks kept women out of their athletic games they wouldn t even let them on sidelines i m not so sure but they were right according to butterfield brundage was suspicious of female athletes suspecting that some were actually men in disguise 1936 olympics fighting a boycott thumb left brundage left and other olympic officials on board and with captain of ss bremen en route to 1936 winter olympics in garmisch partenkirchen nazi germany in 1931 ioc awarded 1936 olympics to germany with winter games in bavaria and summer games in capital city of berlin after germany was selected several ioc members indicated that they were showing support for its democratic government which was under attack from extremists in hard economic times of great depression berlin games were thrown in doubt however by july 1932 elections in which nazi party led by adolf hitler unexpectedly won most seats in reichstag national legislature nazis had expressed little interest in international sport instead preferring idea of german games in which german athletes would compete without what they deemed subhuman untermenschen such as people of gypsy or african descent or of jewish religion thereby promoting their ideas of aryan racial superiority and germans as a master race when nazis attained power in january 1933 olympics were thought likely to be moved elsewhere although nazis were suspicious of chairman of local olympic organizing committee theodor lewald because he had a jewish grandmother they quickly saw propaganda potential in hosting olympic games lewald had intended to stage games on a shoestring budget instead reich threw its resources behind effort as nazi hatred of jews manifested itself in persecution there were calls to move olympics from germany or alternatively to boycott games as head of us olympic movement brundage received many letters and telegrams urging action in 1933 and 1934 ioc worked to assure that consistent with olympic ideals games would be open to all and that there would be no discrimination because of race or religion ioc president comte henri de baillet latour wrote to brundage in 1933 i am not personally fond of jews and of jewish influence but i will not have them molested in no way whatsoever according to historical writer christopher hilton in his account of 1936 games baillet latour and great and good around him had no idea what was coming and if ioc s german delegates kept offering assurances what else could they do but accept them baillet latour opposed boycotting games as did brundage who had learned in 1933 that he was being considered for ioc membership in her 1982 journal article on his role in us participation in 1936 summer games carolyn marvin explained brundage s political outlook nazi pledges of non discrimination in sports proved inconsistent with their actions such as expulsion of jews from sports clubs and in september 1934 brundage sailed for germany to see for himself he met with government officials and others although he was not allowed to meet with jewish sports leaders alone when he returned he reported i was given positive assurance in writing that there will be no discrimination against jews you can t ask more than that and i think guarantee will be fulfilled brundage s trip only increased controversy over question of us participation with new york congressman emanuel celler stating that brundage had situation before he sailed from america aoc heard a report from brundage on conditions in germany and announced its decision on september 26 1934 committee voted to send united states team to berlin brundage took position that as germans had reported non discrimination to ioc and ioc had accepted that report us olympic authorities were bound by that determination nevertheless it became increasingly apparent that nazi actions would prohibit any jew from securing a place on german team on this issue brundage stated that only 12 jews had ever represented germany in olympics and it would hardly be surprising if none did in 1936 people who had advocated a boycott were foiled by aoc and they turned to amateur athletic union hoping that organization though also led by brundage would refuse to certify american athletes for 1936 olympics although no vote took place on a boycott at aau s december 1934 meeting brundage did not seek re election and delegates elected judge jeremiah t mahoney as new president to take office in 1935 although pro boycott activities briefly fell into a lull renewed nazi brutality against jews in june 1935 sparked a resurgence and converted mahoney to pro boycott cause in october baillet latour wrote to three american ioc members william may garland charles sherrill and ernest lee jahncke asking them to do all they could to ensure a us team was sent to germany garland and sherrill agreed jahncke however refused stating that he would be supporting boycott brundage at baillet latour s request took lead in anti boycott campaign matters came to a head at aau convention in december 1935 brundage s forces won key votes and aau approved sending a team to berlin specifying that this did not mean it supported nazis brundage was not magnanimous in victory demanding resignation of opponents although not all quit mahoney did brundage believed that boycott controversy could be used effectively for fundraising writing fact that jews are against us will arouse interest among thousands of people who have never subscribed before if they are properly approached in march 1936 he wrote to advertising mogul albert lasker a jew complaining that a large number of misguided jews still persist in attempting to hamper activities of american olympic committee result of course is increased support from one hundred and twenty million non jews in united states for this is a patriotic enterprise in a letter which david large in his book on 1936 games terms heavy handed brundage suggested that by helping to finance american participation in olympic games jews could decrease anti semitism in us however lasker to his credit refused to be blackmailed writing to brundage that you gratuitously insult not only jews but millions of patriotic christians in america for whom you venture to speak without warrant and whom you so tragically misrepresent in your letter berlin right thumb julius lippert avery brundage and theodor lewald organizer of 1936 olympics in berlin brundage led contingent of american athletes and officials who embarked for hamburg on s s manhattan at new york harbor on july 15 1936 immediately upon arrival in germany brundage became headline news when he and aoc dismissed swimmer eleanor holm who was a gold medalist in 1932 and expected to repeat for getting drunk at late night parties and missing her curfew there were various rumors and accounts of married swimmer s pursuits while on board ship gossip included statements that she was at an all night party with playwright charles macarthur who was traveling without his wife actress helen hayes brundage discussed matter with fellow aoc members then met with holm although aoc attempted to send her home holm pleaded in vain for reinstatement to aoc s horror she remained in berlin as a journalist in later years holm claimed that brundage had kicked her off team because he had propositioned her and she had turned him down according to guttmann brundage has appeared ever since 1936 in guise of a butterfield noted that through efforts of sportswriters who supported holm brundage became celebrated as a tyrant snob hypocrite dictator and stuffed shirt as well as just about meanest man in whole world of sports on july 30 1936 six days after american arrival in germany ioc met in berlin and unanimously expelled jahncke two places for united states were vacant as sherrill had died in june but minutes specifically note that brundage was elected to ioc in jahncke s place one of sensations of games was black american track star jesse owens who won four gold medals according to some american press stories hitler left stadium rather than shake hands with him this was not case ioc president baillet latour had told hitler not to shake hands with winners unless he was prepared to shake hands with all gold medalists which he was not this however was not publicized according to butterfield in later years retellings of what brundage termed a fairy tale roused american to acute fury hitler was however asked by his youth leader baldur von schirach to meet owens and he refused saying do you really think that i d allow myself to be photographed shaking hands with a negro question of us 4 x 100 meters relay squad was another controversy that may have involved brundage scheduled team included sprinters sam stoller and marty glickman who were both jewish after owens won his third gold medal both men were removed from relay squad in favor of owens and fellow black athlete ralph metcalfe us track coach lawson robertson told stoller and glickman that germans had upgraded their squad and it was important to have fastest team possible in event us team turned in back to back world record times in heats and final to take gold medal italians were a distant second edging out germans for silver medal stoller and glickman who were only jews on us track team and only american athletes who went to berlin and did not compete did not believe stated reason for their replacement stoller recorded in his diary that he and glickman had been left out of relay because two other participants foy draper and frank had been coached by one of robertson s assistants at university of southern california glickman conceded college favoritism as a possible reason but thought anti semitism more likely and his position that he and stoller had been replaced so as not to embarrass hitler by having him see jews as well as blacks win gold medals for us track team hardened in following years he believed brundage was behind replacement brundage denied any involvement in decision which remains controversial glickman went on to a lengthy career as a sports broadcaster and was given inaugural douglas macarthur award for lifetime achievement in field of sports in 1998 after stoller s death by united states olympic committee successor to aoc usoc chairman william hybl stated that while he had seen no written proof that brundage was responsible i was a prosecutor i m used to looking at evidence evidence was there though as large notes exactly what evidence he didn t say in report that he submitted after games brundage called controversy absurd he noted that glickman and stoller had finished fifth and sixth at olympic trials at new york s randall s island stadium and that us victory had validated

ioc baron de of switzerland had died and sweden s sigfrid edstrom was elected to replace him brundage was selected to fill edstrom s place on executive board edstrom had been a brundage ally in boycott fight writing to american that while he did not desire persecution of jews as an intelligent and unscrupulous people they had to be kept within certain limits brundage wrote to a german correspondent regretting that leni riefenstahl s film about berlin olympics olympia could not be commercially shown in united states as unfortunately theaters and moving picture companies are almost all owned by jews berlin games had increased brundage s admiration for germany and he spoke out at a speech before german american bund at madison square garden in october 1936 stating that five years ago they germans were discouraged and demoralized today they are united sixty million people believing in themselves and in their country in 1938 his construction company received contract to build a new german embassy in washington this was not fulfilled as world war ii intervened brundage joined keep america out of war committee and became a member of america first he resigned from both day

climate brundage was one of leaders in founding of pan american games participating in initial discussions in august 1940 in buenos aires on his return he arranged for american olympic association to be renamed united states of america sports federation which would organize united states olympic committee as aoc would now be called and another committee to see to american participation in pan american games brundage became an early member of international pan american games commission although inaugural event in buenos aires was postponed because of war and was eventually held in 1951 with brundage present despite his role in founding them brundage viewed pan american games as imitative with no true link with antiquity war postponed any future olympics and fractured ioc geographically and politically with baillet latour in german occupied belgium brundage and ioc vice president edstrom did their best to keep channels of communication open between ioc members according to guttmann he and edstrom perceived themselves as keepers of sacred flame guardians of an ideal in whose name they were ready once again to act as soon as madness ended baillet latour died in 1942 edstrom took on duties of president although he continued to style himself vice president edstrom and brundage did not await end of war to rebuild olympic movement brundage even sent parcels to europe in aid of ioc members and others in places where food was scarce with edstrom turning 74 in 1944 swede expressed concern as to who would lead ioc if he should die and suggested that brundage become second vice

brundage served on a commission appointed at ioc s london session in 1948 to recommend whether 1906 intercalated games held in athens should be considered a full olympic games all three members of what came to be known as brundage commission were from western hemisphere and met in new orleans in january 1949 commission found that there was nothing to be gained by recognizing 1906 games as olympic and it might set an embarrassing precedent full ioc endorsed report when it met later that year in rome edstrom intended to retire following 1952 summer olympics in helsinki when a successor would be elected brundage s rival for presidency was great britain s lord burghley an olympic gold medalist in track in 1928 and president of international amateur athletic federation iaaf balloting took place at ioc session in finnish capital before games although brundage was executive board s candidate he was disliked by some ioc members others felt that president should be a european private notes kept during balloting reveal it to have been very close but on 25th and final ballot brundage received 30 votes to 17 for burghley and was elected ioc president 1952 1972 thumb brundage center seated surrounded by others who had served as amateur athletic union officials at 1963 aau convention amateurism throughout his career as a sports official according to guttmann brundage was unquestionably an idealist he often concluded speeches by quoting from john galsworthy this ideal was best realized brundage believed in amateur sports athlete he stated should compete for love of game itself without thought of reward or payment of any kind with professionals being part of entertainment business amateurism to brundage expressed concept of renaissance man with abilities in many fields yet a specialist in none as definition of amateur varied by sport many of battles brundage engaged in concerned question of what money or valuables an athlete could accept while retaining their amateur status with some sports more liberal than others 1948 tennis allowed expense payments of up to 600 per tournament while boxing permitted valuable prizes as awards enforcement of these rules often fell to national olympic committees and brundage found them less than enthusiastic about rules which hampered their own athletes in pursuit of medals thumb left brundage lower left back to camera presents a silver medal to swedish cross country skier rolf squaw valley 1960 both before and after becoming ioc president brundage was involved in a number of controversies involving threats to or sometimes actual disqualification of athletes for breach of amateur rules in 1932 he was part of a special committee of iaaf which disqualified finnish runner paavo nurmi from los angeles games for allegedly accepting monetary compensation at 1948 winter olympics in st moritz rival us ice hockey teams sponsored by different accrediting organizations one from aau and other from ahaus came to games dispute proved difficult and ioc initially voted to cancel tournament and eliminate ice hockey as an olympic sport but relented as organizers had sold thousands of tickets a compromise was then reached aau team backed by brundage and aoc would march in opening ceremony while ahaus team not favored by brundage but supported by forerunner to today s iihf and featuring current and former professional players were allowed to compete but could not earn an olympic medal however since at time olympic hockey tournament also doubled as that year s ice hockey world championships their results would be recorded for that competition in which they finished fourth in 1972 brundage banned austrian skier karl from sapporo winter olympics for commercial activities calling him a walking billboard eastern bloc countries were notorious for skirting edge of rules by having state sponsored full time amateurs their olympic athletes were given everything they needed to live and train but were not technically paid to do it and all money came from government soviet union entered teams of athletes who were all nominally students soldiers or working in a profession but many of whom were in reality paid by state to train on a full time basis this put self financed amateurs of western countries at a disadvantage near end of 1960s canadian amateur hockey association caha felt their amateur players could no longer be competitive against soviet team s full time athletes and other constantly improving european teams they pushed for ability to use professional players but met opposition from iihf and ioc brundage was opposed to idea of amateurs and professionals competing together at iihf congress in 1969 organization decided to allow canada to use nine non nhl

olympics because of ioc s amateur only policy story 6 first canada cup opens up hockey world as ioc president brundage s views on amateurism came increasingly to be seen as outdated in modern world as rules were tested by athletes who saw everyone making money but themselves in 1962 against brundage s opposition ioc amended rules to allow sports federations to offer athletes broken time payments compensating them for time missed from work but only if they had dependents in need in 1972 brundage called for elimination of winter olympics after 1976 finding them hopelessly polluted by rampant commercialism especially in alpine skiing in his final speech to ioc in munich in 1972 brundage maintained his position on amateurism there are only two kinds of competitors those free and independent individuals who are interested in sports for sport s sake and those in sports for financial reasons olympic glory is for amateurs national participation controversies germany no german team was allowed at 1948 summer olympics in london or winter games in st moritz brundage was anxious to reintegrate germany into olympic movement once federal republic of germany west germany through brundage s lifetime was formed in 1949 soon after state s formation its national olympic committee approached ioc seeking recognition but there was still much animus towards germany just prior to ioc session in vienna in 1951 brundage was still vice president german democratic republic east germany also formed an noc and requested recognition this created controversy as federal republic and its noc claimed to represent both west and east germany but did not control latter despite lengthy discussions no resolution was reached in 1951 and matter was put over until february 1952 when a negotiating session was scheduled for copenhagen although east germans came to copenhagen they refused to attend session which was eventually cancelled by edstrom after ioc officials and west germans waited for hours in vain german team which competed in helsinki that summer was entirely west german in 1954 east germans resumed their attempts at recognition following year after brundage received assurances that east german noc was not government run ioc voted to recognize it but required that both east and west germany compete as part of a single german team in 1956 east germany sent only 37 athletes to 1956 summer olympics in melbourne and they lived and trained separately from their west german counterparts for summer olympics at rome in 1960 under continuing ioc insistence that two states send a single team east germany contributed 141 of 321 athletes competitors from both states lived in same area of olympic village at opening ceremony at rome italian president giovanni gronchi marveled much to brundage s delight that ioc had obtained german reunification which politicians had been unable to secure brundage responded but in sport we do such things brundage saw german participation as symbolic of potential for olympic games to overcome divisions to unite despite construction of berlin wall beginning in 1961 which increased tensions between east and west brundage was successful in securing a joint german team for 1964 summer olympics in tokyo nevertheless east germans supported by ioc members from warsaw pact nations aspired to have their own team they made a major breakthrough when iaaf led by marquess of exeter former lord burghley recognized a separate east german team beginning with 1966 european athletics championships east germans did their best to get brundage s support and at ioc session at mexico city in 1968 they were granted full membership with their own team under their own flag which they displayed on west german soil four years later at opening ceremony at munich brundage while finally supporting full membership for east germany considered matter a defeat for olympic ideals soviet union although czarist russia had sent athletes to olympic games after soviet union was formed it declined to participate considering olympics bourgeois as early as 1923 ioc attempted to lure soviets back into fold brundage visited ussr in 1934 he was impressed by progress which had been made there since a visit he had made in 1912 after competing in stockholm despite his anti communism brundage wanted soviets to join olympic movement according to guttmann when brundage had to choose between his hostility to communism and his commitment to ideal of olympic universality he chose latter he wanted russians sic in olympics communists or not during world war ii brundage wrote to other ioc members that he had no objection to soviet involvement in international sports with representation on ioc if ussr joined international sports federations isfs ioc required that an noc be independent of government of territory which it represents there were concerns a soviet noc would not be this was a problem not unique to communist states a number of latin americans countries were starting to bring local nocs into political structure with an official naming noc chair who might even be country s political leader this mixture of sports and politics worried brundage beginning in 1946 soviets began to join international federations in 1951 their noc was recognized by ioc and they began olympic competition following year as few soviet sports officials were internationally known ioc had little alternative than to accept nominees of ussr s government if they wished to have soviet ioc members soviet members were believers in sport and completely loyal to their nation and to communist ideals they quickly became leaders of ioc members from behind iron curtain who voted in accord with soviet members brundage visited ussr at soviet invitation though at his own expense in 1954 he deemed nation s physical education program as creating greatest army of athletes world has ever seen warning as he would often through 1950s that americans were by comparison soft and unfit brundage found his view often expressed in press that physical education and competitive sports made for better citizens especially in event of war more enthusiastically embraced in soviet union than in united states according to david maraniss in his account of 1960 rome games brundage s admiration for soviet union s sports programs in some ways mirrored his response two decades earlier to his encounters with nazi germany on his return he related in an article for saturday evening post that he had confronted soviet officials with information from defectors stating that ussr was running year round training camps and giving athletes material inducements for success he also repeated soviet response which questioned defectors integrity these men are deserters traitors would you attach any truth to their statements had they been americans and had turned against your country since brundage did not comment on response there was a storm of controversy in press which accused brundage of being a soviet dupe despite evident conflicts between amateurism and soviet system in which athletes received salaries and property at state expense allowing them to train full time brundage took no action against ussr or warsaw pact nations with similar systems when challenged on this point he argued that western nations did similar things citing athletic scholarships as an example soviet system remained in place https www cia gov library readingroom docs cia rdp80 1 www cia gov library readingroom docs cia rdp80 0 pdf china and taiwan republic of china which then governed mainland had joined olympic movement in 1924 when china national amateur athletic federation was recognized by ioc as nation s noc china participated in 1932 olympics in los angeles as well as in berlin four years later and first post war olympics at london in 1948 when communists were successful in chinese civil war and established people s republic of china prc in 1949 most noc members fled mainland for island of taiwan this left china with two rival nocs one on mainland and one on taiwan each claiming to represent whole of china matters came to a head in 1952 when mainland noc all china athletic federation considering itself a continuation of pre 1949 committee wrote to ioc stating that it desired to participate in helsinki olympics to be held that year as taiwanese also proposed to send a team this conflicted with ioc rules stating that only one committee could represent a country and both chinese groups were unwilling to negotiate with other or to send a joint team after considerable deliberation ioc decided that if either committee was recognized by isf for a sport committee could send athletes to participate in events in that discipline in protest taiwan withdrew from games prc sent a team to helsinki though it arrived ten days after start of games brundage president elect when decision was made to allow prc athletes to compete argued against decision to allow mainland participation before its noc was recognized but he was overruled by his colleagues in 1954 brundage headed ioc in a narrow vote recognized both committees thus allowing both states to participate at melbourne only prc s committee initially accepted but when taiwanese noc changed its mind and decided to send a team to games mainlanders withdrew in protest brundage took position that despite similar concerns about state sponsorship as with ussr once prc s committee was recognized and reported to ioc that all eligibility rules were observed international committee had to accept that unless it had evidence to contrary he was frustrated by continuing controversy considering squabble a distraction from goal of advancing olympic movement when continuing efforts to exclude taiwanese failed in 1958 mainlanders withdrew from ioc following year ioc ruled taiwanese could not compete under name republic of china olympic committee but would have to compete under some other name which did not imply they governed sports in china brundage and exeter both advocated for ruling which they compared to having an italian noc represent only sicily press interpreted ruling to mean that nationalist china had been expelled from olympic movement and for next year anti communist brundage found himself under attack in press as a communist sympathizer although united states state department officials attempted to persuade them to stand on principle taiwanese officials decided to participate in rome games hoping to secure china s first medal and believing their noc s continued presence helped keep mainland china out of games taiwanese athletes competed under designation formosa an alternate name for taiwan and caused a sensation by briefly displaying a sign reading under protest at opening ceremony when yang chuan kwang took silver medal in decathlon he was not allowed to display nationalist chinese flag at medals ceremony brundage through his tenure slowly came around to position advocated by iron curtain ioc members that important thing was to recognize mainland with taiwan of less importance although mainland chinese were invited by munich olympic organizers to send an observer delegation to munich they declined due to taiwanese presence it was not until 1975 after brundage s departure as president that prc applied to rejoin olympic movement prc again participated at 1980 winter games at lake placid and then 1984 summer olympics in los angeles island noc competed as republic of china in 1968 and 1972 when refused permission to compete under that name in 1976 after brundage s death it boycotted 1976 and 1980 games returning in 1984 as chinese taipei south africa and rhodesia in late 1950s protest against south africa s apartheid regime reached stage of seeking to exclude nation from international sport in 1956 government rules requiring separate events for whites and non whites in south africa were issued non whites received poorer facilities brundage initially opposed taking any action run up to 1960 rome olympics had seen tumult in south africa including sharpeville massacre and a crackdown on african national congress activists attempted to persuade brundage that south africa should be excluded from games brundage initially took word of south african sport leaders that all citizens were able to compete for a place on olympic team and that non white south africans simply were not good enough drive towards a boycott was fueled by large number of african nations which became independent in late 1950s and early 1960s to prevent new nations from overwhelming isfs brundage proposed that federations adopt weighted voting systems to allow earlier members to wield disproportionate influence which some did by 1962 with suspension of south africa from fifa association football governing body brundage had come around to position that south africa s racist policies were inconsistent with ideals of olympic movement at 1963 ioc session in baden baden moved there from nairobi when kenyan officials refused to issue visas to south african representatives ioc voted to suspend south africa from olympics unless its noc and government adopted non discrimination policies regarding olympic selection this did not come to pass and south africa did not participate in 1964 in 1968 brundage and ioc invited a south african team supposedly to be multiracial to mexico city games but under a threatened boycott and with evidence of minimal south african compliance withdrew it in 1971 ioc at its amsterdam session voted to strip south african noc of recognition although brundage had hoped to keep south africa within olympic movement he believed that those who sought its expulsion had made stronger case south africa did not return to olympics until 1992 summer olympics in barcelona after end of its apartheid government a parallel problem was that of rhodesia british colony which had unilaterally declared its independence from great britain in 1965 rhodesia had a white minority government in may 1968 united nations security council condemned its government and asked nations not to honor its passports and mexican government set to host olympics later that year complied with ban ioc initially believed that sports facilities in breakaway colony were not segregated despite its government s policies proposed 16 member olympic team included two black athletes because of this brundage supported rhodesian participation at mexico city but he was overruled by ioc according to head of rhodesian olympic committee douglas downing his voice cries in a wilderness of spite for munich in 1972 ioc decided to allow rhodesians to compete as british subjects which by international law they were african nations again threatened to boycott if rhodesians were allowed to participate and at its munich session in 1972 just before games ioc narrowly voted to exclude rhodesians brundage was livid at decision believing that ioc had yielded to blackmail in 1974 after brundage left office ioc found evidence of segregated facilities in rhodesia and it subsequently withdrew recognition from its noc rhodesia returned to olympics in 1980 as recognized independent zimbabwe olympic administration challenges to leadership thumb right maison de mon repos in parc de mon repos was home of ioc between 1922 and 1967 unpaid as ioc president even for his expenses brundage sometimes spent 50 000 per year to finance his role in 1960 ioc had almost no funds brundage and ioc had considered potential of television revenue as early as melbourne games of 1956 but had been slow to address issue with result that television rights for 1960 games were in hands of rome organizing committee ioc received only 5 of 60 000 rights fee accounts submitted by rome organizers showed they lost money on olympics ioc would have received a portion of profits and had no money to offer sports federations who wanted a percentage of proceeds in future years sale of television rights became a major source of revenue for ioc rising to 10 million by 1968 summer olympics in mexico city and 1 2 billion long after brundage s death at athens in 2004 brundage was concerned about increasing revenue warning ioc members in 1967 moment we handle money even if we only distribute it there will be trouble noc representatives had met with brundage and ioc executive board from time to time but many noc representatives felt that brundage was taking no action in response to concerns expressed by noc attendees in early 1960s many nocs led by italian ioc member giulio onesti sought to bypass brundage and ioc by forming a permanent general assembly of national olympic committees pga noc which brundage strongly opposed and ioc refused to recognize pga noc from 1965 demanded a share of television revenue it also desired that isfs not ioc set policy on amateurism thumb left brundage left examines facilities at squaw valley 1960 winter olympics brundage had been initially elected in 1952 for an eight year term he was re elected unanimously in 1960 for an additional four years despite talk that he would be opposed by exeter brundage s 1952 rival nominated him for new term brundage was re elected in 1964 by an announced unanimous vote though guttmann records that brundage actually only narrowly turned back a challenge by exeter as brundage s term as president neared its end in 1968 some ioc members who saw him as hidebound or just too old at 81 to effectively lead organization sought his ouster nevertheless he was easily re elected at ioc session in mexico city that year though he pledged not to seek another four year term but to retire in 1972 ireland s lord killanin was elected first vice president killanin seen correctly as brundage s likely successor was more sympathetic to concerns of nocs and attended pga noc meetings brundage did not recognize pga noc but did establish joint ioc noc committees to address noc concerns although pga noc did not gain olympic recognition it remained a significant outside organization through brundage s presidency and according to guttmann brundage won a less than total victory and onesti suffered a far from complete defeat i o c had become far more attractive to national olympic committees and to their interests and that is what onesti called for in first place with brundage in chicago or at his california home day to day ioc operations were overseen at mon repos ioc headquarters in lausanne by otto meyer ioc s chancellor brundage came to consider meyer too impetuous and dismissed him in 1964 abolishing office eventually brundage promoted monique berlioux to be ioc director in last years of his tenure and apparently found her services satisfactory mon repos former home of founder of modern olympics baron pierre de coubertin proved too cramped for ioc which had to share space with de coubertin s widow who lived to be 101 in 1968 ioc moved to new quarters at lausanne s chateau de vidy political demonstration at mexico city year 1968 had seen turmoil in united states including riots and assassination of civil rights leader martin luther king prior to olympics in mexico city in october 1968 some african americans led by activist harry edwards had urged a boycott of games but found little enthusiasm among athletes reluctant to waste years of effort atmosphere was made more tense by unrest in mexico city before games which left dozens dead there were racial tensions between black us athletes and their white counterparts in one incident african americans blocked whites from track one black runner tommie smith told writers on october 15 i don t want brundage presenting me any medals following day smith won 200 meters and fellow african american john carlos took bronze medal two men after receiving their medals from iaaf president lord exeter and as star spangled banner played raised black gloved fists heads down in salute of black power brundage deemed it to be a domestic political statement unfit for apolitical international forum olympic games were intended to be in response to their actions he ordered smith and carlos suspended from us team and banned from olympic village when us olympic committee refused brundage threatened to ban entire us track team this threat led to expulsion of two athletes from games on this day tommie smith and john carlos give black power salute on olympic podium findingdulcinea com retrieved on 13 june 2015 other demonstrations by african americans also took place three african americans who took medals in 400 meters race led by gold medalist lee evans wore black berets on podium but took them off before anthem while african american boxer george foreman triumphant in heavyweight division waved a small american flag around boxing ring and bowed to crowd with fellow american boxers brundage s comment about smith carlos incident was warped mentalities and cracked personalities seem to be everywhere and impossible to eliminate usoc s official report omits iconic photograph of smith and carlos with their fists raised local organizing committee s official film showed footage of ceremony brundage who termed incident nasty demonstration against american flag by negroes objected in vain to its inclusion munich 1972 at same ioc session in august 1972 in munich at which rhodesians were excluded ioc elected killanin as brundage s successor to take office after games brundage cast a blank ballot in vote which selected irishman considering him an intellectual lightweight without force of character needed to hold olympic movement together thumb right munich olympic stadium where brundage gave his speech on september 6 1972 brundage hoped that munich games would take sting out of his defeat over rhodesian issue munich was one of his favorite cities and spiele cheerful games were designed to efface memories of 1936 and berlin in eyes of world they initially seemed to be doing so as athletic feats like those of gymnast olga and swimmer mark spitz captivated viewers in early morning of september 5 1972 palestinian terrorists from organization black september entered olympic village and took 11 israelis hostage demanding freedom for hundreds of palestinians held in israeli custody brundage once informed rushed to olympic village where he conferred with german and bavarian state officials through day playing what guttmann describes as a modest role in discussions german officials moved hostages and their captors to air base where german police and troops tried a rescue late that evening attempt was bungled nine remaining hostages two had been murdered earlier and three of their captors were killed even before ill fated rescue attempt ioc officials began conferring killanin and other officials were in kiel for yacht racing they hurried back to munich just before 4 pm brundage called off remainder of day s events and announced a memorial service honoring those who had already died for following morning many olympic leaders were critical of brundage for his participation in discussions with government feeling that this should have been left for authorities and local organizing committee but all supported memorial service which was held following day in olympic stadium there before audience in stadium and millions watching on television brundage offered what guttmann called credo of his life crowd in stadium responded to brundage s statement with loud applause according to stars stripes brundage s statement that games must go on took much of heavy gloom away which has permeated munich since early tuesday september 5 day of attack killanin after his own retirement as ioc president stated that i believe brundage was right to continue and that his stubborn determination saved olympic movement one more time but that brundage s mention of rhodesian question was while not inappropriate at least better left for another time according to future ioc vice president dick pound insertion of rhodesian issue into speech was universally condemned and brundage left office under a cloud of criticism that effectively undermined a lifetime of well intentioned work in olympic movement brundage subsequently issued a statement that he did not mean to imply decision to exclude rhodesians which he stated was purely a matter of sport was comparable to murder of israelis according to alfred senn in his history of olympics decision to continue games sat poorly with many observers sportswriter red smith of new york times was among critics retirement and death thumb left brundage left with university of illinois president john corbally 1974 announcing avery brundage scholarships brundage retired as ioc president after 1972 summer games there were differing accounts of brundage s state of mind during his retirement ioc director berlioux stated that brundage would come to chateau de vidy and take telephone calls or look at correspondence while he waited for lord killanin to turn to him for help according to berlioux brundage sometimes called her from geneva and asked her to go there two would spend hours wandering streets saying little brundage s longtime factotum frederick ruegsegger described a different tranquil brundage whom he compared to an abdicated japanese emperor his wife of nearly half a century elizabeth to whom he had not been faithful died in 1971 brundage had once jested that his ambition was to wed a german princess in june 1973 this came to pass when he married princess mariann charlotte katharina stefanie von reuss 1936 2003 daughter of heinrich xxxvii prince of reuss von reuss had worked as an interpreter during munich games she stated that she had met brundage in 1955 when she was 19 when brundage was asked by reporters about 48 year difference in their ages brundage responded that he was young for his age and she mature for hers and instead of 85 years to 37 it should be thought of as more like 55 to 46 ruegsegger refused to be best man and stated after brundage s death that couple had dissipated much of brundage s fortune through free spending though guttmann notes that some of those purchases were of real estate which could be deemed investments in january 1974 brundage underwent surgery for cataracts and glaucoma necessary arrangements had initially been made by brundage s protege spanish ioc member juan antonio samaranch who would become ioc president in 1980 at last moment brundage cancelled plans choosing to have surgery in munich near home he had purchased in garmisch partenkirchen site of 1936 winter olympics after a month and a half brundage was discharged from hospital though whether surgery had improved his vision was disputed with mariann brundage stating that it did and ruegsegger stating contrary now frail at age 87 he went with his wife on a final tour of far east despite

business career relationships at age 40 in 1927 brundage married his first wife elizabeth dunlap who was daughter of a chicago banker she was a trained soprano which was a talent that she exhibited to people who visited brundage home she had a strong interest in classical music this interest might not have been fully shared by her husband who said that a performance of wagner s die walkure started at 7 o clock at 10 00 pm i looked at my watch and it registered exactly 8 o clock elizabeth died at age 81 in 1971 in 1973 brundage married princess mariann charlotte katharina stefanie von he had no children with either of his two wives during his first marriage however brundage fathered two sons out of wedlock with his finnish mistress lilian dresden his affair with dresden was one of many children were born in 1951 and 1952 at precisely time that brundage was being considered for presidency of ioc though he privately acknowledged paternity brundage took great pains to conceal existence of these children he was concerned that truth about his extra marital relationships might damage his chances of election he requested that his name be kept off birth certificates brundage visited his two sons periodically in 1950s visits that tailed off to telephone calls in 1960s and nothing in his final years he did establish a trust fund for boys education and start in life but after his death unnamed in his will they sued and won a small settlement of 62 500 each out of his 19 million estate construction executive thumb right chicago s la salle hotel which brundage owned for many years

brompton apartments 1924 overlooking lincoln park were built in five months allowing start of 40 000 in monthly rental income offsetting a monthly mortgage payment of 15 000 often brundage company was involved in ownership of apartments 3800 sheridan road 1927 a 17 story building costing 3 180 000 was owned by a company which had as its president and treasurer chester brundage avery s younger brother it was constructed in eight months through chicago winter using an onsite concrete mixing plant this temporary structure also provided office space for construction another source of income for brundage and his company was hotel construction for which he was often paid in part with stock in new facility one president of an engineering firm specializing in large structures called brundage s methods on shoreham hotel progressive snappy and up to date and straightforward and honest in 1923 brundage constructed a massive assembly plant on torrence avenue on chicago s south side for ford

due to corruption he built 23rd street viaduct as part of south shore development project brundage s viaduct extended chicago s shoreline into lake michigan at a cost of two million dollars by 1925 avery brundage company was acclaimed for speed innovation and quality and had a payroll of 50 000 a week although start of depression in 1929 was a major setback for brundage he rebuilt his wealth by investments in real estate also accepting interests in buildings he had constructed in lieu of payments owners were unable to make he later stated that you didn t have to be a wizard in order to buy stocks and bonds in depressed corporations for a few cents on dollar and then wait i was just a little lucky according to historian and archivist maynard brundage emerged from difficult depression years with a substantial annual income a good reputation and excellent investments his foresight resulted in a fortune which by 1960 was estimated at 25 000 000 a major brundage investment was chicago s la salle hotel which had been built in 1908 located in heart of loop and city s financial district brundage first leased it in 1940 later purchasing it when hotel was seriously damaged by fire in 1946 brundage spent about 2 5 million remodeling and modernizing it as brundage made a home there during his time as ioc president hotel became famous in international sports as his residence he sold hotel in 1970 but later reclaimed it when purchaser failed to make required payments art collector and benefactor thumb left a seated chinese buddha dated 338 making it earliest known dated buddha figure formerly owned by brundage and now in asian art museum of san francisco brundage s interest in asian art stemmed from a visit he made to an exhibition of chinese art at royal academy in london in early 1936 after winter olympics in garmisch partenkirchen brundage stated of experience we his first wife elizabeth and himself spent a week at exhibition and i came away so enamored with chinese art that i ve been broke ever since he did not begin active collecting until after brundages two week visit to japan in april 1939 where they visited yokohama kyoto osaka nara and nikko they followed up japan with visits to shanghai and hong kong but due to war between japan and china were unable to explore further on avery brundage s only visit to mainland china this disappointment bothered him his whole life on his return to united states after june 1939 ioc session in london brundage systematically set about becoming a major collector of asian art unsettled conditions caused wealthy chinese to sell family heirlooms and prices were depressed making it an opportune moment to collect he bought many books on asian art stating in an interview that a major library is an indispensable tool after us entered world war ii stock owned by japanese dealers in united states was impounded brundage was able to purchase best items dealers found him willing to spend money but knowledgeable and a hard bargainer brundage rarely was fooled by forgeries and was undeterred by few he did buy noting that in asian art fake pieces were often a thousand years old in his 1948 article on brundage for life butterfield noted that his collection is regarded as one of largest and most important in private hands in this country brundage engaged french scholar rene yvon lefebvre d then teaching at university of california as full time curator of his collection and advisor on acquisitions two men made a deal no piece would be purchased unless both men agreed they built a collection of jade which ranged from neolithic period to modern era and hundreds of chinese japanese and korean bronzes mostly buddhas and bodhisattvas painter whom brundage admired most was huizong 12th century chinese emperor of song dynasty collector never was able to obtain any of his work brundage several times bought pieces smuggled out of their lands of origin to restore them there when brundage sold a piece it was most likely because he no longer favored it artistically rather than to realize a profit in 1954 a financial statement prepared for brundage listed value of his collection as more than 1 million in 1960 robert shaplen in his article on brundage for new yorker noted that brundage during his travels as ioc president always found time to visit art dealers and stated that collection was valued at 15 million by late 1950s brundage was increasingly concerned about what to do with his collection his homes in chicago and california were so overwhelmed with art that priceless artifacts were kept in under beds in 1959 brundage agreed to give part of his collection to city of san francisco following year city voters passed a bond issue of 2 725 000 to house donation result was asian art museum of san francisco which opened in 1966 in golden gate park initially sharing space with m h de young memorial museum before moving to its own facility near civic center in 2003 brundage made another major donation in 1969 despite a fire which destroyed many pieces at his california home la near santa barbara in 1964 and left remainder of his collection to museum in his will today museum has 7 700 pieces from brundage among 17 000 plus objects which make up its collection brundage connected world of art and that of amateur sports in his own mind in a speech to ioc session in tokyo in 1958 he discussed netsuke used at one time by japanese to anchor items hung from kimono sashes and of which he owned several thousand he held two in his hands as he spoke he told members that a netsuke was at one time carefully carved by man who wore it building something of himself into design and although a class of professional netsuke makers arose later whose work might have been more technically adept it was ordinarily cold stiff and without imagination missing was element of amateur carver which causes these netsuke to be esteemed so much higher by collector than commercial product carved for money brundage later commented about his speech here was difference between amateurism and professionalism spelled out in a netsuke legacy retrospective news coverage has sometimes judged brundage harshly in may 2012 independent dubbed him ancient ioc emperor anti semite and nazi sympathiser bent on insulating games from meddlesome tentacles of real world orange county register stated that brundage s racism and anti semitism are well documented and new york daily news averred that brundage admired hitler and infamously replaced two jewish sprinters on 4 by 100 relay team because it could have further embarrassed hitler if they won brundage left an uncertain legacy guttmann notes that in 1960s brundage may have been better known as an art collector than for his sports activities and there are those who maintain that he will be remembered not for his career in sports but for his and bronzes andrew leigh a member of australian house of representatives criticizes brundage for expelling two athletes in mexico city calling him a man who d had no difficulty with nazi salute being used in 1936 olympics whiteman hilary august 21 2012 apology urged for australian olympian in 1968 black power protest cnn dick pound believes brundage to have been one of ioc s great presidents along with de coubertin and samaranch but concedes that by end of his term brundage was out of touch with world of sports while pound credits brundage with holding olympic movement together in a period when it was beset by many challenges he notes that this might not be fully appreciated
