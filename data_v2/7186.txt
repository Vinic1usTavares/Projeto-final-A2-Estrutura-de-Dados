juliet some see romeo s supposed love for rosaline as childish as compared with his true love for juliet others argue that apparent difference in romeo s feelings shows shakespeare s improving skill since shakespeare is thought to have written early drafts of play in 1591 and then picked them up again in 1597 to create final copy change in romeo s language for rosaline and juliet may mirror shakespeare s increased skill as a playwright younger shakespeare describing rosaline and more experienced describing juliet in this view a careful look at play reveals that romeo s love for rosaline is not as petty as usually imagined critics also note ways in which romeo s relationship with rosaline prepares him for meeting juliet before meeting rosaline romeo despises all capulets but afterwards looks upon them more favourably he experiences dual feelings of hate and love in one relationship this prepares him for more mature relationship with juliet one fraught by feud between
