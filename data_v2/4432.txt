nearby and rallies dothraki by stating that she chooses them all to be her bloodriders rather than traditional three chosen by khals she then asks if they will cross narrow sea with her and help her retake seven kingdoms which they unanimously agree to do production writing left thumb upright series veteran bryan cogman wrote episode his first of two episodes of season blood of my blood was written by bryan cogman cogman has been a writer for series since its beginning previously writing seven other episodes as well as subsequent episode title of episode blood of my blood is a reference to famous dothraki saying between a khal and his bloodriders in an interview with entertainment weekly cogman described some of thought process he had when writing reunion between samwell and his family saying as much as sam has gone through i love exploring those family dynamics his mother and sister and brother are all fundamentally decent people but his father is just a cold hearted bastard when it comes to his distant son there s a painful part of scene where his father just unloads on him and tells him every hateful thing he ever thought about him and sam can t defend himself we found that fascinating sam has killed a man he s killed a white walker he s emerged as such a great hero but he still can t stand up to his dad cogman noted about arya storyline in same interview that he comes from a theater background and that being able to comment on show and reactions to show through players were so much fun show is often accused of being gratuitous in all kinds of way violence and bigness of characters it s a huge operatic story we re able to lovingly spoof ourselves but also play with ideas about how audiences view show good and bad and how a perspective of a story changes plus there s dramatic deliciousness of arya watching her own life play out on stage weiss also spoke about arya saying we were excited to do play within play and it s a distorted fun house mirror representation of things we ve already seen benioff continued part of arya s amusement is just that she knows that they re getting so many details wrong but she always regretted that she didn t have a chance to watch joffrey die and now she gets to it s obviously a comic version of it but that gives her great pleasure weiss also noted arya is slowly getting seduced by these performances and lady crane actress that she s charged with killing this is somebody who like her has taken as her life s work job of becoming other people in regards to final scene of episode with daenerys targaryen riding drogon and emboldening her newly acquired khalasar benioff stated in inside episode featurette that scene is a reflection of speech that khal drogo gave before his death with benioff saying one of our favorite moments from season one was watching khal drogo deliver a speech to his gathered khalasar that speech clearly lingered in daenerys s mind and she s echoing almost exact same language when she s talking to dothraki now she s basically telling them promise that one of great khals had made years before and saying now is time to live up to that promise and fulfill it casting right thumb upright actor david bradley pictured as well as joseph mawle and tobias menzies returned to series after a nearly three year absence episode saw return of several characters from previous seasons and introduction of new characters that had either been mentioned or had some connection to established characters joseph mawle who was previously cast to play benjen stark and was featured in three episodes in show s first season before disappearing as he does in a song of ice and fire series that show is based on in an interview with entertainment weekly bryan cogman spoke of re introduction of benjen and mawle to show saying it was great to have joe mawle back with us it must have been a trip for him to step back into character after so long but he s also decidedly not benjen of season 1 so that was fun to explore mawle had been interviewed in 2013 where he expressed his desire to return to series another return involved story of riverlands with actor david bradley returning to show as walder frey who last appeared in aftermath of red wedding as well as tobias menzies as edmure tully who also had not appeared since red wedding episode rains of castamere in third season tim who plays one of walder s sons also returned but his other son lothar was re cast with daniel tuite taking over role several new actors were cast as samwell tarly s family in horn hill samwell s father randyll tarly had been referenced several times and had been described as cruel in his treatment of his oldest son in an interview with hollywood reporter john bradley samwell tarly spoke about introduction of his family to series stating when you see sam with his father and mother and brother especially he starts to make sense character is contextualized why is his psyche way it is why does he behave way he does ever since you first saw him he comes from this very sincere and heartfelt maternal love and then there s this monster you can see why he s so damaged his emotional life has been pulled in so many different directions he s so incredibly confused actor james faulkner was cast in role of randyll with samantha spiro portraying samwell s mother and freddie stroma and rebecca benson portraying samwell s brother dickon and sister talla for bran s brief vision sequence at beginning of episode actor david rintoul was cast as king aerys ii targaryen in a scene that had only been described to that point it depicts murder of aerys who is repeatedly yelling burn them all at hands of jaime lannister filming left thumb cathedral in girona spain stood in for great sept with some extending cgi altering building blood of my blood was directed by jack bender who also directed previous episode door his directorial debut for series bender had been approached to direct for series but declined due to extensive time commitment involved in shooting which he noted in an interview as having to commit to four and a half to six months because of enormity of episodes for primary king s landing scene at great sept with margaery being presented to city by high sparrow grand staircase of girona cathedral in girona spain was used cathedral was constructed in 11th century and continued its expansion throughout 12th and 13th centuries as well as 18th century according to prior reports filming took place over course of approximately two weeks with many different challenges involved in shooting at location including extras requiring medical attention due to exhaustion and dehydration as well as need for extensive security to close off certain areas during filming from public parts of braavos were also filmed in girona in nearby canet de mar catalonia spain castell de santa florentina an 11th century medieval castle was utilized for castle of house tarly director of episode bender conducted an interview with wall street journal following airing of episode and spoke about filming play with arya in braavos stating i staged whole play we did it and producers came in to watch rehearsal including all fart jokes all that stuff some of which was written so after we watched rehearsal and guys laughed a lot i said my only concern is am i mocking your brilliant show too much and they said no do it more they re completely unpretentious david and dan and they loved it he also noted that several other extra scenes were filmed but were cut from final version of episode noting that they will likely be released as deleted scenes on dvd for season in behind scenes video published by hbo following airing of fifth and sixth episodes benioff described bran s visions at beginning of episode as being something that was put together very precisely and purposefully noting even though some of those images flash by in just a fraction of a second each of them was very carefully chosen and mad king was probably most dramatic of those because we ve been hearing about mad king from very beginning of show but he s never appeared on screen before and shooting it you know spending a lot of time on what ended up being maybe like a second and a half couple seconds of screen time new scenes of mad king aerys ii targaryen are interspersed with previously shown footage of white walkers as well as wildfire explosions and other landmark moments from throughout series such as ned stark s beheading red wedding and bran falling from broken tower in series premiere in a song of ice and fire series by george r r martin mad king is described as having long unkempt hair and beard with nine inch long fingernails show s version portrayed his look in a more tidy fashion with david rintoul playing role of mad king ellie kendrick who portrays meera reed in series in an interview with hollywood reporter spoke about re introduction of benjen stark or coldhands benjen and working with joseph mawle saying it was so fantastic and it s interesting if you ve read books then you know about coldhands character who was cut out of bran meera and storyline on show it was always interesting having read books watching this amalgamation of story lines happen benjen is sort of like coldhands character in that he s a slightly suspicious guy who is half dead and half alive with blue hands i thought that was very cool way it happened it was a nice marriage between book and tv revelations rolled into one i was very excited having him on set i loved working with joseph mawle and i loved having another member of our rapidly dwindling gang reception ratings blood of my blood was viewed by 6 71 million american households on its initial

and significant characters return in skillfully plotted and gratifying blood of my blood matt fowler of ign wrote in his review of episode some sluggish stories took better turns this week albeit sometimes by just ending things for now while a book character many thought would never appear on series made a notable splash answering a big mystery that novels hadn t even revealed yet in process there were some great moments in blood of my blood but mostly big returns made it possible to for payoffs and possible characters to come he also continued by noting this installment probably speaks more than any other episode so far this season to accelerated rate of payoffs we re now getting that show isn t directly following books fowler gave episode an 8 6 out of 10 laura prudom of variety also praised pacing of episode as well as season s payoffs writing there s a clarity of purpose in season 6 that certainly gives impression that we re towards a conclusion instead of just meandering through dorne or killing time in qarth emily vanderwerff of vox likewise praised structure of season noting recent absence of ramsay bolton as a positive but continuing though it wasn t as good as last two episodes blood of my blood continued general upswing in quality game of thrones season six has undergone vanderwerff also wrote in her review blood of my blood is another exciting hour of television even if it s a bit more piece move y than say door revelations are milder characters mostly talk about what they re going to do next and stories go from point a to point b instead of point x y or z but there s still plenty going on that s worth checking out comparing episode to book of stranger jeremy egner of new york times said problem with emerging naked from a flaming temple is that it s hard to top it s hard to top that is unless you happen to have a dragon with a flair for dramatic timing aaron riccio of slant magazine criticized episode writing in his review largest problem with tonight s episode is that it either changes course so abruptly or certain theses so that it feels like a bit of a tease especially to those not invested in samwell tarly s storyline accolades
