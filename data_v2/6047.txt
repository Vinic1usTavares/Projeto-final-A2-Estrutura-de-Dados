characters liz and jack saying they continued to provide laughs but said jenna and tracy only continued to frustrate canning called baldwin best part of 30 rock and found that series had laid essential groundwork for a successful situation comedy robert abele of la weekly felt that characters of morgan and krakowski were undeveloped describing them as self obsessed newly thrown together co leads tim goodman of san francisco chronicle felt that aftermath was only more funny than pilot he praised baldwin and morgan but said that rest of episode was weak goodman felt that fey could fix 30 rock by showing more of baldwin and less of krakowski phil horst of pitt news praised individual scenes between fey and either baldwin or morgan but criticized fey for not writing an effective scene in which she did not appear horst saw jenna s screentime as a waste of time and thought that krakowski did not have comedic skills to keep up with rest of cast he went on to say that dratch would have taken character in a completely different direction giving 30 rock variety it lacked references external links category 30 rock season 1 episodes category 2006 american television episodes category
