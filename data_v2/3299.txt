light of modern historiography events preceding issue of this document could be as follows przemysl ii unhappy with prolonged guardianship of his uncle and with support of some powerful greater poland is unknown who were these people it only assumes that they could be young prince s closest associates during his government over duchy of poznan in 1273 1279 they were governor of poznan benjamin

armed incidents in any case demands of przemysl ii became so insistent that they ended in his imprisonment in gniezno castle it can be swiezawski przemysl krol polski warsaw 2006 p 97 that there wasn t a prison in proper sense of word but under house arrest during which przemysl ii was not too rigorously guarded since prince was able to escape from castle without any outside help in a document issued to piotr winiarczyk writer used phrase qui de which supports assumption that clerk was asleep and was completely surprised by arrival of prince in any case real cause of this grant of lands given to winiarczyk by przemysl ii apparently wasn t sure and probably only equipping him with sufficient means to escape some doubts about this theory are raised because fact that peter winiarczyk was rewarded after 16 years of events a swiezawski przemysl krol polski warsaw 2006 pp 97 98 alliance with henryk iv probus after escaping from gniezno przemysl ii probably went on lower silesia under

1276 an alliance between przemysl ii and henry iv placed boleslaw pious in a very uncomfortable situation because he was a member of pro hungarian coalition of polish princes in addition to him it included boleslaw v chaste leszek ii black and konrad ii of masovia could not remain indifferent to this close cooperation with duke of wroclaw which was leader of pro bohemian coalition where other silesian princes also belonged cf s zachorowski wiek xiii i panowanie wladyslawa lokietka in r grodecki s zachorowski j dabrowski dzieje polski sredniowiecznej w dwu tomach vol i to 1333 krakow 1995 p 271 here is further related long term conflict between kingdoms of hungary and bohemia after fall of babenberg dynasty who ended with defeat of przemysl otakar ii in battle on marchfeld in 1278 should be remembered however that after 1273 polish princes who were on hungarian side changed unexpectedly his politics and transferred their loyalty to bohemian side probably due to inability to find

boleslaw v chaste in lesser poland during first half of 1273 a swiezawski przemysl krol polski warszawa 2006 p 97 thus with high probability it can be concluded that by this time conflict between

make this radical move was probably his desire to increase his influence over neighboring principalities as part of his own plans for a royal coronation plans for a royal coronation for henryk iv

had even been a separation between them reason for this was supposed infertility of ludgarda more apparent after ten years of marriage actual period of marital intercourse between spouses given their age both are quite young at time of their wedding could actually be shorter indeed there is no direct proof about ludgarda s barrenness beyond lack of offspring in those childlessness in marriage was usually considered to be woman s fault although in this case due to birth of a daughter from przemysl ii s second marriage it seems more likely it wasn t a surprise when accusations began to emerge against duke of greater poland of suspected murder of his wife sources medieval sources actually inventing sensational information about unnatural deaths of rulers especially in relation of silesian princes during years 1266 1290 because is noted fact that deaths of four rulers brothers henry iii white wladyslaw and konrad i of glogow and henryk iv probus were under suspicions of poisoning see b nowacki przemysl ii ksiaze wielkopolski krol polski 1257 1295 poznan 1995 p 93 it must be noted however that no contemporary source mentions this a fact more surprising because przemysl ii had bitter enemies who certainly would use this crime against him also any reactions from church or public penance would noticed first suggestion about ludgarda s mysterious death came from 14th century rocznik traski in same year died unexpectedly spouse of przemysl duke of greater daughter of lord nicholas of mecklenburg named lukarda nobody could figure out how she died rocznik traski in mph vol ii p 849 chronicler obviously mistakenly identified ludgarda s father with her uncle probably this mistake was originated because at time of writing henry i was taken prisoner during a pilgrimage to holy land and his brother nicholas iii assumed government of mecklenburg on his behalf chronicler of rocznik traski doesn t suggest an unnatural death for duchess but leaves some doubts about it rocznik malopolski by other hand spoke clearly about ludgarda s murder in szamotuly code in which added further information about this event regardless of historian i might add we have seen in our youth in streets of gniezno a wooden chapel which in vernacular language is called vestibule where exist two great stones in shape of millstones reddened with blood of that lady who are completely worn and faded and were deposited in her tomb at gniezno cathedral rocznik malopolski in mph vol iii p 183 another source that describes death of ludgarda is kronika oliwska written in mid 14th century by abbot stanislaw on pages of his work author clearly showed aversion towards dynasty rulers of pomerelia until end of 13th century this aversion is also transferred to przemysl ii when prince mestwin was buried in oliwa przemysl arrived in gdansk and took possession of duchy of pomerania then he received from holy see crown of polish kingdom he lived another year and was captured by men of margrave of brandenburg waldemar who killed him to avenge holy lukarda his wife suspecting that he had strangled her chronica oliviensis auctore stanislao abbate olivensi in mph vol vi p 315

for duke s hospitality and wrote a long rhyming poem in which he also mentions ludgarda story of chronicler was as follows przemysl ii at instigation of his mother elizabeth of wroclaw who is well known had died in 1265 a long time before marriage of her son asked his wife for a divorce and return her to mecklenburg in view of her refusal because what god has joined men must not divide przemysl ii decided her imprisonment in tower where he tried to persuade her again to accept a divorce finally due to her obstinacy przemysl ii killed her with his own dagger in this event he was helped by one of his ministers who finished deed by suffocating a dying ludgarda with a towel last important source for history of ludgarda are annals of jan dlugosz jan dlugosz annales seu cronicae incliti regni poloniae fr vii viii warsaw 1975 pp 225 226 who wrote about this events almost two centuries after around 1480 dlugosz was first chronicler who locates poznan as place of ludgarda s death besides he established her date of death on 14 december who is corroborated by contemporary sources as a date of her burial modern historiography generally supports complete innocence of przemysl ii in sudden

concluded that 10 year marriage of przemysl ii and ludgarda wasn t successful and over time it became more obvious to everyone that ducal couple was unable to have children although this couldn t be completely certain because ludgarda in 1283 was at most only 23 years old nevertheless is assumed that przemysl ii s growing aversion to his wife because of her infertility was well known by all so when in mid december jasinski genealogia piastow wielkopolskich potomstwo wladyslawa odonica in nasi piastowie kronika miasta poznania nr 2 95 poznan 1995 p 55 ludgarda died suddenly and separated evidenced by her death in gniezno away from przemysl ii s court in poznan raised suspicion that death of duchess was unnatural nobody however had evidence of this contributing to rumors was that in 13th century medical knowledge was negligible and therefore often sudden death of a young person was interpreted as unnatural in addition duke s rejection of a proper mourning to his wife who was universally liked increased suspicions against przemysl ii election of jakub swinka as archbishop of gniezno 200px thumbnail right jakub swinka archbishop of gniezno from a book illumination before 1535 on 18 december 1283 a few days after ludgarda s funeral greater poland witnessed an extremely important event for later history of poland consecration of jakub swinka as archbishop of gniezno event took place in franciscan church in kalisz and was extremely important because after twelve years since death in 1271 of archbishop janusz poland wasn t a full recognized prelate in 1271 bishop of kujawy was appointed vicar in however he died three years later then cantor prokop was designated administrator of archdiocese of gniezno it was only in 1278 when pope nicholas iii appointed martin of opava as new archbishop however this selection is not accepted by both boleslaw pious and przemysl ii and case was only solved by martin s death shortly after in his route to gniezno next two candidates proposed by przemysl ii and leszek ii black and heinrich von by papacy refused their nominations finally selection of chapter in 1283 fell in jakub swinka who counted with consent of both

since first meeting was held in sieradz ie territory belonging to leszek ii so he had to known about details of discussions held there secondly bronislaw nowacki assumes that henry iv probus was informed about talks in sieradz a fact even more unlikely it becomes apparent that conspiracy against leszek ii was accorded here especially if zegota remained in his post until 1285 until actual

coronation lived one year was captured by adjutant of waldemar margrave of brandenburg and was murdered in revenge for his wife holy lukarda which he suspected had killed before kronika oliwska ed wojciech ketrzynski in mph vol vi krakow 1893 p 135 a by czas nie i warsaw 1975 p 110 with high probability it s assumed that first part of this information was translated from liber mortuorum monasterii mortuorum monasterii oliviensis ed w ketrzynski in mph vol v p 507 by author of kronika oliwska abbot stanislaw and message about motives of murder as a revenge for ludgarda s death is result of a latter addition of abbot this passage established main indication that margrave waldemar of brandenburg was guilty of crime however during tragic events he could not have participated because in 1296 he had less than 15 years old waldemar certainly gained notoriety only around 1308 after his failed attempt to seize pomerania k gorski smierc przemysla ii in roczniki historyczne t v poznan 1929 p 172 another earlier source who wrote about death of przemysl ii at hands of brandenburg was rocznik kolbacki of cistercian monastery in on western pomerania brief information is valuable primarily because it was only one who named direct perpetrator of crime a man named jakub kaszuba problem is that nothing certain about him was found in other sources and besides name of piotr under what is known przemysl ii in chronicle raises big surprise translation by karol gorski k gorski smierc przemysla ii in roczniki historyczne vol v poznan 1929 p 198 indicated that possibly name peter was taken in baptism although there is no confirmation of this information in any other source most likely this is a mistake of author finally another source who accused margraves of brandenburg was relative later chronicle of henry of hertford which although written during mid 14th century was reliable enough because was from germany and therefore unsuspected of being partial there he stated that przemysl ii died during a war between brandenburg and greater poland another german chronicler who unequivocally accused house of ascania was dietmar of lubeck interpretation of text by k

wife margaret took part in conspiracy who killed him due to her family relations it s unknown whether chronicler found this information from earlier sources or deduced it based on simple relationship because margaret came from family accused of murder she had to participate 200px thumbnail right archcathedral basilica of st peter and st paul in poznan burial place of przemysl ii there are a number

event who was clearly unfavorable to brandenburg for house of ascania it then became clear that all diplomatic pressure against przemysl ii and his alliance with western pomerania were doomed to failure and therefore they lost any chance of winning pomerelia but main concern of house of ascania was obvious to all union of kingdom of poland and that sooner or later przemysl ii would claim lands seized by margraves in greater poland after 25 january 1296 king left his capital and surely by 3 february he was in pyzdry for last days of carnival between 4 7 february przemysl ii decided to spend these festivities in town of rogozno leaving pyzdry king certainly didn t think that about only 30 km away in brandenburg town of are staying two brothers margraves otto iv with arrow and conrad

detailed by roczniki malopolski they probably wanted to obtain from przemysl ii resignation of pomerelia and with this his plans for unification of polish kingdom contingent was probably consisted by dozens of people because made kidnapping in hostile territory require adequate preparation direct command of army was entrusted according to rocznik kolbacki mgh ss vol xix p 716 to certain jakub who

slawnego krolestwa polskiego fr viii p 369 this fact seems unlikely because they would not risk their lives with no certainty of success in any case an army of a few dozen men set off in evening on 7 february probably after sunset by shortest route through notec to place where przemysl ii stayed as was stated by karol gorski k gorski smierc przemysla ii in roczniki historyczne vol v poznan 1929 p

to their target attack took place early in morning of 8 february on ash wednesday when bodyguards of king were in a deep sleep despite this they were able to organize a defense under personal guidance of king but attackers were too numerous to overcome primary objective of jakub kaszuba s people was capture of przemysl ii they succeeded only after king covered with numerous wounds fell to ground brandenburg army seriously wounded his horse to flee towards border with silesia probably with intention to confuse polish army soon kidnappers realized that they weren t able to bring alive king and

rogozno king s body was abandoned on road where was found by knights involved in persecution place where crime was committed and his body was found pl was traditionally named assassins were never

wielkopolsko brandenburskiej o pomorze gdanskie in zapiski historyczne vol xxvi t 4 torun 1961 p 65 that efficient action wasn t possible without participation of people who was close to przemysl ii historians are divided about what of two noble families nalecz or zaremba participated in this event zarembas are more suspect based on writings of rocznik malopolski rebellion of 1284 certainly caused a deterioration in their relations with king about nalecz family there is no accusation against them in rocznik swietokrzyski nowy p 76 or in chronicle of dlugosz j dlugosz roczniki czyli kroniki slawnego krolestwa polskiego fr viii p 271 in fact modern historiography writes about friendly relationship of przemysl ii with and lodzia families and also with nalecz situation of greater poland and gdansk pomerania after przemysl ii s death although death of przemysl ii last male member of piast greater poland line certainly surprised his neighbors including brandenburg whose purpose was to kidnap king not his murder it caused rapid intervention of all forces who wanted to seize power in his domains probably even in february and by march greater poland was in middle of a
