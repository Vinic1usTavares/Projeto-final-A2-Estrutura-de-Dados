interview with cnn ibn madhur bhandarkar said that he was preparing to make a film about fashion industry he thought lack of indian films on this subject prompted him to do so he said he was fascinated with industry models and their lives outside ramp walks saying i was amazed at overwhelming attention given to fashion industry by media and public i thought idea of delving deep into fashion world was very interesting and intriguing he was excited about depicting people behind ramp because most people are unfamiliar with fashion world bhandarkar who is known for studying his subject matter to make his films as realistic as possible researched fashion industry for nearly eight months attending fashion events and shows he spoke with designers buyers choreographers and models several media publications reported that film was inspired by lives of fashion models such as shivani kapur geetanjali nagpal kate moss and alicia raut however bhandarkar stated that story is fictional and does not resemble anyone s life media also reported that film revolved around two homosexual fashion designers bhandarkar denied these rumours saying film did not revolve around male characters but had female protagonists casting and characters casting began in october 2007 when priyanka chopra signed to play lead role in film chopra initially refused role feeling she would not be able to do it justice six months later she agreed to appear in film because of bhandarkar s confidence in her media reported that chopra was unhappy with first draft of film and wanted script changes before signing film bhandarkar was also unhappy with first draft and agreed to rewrite script kangana ranaut was cast as film s second lead she was pleased with script and found it challenging interesting and exciting in december 2007 arbaaz khan and arjan bajwa were cast opposite chopra after confirming principal cast media reported that bhandarkar was having difficulty casting male roles including that of a homosexual clothing designer samir soni and harsh chhaya were cast as homosexual designers and model mugdha godse was cast in a supporting role according to godse bhandarkar offered her a part when they were shooting a jewellery advertisement a year later she agreed to appear in film hindustan times said that several models and designers played themselves giving film appearance of a documentary chopra said she studied method acting to make her character seem real actress said that her character is determined and added while her father wants her to become an accountant she aspires to become leading model in fashion industry addressing rumours that film was an expose of fashion industry she said it is nothing like that whatever problems that come up to my character in film are not because of profession but because of choices that my character makes in her life ranaut said in this script my character is such that you get to express you emotions emotions that you have never delivered before in front of camera so when i heard script it was something new and much more challenging more interesting and exciting godse said that she accepted her role in film because she identified with her character janet whom she described as outgoing vibrant bold and outspoken arjan bajwa described his character an aspiring fashion model as uncompromising achieving success in his own way samir soni found his role as a closeted fashion designer very challenging requiring research to flesh out character and his personality soni s greatest challenge was to avoid a stereotypical homosexual character instead subtly expressing his sexuality in his personality and relationships with film s other characters styling rita dhody and narendra kumar were chosen to style film s characters dhody said it took nearly two months for utv and bhandarkar to persuade her to help design film she found job challenging because she had to make everything as authentic as possible chopra had to wear 137 costumes in film because her character passed through five phases initially she was a hep character with brightly coloured matching attire her make up becomes lighter as she becomes a model and later a supermodel when her career falters chopra s look becomes softer demonstrating her character s lack of concern about her appearance before she returns to mumbai according to dhody chopra s look is very contemporary and a very much today s look but my idea was to streamline and take it to classic side rather than making it trend based ranaut s character was designed to make audiences feel sympathy for her dhody gave her short dresses with low necklines conveying image of a supermodel comfortable with her body during her low phase she is shown in long t shirts godse whose character is a failed model has a carefree look dhody said godse s look in film is a fusion of rock and a grunge to give her survivor look as a b grade model making her more chic and glamorous she wears low waisted trousers chains and ankle boots details of jewellery clothes colour and accessories outline characters everything had to be and complement each other to create an authentic look dhody said we didn t try to it by making it more bling or costume based i had to restrain myself from going overboard due to bhandarkar s reservations film s narrative included 11 character based ramp shows filming principal photography commenced in december 2007 and film was shot extensively in mumbai scene with ranaut s wardrobe malfunction during a ramp walk was filmed in late january 2008 at mehboob studios bandra while filming scene only essential cast and crew members included bhandarkar and his cinematographer were present according to bhandarkar it was a sensitive scene and a sensitive issue chopra had to gain as a girl from punjab and then lose it as a model she had five looks in film phases through which her character passes although media spread rumours that chopra was starving herself to reduce her weight to that of a supermodel she said that her appearance was achieved with two months of training and a disciplined diet film s climactic scene in which chopra walks ramp at paris fashion week was supposed to be filmed in paris with eiffel tower as a backdrop but bhandarkar could not shoot there instead scene uses some footage from actual fashion show in mid august 2008 key scenes with chopra raj babbar and kiran juneja chopra s character s parents were filmed in chandigarh for authenticity bhandarkar said we wanted to bring essence of city alive in scenes director said film took about 106 days to complete compared with his 45 day average themes and allusions thumb fashion was bhandarkar s fourth women centric film to win widespread praise fashion is bhandarkar s fourth women centric film after chandni bar 2001 page 3 2005 and corporate 2006 to earn widespread praise for their strong independent female characters according to times of india fashion is not about cliches alone and manages to transcend them with its moving tale of three women who try to maintain their honour dignity and identity in a cruel world that spills over with grime behind glamour film not only takes you behind psychedelic ramp it travels through dark inner recesses of three lead characters laying bare their strengths and weaknesses their fears and hopes their dreams and nightmares ananya bhattacharya of zee news said that film went on to speak volumes about women their aspirations and dark side effects of over ambition in an interview with hindustan times chopra said that film is an emotional tale and story of three girls which shows female bonding in a beautiful way reviewer kriti verma of headlines india said that movie shows every bit about life of models and bring inside secrets of fashion industry it has everything fashion weeks casting couch drugs abuses gay designers bitching taran adarsh from bollywood hungama wrote narrative is inevitably filled with lots of glam n glitz moments fashion shows stunning models superb styling vibrant colours and behind scenes drama is worth every penny spent on ticket a reviewer from sify com found film s depiction of fashion industry superficial noting that film does not talk about clothing creativity or passion for work in fashion industry however according to bhandarkar film was not about fashion industry as such it only has fashion as a backdrop film is more about story of models designers and people and it is on aspects like personal story individual story their ups and downs their journey that i tried to capture critics also said that film explores drug abuse homosexuality and gay relationships designer bahl complained about male characters most of whom are portrayed as gay designers and exploitative agency owners he said bhandarkar could have done without gross generalisations it makes movie shallow and over dramatic film alludes several times to actual incidents including a scene where bhandarkar appears at a fashion show to research his upcoming film on fashion industry one of models looking at him says oh that s madhur bhandarkar realistic filmmaker now he is going to expose fashion world it is taken from bhandarkar s experiences while researching subjects of his films indian express said that chopra s character who indulges in drug and alcohol abuse and undergoes rehabilitation resembles life of british educated model shivani kapur who had similar experiences scene in which ranaut s character s top slips off during a ramp walk resembles experience of carol gracias at 2006 lakme fashion week soundtrack fashion soundtrack album was composed by salim sulaiman and lyrics were written by irfan siddiqui sandeep nath appeared as a guest lyricist for fashion ka jalwa soundtrack contains four original songs one theme and five remixes music was released by bhandarkar and cast on 11 september 2008 at temple in mumbai cast played film s

shot joginder tuteja of bollywood hungama described album as a winner all way and said madhur bhandarkar films haven t been known for their music even though albums of corporate and page 3 still saw some sales on stands however fashion is all set to break jinx while turning out to be first madhur bhandarkar film ever to boast of a truly mass as well as class appealing score sukanya verma of rediff com rated album three out of five and said that film offers a well designed mix of trendy tunes and refined melodies marketing and release film s trailer was unveiled on 17 july 2008 in mumbai and was received warmly by critics and audiences emphasizing its theme lead female cast walked ramp at fashion shows to promote film fashion was also promoted at lakme fashion week where chopra ranaut and godse walked ramp made on a budget of fashion earned and before release recouped half its cost from tie ins with brands including reebok lenovo and lg electronics products from these brands were showcased in film and brands promoted film in their advertising bhandarkar expressed disappointment about censor board for film certification s decision to grant film an a certificate meant for viewers 18 years or older instead of u a certificate that he had expected his previous films received u a certification despite adult content according to them their new guidelines did not allow fashion a u a certification board was willing to issue a u a certificate after several cuts bhandarkar refused and accepted a certificate since scenes in question were crucial to narrative before its release delhi commission for women dcw asked bhandarkar to screen film before its release due to its concern that ranaut s character was based on geetanjali nagpal a former high profile fashion model found begging bedraggled and mentally unbalanced on streets of delhi in 2007 nagpal was helped by dcw which did not want anyone profiting from her life bhandarkar narrated a summary of film s plot at dcw office which satisfied commission that there was no reference to nagpal a screening of film was also held for commission film was originally scheduled for release on 14 november 2008 but this clashed with release of chopra s film dostana and fashion was released 29 october diwali on 700 screens worldwide film was released in a two disc ntsc dvd package on 22 december 2008 in all regions

news gave film a rating of 4 out of 5 called it a must watch and praised sets music performances and storyline nikhat kazmi rated film 3 5 out of 5 describing it as a sensitive parable on bonding and empowerment taran adarsh rated film 3 5 out of 5 praised cinematography screenplay dialogue costumes and styling and called fashion a hard hitting film that enlightens you moves you motivates and deflates you even shocks and surprises you and of course entertains you rajeev masand gave film a rating of 3 out of 5 and wrote fashion is an easy watch because very subject lends itself to so much interest like director s own film page 3 it is mostly sensational and on several occasions compromises authenticity for sake of exaggerated drama he praised performances of lead cast writing that chopra turns in a respectable performance one that will inevitably go down as her best truth is it s one of those by book characters that she understands only too well and performs just as easily ditto for kangana ranaut who plays eccentric with such a practiced hand it almost seems like an effortless delivery it s godse who invests such sincerity into her role that she makes character a real flesh and blood person kitu gidwani as agency head who mentors our protagonist kitu strikes all right notes never once slipping out of character subhash k jha of indo asian news service rated film 3 out of 5 calling it a truly outstanding film he said bhandarkar takes us through a labyrinth of emotions some devastating in their gut level directness but at end we come away with a film that gives us something to hold on to permanently even as characters on screen lose practically everything worth holding on to jha also wrote that sequences between chopra and ranaut as highlights of film gaurav malani from economic times rated film a 3 out of 5 praised chopra s performance and wrote chopra s character graph is skillfully sketched from an aspiring model to an ambitious showstopper to a brash supermodel and subsequently to a faded manikin desperate to make her comeback in each phase her character exudes a contrasting gamut of emotions khalid mohamed rated fashion 3 out of 5 called film a must try and wrote excelling on catwalk as well as in moments of self destruction ranaut s is terrific show stopping performance sonia chopra of sify criticised film s superficial portrayal of fashion industry and called film a superficial take on lives of models and a dumbed down version of workings of fashion industry however she praised performances fashion opened well at box office filling 90 100 percent of seats in most indian multiplexes film competed with opening of a popular comedy golmaal returns but both films were box office successes fashion earned approximately on its opening day
