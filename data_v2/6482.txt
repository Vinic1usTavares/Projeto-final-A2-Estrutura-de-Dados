of south a typical protagonist in godwin s novels is a young woman that in search of herself confronts obstacles caused by her family her lovers her husband or her own as she struggles to establish her independence and secure her identity through her work main character may be personally flawed then achieve self reflection or personal growth thanks to support of their community or a mentor main characters often make poor choices but become a better person learn to make better decisions and build stronger bonds often as a result of intellectual pursuits according to critic anne cheney protagonist may be searching for happiness academic or artistic achievement love respect or more generally meaning in life according to warren french from university of wales godwin s works are most often seen as having two primary themes gender roles and southern settings french said godwin herself disapproves of being categorized which she feels creates externally imposed limitations on themes she covers however scholars continue to attempt to put her work into a distinctive literary category in her early works godwin was seen as a woman writer because her books appealed to a mostly female audience and because she is a woman after publishing a southern family she began being identified as a southern writer according to times london godwin has a pesky resistance to categorisation and she often changes themes even after being commercially successful with one academic lihong xie said godwin could be identified with literary tradition of bildungsroman which focuses on moral and psychological development of a character many other critics posit that a quest for meaning and self identification are godwin s primary themes other themes in godwin s work have included escaping cultural expectations of becoming a southern lady childhood abandonment depression and suicide racial discrimination social class and succeeding without a male companion her work has spanned different literary categories such as realism fantasy and allegory early works all of godwin s books written from 1970 to 1990 are fictional stories based on themes taken from godwin s life her early works focus on women hoping for a relationship with a male companion but at same time wanting independence and freedom main protagonist is often restricted by family tradition and patriarchy most of godwin s early works include a prominent mother daughter relationship as well her first three books perfectionists 1970 glass people 1972 and odd woman 1974 have protagonists who find that their relationship with a male companion restricts their personal and professional development first two books are each about a female character who feels trapped in an unhappy marriage according to contemporary southern writers unlike fairy tale romances these novels present a realistic depiction of feminist concerns and struggles lihong xie comments that godwin s protagonists are southern women that caught between ideal of southern womanhood and contemporary feminism struggle to form a personal identity violet clay 1978 and a mother and two daughters 1982 are each about an unmarried protagonist s career in a creative profession in a mother and two daughters main character resists temptation to get married and chooses instead to focus on her work a mother and two daughters and a southern family 1987 each depend heavily on a southern setting and employ themes traditionally associated with social problems in south some of their themes include racial discrimination social economic class and cultural differences between generations many characters struggle to reduce gap between rich and poor or try to break free from a dominant cultural tradition with mixed success in godwin s early books female protagonists tend to be fearful passive and repeat their mistakes protagonist is often depicted as a victim who has failed to achieve independence and is struggling to form a personal identity that could exist beyond that of their relationship with a male companion in her next books godwin begins to introduce stronger and more independent central characters violet clay 1978 for example features a more assertive character than those in prior novels according to susan s kissel adams from northern kentucky university godwin s later characters come to value inclusion and connection over exclusion and isolation in their lives they seek ways to combine their private and their public selves open and extend family structures take political action and fulfill their social responsibilities in their struggle against southern codes and family structures that retain a powerful hold even in late twentieth century godwin s daughters of south grow from a state of dependency and arrested development they begin to embark on mature adult lives of their own later works as in her earlier novels godwin s work in 1970s and 1980s still centers mostly on difficulties female characters experienced as women however she departs from this theme in finishing school 1984 which is about two women of different generations and student mentor relationship between them rather than their relationship with men according to lihong xie godwin s work during this period continues to be about female self and a woman s intimate relationships with husbands fathers and god godwin s books begin to incorporate religious themes starting with father melancholy s daughter 1991 novel is told from perspective of multiple characters each of whom have a different perspective on religion father melancholy s daughter was followed by several books that centered on episcopal church and christian practices in these novels female and male characters have a more equal influence on events and plot than in prior novels godwin s books neither evangelize nor mock practices of episcopal church but rather treat it as a routine aspect of life or as a subject of intellectual interest during these years godwin s books continued to show father figures who have died or are absent by 1996 two of her books had fathers that died and five had that are depicted as intruding on mother daughter relationship according to narrative magazine godwin transitions from female protagonists who are looking for ways to get out of traps and to those who make interesting or dangerous life choices some of godwin s later works depict successful but unconventional marriages in good husband 1994 both partners accept wife s career as having a priority over husband s good husband is also a return to theme of marriage that is typical of some of godwin s earlier works according to contemporary southern writers good husband explores dying experience godwin also published several non fiction works based on her own life during this period godwin s short story collections dream children and mr bedford and muses focus on themes similar to those in her novels but also incorporate dreams and myth they tend to be less auto biographical than her novels according to philosopher anna teresa godwin s approach to dream worlds is radical because dream is incorporated into characters real world experiences her characters compare their real and dream worlds to each other in order to negotiate their sense of destiny she said dream children challenges distinction between reality and dream experiences where dream does not violate one s theory of reality usa today said that subjects covered in unfinished desires 2010 include mean girls lesbian kisses learning disabilities domestic violence alcoholism and roman catholic nuns according to times london flora 2013 encompasses most of themes that have preoccupied godwin throughout her career it takes place in south in mid 1940s in

heard and that her later books focuses on her enemies now she s working to understand villains villains reception by 1980 godwin s writing had become subject of essays book chapters and other literary analysis from academic critics according to washington post gail godwin has been accused of not being able to decide whether she s a popular or a literary writer but she s certainly accrued enough bestsellers and literary honors to claim both identities much of scholarly attention on her works comes from those critics with an interest in southern or feminist authors according to contemporary fiction writers of south godwin s books have been widely and favorably reviewed contemporary american women fiction writers states that although some reviews of her work have been mixed her books are accomplished works of fiction if not masterpieces contemporary literary criticism said most of her books are characterized as well written well executed readable witty and having vivid believable
