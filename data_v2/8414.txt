tensei if high school setting of if was received positively upon release so atlus decided to create a dedicated subseries focusing on inner struggles of young adults this concept eventually evolved into persona and its underlying focus on human soul would become a mainstay of persona series title megami ibunroku was designed to show title s status as a spin off directly related to megami tensei series although it was removed for later persona titles persona system was directly inspired by guardian system used in if originally designed by future persona director katsura hashino veteran megami tensei producer kouji okada and character designer kazuma kaneko took over these respective staff roles new to production team was writer tadashi satomi script took about a year to write with staff going through twenty drafts first draft involved students going on a field trip and being caught in a series of mysterious events this was one of more fondly remembered versions shigenori soejima a future designer for series was involved in designing minor characters and coloring promotional and cover artwork main concept behind persona was a megami tensei game that could be enjoyed by people new to series popularity of casual games on playstation was a key factor in making this decision development team s focus on persona resulted in development on shin megami tensei nocturne coming to a near halt kaneko designed main cast around multiple notable celebrities and fictional characters of time along with members of atlus staff while characters wearing same uniform helped designate them as a single group it also made them look same to balance against this kaneko expressed their individuality through accessories atlus staff members also made cameos as minor characters character of philemon was based on carl jung s titular wise old man archetype described as a contradictory existence his appearance in game was based on paintings of chinese philosopher zhuang zhou multiple ideas and terms used in game were based on jungian psychology and archetypes velvet room a key gameplay location was based on black lodge from twin peaks one of characters focused on by kaneko was maki who was given multiple forms throughout story first versions created were original maki who had been bed ridden for a long time and ideal version whose inexperience with outside world and interactions with others made her an expressionless doll in addition to these forms black clothed aki and white clothed mai were created when maki s personality split representing her extremes true maki represented balance so kaneko made her uniform grey because of this school uniform had to be grey to represent her psychological immaturity she was given a ribbon to represent her along with a locket

setting and multitude of options in battle to be refreshingly original though they found complexity of battles overwhelming at points next generation also complimented originality of setting but concluded game lacks kind of cohesion needed to be called great reviewer elaborated that frequent shifting of gameplay perspectives is frustrating and that missing is a fluid unraveling of story and in its place is a fragmented disclosure of facts interrupted entirely too often by battle scenes game informer variously complemented game for its challenging gameplay and story and setting with one
