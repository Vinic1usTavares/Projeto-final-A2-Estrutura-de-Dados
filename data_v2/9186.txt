wehrmachtbericht literally armed forces report usually translated as wehrmacht communique or wehrmacht report was daily wehrmacht high command mass media communique and a key component of nazi propaganda during world war ii produced by propaganda department of okw wehrmacht propaganda troops it covered germany s military situation and was broadcast daily on reich broadcasting corporation of nazi germany all broadcasts were authorized by reich ministry of propaganda under joseph goebbels despite latter s attempts to temper excessive optimism they often exaggerated success of german army leading historian aristotle kallis to describe their tone as triumphalist both civilian and military authorities considered wehrmachtbericht to be a vital instrument of german home front mobilisation civilian contribution to german war effort especially after defeat in battle of stalingrad according to historians wolfram wette and daniel uziel final 9 may 1945 communique laid foundation for myth of clean wehrmacht notion that wehrmacht had fought honourably and was not implicated in crimes of nazi regime for which according to myth only ss bore responsibility production during world war ii wehrmacht communique wehrmachtbericht was official news communication medium about military situation of reich and was intended for both domestic and foreign consumption communique was produced by a special propaganda department attached to wehrmacht chief of operation staff general alfred jodl in wehrmacht high command okw commanded by general hasso von wedel department oversaw growing number of propaganda companies of wehrmacht propaganda troops propaganda wing of wehrmacht in army air force and navy and waffen ss at its peak in 1942 propaganda troops included 15 000 men thumb upright 1 1 1940 exhibition of photographs produced by propaganda companies during invasion of poland exhibit was organized by planning for propaganda activities by wehrmacht began in 1938 joseph goebbels head of ministry of propaganda sought to establish effective cooperation with wehrmacht to ensure a smooth flow of propaganda materials from front he deferred to military in setting up and controlling propaganda companies but provided assistance in supplying personnel these troops who were trained soldiers were responsible for preparing combat reports to be used as source material for okw communiques propaganda companies were only news reporting units in areas of military operation as civilian news correspondents were prohibited from entering combat zones troops produced written audio and film materials from front and sent them to a processing center in germany where they were reviewed by censors mostly for security purposes filtered materials were then forwarded to ministry of propaganda for immediate dissemination all wehrmachtbericht broadcasts were authorized by goebbels s ministry as controlling institution of german media a ministry of propaganda official attended daily wehrmacht conferences where initial versions of communique were provided to state and party officials goebbels s day at ministry began with his adjutant reading out text of communiques to him while goebbels did not have a final say in what went into communiques he made sure that officials from his ministry worked closely with wehrmacht propaganda department first communique aired with start of world war ii on 1 september 1939 and last one was issued on 9 may 1945 communiques were broadcast daily on reich broadcasting corporation and published in press from 12 may 1940 onwards major of okw propaganda department was given task of adding commentary to them both on radio 21 00 to 21 15 and in press commentaries were aimed at civilian audience and were written in layman s language so that population could easily grasp daily military developments communiques were read twice first at a normal speed and a second time more slowly to enable them to be transcribed by listeners operation barbarossa in summer of 1941 during operation barbarossa communiques created an image of uninterrupted successful advances by germany deep into soviet territory with historian aristotle kallis describing tone of early wehrmacht reports as triumphalist as operation progressed however it was more and more difficult to sustain illusion of a swift and decisive victory subsequent reports were at times in stark contrast with deteriorating situation on ground which was noted by german troops after soviet yelnya offensive east of smolensk in early september 1941 a german infantryman wrote officially it was called a planned withdrawal but to me it was so much bullshit next day we heard on radio in news from front wehrmachtbericht about successful front correction in our yelnya defensive lines and enormous losses we inflicted on enemy but no single word was heard about a retreat about hopelessness of situation about mental and emotional numbness of german soldiers in short it was again a victory but we on front line were running back like rabbits in front of fox this metamorphosis of truth from all shit to it was a victory baffled me and those of my comrades who dared to think starting in august 1941 when it became clear to some in propaganda ministry and wehrmacht high command that war would likely extend into 1942 goebbels grew increasingly concerned about triumphant tone of communiques however a string of spectacular victories in september especially in battle of kiev removed any restraint from texts making propagandists s work more difficult later on when they had to explain wehrmacht s failures to german public which was rapidly losing confidence in a swift victory because of competing goals approaches and chains of command along with chaotic nature of regime itself propaganda materials produced by goebbels s ministry okw and hitler s press chief otto dietrich did not always agree in tone or assessment of situation after assault on moscow operation typhoon began on 2 october 1941 goebbels described in his diary excessive optimism that was developing in population after announcements about initial rapid advance of german forces concerned about an almost illusionistic mood he instructed press to adopt a more cautious approach and spoke to jodl about tempering down tone of wehrmacht communiques nonetheless broadcast on 16 october announced that first defensive line in front of moscow had been broken being still too optimistic for goebbels battle of stalingrad wehrmachtbericht communiques around 1942 summer campaign and defeat of german army in battle of stalingrad provide another case study on their effects on germany s population and evolution of propaganda efforts themselves in august 1942 name stalingrad was featured prominently in communiques even before wehrmacht reached outskirts of city communiques were factual and restrained nevertheless goebbels issued instructions to german press to exercise cautious optimism so as not to set expectations too high among population soviet counter offensive operation uranus broke thinly held german flanks on 19 november by 22 november encirclement of 6th army was complete concern of propaganda organisations both military and civilian was how to present this military disaster to public initially every effort was made to hide true scope of events from population communiques published between 19 and 24 november merely mentioned soviet attack in southern sector of east front not addressing extent of wehrmacht s difficulties from 24 november onward wehrmacht communiques began acknowledging soviet breakthrough and described heavy fighting but provided no references to encirclement reports by sd security and intelligence service of ss indicated that 24 november report caused alarm among population there were periods where okw dispatches did not mention stalingrad at all wild rumors describing 100 000 german troops trapped at stalingrad were beginning to circulate as some germans were able to get news from foreign radio on 16 january 1943 dispatch finally mentioned that 6th army was fighting enemy on all sides thus acknowledging encirclement but little was said about situation in subsequent reports meanwhile goebbels was working behind scenes to advance his program of mobilisation of population for total war using impending defeat at stalingrad as a rallying cry getting go ahead from hitler goebbels launched effort in late winter of 1943 state propaganda after that focused on home front mobilization civilian contribution to german war effort with this message continuing through rest of war impact despite occasional mis alignment of messages with tone of wehrmacht communiques being too exuberant for goebbels a self described realist relations between military and civilian propaganda organizations proved successful throughout war friction was low even though several apologetic postwar publications such as an account provided by wedel described relations between them as problematic both goebbels and jodl considered wehrmachtbericht a vital instrument of german home front mobilization especially after defeat at stalingrad from onset according to historian daniel uziel nazi propaganda machine regarded wehrmacht communiques as possessing a future value besides immediate use as news delivery medium along with all other propaganda materials produced by wehrmacht underlying message was supposed superiority of german warrior s spirit and character final broadcast issued by donitz government aired on 9 may 1945 and read in part since midnight weapons on all fronts are silent by order of grand admiral donitz wehrmacht ceased its hopeless fighting with this a nearly 6 year heroic struggle has ended it brought us great victories but also heavy defeats wehrmacht has been honorably defeated by superior forces german soldier in accordance with his oath has given his unforgettable effort to his people till end homeland supported him with all its strength under heaviest sacrifices singular performance of front and fatherland shall receive its final honor in later fair judgement achievements and sacrifices of german soldiers at sea on land and in air has not escaped notice of our enemy therefore every soldier can hold his head high and proudly lay his weapon down he can start to work bravely and confidently bitterest hour of our history for eternal life of our people those words were intended for public consumption by now defeated nation according to uziel in this final radio address wehrmacht propagandists hoped to set frame of reference for entire war effort of 1939 45 in this they were successful last communique helped lay foundation for legend of clean wehrmacht notion that wehrmacht had fought honourably and professionally and was not in any way implicated in crimes of nazi regime for which according to myth ss bore sole responsibility this assessment is echoed by historian wolfram wette in his 2006 work wehrmacht history myth reality named reference according to historian felix romer named reference in wehrmachtbericht was an award among other military decorations as an
