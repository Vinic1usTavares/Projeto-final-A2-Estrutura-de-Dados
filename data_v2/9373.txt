and then ich will ich sein lana del rey in german intro germany june 2014 together they produced initial recording of west coast as a classic rock inspired song del rey developed track as a dedication to west coast of united states but with intention of it being more psychological which resulted in track becoming distant from that of verse chorus form she felt song s slow shifting tempo was important because it reflected her mental state during its writing del rey initially completed her third studio album ultraviolence in december 2013 but at time was dissatisfied with a demo she had recorded for west coast she then met dan auerbach of black keys by chance at electric lady studios and then again on a night out in queens new york and realized she needed to re record track to incorporate his looser production techniques that night del rey explained to auerbach her interest to develop a song containing jazz undertones west coast fusion influenced by beach boys and eagles and a 1970s laurel canyon type revival subsequently del rey traveled to nashville tennessee to re record west coast and tracks from its parent album with auerbach in a 3 week session at his studio easy eye sound she invited him to add a more casual california vibe to song by recording in single takes with a blues like shure microphone according to auerbach recording of west coast was sung 99 live by del rey in a room adjacent to one where a seven piece band were recording track s instrumentation auerbach produced song s electric guitar shaker 12 string acoustic guitar and synthesizer instrumentation while nick movshon was credited as a bassist and drummer on west coast track s strings were recorded separately from main recording at a studio in glendale california called bridge del rey opined that track s demo sounded very different to auerbach s reproduction when del rey first played west coast to her record label interscope records they were dissatisfied with its chorus being slower in beats per minute than its verses they responded to her stating none of these songs are good for radio and now you re slowing them down when they should be speeded up in an interview with guardian del rey explained that she felt murky with her life during song s writing and it was that feeling which influenced it to sound disconnected from mainstream pop composition a psychedelic rock and soft rock ballad west coast also contains elements of reggae indie rock latin rock 1960s music 1980s drive time and swing track s subversive sound is result of its comprising jagged instrumentation and laid back groove similar to that of classics iv s spooky 1967 opening riff solicits a wavy sound reminiscent of black keys turn blue 2014 and is continued throughout rest of song described as a two in one track its shifting tempo transcends downward during chorus mark following into a rhythmical shift reminiscent of beatles we can work it out 1965 being more guitar orientated than singer s previous output it is based around minimal country tinged surf guitar and twangy drum instrumentation track s slower second section opens with a descending blues riff reminiscent of beatles and i love her 1964 in which production switches between a half mumbled baritone and layered choral symphony among neo noir motif its chorus scythes across juddering bass and off kilter percussion instrumentation towards end of track s duration a stray burst of g funk shrill synth is solicited incorporating an ease to her vocal delivery del rey eased her vocal delivery by crooning hook move baby move baby ooh baby ooh baby throughout chorus shift in a style that recalls stevie nicks edge of seventeen 1982 del rey uses an inexpressive tone in song with her voice being layered into track s production by means of reverberation in addition her vocals use a more sensual and sinister tone than in her previous discography and are often sung in an anxious and breathy style and in an octave just above a whisper she also sings track s backing vocals which in part contribute to song s ethereal feel through distant faraway moans muumuse s bradley stern observed that del rey s voice skipped between breathy and slurred drugged out ecstasy throughout song she restrains her delivery during its verses but sings in a sweeping cinematic style in its chorus west coast was noted to be a cross between works of bands portishead and beach house it was also highlighted that track deviated from del rey s formula in born to die and paradise 2012 as an evolution of their sound though

trappings of born to die its eeriness omnipresent in previous del rey tracks takes on a full on psychedelia sound recalling turtles you showed me 1969 west coast is set in simple time signature of 4 4 with a moderately fast tempo of 123 beats per minute in its verses and a slow tempo of 65 beats per minute in its chorus it is composed in key of f minor with del rey s vocals spanning range from f2 to c5 track has basic a chord progression of fm fm e d fm e d in its first verse and bm d fm fm cm d d e in its chorus a melancholy love song its lyrics depict a woman torn between love and ambition west coast also serves as a dedication to del rey s california hometown and elicits imagery from its titular location in song she sings about leaving a lover for californian promise of fame and emphasizes on a gulf between a sweetly uncomplicated romance and a dysfunctional relationship similarly to her previous works lyrics are both specific and vague and complement track s dreamlike sonics west coast sets up a disunity between form and content and though a love song its sound is more reminiscent to that of a breakup song it was also noted that lyrics depict a vivid picture of teenage summer memories and forgotten romance comparing track s lyrical content to that of sonic youth s superstar 1994 grantland s molly lambert analyzed while born to die era lana often displayed a preening
