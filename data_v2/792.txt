250t boat 250t class were high seas torpedo boats built for austro hungarian navy between 1913 and 1916 a total of 27 boats were built by three shipbuilding companies with letter after boat number indicating manufacturer there were small variations between manufacturers mainly in steam turbines used and whether they had one or two funnels eight boats of t group designated 74 t 81 t were built by stabilimento tecnico triestino located at trieste sixteen boats of f group 82 f 97 f were built by ganz danubius at their shipyards at fiume and porto re three m group boats 98 m 100 m were manufactured by cantiere navale triestino at monfalcone all 27 boats saw service in world war i undertaking anti submarine operations in adriatic sea shore bombardment missions along its italian coastline and convoy escort and minesweeping tasks although widely used during war class suffered no losses despite taking hits during surface engagements and damage from accidents in 1917 one of guns on each boat was placed on an anti aircraft mount under terms of post war treaty of saint germain en laye boats were transferred to various countries including seven to romania six to portugal six to greece and eight to newly created kingdom of serbs croats and slovenes later yugoslavia by 1940 thirteen boats of class had been lost or scrapped including all six portuguese boats during world war ii five remaining greek boats were sunk by axis aircraft during german led invasion of greece in april 1941 one romanian boat was lost during war while two remaining romanian boats performed escort tasks in black sea before being taken over by soviet navy and serving in black sea fleet until end of war they were finally stricken in late 1945 six surviving yugoslav boats were captured by italians during axis invasion of yugoslavia in april 1941 and were operated by regia marina in a coastal and second line escort role immediately following italian capitulation in september 1943 one ex yugoslav boat was sunk by german aircraft another was scuttled by its italian crew and two more fell back into yugoslav hands a few months later remaining two were seized by germans of two ex yugoslav boats taken over by germans both were operated by croatian crews or by navy of independent state of croatia for some time before being recovered by germans one was destroyed by royal navy motor torpedo boats in june 1944 and other was sunk by royal air force aircraft in 1945 two surviving boats were commissioned by yugoslav navy after war one continuing in service until early 1960s background in 1910 austria hungary naval technical committee initiated design and development of a coastal torpedo boat specifying that it should be capable of sustaining for 10 hours this specification was based on an expectation that in a future conflict strait of otranto where adriatic sea meets ionian sea would be blockaded by hostile forces in such circumstances there would be a need for a torpedo boat that could sail from southern adriatic austro hungarian navy base at cattaro to strait during darkness locate and attack blockading ships and return to port before morning steam turbine power was selected for propulsion as diesels with necessary power were not available and austro hungarian navy did not have practical experience to run turbo electric boats description and construction stabilimento tecnico triestino stt of trieste was selected for contract to build eight vessels ahead of one other tenderer despite specifications of contract being very close to requirements for coastal torpedo boat stt boats were classified as sea going stt boats used parsons turbines driving two propeller shafts another tender was requested for four more boats but when ganz danubius reduced their price by ten percent a total of sixteen boats were ordered from them these boats were powered by aeg curtiss turbines and had two funnels rather than single funnel of stt boats third contract went to cantiere navale triestino cnt who used melms pfenniger turbines and their boats also had two funnels boats of all three groups used steam generated by two yarrow water tube boilers one of which burned fuel oil and other coal when completed all 27 boats were armed with two skoda l 30 guns and four torpedo tubes each vessel could carry 10 12 naval mines t group t group were built by stt

torpedo craft division of austro hungarian 1st torpedo craft flotilla all 27 boats saw service performing convoy escort and minesweeping tasks anti submarine operations and shore bombardment missions they also conducted patrols and supported seaplane raids against italian coast due to inadequate funding 250t class were essentially coastal vessels despite original intention that they would be used for high seas operations on 24 may 1915 several 250t class boats were involved in shelling of various italian shore based targets known as bombardment of ancona 74 t 77 t were part of operation against ancona and 78 t 81 t were involved in shelling of porto corsini near ravenna in latter action an italian shore battery returned fire hitting light cruiser and damaging 80 t on 23 july 74 t and

torpedoes that night destroyer csikos accompanied by 78 t 93 f and 96 f were pursued in northern adriatic by an italian force of five destroyers but were able to retire to safety behind a minefield on 14 15 may 1917 several 250t class boats were part of support forces for a major raid on otranto barrage when raiding force departed torpedo boats and aircraft secured approaches to austro hungarian naval base at cattaro once raiding force had departed for barrage sankt georg a destroyer and 84 f 88 f 99 m and 100 m were to be prepared to sortie out to support raiders on their return voyage old coastal defence ship and 86 f 91 f and 95 f were also available at cattaro if needed although raid was a success sinking 14 drifters raiding force was then engaged by allied ships in battle of otranto straits both support groups sailed to meet returning austro hungarian force including heavily damaged novara which was under tow on marrying up with raiding force torpedo boats fanned out to screen larger warships protecting them as they returned to port on 3 june destroyers wildfang and csikos along with 93 f and 96 f briefly encountered three italian mas boats off mouth of tagliamento river in far north of adriatic on 23 september 77 t and 78 t were laying a minefield off in northern adriatic when they had a brief encounter with an italian mas boat following night 94 f and three other

constanta on 20 august 1944 and survived world war ii having been transferred to soviet black sea fleet in late august 1944 after romania changed sides and joined allies serving as musson and toros respectively yugoslav boats served in a coastal and second line escort role with royal italian navy in adriatic under their yugoslav designations and were fitted with two l 30 anti aircraft guns in place of their 66 mm guns but no other significant alterations were made to them after italians capitulated in september 1943 they transferred t1 back to kjrm in exile in december of that year t3 was seized by germans at rijeka on 16 september 1943 and was renamed ta48 she was commissioned on 15 august 1944 and was used for patrol and escort work in northern adriatic germans added to her armament fitting her with two single anti aircraft guns in addition to guns fitted by italians and removing two of her torpedo tubes there are two versions of how ta48 was employed first version indicates that she was crewed exclusively by croatian officers and sailors but remained under german control and second states that she was handed over to navy of independent state of croatia but was repossessed by germans on 14 december 1944 because they considered croatians unreliable her complement was also increased to 52 during her german croatian service she was sunk in port of trieste by allied aircraft
