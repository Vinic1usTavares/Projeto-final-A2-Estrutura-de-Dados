positive review from cindy white of ign she said laughs were scarce this episode but lack of humor was compensated by emotional highlights however she praised performances of many of supporting cast she ultimately gave episode a 7 out of 10 denoting a good episode alan sepinwall of hitfix felt that episode was very up and down largely due to inconsistent writing he did however feel that ending song was beautiful and enough to justify episode dan forcella of tv fanatic awarded episode four and a half stars out of five and called it funny and sweet and a perfect penultimate episode for steve carell myles mcnutt of a v club awarded episode a b he felt that it was appropriate that steve carell s time on series was bookended largely by dundies he noted that episode in which awards were introduced eponymous second season entry served as a second pilot of sorts for series and idea to bring dundies back made sense at time in order to see how characters had grown however he felt that episode at large did not live up to its source material and that it was occasionally funny but unfortunately meaningless ending song however in mcnutt s opinion was a highlight of episode will ferrell s character received criticism in episode white criticized deangelo vickers noting that she did not have a handle on character and that he was too downright normal and practically boring mcnutt argued that while ferrell is not really problem with role of deangelo vickers actions between ferrell and carell felt more like hanging out to commemorate former s departure from a television show rather than two playing believable characters he also felt that deangelo feels disruptive to show s narrative because his character gets in way of plot sepinwall felt that parts of episode fell flat because it spent so much time giving will ferrell stuff to do he further noted that nobody has come up with a good reason for him being here other than that he s will ferrell references external links michael
