1821 voyage new south greenland sometimes known as morrell s land was an appearance of land recorded by american captain benjamin morrell of schooner wasp in during a sealing and exploration voyage in weddell sea area of antarctica morrell provided precise coordinates and a description of a coastline which he claimed to have sailed along for more than because weddell sea area was so little visited and hard to navigate due to ice conditions alleged land was never properly investigated before its existence was emphatically disproved during antarctic expeditions in early 20th century at time of morrell s voyage geography of then unnamed weddell sea and its surrounding coasts was almost entirely unknown making claimed sighting initially plausible however obvious errors in morrell s voyage account and his general reputation as a fabulist created scepticism about existence of this new land in german explorer wilhelm filchner searched for but found no traces of land after his ship deutschland became icebound in weddell sea and drifted into locality of morrell s observation a sounding of sea bottom revealed more than of water indicating no land in near proximity three years later trapped in same waters with his ship endurance ernest shackleton was able by similar means to confirm land s non existence various explanations for morrell s error have been suggested including intentional deception however morrell describes his find briefly and prosaically evidently seeking no personal credit or glory from discovery in his narrative he assigns honour to his fellow sealing captain robert johnson for finding and naming land two years earlier morrell may have been honestly mistaken through miscalculation of his ship s position or by misremembering detail when writing account after nine years alternatively he may have made common error of confusing distant icebergs with land or been misled by distorting effects of antarctic mirage in 1843 distinguished british naval explorer james clark ross reported possible land in a position close to morrell s this land too would eventually be proven not to exist voyage of wasp 1822 23 june 1822 to march 1823 in early

prosecute new discoveries he proposed to use this discretion to investigate antarctic seas and to ascertain practicality of penetrating to south pole this would be first of four extended voyages that would keep morrell at sea for most of following eight years although he would not revisit antarctic after initial voyage subsequent voyages in successive ships would take morrell to pacific ocean

various positions during voyage at southerly latitudes which later proved to be at least 100 miles inside then undiscovered antarctic continental mainland one possible explanation for this discrepancy offered by writer w j mills is that since morrell s account was written nine years after voyage he may not have had access to ship s log and hence felt constrained to invent details that appeared plausible in order to sustain his narrative on wasp reached candlemas island in south sandwich islands after a few days spent in a search for fuel to feed ship s stoves morrell sailed southwards on

subsequently proved to be nonexistent had from time to time been reported see list of reported lands and islands in robert headland of scott polar research institute has suggested various reasons for these false sightings ranging from too much rum to deliberate hoaxes designed to lure rival ships away from good sealing grounds some sightings may have been of large ice masses that were carrying rocks and other glacial debris dirty ice can appear convincingly similar to land it is also possible that some of these lands existed but later became submerged after volcanic eruptions other sightings may have been of actual land position of which was wrongly fixed through observational errors arising from chronometer failure adverse weather or simple incompetence rubin p 152 insert by

that very little weight is given to discovery in morrell s 500 page account gould writes if morrell wished to gain an undeserved reputation as an antarctic explorer one would think he could have gone a better way about it than to bury his pieces justificatives after he had forged them in an undistinguished corner of so bulky a book gould p 268 nor would he have credited it to captain johnson two

a short stretch of this coast approximately long separated from weddell sea by larsen ice shelf see p 107 despite its being 14deg further west from position of new south greenland sighting gould asserts that features of peninsula s eastern coast corresponds closely with morrell s description of new south greenland gould pp 277 78 this theory supposes that morrell miscalculated ship s position perhaps because he lacked chronometer necessary for proper navigational observation in his account morrell writes that he was destitute of various nautical and mathematical instruments morrell p 67 although other parts of his narrative seem to indicate that occasional dead reckoning calculation was exception to norm gould p 276 a longitudinal error of 14deg is very large and additional distance of about to foyn coast seems too great to have been covered within ten day voyage from south sandwich islands where ship s position is recorded accurately even so gould suggests that a balance of evidence shows that what morrell saw was foyn coast gould pp 280 81 thumb 270px alt distant shadowy appearances of land seen across a wide expanse of sea an example of a fata morgana a form of

is echoed by simpson housley he suggests that morrell and his crew saw a superior mirage one form of superior mirage sometimes described as a fata morgana distorts distant flat coastlines or ice edges both vertically and horizontally so they can appear to have tall cliffs and other features such as high mountain peaks and valleys in his expedition account south shackleton gives a description of a
