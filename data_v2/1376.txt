cleaning symbiosis is a mutually beneficial association between individuals of two species where one cleaner removes and eats parasites and other materials from surface of other client cleaning symbiosis is well known among marine fish where some small species of cleaner fish notably wrasses but also species in other genera are specialised to feed almost exclusively by cleaning larger fish and other marine animals other cleaning symbioses exist between birds and mammals and in other groups cleaning behaviour was first described by greek historian herodotus in about 420 bc though his example birds serving crocodiles appears to occur only rarely role of cleaning symbioses has been debated by biologists for over thirty years some believe that cleaning represents selfless co operation essentially pure mutualism increasing fitness of both individuals others such as robert trivers hold that it illustrates mutual selfishness reciprocal altruism others again believe that cleaning behaviour is simply one sided exploitation a form of parasitism cheating where either a cleaner sometimes harms its client or a predatory species mimics a cleaner also occurs predatory cheating is analogous to batesian mimicry as where a harmless hoverfly mimics a stinging wasp though with tables turned some genuine cleaner fish such as gobies and wrasse have same colours and patterns in an example of convergent evolution mutual resemblance among cleaner fish is analogous to mullerian mimicry as where stinging bees and wasps mimic each other history thumb herodotus asserted that trochilus bird possibly a sandpiper was able to enter mouth of nile crocodile in what would now be called a cleaning symbiosis drawing by henry scherren 1906 in his histories book ii ancient greek historian herodotus wrote herodotus thus claimed circa 440 bc that nile crocodiles had what would now be called a cleaning symbiosis with bird he called trochilus possibly a sandpiper in 1906 henry scherren quoted john mason cook son of travel agent thomas cook as reporting from egypt that he had seen some spur winged plovers approach a crocodile which opened its jaws for them macfarland and reeder reviewing evidence found that a disputed relationship cleaning symbiosis is a relationship between a pair of animals of different species involving removal and subsequent ingestion of ectoparasites diseased and injured tissue and unwanted food items from surface of host organism client by cleaning organism cleaner its status has been debated by biologists with viewpoints ranging from pure mutualism through to a form of exploitative parasitism by cleaner marine biologist alexandra grutter explains selfless co operation grutter and her colleague robert poulin reviewing over thirty years of debate by biologists on cleaning symbioses argue that cleaning symbioses may not be mutualistic associations but rather one sided exploitation however one must then ask why no counter adaptation has evolved in clients to free them from this exploitation if clients are puppets of cleaners then fitness consequences of being exploited must be small they quote as an example of an early position c limbaugh writing in 1961 from standpoint of philosopher of biology extent of cleaning behavior in ocean emphasizes role of co operation in nature as opposed to tooth and claw struggle for existence mutual selfishness in 1971 mathematical biologist robert trivers wrote more carefully cleaner organisms and their hosts meet preconditions for evolution of reciprocally altruistic behavior host s altruism is to be explained as benefiting him because of advantage of being able quickly and repeatedly to return to same cleaner i e mutual selfishness one sided exploitation by 1987 g s losey wrote less optimistically cleaners are nothing but very clever behavioral parasites that have taken advantage of rewarding aspects of tactile stimulation found in nearly all vertebrates poulin and grutter remark that over last few decades opinion of scientists regarding cleaning symbioses has changed from selfless cooperation to a mutually beneficial interaction and finally to a one sided exploitation biological range cleaning symbiosis is known from several groups of animals both in sea and on land see table cleaners include fish shrimps and birds clients include a much wider range of fish marine reptiles including turtles and iguanas octopus whales and terrestrial mammals cleaning symbioses with reptile clients include fish cleaning teeth of american

fishes where several species of small fish notably of wrasse are specialised in colour pattern and behaviour as cleaners providing a cleaning and removal service to larger often predatory fish cleaner species as shown in table vary widely in their degree of dependence on their clients some are essentially pure obligate symbionts like cleaner wrasse some are opportunistic or facultative symbionts like orange chromide or some cleaner shrimps and some like oxpeckers combine a little eating of parasites beneficial to client with taking of blood harmful to client their favoured food mimicry among

labroides dimidiatus copying its dance but then biting duped client mutual mimicry among cleaner fish many cleaner fish in different families such as caribbean neon goby elacatinus evelynae and indo pacific cleaner wrasse labroides dimidiatus share distinctive combination of a long narrow body a longitudinal stripe a blue colour and small size convergent signalling among cleaners using size stripes and colour should facilitate their recognition by fish clients this is analogous to mullerian mimicry where genuinely aposematic species such as wasps mimic each other s warning colours aggressive mimicry of cleaner fish by sabre toothed blenny taeniatus is a predatory blenny an aggressive mimic which accurately resembles bluestreak cleaner wrasse not only in colour and pattern but also in ritualised dance cleaner wrasse makes when potential client fish swim nearby however instead of providing cleaning service that it signals it bites off pieces of healthy skin scales and mucus from host and then swims rapidly away to safety comparison of batesian mimicry with aggressive mimicry of cleaner fish type of mimicry model mimic dupe model dupe relationship dupe s expectation effect batesian mimicry wasp hoverfly predatory bird antagonistic predator prey mimic looks noxious mimic dupes predator into not eating mimic aggressive mimicry bluestreak cleaner wrasse sabre toothed blenny client fish co operative cleaner client mimic looks to be a cleaner mimic dupes client into allowing mimic to bite effect of aggressive mimicry in a cleaning symbiosis is analogous to batesian mimicry where a harmless edible mimetic species copies warning signal of a noxious aposematic model species thereby gaining protection from predators as in batesian mimicry rate of successful attacks on cleaning clients by fangblenny plagiotremus rhinorhynchos which like sabre toothed blenny mimic bluestreak cleaner wrasse labroides dimidiatus is frequency dependent meaning that mimicry is more effective when cheating fangblenny is rare compared to cleaner wrasse difference however is that aggressive mimic is inserting itself into a co operative relationship between cleaner and client whereas batesian mimics insert themselves into an antagonistic predator prey interaction where models are unpalatable prey fangblenny has evolved an opioid containing venom which dulls pain and lowers
