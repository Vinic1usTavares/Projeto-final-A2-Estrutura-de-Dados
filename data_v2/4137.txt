between mongolian wild horse and arabian first mentioned in written chronicles in 1584 manipuri ponies were used as cavalry horses throughout 17th and 18th centuries in late 19th and early 20th centuries they were in demand by british for use as polo ponies breed numbers have dwindled however mainly due to exports and today population is very low in 2007 a genetic study was conducted on manipuri and four other indian equine breeds manipuri was shown to be genetically close to three other indian pony breeds but genetically more distant from marwari sole indian horse breed in study manipuri pony was originally bred for polo and military usage and today is bred mainly for playing polo and racing although it is also in demand for military transport use breed characteristics

was published that examined genetic variation among five indian equine breeds manipuri marwari spiti bhutia and based on analysis of microsatellite dna manipuri was found to have greatest genetic distance from marwari and a much closer genetic distance to other three breeds distance from marwari was not only genetic but seen in physical characteristics particularly height and environmental adaptability physical differences were attributed to differing ancestries marwari horse is closely associated with arabian while four other breeds are thought to have descended at least in part from tibetan pony none of breeds in study were found to be closely genetically associated with thoroughbred history sources disagree as to exact origins of manipuri pony although all agree that it was

mention of breed dates to a brief statement in 1584 manipur royal chronicle by early 1600s breed was mentioned frequently in manipur literature they were often used as cavalry horses and were ridden by warriors manipuri ponies played a major part in cavalry commanded by whose horsemen terrorized upper burma throughout early 1700s and in 1738 were used during his sack of sagaing between 1859 and 1916 manipuri ponies were extremely desired by british for playing polo and there were further infusions of arabian blood in 19th century as british administrators and military officers sought to upgrade their polo ponies height of polo horses was initially restricted to based on average height of manipuri and although this restriction was later relaxed to and then removed altogether demand for manipuris was so high that area was drained of them at one point during this period export of ponies from manipur was banned to allow breed time to increase in number to a viable level manipuris were also used to transport british troops into burma throughout world war ii in 1977 manipur horse riding and polo association was established to promote manipuri pony breed and game of polo in recent years breed numbers have decreased and estimates place breed at somewhere between 2 300 and 1 000 in population in 21st century population numbers continue to dwindle in part due to high numbers of ponies being smuggled into myanmar burma where breed is in demand after either having been purchased or stolen from their indian owners in 2005 a heritage park was begun by manipur horse riding and polo association with goal of preventing extinction of breed and promoting them to tourists uses polo was introduced into area of manipur state as early as seventh century and manipuri ponies were one of first breeds used in game british learned of polo during 19th century while watching it played on manipuri ponies in india breed is still used for polo today in india but other breeds are more popular in europe and america manipuri ponies are often also used to play sagol kangjei a version of polo believed to be close to what was originally played when sport was invented sagol kangjei is more demanding than modern polo as ponies are used for entire match instead of being changed between periods manipuri ponies are also used for racing during their early history they were in demand as cavalry horses and men that rode these ponies were thought well mounted they continue to be in demand for military uses references category horse breeds category horse breeds
