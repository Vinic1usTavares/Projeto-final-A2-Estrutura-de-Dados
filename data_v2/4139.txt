surrounding death and burial suggesting areas where this ritual activity is visible in burial record of multiple societies merrifield goes on to discuss archaeological evidence for ritual practices in christian europe highlighting areas of ritual continuance from earlier pagan periods in particular deposition of metal goods in water looking at evidence for foundation deposits in european buildings

merrifield 1987 p vii he dedicated book to memory of h s toms former curator of brighton museum and a one time assistant to archaeologist augustus pitt rivers in his dedication merrifield noted that toms had been his first mentor in archaeology and folk studies merrifield 1987 un numbered page synopsis in his preface merrifield noted that while archaeologists studying prehistoric periods have paid increasing attention to evidence for ritual and magic in archaeological record their counterparts working in later historical periods have failed to follow their lead presenting this book as a rectifier he outlines his intentions and study s limitations merrifield 1987 pp xiii xiv chapter one ritual and archaeologist begins by describing ritual deposits from pre roman iron age sites of cadbury castle and danebury hillforts in southern britain merrifield laments fact that majority of archaeologists particularly those studying literate historical periods have avoided ritual explanations for unusual phenomenon in archaeological record he believes that they exhibit a ritual phobia he contrasts this view with that of those archaeologists studying neolithic and bronze age britain who have widely accepted ritual uses of chambered tombs and stone circles he specifies particular definitions for words such as ritual religion and superstition arguing that such terms must be used with precision by archaeologists offering a case study he describes how neolithic stone axes were adopted as amulets or talismans in later roman iron age onward in britain and that as such archaeologists should expect to find them in non prehistoric contexts merrifield 1987 pp 1 21 left thumb 300px alt a photo of large stones arranged in a circle at swinside england merrifield noted that archaeologists studying neolithic and bronze age europe regularly recognised ritual significance of monuments such as this stone circle at swinside in lake district england but that their counterparts studying later periods of history often neglected to consider ritual explanations in second chapter offerings to earth and water in pre roman and roman times merrifield explores various forms of archaeological evidence for ritual deposits in pre roman iron age and roman iron age of britain he provides an overview of evidence for animal and human sacrifice as well as that in support of ritual offerings in bodies of water such as river thames merrifield deals with votive deposits on land in particular looking at evidence for deposition in ditches shafts and wells he rounds off chapter by examining evidence for iron age rituals that took place at commencement and termination of building constructions merrifield 1987 pp 22 58 chapter three rituals of death deals with religious rituals accompanying death and burial and their visibility in archaeological record it explains three main ways which human communities have dealt with corpses of dead through exposing them to elements and scavengers through inhumation and through cremation at beliefs surrounding afterlife merrifield discusses ways in which these beliefs might be visible in archaeological record such as through deposition of grave goods discussing evidence for rituals of separation through which deceased is separated from world of living including those that deal with decapitation of body merrifield then looks at effect of christianity on burials in europe arguing that it brought a new intimacy with dead through collection of relics which was in contrast to pagan beliefs of roman empire which portrayed deceased as unclean merrifield 1987 pp 59 82 fourth chapter from paganism to christianity explores continuing practice of ritual in christian europe discussing early roman catholic church s of pagan deities merrifield states that church continued propagating a form of polytheism through cult of blessed dead veneration of saints and martyrs throughout middle ages discussing ritual use of

survivals revivals and reinterpretations continues merrifield s exploration of ritual practices in christian europe he examines late and post medieval items that have been deposited in rivers including swords and pilgrimage souvenirs speculating that their deposition might represent a survival from pagan tradition of casting votive offerings into water he speculates that contemporary practice of throwing a coin into a fountain for good luck is a further survival of custom he then discusses evidence for ritual foundation deposits under buildings noting widespread medieval deposition of an animal s head or jaw in a construction s foundations presumably for protective magical purposes proceeding to deal with late and post medieval deposition of pots under foundations he looks at their place in churches where it was believed that they aided acoustics continuing with this theme he discusses british folk custom of burying a horse s head under floor to improve a building

recognition academic reviews archaeology of ritual and magic was reviewed by john hutchings for folklore journal published arm of folklore society he highlighted how work would be of benefit to folklorists by putting various charms then in museum exhibits such as dead cats buried shoes and witch bottles into wider context of ritual activity he opined that it was a little disappointing that examples were almost all from london and home counties but described book as lucidly written carefully argued and well illustrated hutchings 1989 in a short review for antiquaries journal historian of religion hilda ellis davidson praised cautious and balanced arguments of merrifield s work she opined that it should be read by every archaeologist as a corrective to what she thought was their widespread ignorance of folklore noting that wide array of evidence for ritual behaviour in archaeological record would surprise many readers ellis davidson 1988 wider recognition writing merrifield s obituary for independent newspaper museum of london archaeologist peter marsden described archaeology of ritual and magic as a masterly study of an unusual subject marsden 1995 importance of merrifield s book was discussed by englishman brian hoggard an independent researcher who authored a 2004 academic paper entitled archaeology of counter witchcraft and popular magic being published in

studies of magic were restricted to small journals magazines and newspaper articles hoggard 2004 pp 167 186 influential nature of merrifield s work was also recognised by medieval archaeologist roberta gilchrist of university of reading in an academic paper published in a 2008 edition of medieval archaeology journal gilchrist referenced merrifield s study noting that it offered a rare contribution to archaeology of ritual and magic in britain in particular she highlighted his belief that many archaeologists dealing with literate cultures exhibited a ritual phobia as accurate
