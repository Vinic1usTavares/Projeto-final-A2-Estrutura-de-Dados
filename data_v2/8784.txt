of preceding s as an economy measure they were intended to revert to previous practice of using both fuel oil and coal but first sea lord jackie fisher rescinded decision for coal in october 1914 still under construction ships were redesigned to employ oil fired boilers that increased power of engines by over original specification resolution had a length overall of a beam of and a deep draught of she had a designed displacement of and displaced at deep load she was powered by two pairs of parsons steam turbines each driving two shafts using steam from eighteen yarrow boilers

decided that fleet should not be risked in further such sorties unless german high seas fleet ventured north or strategic situation warranted risk for its part german fleet remained in port or trained in baltic sea through 1917 as both sides had largely abandoned idea of a decisive surface battle in north sea both sides turned to positional warfare laying fields of naval mines and germany resumed unrestricted submarine warfare campaign early in year as a result resolution and rest of grand fleet saw no action during this period in 1917 britain began running regular convoys to norway escorted by light forces germans raided these convoys twice late in year prompting admiral david beatty who had replaced jellicoe previous year to send battle squadrons of grand fleet to escort convoys high

fleet british ships returned fire and in course of about half an hour resolution and barham had fired more than 100 shells from their main battery poor visibility hampered their shooting and between them two battleships only scored a single hit on a freighter unable to effectively engage french forces in harbor cunningham broke off attack after several of his ships received serious hits from french coastal batteries next day cunningham attempted an air strike from ark royal which failed to damage heavily armoured richelieu while they were steaming off coast destroyer came under attack from a french cruiser which resolution drove off with a single broadside of her main battery guns battleships then moved into position to attack port they scored a single hit on richelieu though it

withdrew before attacking again later in afternoon resolution engaged shore battery while barham fired on richelieu neither british ship scored any hits though resolution was straddled by coastal guns cunningham again disengaged determined to make another attack next morning two battleships arrived off dakar at around 9 00 to launch another attack this time supported by a pair of heavy cruisers just as they were manoeuvring into position french submarine launched a spread of torpedoes at battleships one of which struck resolution amidships on her port side explosion tore a large hole in her hull and flooded port boiler room reducing her to a speed of and causing a serious list to port resolution was forced to withdraw leaving barham to engage richelieu by herself cunningham escorted

battleships were no longer front line warships vice admiral chuichi nagumo s powerful kido butai composed of six carriers and four fast battleships was significantly stronger than somerville s eastern fleet as a result only modernised warspite could operate with two fleet carriers resolution her three sisters and hermes were kept away from combat to escort convoys in indian ocean in late march code breakers at far east combined bureau a branch of bletchley park informed somerville that japanese were planning a raid into indian ocean to attack colombo and trincomalee and destroy his fleet he
