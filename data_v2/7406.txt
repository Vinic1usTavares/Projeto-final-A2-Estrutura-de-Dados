focus of storyline is psychological effect that attack has on toyah there are many women out there who have been raped or sexually assaulted and we owe it to them to make sure that story line is handled sensitively and accurately there is no denying that rape is a sensitive and controversial storyline but i have put my heart and soul into it trying to portray it accurately and i only hope that women who have experienced it will think i have given it justice a show spokesperson commented that storyline would be handled sensitively and that it would not become a whodunnit some of male residents came under suspicion and were forced to give dna samples peter barlow chris gascoyne briefly became prime suspect but dna soon eliminated him from enquires toyah was aware that her attacker

about attack there s another side of her that wants to let it go and just leave it to courts to deal with him toyah agreed to phil s request to visit him and taylor said that toyah believed that seeing phil in person would help her to come to terms with what happened when toyah came face to face with phil her first thought was how pathetic he looked when phil tried to make excuses for what he had done toyah did not feel any pity and told him to plead guilty which he agreed to do toyah left prison feeling tearful but triumphant and taylor commented that while she would never fully recover
