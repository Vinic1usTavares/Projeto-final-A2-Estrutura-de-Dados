government of japan is a constitutional monarchy in which power of emperor is limited and is relegated primarily to ceremonial duties as in many other states government is divided into three branches legislative branch executive branch and judicial branch government runs under framework established by constitution of japan adopted in 1947 it is a unitary state containing forty seven administrative divisions with emperor as its head of state his role is ceremonial and he has no powers related to government instead it is cabinet comprising ministers of state and prime minister that directs and controls government cabinet is source of power of executive branch and is formed by prime minister who is head of government he or she is designated by national diet and appointed to office by emperor national diet is legislature organ of legislative branch it is bicameral consisting of two houses with house of councillors being upper house and house of representatives being lower house its members are directly elected from people who are source of sovereignty supreme court and other inferior courts make up judicial branch and they are independent from executive and legislative branches history prior to meiji restoration japan was ruled by successive military shoguns during this period effective power of government resided in shogun who officially ruled country in name of emperor shoguns were hereditary military governors with their modern rank equivalent to a generalissimo although emperor was sovereign who appointed shogun his roles were ceremonial and he took no part in governing country this is often compared to present role of emperor whose official role is to appoint prime minister meiji restoration in 1868 led to resignation of shogun tokugawa yoshinobu agreeing to be instrument for carrying out emperor s orders this event restored country to imperial rule and proclamation of empire of japan in 1889 meiji constitution was adopted in a move to strengthen japan to level of western nations resulting in first parliamentary system in asia it provided a form of mixed constitutional absolute monarchy with an independent judiciary based on prussian model of time a new aristocracy known as kazoku was established it merged ancient court nobility of heian period and former daimyos feudal lords subordinate to shogun it also established imperial diet consisting of house of representatives and house of peers members of house of peers were made up of imperial family kazoku and those nominated by emperor while members of house of representatives were elected by direct male suffrage despite clear distinctions between powers of executive branch and emperor in meiji constitution ambiguity and contradictions in constitution eventually led to a political crisis it also devalued notion of civilian control over military which meant that military could develop and exercise a great influence on politics following end of world war ii present constitution of japan was adopted it replaced previous imperial rule with a form of western style liberal democracy emperor thumb right 250px imperial standard is head of imperial family and ceremonial head of state he is defined by constitution to be symbol of state and of unity of people however he is not nominal chief executive and he possesses only certain ceremonially important powers he has no real powers related to government as stated clearly in article 4 of constitution article 6 of constitution of japan delegates emperor following ceremonial roles appointment of prime minister as designated by diet appointment of chief justice of supreme court as designated by cabinet while cabinet is source of executive power and most of its power is exercised directly by prime minister several of its powers are exercised by emperor powers exercised via emperor as stipulated by article 7 of constitution are promulgation of amendments of constitution laws cabinet orders and treaties convocation of diet dissolution of house of representatives proclamation of general election of members of diet attestation of appointment and dismissal of ministers of state and other officials as provided for by law and of full powers and credentials of ambassadors and ministers attestation of general and special amnesty commutation of punishment reprieve and restoration of rights awarding of honors attestation of instruments of ratification and other diplomatic documents as provided for by law receiving foreign ambassadors and ministers performance of ceremonial functions emperor is known to hold nominal ceremonial authority for example emperor is only person that has authority to appoint prime minister even though diet has power to designate person fitted for position one such example can be prominently seen in 2009 dissolution of house of representatives house was expected to be dissolved on advice of prime minister but was temporarily unable to do so for next general election as both emperor and empress were visiting canada in this manner emperor s modern role is often compared to those of shogunate period and much of japan s history whereby emperor held great symbolic authority but had little political power which is often held by others nominally appointed by emperor himself today a legacy has somewhat continued for a retired prime minister who still wields considerable power to be called a unlike his european counterparts emperor is not source of sovereign power and government does not act under his name instead emperor represents state and appoints other high officials in name of state in which japanese people hold sovereignty article 5 of constitution in accordance with imperial household law allows a regency to be established in emperor s name should emperor be unable to perform his duties imperial house of japan is said to be oldest continuing hereditary monarchy in world according to kojiki and nihon shoki japan was founded by imperial house in

of japan are unitary in which local jurisdictions largely depend on national government both administratively and financially san ge zi zhi they are established as an act of devolution under constitution all matters pertaining to local self government is allowed to be determined for by law more specifically local autonomy law ministry of internal affairs and communications intervenes significantly in local government as do other ministries this is done chiefly financially because many local government jobs need funding initiated by national ministries this is dubbed as thirty percent autonomy result of this power is a high level of organizational and policy standardization among different local jurisdictions allowing them to preserve uniqueness of their prefecture city or town some of more collectivist jurisdictions such as tokyo and kyoto have experimented with policies in such areas as social welfare that later were adopted by national government local authorities japan is divided into forty seven administrative divisions prefectures are one metropolitan district tokyo two urban prefectures kyoto and osaka forty three rural prefectures and one district hokkaido large cities are subdivided into wards and further split into towns or precincts or subprefectures and counties cities are self governing units administered independently of larger jurisdictions within which they are located in order to attain city status a jurisdiction must have at least 500 000 inhabitants 60 percent of whom are engaged in urban occupations there are self governing towns outside cities as well as precincts of urban wards like cities each has its own elected mayor and assembly villages are smallest self governing entities in rural areas they often consist of a number of rural hamlets containing several thousand people connected to one another through formally imposed framework of village administration villages have mayors and councils elected to four year terms structure each jurisdiction has a chief executive called a in prefectures and a in municipalities most jurisdictions also have a unicameral although towns and villages may opt for direct governance by citizens in a both executive and assembly are elected by popular vote every four years local governments follow a modified version of separation of powers used in national government an assembly may pass a vote of no confidence in executive in which case executive must either dissolve assembly within ten days or automatically lose their office following next election however executive remains in office unless new assembly again passes a no confidence resolution primary methods of local lawmaking are and ordinances similar to statutes in national system are passed by assembly and may impose limited criminal penalties for violations up to 2 years in prison and or 1 million yen in fines regulations similar to cabinet orders in national system are passed by executive unilaterally are superseded by any conflicting ordinances and may only impose a fine of up to 50 000 yen local governments also generally have multiple committees such as school boards public safety committees responsible for overseeing police personnel committees election committees and auditing committees these may be directly elected or chosen by assembly executive or both all prefectures are required to maintain departments of general affairs finance welfare health and labor departments of agriculture fisheries forestry commerce and industry are optional depending on local needs governor is
