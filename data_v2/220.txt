kellum in 1846 as junior partner of gamaliel king who required an on site partner while designing brooklyn borough hall firm designed commercial buildings such as cary building one of earliest cast iron facades in new york city kellum started his own practice in 1860 and designed several buildings for alexander t stewart including stewart s department store at broadway and 10th street as well as master plan for garden city long island kellum was hired to tweed courthouse project in august 1861 he died in august 1871 around same time tweed ring would lose its power at his death reception of his work was mixed while his obituary in harper s weekly praised him profusely an anonymous writer for american architect and building news said that his involvement in tweed courthouse negated anything else he had designed thomas little a political appointee of new york city board of supervisors was given ex officio credit having been recognized as a collaborator by virtue of his membership on board of supervisors his first design was new england congregational church in brooklyn which he designed in 1852 and he had submitted plans for tweed courthouse in 1859 multiple documents and testimony indicate that little was likely first architect of courthouse and that kellum had been hired later leopold eidlitz was born in prague and immigrated to u s in 1843 prior to working on courthouse eidlitz worked with richard and with otto blesch collaborating with both architects to design numerous churches such as st george s episcopal church eidlitz s other projects included new york state capitol which he started in 1875 following year eidlitz was hired to finish courthouse he added building s south wing and domed rotunda in a similar design to state capitol eidlitz believed that most important part of a building s design was its materials romanesque style and his extensive use of brick and stone transformed appearance of courthouse in contrast to kellum s intricate cast iron design new york city landmarks preservation commission stated that eidlitz s style departs from kellum s classicism with an american version of organic architecture expressed through medieval forms history site tweed courthouse is located in city hall park directly north of new york city hall and courthouse s specific site had previously been occupied by public commons and a poorhouse dutch settlers of new amsterdam used location as a grazing site for animals in 1686 courthouse site was acquired by british as a prisoners punishment location and an african burial ground eight graves from american colonial era still exist beneath courthouse various other government buildings would be built at courthouse s future site including an almshouse upper barracks new gaol a military jail called bridewell and a second almshouse city hall and now demolished rotunda were built in 1871 just south of courthouse site because of city s rapid rate of growth in 1850s new structures were built or planned around city hall including a brownstone built to west of rotunda in 1852 a bill was passed in 1858 that provided for construction of a new structure to north or rear of city hall structure would contain various new york county courts as well as grand and petit juries and county sheriff s office two commissioners were named for that task in november 1858 by early 1859 two commissioners had proposed a new budget of 1 million saying that existing budget of 250 000 was not enough however an amendment to budget was declined and construction of courthouse building was authorized by a resolution passed on may 3 1859 same year thomas little submitted first plans for what would become courthouse building first explicit reference to new building as a courthouse was in a resolution passed by new york city board of supervisors in march 1860 a law called an act to enable supervisors of county of new york to acquire and take land for building of a court house in said county was passed on april 10 of same year late in 1861 land was appraised as being worth 450 000 tweed construction thumb northeast corner of building from 1861 to 1871 william m tweed also known by his nickname boss was among most powerful politicians in manhattan son of a chair manufacturer he was elected to new york city board of aldermen in 1851 and became part of new york county board of supervisors in 1857 it was in this capacity that he was able to oversee construction of new york county courthouse and earn millions through embezzlement related to construction process tweed considered one of most corrupt politicians in united states history was able to steal at least 75 million from new york city public funds with help of a ring of political allies which as a whole embezzled up to 300 million chief portion of this theft came from extremely slow rate of construction on new courthouse historian alexander callow later called courthouse corruption a classic in annals of american graft construction started on courthouse on september 16 1861 though cornerstone was laid on december 26 tweed bought a marble quarry in sheffield massachusetts to provide much of marble for courthouse at great profit to himself tweed was able to engage in many other acts of corruption though not necessarily related to courthouse s construction separate from tweed s corruption was slowdown of work on courthouse due to american civil war in december 1865 new york times wrote that much of exterior was built but interior except for basement had yet to be constructed new york county court of appeals moved to building in march 1867 despite being largely incomplete cupola was not yet installed main iron staircase only reached to second floor and stucco had been placed only in a few rooms at that point new york times said that many holes both in floor and roof are visible in which to bury money of tax payers in first four years of construction supervisors were able to take 3 million from project by taking 65 of commission on each of contracts supervisor smith ely jr made first allegation of corruption in courthouse s construction in 1866 ely claimed that grossly extravagant and improper expenditures have been made in reference to purchase of iron marble and brick and in payment of various persons for services one particularly egregious example of these expenditures was a 350 000 bill for carpeting in new courthouse despite high price of contract some offices remained without carpets several years later in another case a contractor was paid 133 180 for two days work on window frames and to justify per pound cost of material he included excessively thick screws within frames to solve ely s complaint board of supervisors created special committee on new court house which found no wrongdoing in its own actions after tweed charter to reorganize city s government was passed in 1870 four commissioners for construction of new york county courthouse were appointed commission never held a meeting though each commissioner received a 20 kickback from bills for supplies few media outlets except for new york times and thomas nast cartoonist from harper s weekly pointed out tweed s corruption nevertheless once local media learned of bribes ring was disbanded in 1871 upon arrest of boss tweed this coupled with death of john kellum that august halted construction for five years completion thumb 1893 depiction of tweed courthouse eidlitz was commissioned to complete an expanded design in 1876 by this point much of courthouse was already occupied and in use by several courts and city governmental departments eidlitz was to finish north porch facing chambers street finish interior main hall skylight and rotunda and build a replacement south porch eidlitz was also commissioned to build a southern wing which in kellum s original plan was to measure though eidlitz s initial design for southern wing was supposed to be similar to that of main building real plans turned out to be much different he redesigned neoclassical interiors of kellum with rich polychrome effects in romanesque revival style as well as added ornamental and architectural detailing such as arches and foliate detail to integrate new wing s design with rest of courthouse expanded design provided thirty monumental courtrooms around central three story octagonal rotunda new york times criticized new wing s design calling it cheap and tawdry in comparison with elaborate finishing and classic exterior of present structure american architect and building news described how addition was grafted onto original building of course no attention was paid to design of existing building and within and without a rank romanesque runs cheek by jowl with old italian one bald other florid cream colored brick and buff sandstone come in juxtaposition to white marble according to one biography of eidlitz he could not understand reason behind controversy surrounding his design standing in rotunda of courthouse one day when his own vari colored brick arches and columns had been inserted between cast iron panels of older work he said is it possible for anybody to fail to see that this pointing to new work performs a function and that that pointing to old does not tweed courthouse was officially finished in 1881 more than 20 years after work began much of construction was financed through sale of stocks issued at various periods throughout construction process stock with a combined cost of 4 55 million was issued six times with first stock issue being in 1862 and last being in 1871 total cost of construction was estimated in 1914 at 11 million to 12 million of this 8 million was a direct cost on books and remainder was adjusted claims and county liabilities other estimates placed construction cost at 13 million court use modifications and decline in years following its completion tweed courthouse was associated with crimes of william tweed for instance reformer george c barrett said that you look up at its ceilings and find gaudy decorations you wonder which is greatest vulgarity or of place such was reputation of courthouse that in 1871 a poem entitled house that tweed built was published describing courthouse s corruption in an amusing satirical tone following year guidebook miller s new york as it is described courthouse in an unbiased perspective court rooms are large airy unobstructed by columns made with reference to principles of acoustics and finished in an agreeable and pleasing manner perception of tweed courthouse as a symbol of wasteful spending persisted until late 20th century it was not until 1950s when henry hope reed jr wrote about building that writers started to argue in favor of tweed courthouse for historical reasons there were several attempts to destroy courthouse one of first being an 1890s plan by mayor hugh j grant in 1938 mayor fiorello h la guardia studied feasibility of destroying tweed courthouse after a suggestion from new york city parks commissioner robert moses under la guardia s plan city court would move into new new york county courthouse but new york supreme court refused to cede any space within new courthouse yet another plan in 1955 called for demolition of courthouse as part of restoration of city hall park thumb condition of main facade in 1979 showing absence of main steps numerous modifications were made to tweed courthouse following its completion by 1908 montgomery schuyler had written that eidlitz s original rotunda colors had been shorn of much of it pristine force which was much promoted by tri colored brickwork following addition of gray paint shortly afterward in 1911 and 1913 elevators were added to building and steel and iron elevator machinery rooms were built atop roof roof itself was replaced with an iron roof in early 20th century around world war ii original skylight was removed grand steps leading to chambers street on north side were removed to accommodate a widening of that street sometime in mid 20th century forcing workers and visitors to enter through ground floor sources disagree on whether this removal happened in 1940 1942 or 1955 court building also changed uses several times in 1927 county court moved from tweed courthouse to new new york county courthouse a few blocks north on centre street guide to nyc landmarks as cited at afterward city court used space by 1961 city court had moved out of tweed courthouse space was then occupied by numerous county offices and new york family court in 1960s and then by municipal offices by 1980s however deterioration of tweed courthouse made it an unfavorable workplace for many municipal employees and by 1981 only fifty people worked in building by 1974 mayor abraham beame had created a special task force focused on improving manhattan s civic center at time tweed courthouse was already slated for demolition as part of a restoration of nearby manhattan municipal building task force s draft report published in june 1974 recommended destroying courthouse which aligned with beame s past comments that courthouse should be replaced with a more functional structure report stated that projected 12 million cost of a brand new structure was 5 million more than a basic renovation of tweed courthouse and 1 2 million more than a full renovation plan drew opposition from architectural preservationists tweed courthouse was listed on national register of historic places in october 1974 which made it eligible for federal funds but did not yet protect structure from demolition proposed destruction of courthouse was later canceled because of 1975 new york city fiscal crisis which depleted city s funds so much that it could not afford to demolish courthouse much less construct a new structure preservation thumb second floor court chambers before restoration in 1978 administration of mayor ed koch commissioned another report which found that courthouse would need to be renovated at a cost of between 3 million for minimal repairs and 9 million for a complete restoration under koch administration each room of courthouse was restored individually and then retrofitted with modern furnishings new york landmarks conservancy repaired roof in late 1970s at which point an asphalt roof replaced tweed courthouse s iron roof and skylight s wood supports were replaced with cast iron supports conservancy also repainted interior though dilapidated exterior remained untouched sporting a yellow paint job with black and orange stains on marble by 1986 after some repairs had been completed there were 250 300 people working in courthouse a long term 6 3 million renovation began in 1990 with expected completion in 1994 at time city was planning a 21 million project to completely restore remainder of tweed courthouse during project new york city department of general services architects found severe deterioration in chambers street portico and at five places in cornice necessitating temporary closure of chambers street entrance elevator cabs which were unenclosed and posed a fire hazard were retrofitted with plate glass walls and automated operation systems afterward city began planning for full renovation of tweed courthouse initial cost projection was 39 million but following discovery of additional damage construction cost rose to 59 million then to 89 million in may 1999 john g waite associates began a complete restoration of building firm carefully removed as much as 18 layers of paint to reveal original brick walls and cast iron in order to recreate original paint colors skylights and structure of roof over rotunda were replaced marble and glass tiled floors were restored and additional detail was carved into capitals of exterior columns at portico where sheared away entrance steps were replaced original ventilation shafts embedded within tweed courthouse s walls were refitted with heating ventilation and air conditioning hvac systems to maintain appearance of interior spaces in addition front steps to chambers street were restored restoration was completed in december 2001 following september 11 attacks which occurred near courthouse toward completion of restoration portion of city hall park around building was closed due to security concerns that section of park reopened in 2007 new york daily news investigating causes behind high cost of renovation found that much of cost was due to opulence of original design for instance facade cost 13 million to restore and reproduction of skylights masonry and doors cost another 3 2 million officials sought to restore initial design as much as possible by requesting materials from original manufacturers which further increased costs new york times reported that marble for restoration came from tweed s quarry in massachusetts old stone already on building was reused for other elements of facade element e a sculpture by roy lichtenstein was installed in rotunda in 2003 as part of an exhibition in city hall park sculpture remained in building after exhibition had finished nycdoe use thumb kellum s front facade following restoration building s restoration and redecoration was performed in preparation for its proposed new role as new home of museum of city of new york a move for which administration of mayor rudy giuliani was criticized his successor michael bloomberg canceled these plans instead choosing to move new york city department of education nycdoe into building as a way to highlight his administration s focus on education at time building was unused and was accumulating 20 000 per month in utility bills most of building would contain nycdoe s offices in an open floor plan but ground floor would contain classrooms occupied by various schools under bloomberg s plan a cafeteria in building s basement would serve both nycdoe employees and students among nycdoe employees reception of plan was mixed some employees interviewed by new york times in march 2002 preferred to stay in their existing headquarters in brooklyn while others stated that they would rather move to newly renovated courthouse in june 2002 bloomberg stated that he wanted school officials to move into building by that fall coinciding with beginning of next academic year city government spent 6 5 million on renovating upper floors for nycdoe s use by late 2002 nycdoe offices had been set up but there were still discussions about whether to convert ground floor for school use building still serves as nycdoe s headquarters ground floor served as an incubator for new schools first of these was city hall academy in 2003 which gave two week residencies to third and seventh grade students city hall academy moved out of space in 2006 it was then used by ross global academy rga a charter school though rga had moved out of space by 2009 spruce street school next used tweed courthouse s ground floor as a temporary location until it moved to nearby 8 spruce street at end of 2010 2011 school year another school sponsored innovate manhattan charter school occupied space for 2011 2012 school year after innovate moved out an elementary school called ps 343 peck slip school moved into space peck slip school used ground floor for three years until it moved to a new location
