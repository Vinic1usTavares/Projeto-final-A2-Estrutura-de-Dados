hurricane kate was final in a series of tropical cyclones to impact united states during 1985 and latest in any calendar year to strike country at hurricane intensity on record eleventh named storm seventh hurricane and third major hurricane of annual hurricane season kate originated from interaction of an upper level trough and tropical wave northeast of puerto rico on november 15 though system tracked erratically during first hours of its existence intensification of a region of high pressure to cyclone s north caused kate to turn westward a favorable atmospheric pattern allowed newly developed system to intensify to hurricane intensity on november 16 and further to category 2 intensity three days later kate made its first landfall on northern coast of cuba at this intensity prior to emerging as a slightly weaker storm during evening hours of november 19 once clear of land it began to strengthen quickly becoming a category 3 and reaching its peak intensity of 120 mph 195 km h following day on november 21 a cold front moving across mississippi valley resulted in a north and eventual northeast turn of cyclone and on november 22 kate came ashore near mexico beach florida as a minimal category 2 hurricane with winds of 100 mph 160 km h gradual weakening ensued as cyclone moved along southeast united states coastline and kate transitioned to an extratropical cyclone on november 23 a day after exiting coastline of north carolina threat of hurricane kate in cuba prompted evacuation of 360 000 people heavy rainfall in cuba caused numerous mudslides and flooding killing 10 people and leading to severe agriculture damage wind gusts over hurricane intensity resulted in widespread power outages significant building damage and major crop damage damage totaled roughly 400 million making it most damaging hurricane to strike island in many decades in preparation for system s arrival many hurricane watches and warnings were put into effect hundreds of thousands of residents were evacuated and florida governor bob graham declared a state of emergency for six counties this was later cancelled following relatively minor impacts of kate in addition many shelters were opened when kate struck florida panhandle it became first hurricane to make landfall in that location since hurricane eloise in 1975 storm surge and flooding rains destroyed much of oyster industry causing many people to lose their jobs in weeks after storm gusts over 100 mph 160 km h contributed to downed trees and building damage while combination of wind and rain led to downed power poles across remainder of southeast united states several inches of rainfall led to flash flooding damage to roadways and major tree damage overall kate resulted in 15 fatalities and 700 million in damage meteorological history before formation of hurricane kate a ridge was located across southeastern united states for much of autumn of 1985 concurrently a major trough persisted across western portion of country as a result weather conditions across gulf of mexico and western atlantic ocean in november were more typical of pattern in late september including sea surface temperatures of 81 degf 27 degc on november 13 a weak tropical wave began interacting with a trough to northeast of lesser antilles it gradually organized due to favorable conditions and on november 15 a hurricane hunters flight into area indicated development of a tropical cyclone as gale force winds were already present system was immediately declared tropical storm kate about 240 miles 385 km northeast of san juan puerto rico with a ridge to its north kate tracked westward after developing and an upper level low developed to southwest of storm combination of two provided favorable outflow allowing kate to quickly intensify on november 16 storm attained hurricane status while moving through southeastern bahamas after continued strengthening kate made landfall at 0600 utc on november 19 over north central cuba with a well defined eye when it moved ashore kate had a pressure of and winds of about hurricane maintained its well defined eye while moving across northern cuba and about 12 hours after making landfall it emerged into southeastern gulf of mexico just east of havana over next 24 hours kate re intensified off southwest coast of florida as it passed about 85 mi 135 km southwest of key west on november 20 hurricane hunters observed winds as strong as 125 mph 200 km h and a buoy recorded a gust of this was highest recorded wind gust from a buoy in gulf of mexico until hurricane lili in 2002 based on these observations it was estimated that kate attained peak winds of about around 1200 utc on november 20 hurricane kate maintained peak intensity for about 18 hours on november 21 a cold front moving through mississippi valley deflected hurricane to north and northeast combination of cooler waters and wind shear from front weakened kate to an intensity of 100 mph 160 km h by time hurricane struck crooked island near mexico beach florida late on november 21 after landfall kate continued to northeast crossing into georgia and weakened into a tropical storm kate emerged from north carolina into atlantic ocean late on november 22 encountering even colder waters and continued shear storm weakened further while turning to east southeast on november 23 kate transitioned into an extratropical cyclone to west of bermuda terminating at 1800 utc that day until 2011 kate s was considered second latest hurricane landfall in united states behind only a cyclone in 1925 that struck on december 1 however a systematic reanalysis indicated that 1925 system was only a tropical storm in turn kate took record with kate s landfall 1985 season had six hurricanes that struck united states only one short of record seven in 1886 preparations by november 18 a hurricane warning was in effect for southeast and central bahamas and turks and caicos islands flood warnings were issued for northern puerto rico and dominican republic in preparation for hurricane s arrival officials forced 360 000 people to evacuate in north central cuba while kate was moving through bahamas national hurricane center nhc issued a hurricane warning from jupiter to fort myers florida including florida keys then governor of florida bob graham declared a state of emergency for six counties in south florida however it was reversed following relatively minor effects in area officials recommended evacuation of florida keys leading to heavy traffic on overseas highway and prompting red cross to open 12 shelters three shelters were opened in key west but only 500 individuals utilized them during storm most residents chose to endure storm in their homes in fort lauderdale schools were closed and residents of mobile homes were required to leave shortly after storm reached its peak intensity on november 20 nhc issued a hurricane watch from grand isle louisiana to cedar key florida

evacuees portions of florida gulf coast had been threatened by hurricane elena earlier in season and some evacuees of that storm intended not to leave during kate due to poor shelter conditions that they had experienced governor graham activated 300 members of florida national guard to prevent looting and to assist in evacuations one person died from a stress induced heart attack in chipley after evacuating outside of florida about 2 200 people fled grand isle louisiana after kate moved ashore nhc issued gale warnings along east coast of united states from st augustine florida to chincoteague
