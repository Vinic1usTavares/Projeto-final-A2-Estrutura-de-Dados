king s highway 416 commonly referred to as highway 416 and as veterans memorial highway is a 400 series highway in canadian province of ontario that connects trans canada highway highway 417 in ottawa with highway 401 between brockville and cornwall freeway acts as an important trade corridor from interstate 81 between new york and eastern ontario via highway 401 as well as fastest link between ottawa and toronto highway 416 passes through a largely rural area except near its northern terminus where it enters suburbs of ottawa freeway also serves several communities along its length notably spencerville and kemptville highway 416 had two distinct construction phases highway 416 north was segment starting from an interchange at highway 417 and bypassing original route of highway 16 into ottawa now prince of wales drive along a new right of way highway 416 south was twinning of of highway 16 new a two lane expressway constructed throughout 1970s and finished in 1983 that bypassed original highway and construction of a new interchange with highway 401 sections of both opened throughout late 1990s highway 416 was commemorated as veterans memorial highway on 54th anniversary of d day in 1998 final link was officially opened by a world war i veteran and local officials on september 23 1999 route description thumb left highway 416 entering western end of ottawa fallowfield road interchange is shown highway 416 begins at an interchange with highway 401 branching to north near community of johnstown in united counties of leeds and grenville this interchange only provides access to and from west of highway 401 but immediately north of it a second interchange with remaining section of highway 16 provides access from johnstown and to a parclo interchange with both directions of highway 401 as well as to ogdensburg prescott international bridge crossing to ogdensburg new york proceeding north two carriageways of freeway are separated by a forested median route is surrounded by thick forests for next as it passes beneath leeds and grenville county road 44 original routing of highway 16 prescott highway south of spencerville it exits forest and enters farm fields route travels to east of community access to which is provided by an interchange at county road 21 and crosses a swamp and south nation river highway 416 crosses under prescott highway a second time to north two remain roughly parallel but separated as they pass through a mix of farmland and forest south of community of kemptville prescott highway crosses route a third time with an interchange connecting two highways freeway curves to northeast bypassing kemptville and featuring an interchange with county road 43 formerly highway 43 it crosses line of old and prescott railway then curves to northwest providing an interchange with river road at southeast corner of river road interchange is veterans commemorative park dedicated in 2000 by royal canadian legion tiny veterans commemorative park 45 75 at highway s approximate midpoint may be reached on foot directly from a commuter parking lot on southeast corner of river road s highway 416 interchange it crosses rideau river and enters city of ottawa aside from first couple of kilometres north of rideau river majority of freeway cuts through swaths of farmland which fill ottawa valley median also becomes narrower freeway encounters an interchange with dilworth road and thereafter with roger stevens drive latter providing access to north gower continuing north of manotick through fields highway 416 is crossed by prescott highway for fourth and final time as that road turns northeast and travels into downtown ottawa as prince of wales drive shortly thereafter is an interchange with brophy drive bankfield road latter provides access to prescott highway prince of wales drive approaching urban ottawa route passes alongside a large quarry then jogs to west along an s curve crossing jock river in process after this an interchange with fallowfield road provides access to suburb of barrhaven which occupies portions of land immediately east of freeway route jogs back to east along a second s curve and passes through an aesthetically designed bridge while traveling alongside stony swamp final section of highway 416 travels parallel to cedarview road which was relocated for freeway stony swamp lies west of route while farmland lies to east at northern end of swamp is an interchange with west hunt club road freeway continues through a section of greenspace before descending gently into a trench it passes beneath bruin road and ottawa central railway while traveling alongside lynwood village in bells corners highway is crossed by baseline road and richmond road former provides an onramp to southbound highway 416 freeway ends at a large interchange with trans canada highway highway 417 exit 131 just south of lakeview and bayshore communities on ottawa river downtown ottawa is to east and kanata is to west design features stony swamp overpass at southern entrance to ottawa is a pre tensioned concrete arch design which allows structure to cross entire right of way with a single span won 1996 award of excellence from portland cement association bridge acts as a gateway to national capital region and is longest rigid frame bridge in ontario with a span in same vicinity freeway sinks below ground level in a trench groundwater retaining walls were installed to prevent lowering of water table in adjacent wetlands therefore mitigating damage to them at jock river southwest of barrhaven deposits of sensitive leda clay presented a challenge in designing crossing for freeway as well as canadian national railway overpass to north it was feared that weight of these structures could destabilize clay deposits beneath and lead to landslides in place of standard heavier aggregate lighter blast furnace slag at half weight was substituted sloped rock cuts line side of freeway in numerous locations with intent of reducing severity of collisions against those cuts ministry of transportation of ontario mto tested out numerous alternatives to strike a cost to benefit balance standard slope used by mto is vertical offset from edge of pavement by study concluded that although an initially higher investment would be required 2 1 sloped cut with grass overlaid produced best results history thumb right highway 416 is commemorated as veterans memorial highway signs placed along length of highway in english and french in background indicate this along with phrase lest we forget highway 16 new in 1966 department of highways dho predecessor to today s mto published eastern ontario highway planning study identifying need for a controlled access highway between ottawa and highway 401 highway 16 which passes over geologically subdued st lawrence lowlands was selected over highway 15 which crosses undulating canadian shield to west as ideal route for new link highway 16 was one of first roads taken over by expanding department of public highways in 1918 important corridor between trans provincial highway highway 2 and ottawa was known as prescott highway in 1925 road was given a numerical designation to supplement name this highway served low traffic volumes of day but as number of vehicles increased over first half of 20th century issues arose with numerous private driveways along route to overcome this issue of abutting properties long established on old highway 16 corridor dho began purchasing a new right of way between highway 401 and century road by late 1967 for a two lane bypass of original alignment avoiding all built up areas that original highway 16 encountered this route was designed to easily accommodate eventual upgrade to a freeway when traffic volumes necessitated construction of super two dubbed highway 16 new took place between 1969 and 1983 spencerville bypass opened by 1971 connecting with old highway in south near crowder road and in north near ventnor road by end of 1973 new highway was completed from immediately north of highway 401 through leeds and grenville united counties and into ottawa carleton this included a bypass around kemptville and a new structure over rideau river new highway ended at dilworth road regional road 13 for nearly a decade no new construction took place then during summer of 1982 mto awarded a contract to construct route north from dilworth road towards manotick bypassing north gower and extending route as far north as roger stevens drive regional road 6 including a structure over stevens creek following completion of this first contract a second contract was awarded for remaining distance north to century road regional road 8 project was completed in 1983 merging into original route of highway 16 northeast of present prince of wales drive overpass thumb left highway 416 approaching its terminus at highway 417 in ottawa with completion of highway 16 new mto needed only to construct interchanges and southbound lanes in order to create a full freeway corridor upgrade to highway 416 took place between 1989 and 1999 and was carried out through two separate projects highway 416 north was a freeway on a new alignment through ottawa and an interchange at highway 417 and highway 416 south was twinning of of highway 16 new and an interchange at highway 401 change of plans original plans for highway 416 conceived during late 1960s had it enter ottawa along merivale corridor to merge with queensway approximately east of present interchange however when it came time to construct this section public attitudes had shifted and environmental concerns had come to forefront of everyday life new roads were now subject to intense public scrutiny suburbs grew along merivale road prompting region of ottawa carleton to request mto decommission right of way along road in 1977 which it did passing of environmental assessment act in 1975 however meant that new projects were subject to a lengthy investigation of social and environmental concerns in 1981 mto began an environmental assessment into a new alignment for northern connection with queensway it was approved in mid 1987 with cedarview drive chosen as ideal alignment for new freeway mto set out to design a four lane route to connect queensway with highway 16 new including a three level free flow interchange a contract for construction of this interchange was awarded in late 1989 and construction began in 1990 during 1991 construction season contracts were awarded to construct several overpasses along new route this contract was completed in 1993 after which budgetary restraints prevented awarding of further contracts as a result aside from interchange at highway 417 and some overpasses construction activity on highway 416 came to a standstill for two years it was during this period that mto undertook an engineering review of entire route in search of cost inefficiencies highways 416 and 407 were constructed during a recession in mid 1990s highway 407 became a tolled highway and for a time it was mentioned in legislative debates that highway 416 would also be tolled but ultimately this never happened instead a hiatus in construction allowed engineers to evaluate inefficiencies in bridge and cross section designs as well as sensitive clay soils near ottawa this initiative led to a cost savings of over c 7 million and several of unique design features located along length of freeway twinning and completion work resumed on highway 416 north following review it was opened from century road to hunt club road on july 16 1996 and completed on july 31 1997 with opening of interchange with highway 417 cost of this section was c 196 million on december 8 1995 in north gower provincial and federal governments announced a financing deal to ensure highway 416 south was completed by 2000 this section of route was constructed through a process known as twinning in which a second carriageway is built parallel to an existing road in addition existing intersections were rebuilt as grade separated interchanges with right of way along highway 16 new already purchased construction was able to proceed without disruption to local properties or traffic project was constructed through five contracts first was awarded to tarmac canada on june 10 1996 calling for twinning of from century road south to roger stevens drive another contract was awarded one month later to bot construction on august 19 this contract involved section from roger stevens drive south to what was then highway 43 a distance of on june 12 1997 first section opened connecting with ottawa bypass at century road on july 10 third contract was awarded to armbro construction to construct section from highway 43 south to grenville county road 20 oxford station road another contract followed on october 21 for south to grenville county road 20 shanly road which was awarded to bot construction fifth and final contract was awarded to armbro construction on april 8 1998 calling for construction of southern and two flyover ramps at highway 401 section between roger stevens drive and what had now become leeds and grenville county road 43 including a second crossing of rideau river opened to traffic on june 26 1998 this was followed two months later by section between highway 43 and oxford station road which opened on august 24 on fifty fourth anniversary of d day june 6 1998 then transportation minister tony clement unveiled two signs in ottawa and formally declared entire length of highway 416 as veterans memorial highway despite earlier reluctance from previous minister al six additional signs were also installed along length of route at time veterans memorial parkway in london already existed since then two additional veterans highways have been named on october 20 2002 veterans highway was designated in halton region along regional road 25 on september 23 2010 niagara veterans memorial highway was designated in niagara falls along regional road 420 a ceremony was held in johnstown on september 23 1999 to open final section of highway 416 that would complete link from highway 401 to highway 417 premier mike harris transportation minister david turnbull and world war i veteran james w fraser officially opened highway on december 14 2009 there was a 60 70
