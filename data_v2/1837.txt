thumb logo of odb from mentor graphics odb is a proprietary cad to cam data exchange format used in design and manufacture of electronic devices its purpose is to exchange printed circuit board design information between design and manufacturing and between design tools from different eda vendors it was originally developed by valor computerized systems ltd acquired in 2010 by mentor graphics as job description format for their cam system odb stands for open database but its openness is disputed ipc 2581 panel a spirited discussion on pcb data transfer formats richard goering cadence design systems blog october 2 2011 on panel session data transfer in 21st century pcb west conference santa clara california september 29 2011 as discussed below suffix evocative of c was added in 1997 with addition of component descriptions there are two versions of odb original now controlled by mentor and an xml version called odb x that valor developed and donated to ipc organization in an attempt to merge gencam ipc 2511 and odb into offspring ipc 2581 introduction inside almost every electronic device is a pcb onto which semiconductor and other components are mechanically and electrically connected by soldering these pcbs are designed using a computer aided design cad system to physically realize design computerized design information must be transferred to a photolithographic computer aided manufacturing cam system since cad and cam systems are generally produced by different companies they have to agree on a cad to cam data exchange format to transfer data odb is one such file format for performing this transfer other formats are compared and contrasted below after bare board is manufactured electronic components are placed and soldered for example by smt placement equipment and wave or soldering file structure when in use odb data is stored in a hierarchy of files and file folders however for transmission it is convenient to use common operating system commands that create a single compressed file that preserves hierarchy information for example on unix and commands can be used in odb x database is contained in a single xml file by default odb covers specification of not only conductor layer artwork and drill data but also material stack up netlist with test points component bill of materials component placement fabrication data and dimension data history valor was founded in 1992 and it released odb in 1995 it added suffix when component names were added in 1997 xml version was developed beginning 2000 and ended in 2008 with donation to ipc valor was acquired by mentor in 2010 adoption in late 1990s it became clear to industry participants that a second generation data transfer format would be more efficient than prevalent first generation gerber format however it was very difficult to reach a consensus over which of two candidates should be selected odb proven but proprietary ipc 2511 gencam not widely used but open in 2002 a compromise format odb x was recommended by national electronics manufacturing initiative nemi an industry body subsequently renamed international electronics manufacturing initiative after a two year mediation effort between gencam and odb camps companies that supported recommendation at time included cadence hewlett packard lucent mentor which acquired valor some eight years later nokia and xerox but in fact adoption to date has been minimal as a result and as detailed below industry is still divided late 2014 gerber x2 was introduced which added attributes intelligence to gerber format in a compatible way converting gerber to a second generation format advocacy lists of eda tools that support import and or export of odb have been compiled by artwork conversion software mentor itself and on comparison of eda packages table some companies that have adopted odb format are advocates for its use streamline circuits reports that odb provides much greater efficiency than competing gerber format stating that an 8 layer printed circuit board can take up to 5 hours to plan and tool using gerber and only 1 hour when using odb according to streamline manufacturers are adopting it to overcome limitations of simpler gerber format downstream technologies calls odb defacto standard for intelligent data exchange in eda in 2002 dana korf of sci called odb prevalent non gerber format kent of states of odb really we don t need anything else opposition lack of need ucamco developers of gerber format argue that prevalent gerber based flow with some additions can be as complete and efficient as odb these additions were introduced in gerber x2 which added attributes to classical extended gerber standard attributes allow to define layer structure pad functions and cad netlist concerns odb is a proprietary format controlled by valor and now mentor and so like all proprietary standards it comes with risk of vendor lock in cad companies had some concerns about this when odb was controlled by valor a cam company but these concerns were magnified when a rival cad company mentor acquired valor although mentor claims that it openly supports inclusion of odb and updates for other eda tool vendors it used to restrict access to specification and required a non disclosure agreement application form used to include a requirement to demonstrate a customer need for this integration through references from mutual customers provide a recommendation from a mentor graphics product division or demonstrate incremental value of this integration to both mentor graphics and partner company some direct competitors inferred this meant restricted access this was a source of frustration not only for competitors but also for mentor user community in 2012 julian coates director of business development at mentor s valor division claimed that so far all odb partners including competitors to mentor who have applied for assistance to build and maintain odb interfaces via odb solutions alliance have been accepted without reservation or cost in addition format specification is now openly available via odb solutions alliance without need for nda membership of odb solutions alliance is free of charge and open to anybody who registers a no charge odb viewer and other software utilities are available to registrants http www odb sa com resources potential resolution critics of proprietary nature of odb point to several more open formats as models for a future consensus format gerber format although nominally proprietary to ucamco its specification has always been open and freely downloadable making it de facto an open standard introduction of attributes with gerber x2 in late 2014 added intelligence to format layer structure pad functions and cad netlist ipc 2511 gencam which resulted from a donation of certain technologies by to ipc ipc 2581 offspring an attempt to merge gencam with odb x specification can be downloaded freely in 2011 an industry consortium was created to support it motivated in part by frustration with proprietary nature of odb cadence design systems zuken artwork conversion software and owners of gerber format ucamco joined it users updating adopting ipc data transfer spec printed circuit design and fab magazine mike buetow 24 june 2011 but initially not mentor however in 2012 mentor did join this combined with 2012 announcement by zuken that it would join odb solutions alliance creates possibility that pcb designers will have a choice of format no matter which eda tool they choose which resulted from a transfer of certain technologies by cadence to organization although it was originally designed for integrated circuits it is now finding application for ic package and pcb design also fujiko based on
