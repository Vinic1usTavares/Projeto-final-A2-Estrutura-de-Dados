ideology southern is known for its religious and social conservatism and it is widely regarded as most conservative of owned adventist colleges in north america in 2001 adventist noted theologian and scholar raymond cottrell a progressive adventist throughout his life ray was a remarkable thought leader in our denomination it is usual to be productive in one s prime years but consider ray s accomplishments both early and late in his long career in his 30s teaching bible at puc he became one of first adventist theologians to join a scholarly religious society and simultaneously he cofounded first adventist biblical research fellowship an association that evolved into current biblical research institute at general conference after formal retirement in his 70s ray advocated need for a judicial branch of church governance in his 80s he argued for relative autonomy for general conference divisions in our increasingly diverse world church and then just last year 2002 he courageously called for progress beyond our dated sanctuary doctrine was ray right in all these progressive positions i suggest that question misses larger issue point is that ray epitomized spirit of

he placed his collection of artifacts and his personal library at southern adventist university archaeologist william dever said major support for archaeology work in israel and jordan comes from
