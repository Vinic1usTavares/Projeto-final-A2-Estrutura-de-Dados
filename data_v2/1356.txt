other agents though inspector can be bribed and directed to regions of a player s choice in single player mode player competes against an ai opponent available at various difficulty levels multiplayer gameplay includes support for ds download play allowing an entire group of players to play from only one game card development thumb despite aiming to take advantage of unique aspects of video game medium rohrer still prototyped game on paper jason rohrer was inspired by german style board games to build a turn based strategy game he wanted to harness unique qualities that a video game could bring to a board game and so focused on their ability to deliver different views of board to each player he wanted to create a game which explored knowledge chains where player must not only be aware of his knowledge and movements on board but also how much of that has been exposed to opponent in march 2009 he was invited by publisher majesco entertainment to pitch an idea for a nintendo ds game and keeping these mechanics in mind he pitched a game called deception in deception two players would play one half of a married couple with aim to gather damaging evidence regarding their spouse s infidelities as ammunition for a forthcoming divorce case majesco rejected this concept as being too sensitive a subject for ds market rohrer later transferred themes of deception onto a framework around corporate espionage and blood diamond trade though not particularly concerned about blood diamonds and wary of game being perceived as a finger wagging exercise he felt that setting would give an extra oomph to game s seedy mechanics instead of being an overt protest against blood diamond trade game would explore psychology of industry through its game mechanics causing players to reflect after a game on their decisions made within it majesco greenlit this and in july 2009 a publishing contract was signed rohrer began work on diamond trust of london as a pen and paper prototype to iron out design before committing to code by december game was in a fully playable state lacking only soundtrack and tutorial majesco however decided to back away from a physical cartridge release and pushed instead for a dsiware download version rohrer disagreed believing that smaller dsiware market would limit game s audience majesco on other hand was not willing to invest in manufacturing of cartridges without strong pre order numbers company made game available to gamestop to gauge pre order interest stating that 3 000 pre orders would be necessary for a cartridge release diamond trust generated only 23 pre orders and in 2010 majesco agreement was terminated thumb left upright 1 2 this photograph of tom bailey and jason rohrer featured prominently on rear cover an unusual move for video game packaging being more akin to album art thumb left upright 1 2 bailey composed initial musical sketches to act as a guide for loops he had to create for game s music generation engine lacking a publisher for diamond trust of london rohrer moved onto other projects such as inside a star filled sky and sleep is death he also took on work at gun a video games consultancy firm and there he made contact with mark seremet ceo of zoo publishing zoo was interested in pursuing diamond trust of london as a limited physical release on their indiepub label and so work on game resumed to provide game s soundtrack rohrer approached his friend and former bandmate tom bailey this was first time that rohrer had collaborated with others on his games he cited this collaboration as helping to restore his creative momentum for project to avoid hearing exactly same music every time game is played rohrer developed a music generation engine which would arrange bailey composed loops procedurally depending on game s state if lid of nintendo ds is closed with headphones plugged in while game is still running it will act as a random music generator rohrer s previous project inside a star filled sky had used entirely computer generated music but he felt that thematic demands of diamond trust of london required bailey s handcrafted compositions and musicianship by july 2011 rohrer had submitted a beta version of game for nintendo approval this was followed up with master version in october an issue raised during approval process was rohrer s desire to credit bailey on game s cover which nintendo rejected he got around this by officially naming game jason rohrer with music by tom bailey diamond trust of london in may 2012 game was ready for manufacturing however due to changing market conditions zoo publishing was no longer able to afford manufacturing of cartridges given large minimum order of 6 000 units that nintendo required and so rohrer turned to crowdfunding platform kickstarter thumb diamond trust of london packaged and ready to ship to its kickstarter backers rohrer launched kickstarter campaign on may 9 2012 looking to raise 78 715 campaign closed on may 26 2012 after raising 90 118 from 1 305 backers this allowed manufacturing to proceed and diamond trust of london became first successfully crowdfunded nintendo ds game by mid july 6 000 cartridges had been manufactured by nintendo in japan and in august they arrived at rohrer s home in california as he was packaging cartridges personally it allowed him to release a special signed and numbered limited edition of 1000 copies bundled with mystery bonuses game was released on august 28 2012 and as customers received their copies they revealed contents of limited edition jason cipriano at mtv multiplayer received alongside his limited edition postage stamps and a coin from countries featured in game and four actual diamonds reception diamond trust of london received few reviews and they were generally mixed critics enjoyed gameplay but found that game required a human opponent for it to shine with single player element acting merely as a practice mode nintendo gamer found game mind bending likening its cycle of bluffs and double bluffs to ouroboros gamestm enjoyed experience of trying to outwit and deceive a friend but found achieving victory over reliant on control of un inspector paste praised support for ds download play functionality as generous and described games of diamond trust of london as fabulous palate cleansers in between board game sessions they also observed that during these games much of a player s personality would be expressed through moves they made commenting on a preview build nintendo world report highlighted game s music describing it as a wonderfully eclectic mix and a constantly evolving ambient soundscape mtv multiplayer while finding music a little out of place still found it really good and believed that players would find themselves zoning out enjoying music without even realizing it as they waited for their next turn gamestm felt that game did not have sufficient content to justify a full price retail release being more suited instead to a budget priced app publication described diamond trust of london as a fantastic ios strategy game on ds similarly nintendo gamer called it a worthwhile if insubstantial game user interface was described as confusing by nintendo gamer and while edge felt that interface was simple to point of crudity it could also be opaque and cluttered making a reasonably complex game seem even more so edge concluded that if player can get through these issues there is an acute psychological game to be played named diamond trust of london as one of their top games of 2012 describing it as rohrer s most elegantly designed game to date they highlighted how it critiques blood diamond trade by using game mechanics that present world from cynical detached perspective of homo economicus rather than by lecturing player paste echoed these thoughts stating that game offered no overt judgments on diamond trade but had mechanics that paint it as one that encourages and maybe even requires misdeeds reflecting on game s unlikely journey in becoming a physical product paste declared diamond trust of london to be not just a success in design but also one of creation see
