quest completed development ultimate play game represented by its co founding brothers tim and chris stamper was uncommonly taciturn in matters of press and marketing though they provided some details on knight lore development to crash magazine while knight lore was released as third game in sabreman series stamper brothers had finished it first they withheld game for about a year for market reasons they thought that knight lore advancements copyrighted as filmation engine would hurt sales of their then upcoming sabre wulf and used extra time to prepare another filmation game alien 8 to preempt sales that would be lost when other publishers would try to copy technique we just had to sit on it because everyone else was so far behind tim stamper recalled sabre wulf was released to commercial and critical success in 1984 alien 8 and next two sabreman titles underwurlde and knight lore followed in close succession before end of year thumb in image masking developer adds a hole

character image first progression juxtaposes cityscape against silhouetted cut outs of characters with word and in between two it results in a composite image of silhouetted cut outs atop image of cityscape second progression juxtaposes previous image silhouettes atop city against an image with un silhouetted characters in color with word or in between two it results in a composite image where full color characters fill in silhouetted cut out holes filmation and knight lore graphical novelty lay in how images could render without overlapping filmation introduced masked sprites whereas earlier games used planar sprites which overlapped without regard for depth order chris stamper s solution was to use image masking a mask is a version of an image that defines a background from subject matter in different colours when combining mask and on screen composite image mask s background data was ignored and a hole in shape of desired image sprite was added to background this was filled in with sprite s details thus rooms in knight lore were drawn one sprite at a time through this masking method in more recent times contemporary images render with layer priority set at individual pixel level knight lore is depicted in monochrome that changes between rooms so as to avoid attribute clash a computing limitation wherein an object s colour interfered with those of others
