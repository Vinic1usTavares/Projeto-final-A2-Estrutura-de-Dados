st catherine s castle is a henrician castle in cornwall built by thomas treffry between approximately 1538 and 1540 in response to fears of an invasion of england by france and holy roman empire d shaped stone fortification equipped with five gun ports for cannon overlooked mouth of river fowey in cornwall it was protected by a curtain wall and surrounding cliffs castle remained in use for many years until it was closed at end of napoleonic wars in 1815 brought back into service in 1855 during crimean war it was fitted with two new artillery positions but it soon became obsolete and was abandoned during second world war castle was refortified and used to house a battery of naval guns protecting coast against threat of german attack at end of conflict castle was restored to its previous condition and is now managed by english heritage as a tourist attraction history construction st catherine s castle was built as a consequence of international tensions between england france and holy roman empire in final years of reign of king henry viii traditionally crown had left coastal defences to local lords and communities only taking a modest role in building and maintaining fortifications and while france and empire remained in conflict with one another maritime raids were common but an actual invasion of england seemed unlikely modest defences based around simple blockhouses and towers existed in south west and along sussex coast with a few more impressive works in north of england but in general fortifications were very limited in scale thumb left castle seen from east in 1786 in 1533 henry broke with pope paul iii in order to annul his long standing marriage to catherine of aragon and remarry catherine was aunt of charles v holy roman emperor and he took annulment as a personal insult this resulted in france and empire declaring an alliance against henry in 1538 and pope encouraging two countries to attack england an invasion of england now appeared certain and henry began to improve his coastal defences in response to this situation a small d shaped stone fortification was built to protect fowey harbour in cornwall then an important centre for trade harbour was reached through fowey estuary which local town had protected in previous century with two blockhouses positioned along river s edge fowey and polruan blockhouses and a boom chain strung between them new castle replaced these and was located high on headland overlooking entrance to estuary itself st catherine s point from which it took its name construction work began on castle at some point between 1538 and 1540 under direction of a member of local cornish gentry thomas treffry by 1540 a map of local defences described castle as only half made when antiquarian john leland visited what he described as a blockhouse in 1542 he was hosted by treffry and afterwards recorded that construction had been funded partly by treffry and partly by local town later use thumb castle overlooking estuary and sea polruan blockhouse can be seen on far left st catherine s castle remained in use for many years during english civil war of 1640s it was held by royalist supporters of king charles i against parliament in 1684 local burgesses reported that fortification was in a state antiquarian francis grose visited castle in 1786 and noted that fortification was still being maintained at expense of local town he praised its picturesque and romantic position but concluded that building itself was of little importance either to antiquity or architecture at this time castle was equipped with six cannons and it continued to be used as a battery until end of napoleonic wars in 1815 after crimean war broke out in 1853 fresh concerns of invasion were raised and coastline was refortified castle was redeveloped as part of this work in 1855 and two new gun positions built around old blockhouse in 1887 castle was equipped with rifled muzzle loading artillery pieces supported by volunteer forces and used for training purposes but weaponry became obsolete and site had fallen out of use again by end of century castle was brought back into use in second world war by british southern command to defend coast against german attack in june 1940 it was re equipped as a gun battery and observation post with additional concrete defences laid around position two naval guns were installed in one of 19th century firing positions and in a new gun position built to west of castle these were supplemented by a french gun and old blockhouse itself was used to control a minefield in estuary below guns were manned first by 364 coast battery of royal artillery and then by 379 battery of 557 coast regiment but battery was retired from active operations in november 1943 after 1945
