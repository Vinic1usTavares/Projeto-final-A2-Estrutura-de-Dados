hms eagle was an early aircraft carrier of royal navy ordered by chile during south american dreadnought race as almirante cochrane she was laid down before world war i in early 1918 she was purchased by britain for conversion to an aircraft carrier this work was finished in 1924 her completion was delayed by labour troubles and possibility that she might be repurchased by chile for reconversion into a battleship as well as need for comparative trials to determine optimum layout for aircraft carriers ship was initially assigned to mediterranean fleet and then later to china station spending very little time in home waters other than for periodic refits eagle spent first nine months of world war ii in indian ocean searching for german commerce raiders during early part of war fleet air arm was desperately short of fighters and eagle was equipped solely with fairey swordfish torpedo bombers until late 1940 she was transferred to mediterranean in may 1940 where she escorted convoys to malta and greece and attacked italian shipping naval units and bases in eastern mediterranean ship also participated in battle of calabria in july but her aircraft failed to score any hits when they attempted to torpedo italian cruisers during battle whenever eagle was not at sea her aircraft were disembarked and used ashore ship was relieved by a more modern carrier in march 1941 and ordered to hunt for axis shipping in indian ocean and south atlantic her aircraft sank a german blockade runner and disabled a german oil tanker in mid 1941 but did not find any other axis ships before ship was ordered home for a refit in october after completing an extensive refit in early 1942 ship made trips delivering fighter aircraft to malta to boost its air defences in first half of 1942 eagle was torpedoed and sunk by on 11 august 1942 while escorting a convoy to malta during operation pedestal design and description construction and conversion in 1911 chilean navy ordered one super dreadnought battleship with an option for a second ship each to be armed with ten 14 inch 356 mm and sixteen six inch 152 mm guns that were named and almirante cochrane brook p 146 almirante latorre was laid down in december 1911 followed by almirante cochrane at armstrong yards at newcastle upon tyne on 20 february 1913 on outbreak of first world war construction of two ships was suspended as almirante latorre was almost complete she was purchased for royal navy entering service as in 1915 almirante cochrane was almost complete up to forecastle although her side armour had not yet been installed when war broke out no work was carried out during war until british decided to complete her as an aircraft carrier for royal navy she was therefore purchased from chile on 28 february 1918 to be converted into carrier hms eagle gardiner and gray pp 38 70 she was fourteenth ship of royal navy to bear that name colledge and warlow p 108 director of naval construction began preliminary design work even before ship was purchased and submitted an outline design on 8 february 1918 this design had a full length flight deck and its most distinctive features were two islands separated by flight deck each island was to be long containing two funnels and a tripod mast although they were staggered to make it more difficult for an enemy ship to estimate ship s course they were to be connected to each other with heavy bracing bridge was to be mounted on top of this bracing which left a clear height of for aircraft on flight deck there was to be a wide space between islands where aircraft were to be assembled before taking off aircraft would be transported between hangar and flight deck by two aircraft lifts elevators a crane was to be located at aft end of each island to lift aircraft aboard and to recover seaplanes bulk petrol storage consisted of in tins stowed on forecastle deck and protected by plating two ready use tanks near islands would allow aircraft on flight deck to refuel ship s planned armament consisted of nine 6 inch guns and four anti aircraft guns mounted on platform between islands friedman pp 74 75 eagle retained battleship s mixture of coal and fuel oil but quantities were increased to of coal and of oil as forward and rear 14 inch magazines and shell rooms were converted to be used as oil tanks thumb left line drawing of almirante latorre illustrating what eagle would have looked like if she had been finished in her original configuration shaded areas show extent of her armour based on trials with in which pilots were found generally to turn to port when recovering from an aborted landing design was revised to eliminate port island in april 1918 starboard island was lengthened to and its width was reduced to to minimise air turbulence island contained bridge both funnels and tripod mast that carried fire control directors for armament at request of admiral david beatty commander of grand fleet main armament was increased to 12 six inch guns including one mounted on island and eighteen torpedo tubes were added three triple fixed mounts on each broadside in case ship met german light cruisers at night anti aircraft armament was reduced to a single 4 inch gun mounted on island between funnels as beatty believed that ship s own fighters would be her best defence against enemy aircraft this design was approved in june although work had begun earlier friedman pp 74 76 armour planned for her upper belt was used to protect ship s waterline already completed superstructure was removed as were barbettes for 14 inch guns friedman p 75 eagle was launched on 8 june 1918 and was towed downriver to shipbuilder s high walker yard for fitting out ten days later boiler uptakes were re routed and existing openings were plated over existing upper deck became floor of hangar deck and a new superstructure was built above it flight deck was thick and served as uppermost strength deck or main supporting deck of ship when war ended in november 1918 ship was about nine months from completion brown p 250 construction was slowed by industrial action after war and was suspended on 21 october 1919 as chile wanted to repurchase ship and have it re converted to a battleship friedman p 79 ps2 5 million cost of doing so would have been higher than ps1 5 million offered by chileans and admiralty decided to retain ship royal navy needed to carry out flying trials with a carrier fitted with an island and admiralty approved use of eagle on 11 november armstrong whitworth plated over openings for undelivered elevators on flight deck which had been cancelled when they could not meet specifications finished rear funnel removed torpedo tubes and plated over forward funnel uptakes before she sailed to royal dockyard at portsmouth for modifications necessary for trials on 20 april 1920 brown pp 250 51 only two of her boilers converted to run on fuel oil only could be used during trials brown p 251 flight trials trials principally tested longitudinal arresting gear used previously on small aircraft carrier brown p 252 they were not intended to stop landing aircraft landing speeds of time were low enough that this was unnecessary given a good headwind but rather to prevent aircraft from veering off to one side and falling off flight deck friedman p 95 initially arresting gear was about long and was installed too far forward over course of trials it was moved further to rear and lengthened to a total of friedman pp 79 81 ship was commanded during trials by captain wilmot nicholson who had previously commanded carrier in 1918 and royal air force representative was group captain charles samson taxiing trials began on 10 may with sopwith camel fighters and panther reconnaissance aircraft while ship was still docked flights over and around ship to evaluate air currents over flight deck and around island began shortly afterward and first on board landing was made on 1 june larger aircraft like bristol fighter sopwith cuckoo torpedo bomber and de havilland dh 9 bomber were also evaluated during trials they were generally successful with only 12 minor accidents in 143 landings in all types of weather conditions although they did reveal that aircraft landing aboard carriers would need landing gear fitted with shock absorbers to handle impact of landing on a pitching deck friedman pp 81 82 group captain samson strongly preferred elimination of island entirely but nicholson recommended that ship be retained for service although he was not satisfied with size and shape of island he also recommended that eagle be converted to burn fuel oil exclusively and that removal of 6 inch guns in exchange for anti aircraft guns would allow tripod mast in island to be eliminated since it would not then be required for fire control purposes friedman p 82 description ship was paid off on 16 november but did not begin construction to a revised design until 24 march 1921 at portsmouth admiralty accepted some of nicholson s suggestions but not all shape and size of island was modified in accordance with results from wind tunnel testing at national physical laboratory but 6 inch guns were retained forward edge of flight deck was faired into ship s bow to smooth out air currents over bow and 4 inch anti aircraft guns were mounted on and around island forward elevator was moved to forward end of hangar after construction began anti torpedo bulges were added deep and petrol tin storage room was replaced by a tank ship s designed fuel capacity was but this was increased to when she was bulged however of this amount was required to act as ballast to offset weight of island and its equipment brown pp 252 53 eagle had an overall length of a beam of and a draught of at deep load she displaced at standard load each of ship s four sets of brown curtis geared steam turbines drove one 3 bladed propeller brown p 272 they were powered by 32 yarrow small tube boilers during her sea trials on 9 10 september 1923 turbines produced and gave eagle a speed of but this caused leaks in turbine joints and she was limited to a maximum of in service she had a range

enemy warships eagle had nine bl mk xvii 6 inch guns three at stern and six along both sides of ship ship carried 200 rounds per gun two of her five qf mk v 4 inch aa guns were positioned on flight deck in front of island while a third was behind island remaining two guns were mounted on top of island one between two funnels and each gun was provided with 150 rounds career inter war thumb right aerial view of eagle in 1931 prior to her refit eagle was assigned to mediterranean fleet on 7 june 1924 after she commissioned on 26 february and finished working up she was largest aircraft carrier in world at time and embarked 24 aircraft in four six aircraft flights of fleet air arm of royal air force these consisted of no 402 flight with fairey flycatchers no 422 flight with blackburn blackburn reconnaissance aircraft no 440 flight supermarine seagull flying boats and no 460 flight with blackburn dart torpedo bombers brown p 254 while in mediterranean one flight usually operated

operated aboard for a time in late 1925 eagle sailed for devonport at end of 1925 for a brief refit where longitudinal arresting gear was removed as it had been found to be virtually useless in service two single qf 2 pounder pom pom light anti aircraft guns were added forward of 4 inch guns on flight deck in front of island and ship s petrol capacity was increased to when ship returned to mediterranean after completion of her refit in 1926 bisons of no 448 flight replaced no 422 flight in 1928 she was joined by which allowed fleet to experiment with multi carrier operations eagle was refitted again in early 1929 and a salt water spray system was fitted to fight hangar fires on 29 june 1929 she rescued spanish air force major ramon franco brother of future spanish dictator
