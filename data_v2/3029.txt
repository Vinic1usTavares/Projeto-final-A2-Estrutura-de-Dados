background of winter war covers period before outbreak of winter war between finland and soviet union in 1939 1940 stretching from finnish declaration of independence in 1917 to soviet finnish negotiations in 1938 1939 before its independence finland was an autonomous grand duchy inside imperial russia during ensuing finnish civil war red guards supported by russian bolsheviks were defeated fearful of soviet designs during 1920s and 1930s finns were constantly attempting to align themselves with scandinavian neutrality particularly with regard to sweden furthermore finns engaged in secret military co operation with estonia in 1930s while during late 1920s and early 1930s relations with soviet union became normalized to a degree from 1938 on soviets anxious that finland could be used as a springboard for an invasion started negotiations to conclude a military agreement at same time soviet leader joseph stalin s desire to recover territories of tsarist russia lost during chaos of october revolution and russian civil war made finland an obvious target due to nature of soviet demands which included installation of soviet military facilities on finnish soil these negotiations went nowhere edwards 2006 p 55 in august 1939 soviet union and nazi germany signed molotov ribbentrop pact in which eastern european countries were divided into spheres of interest finland belonged to soviet sphere of interest in october 1939 stalin gained control of baltic states and turned his sights on finland confident that control could be gained without great effort soviet union demanded territories on karelian isthmus islands of gulf of finland and a military base near finnish capital helsinki similar to demands presented in previous years finns again refused and red army attacked on 30 november 1939 simultaneously stalin set up a puppet government for finnish democratic republic headed by finnish communist otto wille kuusinen chubaryan shukman 2002 p xxi finnish politics before war first steps of republic thumb right a 1926 league of nations meeting finland had been eastern part of swedish kingdom for centuries until 1809 during napoleonic wars when imperial russia conquered and converted it into an autonomous buffer state within russian empire to protect saint petersburg imperial capital finland enjoyed wide autonomy and its own senate until turn of century when russia began attempts to assimilate finland as part of a general policy to strengthen central government and unify empire by russification these attempts ruined relations and increased support of finnish movements vying for self government trotter 2002 pp 3 5 outbreak of first world war gave finland a window of opportunity to achieve this finns sought aid from both german empire and bolsheviks to that end and on 6 december 1917 senate of finland declared country s independence new bolshevik russian government was weak and soon russian civil war would break out bolshevik leader vladimir lenin could spare no troops or attention for finland and consequently soviet russia recognized new finnish government just three weeks after declaration of independence in 1918 finns fought a short civil war where pro bolshevik red guards were armed by 7 000 to 10 000 russian troops stationed in finland trotter 2002 pp 5 6 after first world war an inter governmental organization league of nations was founded league s goals included preventing war through collective security and settling disputes between countries through negotiation and diplomacy finland joined league in 1920 edwards 2006 p 18 in 1920s and 1930s finland was politically diverse communist party of finland was declared illegal in 1931 and far right patriotic people s movement ikl had a minor presentation of fourteen seats in 200 seat parliament middle ground occupied by conservatives liberals and swedish people s party tended to cluster with social democratic party whose leader vaino tanner was a strong proponent of parliamentary system edwards 2006 pp 26 27 by late 1930s finnish export oriented economy was growing country had almost solved its right wing problem and finland was preparing for 1940 summer olympics finnish german relations thumb right finnish jager troops during world war i during closing stages of world war i german trained finnish jager troops played a key role in finnish civil war while german baltic sea division also intervened late in civil war jager troops were volunteers from german influenced circles such as university students this participation in finnish struggle for independence created close ties with germany but after german defeat in world war scandinavian relations became more important and main goal of finnish foreign policy finnish german relations cooled after national socialists rose to power in 1933 finns admired imperial germany not radical and anti democratic nazi regime finnish conservatives did not accept state violence and anti church policies of nazis still there was sympathy for german aims to revise treaty of versailles although official finnish policy was reserved especially after german occupation of czechoslovakia finland even recalled its ambassador for a short period finnish nazis and ultranationalist parties such as ikl achieved only minor support in several elections especially in aftermath of failed mantsala rebellion in 1932 finnish swedish co operation after 1917 finnish independence and civil war other scandinavian countries would have been best candidates for a political alliance finnish cooperation represented a rich vein of shared history in culture of both nations and swedish speaking finns had a common language with swedes during civil war however sweden briefly occupied aland islands and later supported local movement that wanted to secede from finland and join islands to sweden dispute was resolved by league of nations in 1921 and aland remained finnish but were granted autonomy other obstacles to closer relations were ongoing language strife on status of swedish language in finland sweden had also opposed upper class resistance movement against russification as a result young finnish men received their military training in germany generating jager movement nevertheless finnish swedish relations improved considerably before winter war finland sought security guarantees from league of nations but did not have high expectations sweden was one of founding members of league and consequently framed its military policies based on league s principles of disarmament and sanctions in mid 1920s finns established a special planning committee called committee of erich after its chairman rafael erich which consisted of top politicians and officers with aim of exploring a possible military collaboration of finland with other nations prime goal was co operation with scandinavian countries amongst which sweden was most important prospective partner finnish and swedish militaries engaged in wide ranging co operation but it was more focused on exchange of information and defence planning for aland islands than on military exercises or materiel finnish objective was to commit swedes by establishing a military political joint venture in aland if swedes would undertake to assist finland in fortifying islands then an important and useful precedent might be set government of sweden was aware of military co operation but carefully avoided committing itself to finnish foreign policy secret military co operation with estonia thumb right finnish chief of general staff lennart oesch on left monitors estonian army military exercises in october 1938 estonian chief of general staff nikolai reek stands second from right finnish estonian relations were closest diplomatically after estonian freedom war in 1920s but cooled afterwards military relations however remained close from finnish point of view close relations with estonia did not exclude scandinavian neutrality policy nevertheless military relations were top secret and countries held joint military exercises central aim was to prevent soviet baltic fleet from freely using its strength in gulf of finland against either country estonia also sought public security guarantees and signed baltic entente in 1934 with latvia and lithuania relations with united kingdom and france after collapse of imperial germany in november 1918 finns sought new political partners united kingdom had been a significant trading partner since 18th century and finns worked to improve relations for next two decades in 1930s finland purchased thornycroft torpedo boats from united kingdom and also refrained from buying bomber aircraft from germany because of british protests purchasing instead modern bristol blenheims which later served successfully during winter war relations with france were important after world war i and in 1920s as france played a leading role in new european security arrangements in 1930s france started to fear rise of nazi germany and initiated a rapprochement with soviet union which strained franco finnish relations however during winter war france was one of most important suppliers of military materiel finnish defence plans finnish defence forces military operation plan against soviet union was named russian concentration vk in 1920s in latest 1934 plan finns saw two possible scenarios in scenario soviets would mobilize all along their western border and would deploy only limited forces against finland in this case finns would make counterattacks across border vk2 scenario envisaged a much more unfavourable situation for finns main defense line would be on karelian isthmus finnish forces would repel soviet attacks in favourable positions and destroy enemy by counterattacks in winter war vk2 scenario was flexible and its basis proved correct but finnish general staff badly underestimated numerical superiority of red army finland had a limited defence budget after its independence and especially in 1930s consequently finnish defence forces were lacking military materiel in almost all branches much of military s materiel was outdated and even proved unsuitable for field during winter war during winter war material situation improved but it still lagged behind more modern and well equipped red army soviet finnish relations diplomatic relations thumb right soviet finnish non aggression pact signed in helsinki on 21 january 1932 on left finnish foreign minister yrjo koskinen and on right ambassador of soviet union in helsinki ivan maisky relationship between soviet union and finland had been tense a legacy of two periods of forced russification at turn of century and failed soviet backed socialist rebellion in finland as well as incursions by groups of

border between autonomous grand duchy of finland and imperial russia proper in addition finland received petsamo with its ice free harbour on arctic ocean treaty did not prevent finnish government from allowing volunteers to cross border to support east karelian uprising in 1921 however nor expatriate finnish communists from causing disturbances in finland in 1923 both countries signed border peace agreement which normalized border in 1928 soviet union began collectivization in during collectivization and ethnic cleansing soviets captured killed and deported peasants provoking widespread criticism by finnish media in 1930 two years later nationalist movement unsuccessfully attempted to overthrow finnish government in mantsala rebellion nevertheless during 1930s diplomatic climate between finland and soviet union gradually improved from 1920s soviet union had offered different non aggression pacts with finland but they were all rejected now offer was renewed as part of a series of agreements with countries on soviet union s western border in 1932 soviet union signed a non aggression pact with finland re affirmed in 1934 for ten years relations between two countries remained largely de minimis however while foreign trade in finland was booming less than one percent of it was with soviet union edwards 2006 p 23 in 1934 soviet union joined league of nations and later accepted other progressive forces beside communist parties this change in soviet attitudes as well as internal politics in finland enabled a short thaw in relations in 1937 stalin and protection of leningrad after russian civil war joseph stalin was disappointed at soviet union s inability to foment a successful revolution in finland and furthermore bolsheviks struggle with national sentiments inside soviet union in 1923 stalin proclaimed that main danger in national relations was great russian chauvinism he started policy of korenizatsiya indigenisation to promote national communist cadres for every nationality timo vihavainen nationalism and internationalism how did bolsheviks cope with national sentiments in chulos and piirainen 2000 p 79 however from 1937 stalin encouraged russian chauvinism implying russians were politically and culturally superior rayfield 2005 pp 253 vihavainen nationalism and internationalism how did bolsheviks cope with national sentiments in chulos and piirainen 2000 p 85 soviet diplomacy turned towards recovery of territories of tsarist state soviet union used comintern to announce a doctrine where bourgeoisie equaled fascism and that communism was natural agency of proletariat in practice this meant that anything other than communism would be considered anti soviet and fascist edwards 2006 pp 43 46 soviet foreign policy was a mixture of ideology of world revolution and traditional concerns of russian national security chubaryan shukman 2002 pp xv xvi during stalin era soviet agriculture production collapsed causing famines in 1932 1933 official output numbers of industrial production were used as propaganda to portray soviet union as an economic miracle soviet propaganda also used cross border comparisons with finland to represent country as a vicious and reactionary fascist clique finnish marshal c g e mannerheim and leader of finnish social democrat party vaino tanner were particular hate figures edwards 2006 pp 32 33 stalin gained near absolute power in 1935 1936 leaving only army as self governing rayfield 2005 pp 280 281 but its officers also became target of purges during great terror in 1937 1938 rayfield 2005 pp 315 316 in late 1930s stalin s soviet union was no longer satisfied with status quo in its relations with finland this came as a result of a change in soviet foreign policy which now pursued aim of recovering provinces of tsarist russia lost during chaos of october revolution and russian civil war soviets considered old empire to have had an optimal balance of security and territory and their thoughts were shaped by a historical precedent as treaty of nystad of 1721 was intended to protect tsarist saint petersburg from swedes re acquisition of finland would protect now bolshevik leningrad from rising power of nazi germany edwards 2006 pp 28 29 while in 1938 sweden was no longer a major threat against russia soviets had not forgotten role that finnish controlled aland islands had played as a base of operations for german expeditionary force in finnish civil war edwards 2006 pp 36 38 finnish soviet negotiations negotiations from 1938 to early 1939 thumb right nkvd officer boris yartsev a k a boris arranged secret negotiations with finnish government in 1938 in april 1938 a junior diplomatic official named boris yartsev contacted finnish foreign minister rudolf holsti and prime minister stating that soviets did not trust germany and war was considered possible between two countries in such a war germany might use finland as a base for operations against soviet union red army would not wait passively behind border but would rather advance to meet enemy if finland were to fight against germany then soviet union would offer all possible economic and military assistance soviets would also accept fortification of aland islands but demanded positive guarantees on finland s position trotter 2002 pp 12 13 finns assured yartsev that finland was committed to a policy of neutrality and country would resist any armed incursion yartsev was not satisfied with reply given finland s military weakness he suggested that finland could cede or lease some islands in gulf of finland along seaward approaches to leningrad a suggestion finns rejected earlier in mid 1930s soviet ambassador in helsinki eric assmus polvinen 1992 p 399 eric assmus met finnish prime minister toivo in private on 15 june 1935 stating that in case of a military conflict in mainland europe soviet union could be forced to occupy some parts of finland and leningrad bolshevik party leader andrei zhdanov polvinen 1992 pp 432 433 andrei zhdanov made a public speech at end of november 1936 stating that finland should not be a base for germans in that case finland would be target of red army assault threat was similar than earlier by eric assmus but this time it was published in soviet newspapers had presented a similar proposal negotiations continued during autumn 1938 soviets reduced their demands a red army operation was not an option anymore and focus was shifted on securing gulf of finland soviets wanted to be informed of key elements of finnish estonian gulf blockade secret military plan against baltic fleet furthermore yartsev suggested that finns fortify suursaari island but that soviets would take care of its defence during negotiations rudolf holsti resigned as foreign minister although not for reasons associated with negotiations and his place was taken by eljas erkko holsti was rather anti german so resignation set off rumours quickly quelled by finnish government that he had been forced to resign by a finnish government sympathetic to germans finns attempted to appear even handed and interior ministry issued an order banning extreme right ikl ban was reversed by finnish courts as being unconstitutional many years later minister in charge at that time urho kekkonen admitted that this was a simple gesture to suggest to moscow that finland did not harbour a german fifth column edwards 2006 pp 48 51 by winter of 1939 soviets further reduced their demands and sent boris stein to negotiate stein and erkko met five times erkko rejected soviet proposals saying that soviet demands would mean end of finnish neutrality policy and displease germans when chairman of finnish defense council c g e mannerheim was informed of negotiations he opined that finland should give up suursaari islands because their defence would anyway be impossible during a war but his arguments did not persuade majority of finnish government stein departed helsinki empty handed on 6 april finns had many reasons to turn down soviet proposals finland had started negotiations for a military co operation with sweden and finns had great hopes for joint finnish swedish defense for alands islands and did not want to jeopardize these negotiations in addition violent collectivization purges show trials and executions in stalin s soviet union had given country a bad reputation furthermore most of finnish communist leadership in soviet union was executed during great purge soviet union did not therefore seem to be a reliable contracting party soviet envoys sent to negotiate with finns were officially of relatively low rank but as vaino tanner put it later finns assumed rightly that they represented of some higher organ of state probably soviet secret police nkvd edwards 2006 pp 41 42 soviet german pact thumb right molotov and ribbentrop signed non aggression treaty between germany and soviet union in moscow on 23 august 1939 soviet union and

estonian government had earlier unlike baltic countries finns started a gradual mobilization under guise of additional refresher training finnish government did not send foreign minister but its ambassador in stockholm j k paasikivi this was done on purpose to limit his powers as a negotiator in moscow paasikivi met both foreign minister vyacheslav molotov and stalin soviets demanded that frontier between ussr and finland on karelian isthmus be moved westward to a point only east of viipuri finland s second largest city to line between koivisto and in addition finns would have to destroy all existing fortifications on karelian isthmus finland should also cede to soviet union islands of suursaari and koivisto in gulf of finland in north soviets demanded peninsula furthermore
