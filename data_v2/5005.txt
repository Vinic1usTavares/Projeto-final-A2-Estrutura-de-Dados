playing baseball when yankees traveled north to begin their season krichell usually followed he also scouted local newspapers to look for games in which potential prospects were playing later his style of scouting was used as a blueprint by scouts to evaluate players he usually ignored obvious tools such as ability to hit size speed and human power saying that any dope could see it when he scouted a prospect his top priority was checking that subject could handle pressure of playing major league baseball voigt p 177 when he got word of a promising player he went to see him play if krichell liked what he saw he discussed player s goals and motivation with him and his family he decided whether player was ready for yankees or one of their farm teams to use he tended to take a risk with players passed by other teams berger p 99 he discounted some of a player s weaknesses if their remaining skills were up to par for example with tony lazzeri who was a poor fielder krichell also was one of first to notice that intelligence mattered in a game filled with uneducated people most of his signings were college graduates who krichell believed could take advantage of their ability to think graham p 141 at other times krichell collected some of best prospects in an area normally 300 or more and put them through a four day workout it normally consisted of practice in morning and a full game in afternoon madden p 5 there krichell and his staff sorted though players they believed could become useful in organization and dropped those they thought lacked motivation few players who survived workout were assigned by krichell to yankees minor league hierarchy legacy krichell is considered one of greatest scouts in baseball history p 175 birdie tebbetts a member of veterans
