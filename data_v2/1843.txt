read quote i desire to inform nation that we are proud to pay tribute to efficiency gallantry and devotion of our forces throughout struggle we have expressed to major general bennett our confidence in him his leadership and conduct were in complete conformity with his duty to men under his command and to his country he remained with his men until end completed all formalities in connection with

general and given command of iii corps in perth at time this was an important post but by 1943 as possibility of a japanese invasion of australia faded it became a backwater bennett was told by blamey that he would not be given another active command and he transferred to reserve of officers in may 1944 he soon published his account of malayan campaign why singapore fell which was critical of percival and other british officers although his opinions were later challenged by several australian officers including callaghan blamey unsuccessfully tried to prevent book s publication upon

blamey upon his release and blamey convened a court of enquiry under lieutenant general leslie morshead and major generals victor and george wootten which found that bennett was not justified in handing over his command or in leaving singapore veterans of 8th division who were generally loyal to bennett protested against this finding in november 1945 prime minister ben chifley appointed a royal commission under justice g c commission concluded that bennett had disobeyed percival s order to surrender lodge wrote in 1948 lieutenant colonel thomas fry a military lawyer published opinion
