may not have handled incident correctly stating i wasn t interested in what anybody thought publicly i was interested in what was going on right here on ground with people i work with every day did i do it perfectly of course not this is my first television show it was a learning experience knight said that rhimes was among those for discouraging him to come out however rhimes said i remember saying to fellow executive producer this is our proudest day here t r got to come out and i got to say to him that it wouldn t affect his character because he was concerned he was going to come out and george would suddenly be gay idea that a gay actor can t play a straight man is insulting in december 2008 reports speculated that knight requested to be released from his contract and that they were working out details at that time in june 2009 after conclusion of fifth season of grey s anatomy it was confirmed that knight would not be returning for show s sixth season actor stated reason for his departure was due to a breakdown in communication with rhimes o malley s lack of screen time as well as his decision to be openly gay prior to official announcement of his departure there was speculation that role of o malley would be recast but rhimes labeled it as a hilarious ridiculous rumor after confirmation of his exit knight told tv guide leaving grey s anatomy was not an easy decision for me to make i am extremely grateful to have had opportunity to play this character and will miss my fellow cast and crew very much i continue to wish them very best and wholeheartedly thank all of fans who have supported me and show with such passion and enthusiasm in a statement confirming knight s departure rhimes said i think i speak for entire grey s anatomy family when i say we wish t r knight best in his future endeavors he is an incredibly talented actor and a person whose strength of character is admired by all of us in an interview with entertainment weekly rhimes said she tried to talk him out of quitting explaining i looked in his face and he was really sure it felt like right thing for him however in another interview knight said of his exit my five year experience proved to me that i could not trust any answer that was given about o malley knight was at peace with his departure saying there just comes a time when it s so clear that moving on is best decision however heigl tried to talk knight out of leaving saying i didn t think it was right decision i felt like some of problems could be worked through but by time it came to fruition i was glad for him because he was ready to go on topic of losing a us 14 million contract knight commented from an outsider s perspective i get impression that he s just a spoiled actor he doesn t know how good he has it there are a lot of people who would like to be in my position but in end i need to be fulfilled in my work characterization o malley was characterized a hapless naif on topic of o malley s longtime crush on meredith in second season knight said what s going to be very interesting to see is what he s going to do with meredith it s getting close to time whatever he chooses to do will inform who he is rest of his life after their sexual encounter occurred onscreen knight said in an interview with maureen ryan of chicago tribune george wasn t really paying full attention he was letting his own feelings override his respect for meredith a person really clued in would get that there wasn t anything coming back but he was so in his head about it and caught up in his own feelings that he wasn t listening it s not just that he loves her it s a kind of selfish love he had for her he also added that i think george has a lot of growing up to do part of that is making horrible stupid mistakes he s been pretty sheltered series writer stacy mckee said of sexual encounter there s no turning back there s nothing george and meredith can do damage is done things will never be same they ve just changed something important in their lives forever when asked if o malley was becoming more assertive knight said knight also commented that character does not appreciate himself and his positive traits on topic of o malley performing open heart surgery in an elevator knight said it s a slow change but he s starting to realize way i have been doing things is not working big thing about open heart surgery in elevator was he was forced into it he needs to be kind of kicked in butt to do these things knight felt a parallel to george in that his confidence isn t always at its absolute highest but overall he sees more differences than similarities however when actor starts to think he is so different from o malley an awkward move can suggest otherwise i was walking doing a scene with katherine heigl i finished my line with her and then i walked straight into light stand critical of her affair with o malley knight s co star heigl explained they really hurt somebody and they didn t seem to be taking a lot of responsibility for it i have a really hard time with that kind of thing i m maybe a little too black and white about it speaking of o malley s relationship with lexie rhimes offered her insight i love them as friends they make good friends we all have that friend we met in school or gym or somewhere we just hit it off right away and right away there was no pretense or airs just pure honesty that s lexie and george they re really good friends and i can see friendship evolving into something even greater when asked what his favorite george moment was knight said his relationships with stevens and bailey reception thumb upright callie torres relationship with o malley was initially criticized fans were widely against o malley s affair with meredith in second season however certain fans who supported their relationship were critical when torres was introduced as a love interest for him fans and critics were also against o malley s relationship with stevens in fourth season maclean s said george must die he s slept with virtually everyone except male cast and has been in love with virtually everyone except male cast and he s not that great of a doctor evolve or die christopher monfette of ign said o malley and stevens were a mismatch adding unfortunately while it s refreshing to see a plotline driven by activity versus apathy idea of these two ever affable best friend characters suddenly discovering their potential out of nowhere love for each other quickly feels both force fed and emotionally incorrect similarly dvd verdict stated that george and izzie were one of strongest best friend vibes on television for first three seasons explaining they were perfect as friends while george and callie made a good couple ugo com put two on their list of character couples who should have never happened jennifer armstrong of entertainment weekly said that when o malley told torres about his affair with stevens scene was too melodramatic laura burrows also of ign said that fourth season premiere introduced a new side of george armstrong said of o malley and stevens reconciliation george and izzie are finally on old grey s anatomy road to ruin and i admit this is a good lesson in grey s viewing as well as life sit tight if you hate something as nothing is permanent armstrong also commented that sparkling friendship development between lexie and o malley won her over following year monfette observed of o malley s lack of screen time his growing interest in trauma surgery at side of owen leads to an interesting development in finale but character is virtually side lined this season carina mackenzie of los angeles times said of character s death time lapse episode was an interesting choice and though we sped through six weeks of mourning in two hours it didn t feel rushed to me i m not sure show could have held my attention for another season of crippling sadness huffington post michael pascua commented that o malley s funeral did not live up to his expectations writing that it wasn t as sad as he thought it would be in 2006 knight and other cast of grey s anatomy were nominated for
