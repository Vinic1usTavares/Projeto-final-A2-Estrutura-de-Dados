in 1304 braose secured king edward s confirmation of earlier grants and charters granting braose special rights and liberties in gower he managed this because he was serving king in scotland at time and thus had easy access to king in 1305 however braose miscalculated and insulted a royal judge using gross and words to describe royal official quoted in phillips edward ii p 105 footnote 105 this
