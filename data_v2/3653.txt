besarion jughashvili this is name that appears in birth register entry for his son russian version of his name was vissarion ivanovich dzhugashvili vissarion ivanovich dzhugashvili commonly known as beso 25 august 1909 was father of joseph stalin born into a peasant family of serfs in didi lilo in georgia he moved to tbilisi at a young age to be a shoemaker working in a factory he was invited to set up his own shop in gori where he met and married ekaterine geladze with whom had three sons only youngest ioseb lived once known as a clever and proud man jughashvili s shop failed and he developed a serious drinking problem wherefore he left his family and moved back to tbilisi in 1884 working in a factory again he had little contact with either his wife or son after that point and little is known of his life from then on except that he died in 1909 of cirrhosis family background and early life little is known of family of besarion jughashvili his grandfather zaza jughashvili 1798 1847 was involved in 1804 rebellion against russian empire which had only annexed eastern georgia kartli kakheti in 1801 zaza was possibly of ossetian background with historian simon sebag montefiore suggesting he came from village of geri near modern south ossetia though this claim can not be proven stephen kotkin writes that zaza may have lived in a trial ossetian village but did not specify a name even so it would not have a major impact robert service explains that peoples of caucasus had moved around region for centuries while also notes that claim was made to explain stalin s later actions since mountain peoples are widely regarded as less civilized than town dwellers of valleys furthermore donald rayfield has stated that stalin s possibly blood is no more significant to georgian or russian history than henry tudor s is to english history which is to say not at all zaza escaped uprising and moved to didi lilo a village about away from capital tiflis now tbilisi he worked as a serf for prince tending to his vineyards there he had a son vano georgian diminutive for ivane who in turn had two sons giorgi and besarion who was likely born around 1850 vano died young likely before he turned 50 while giorgi worked as an innkeeper until he was killed by bandits with no family left jughashvili moved to tiflis and worked in g g adelkhanov shoe factory already literate it is likely in tiflis that he learned armenian azerbaijani and russian in addition to his native georgian around 1870 he was invited to move to gori about from tiflis and make shoes for russian soldiers garrisoned there gori was a small town at time with roughly 7000 residents majority were armenian with a large number of georgians as well as small numbers of russians abkhaz and ossetians it grew in importance in 1871 when a branch of transcaucasus railway connected town to tiflis and poti a major port for oil export life in gori left thumb ioseb jughashvili jughashvili s third son and only one who survived childhood pictured in 1894 he would grow up and take name joseph stalin thumb keke geladze jughashvili s wife pictured in 1930s thumb jughashvili home in gori as seen in 2016 family lived in one room on left while jughashvili s shop was set up in basement building is now part of a museum dedicated to stalin jughashvili set up a shop in russian quarter of gori close to barracks in 1872 or 1874 he married ekaterine keke geladze a peasant girl who was probably 16 montefiore and rayfield state wedding took place in 1872 see and while kotkin states it was in 1874 kotin also points out that montefiore s timeline doesn t work as montefiore states that just over nine months after wedding on 14 february 1875 keke an attractive freckled girl with auburn hair was from village of near gori and had moved to town at a young age after her father died they had three children all boys though first two mikheil born 14 february 1875 and giorgi born 24 december 1876 died aged two months and six months respectively their third and final son ioseb was born on 6 december 1878 ioseb would later change his name to joseph stalin montefiore writes that after death of mikheil jughashvili started to drink heavily and that marriage began to deteriorate kotkin has also suggested that rumours of infidelity by keke took a toll on him especially after birth of ioseb with several men suggested as his possible father however kotkin concedes that whether keke was flirtatious let alone promiscuous is unclear and that reliable evidence about possible liaisons of future stalin s mother is lacking and argues that jughashvili was probably father jughashvili s shop was initially quite successful employing up to ten people as well as apprentices and family initially enjoyed a rather high standard of living a former apprentice would later note that he frequently saw butter in their home which was an expensive delicacy for most georgians however kotkin writes that family lived more modestly eating more traditional foods like and however jughashvili s drinking exacerbated by a georgian custom that business paid in part with wine rather than money had adverse effects on his business and home life isaac deutscher felt that jughashvili s inability to lift his status to be his own master likely contributed to his drinking and frustrations this idea is echoed by robert service who noted that jughashvili did not adapt to make european style shoes that were popular at time and instead kept producing traditional georgian styles and suggests that rumours about keke were also a major influence on his drinking frequently drunk jughashvili became violent and routinely would beat keke who often hit back and frequently fought in public earning nickname crazy beso later life and death left thumb jughashvili s grave in telavi georgia originally buried in a common grave what was thought to be his grave was identified in 1972 in 1884 jughashvili left family and moved to tiflis montefiore states that jughashvili left after ioseb contracted smallpox though kotin suggests events were unrelated and implies jughashvili left before smallpox outbreak and that he was told to leave by gori police chief after attacking him he returned to his old job at adelkhanov factory he sent some money to keke as well as offers to reconcile but all efforts to do so failed jughashvili was upset when he learned that keke had enrolled ioseb in school instead hoping his son would follow his path and become a cobbler this led to a major incident in january 1890 ioseb had been struck by a phaeton severely injuring him jughashvili returned to gori and brought his son to a tiflis hospital and after ioseb healed he was apprenticed to adelkhanov factory keke was adamantly opposed to idea and used her connections with church to bring ioseb back to gori where he would continue his studies to become a priest this marked last real contact jughasvhili had with his wife or son as he cut off contact and financial support when ioseb left tiflis soon after ioseb left tiflis jughashvili seems to have left adelkhanov factory he briefly made shoes in a stall at armenian bazaar in tiflis and his actions after that are uncertain he did keep in contact with ioseb occasionally sending him hand made shoes jughashvili also had one final role in ioseb s life in january 1900 ioseb was arrested for first time on account of jughashvili when jughashvili left didi lilo he was not removed from village roles and still owed taxes as a peasant from region it is not clear why ioseb was arrested instead of his father who still lived in tiflis but kotkin suggests it was a police tactic to send a message to ioseb who had begun his revolutionary activities in august 1909 jughashvili went to mikhailovsky hospital in tiflis suffering from tuberculosis colitis and chronic pneumonia he died on 12 august 1909 with cause of death listed as cirrhosis of liver only one person a fellow cobbler attended his funeral and he was buried in an unmarked grave in telavi location of his grave was unknown until 1972 when charkviani former first secretary of georgian communist party led efforts to find it and mark it though it was not confirmed if jughashvili s remains were still there charkviani had previously looked for photos of jughashvili at one point bringing several to stalin to confirm their authenticity after looking at them stalin was unable to confirm if any were his father there is only one photo purportedly of jughasvhili though its authenticity has never been confirmed
