on morning of august 14 2017 significant mudflow events occurred in and around capital city of freetown in sierra leone following three days of torrential rainfall mass wasting of mud and debris damaged or destroyed hundreds of buildings in city killing 1 141 people and leaving more than 3 000 homeless causal factors for mudslides include region s particular topography and climate with freetown s elevation close to sea level and its greater position within a tropical monsoon climate those factors were assisted by generally poor state of region s infrastructure and loss of protective natural drainage systems from periods of deforestation background potential for deadly flooding in sierra leone was exacerbated by a combination of factors freetown which sits at tip of a peninsula was in 2015 occupied by approximately 1million people freetown s topography alternates between thickly wooded and partially deforested mountains these mountains run along peninsula parallel to atlantic for 25 miles freetown s elevation varies from coastal areas which are at or just below sea level to approximately above sea level freetown suffers from long term issues involving poor urban development programs according to jamie of africa research institute government is failing to provide housing for poorest in society and when attention is paid to issues such as unregulated construction it is received only after a crisis because a moratorium on housing construction was not enforced unorganized settlements and municipal works encroached on flood plains resulting in narrower water passageways during floods freetown s drainage systems are often blocked by discarded waste especially in city s poorer communities contributing to higher levels of surface runoff construction of large homes in hillside areas and unrestricted deforestation for residential purposes weakened stability of nearby slopes and caused soil erosion within a decade leading up to disaster sierra leone cleared approximately 800 000 hectares of forest cover country s civil war fought between 1991 and 2002 was also a cause of deforestation nation s environmental protective agency launched a mission in region two weeks prior to floods and mudslides which was ultimately unsuccessful mudslides according to national weather service s climate prediction center sierra leone experienced a
