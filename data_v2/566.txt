battle of cer was a military campaign fought between austria hungary and serbia in august 1914 starting three weeks into serbian campaign initial military action of first world war it took place around cer mountain and several surrounding villages as well as town of sabac battle part of first austro hungarian invasion of serbia began on night of 15 august when elements of serbian 1st combined division encountered austro hungarian outposts that had been established on slopes of cer mountain earlier in invasion clashes that followed escalated into a battle for control over several towns and villages near mountain especially sabac on 19 august morale of austro hungarians collapsed and thousands of soldiers retreated back into austria hungary many of them drowning in drina river as they fled in panic on 24 august serbs re entered sabac marking end of battle serbian casualties after nearly ten days of fighting were 3 000 5 000 killed and 15 000 wounded those of austro hungarians were significantly higher with 6 000 10 000 soldiers killed 30 000 wounded and 4 500 taken as prisoners of war serbian victory over austro hungarians marked first allied victory over central powers in opening days of first world war and first aerial dogfight of war took place during battle background relations between austria hungary and serbia deteriorated in aftermath of may overthrow in 1903 almost immediately new karadordevic government aligned itself with russian empire and oriented its foreign policy away from its long time patron habsburgs and austria hungary in 1906 austria hungary closed its border to serbian agricultural exports in an episode known as pig war in 1908 austria hungary formally annexed bosnia herzegovina a territory with a large serb population that it had been granted by congress of berlin in 1878 annexation prompted serbian public to call for war with austria hungary with no promise of russian support in event of war serbian government decided against pursuing matter militarily count franz conrad von hotzendorf boasted that it would take austro hungary only three months to defeat serbia should war erupt between two nations thumb left 180px austro

herzegovina firmly in austro hungarian hands serbia and several other balkan states turned to forcing ottoman empire from southeastern europe ensuing balkan wars which lasted from 1912 until 1913 saw serbia take possession of kosovo and macedonia on 28 june 1914 bosnian serb student gavrilo princip assassinated archduke franz ferdinand of austria in sarajevo assassination precipitated july crisis which led austria hungary to issue an ultimatum to serbia on 23 july on suspicion that assassination had been planned in belgrade austro hungarian government made ultimatum intentionally unacceptable to serbia and it was indeed rejected austro hungarians declared war on serbia on 28 july and that same day serbs destroyed all bridges on sava and danube rivers in order to prevent austro hungarians from using them during any future invasion belgrade was shelled following day marking beginning of first world war fighting in eastern europe began with first austro hungarian invasion of serbia in early august 1914 number of austro hungarian troops was far smaller than 308 000 strong force intended when war was declared this was because a large portion of austro hungarian 2nd army had moved to russian front reducing number of troops involved in initial stages of invasion to approximately 200 000 forty percent of this force was composed of south slavs living within austro hungarian borders on other hand serbs could muster some 450 000 men to oppose austro hungarians upon full mobilization main elements to face austro hungarians were 1st 2nd 3rd and uzice armies with a combined strength of approximately 180 000 men balkan wars had only just concluded and serbia was still recovering over 36 000 serbian soldiers had been killed and 55 000 seriously wounded few recruits had been gained from newly acquired territories and serbian army had been stretched by need to garrison them against albanian insurgents and threat of bulgarian attack to compound matters serbian army was dangerously short of artillery and had only just begun to replenish its ammunition stocks its supply problems also extended to more basic items many serbian recruits reported for duty barefoot and many units lacked any uniform other than a standard issue greatcoat and a traditional serbian cap known as a sajkaca rifles were also in critically short supply it was estimated that full mobilization would see some 50 000 serbian soldiers with no equipment at all austro hungarians on other hand possessed an abundance of modern rifles and had twice as many machine guns and field guns as serbs they also had better stocks of munitions as well as much better transport and industrial infrastructure behind them serbs had a slight advantage over austro hungarians many of their soldiers were experienced veterans of balkan wars and better trained than their austro hungarian counterparts serb soldiers were also highly motivated which compensated in part for their lack of weaponry austro hungarian forces assigned to invasion were placed under command of general oskar potiorek who had been responsible for security detail of archduke franz ferdinand in sarajevo prior to battle potiorek had predicted an easy victory over serbians calling them pig farmers serbian army was commanded by crown prince alexander with chief of general staff field marshal radomir putnik who had commanded serb forces in balkan wars as his deputy and de facto military leader generals petar bojovic stepa stepanovic and pavle jurisic sturm commanded 1st 2nd and 3rd serbian armies respectively battle prelude thumb mobilized austro hungarian troops sent across sarajevo for serbia from 29 july to 11 august austro hungarian army launched a series of artillery attacks in northern and northwestern serbia and subsequently managed to exploit bombardments by constructing a system of pontoon bridges across sava and drina rivers serbians knew that it was impossible for their forces to line entirety of austro serbian border which extended putnik therefore ordered serbian army to fall back on a traditional line of defence as he grouped bulk of his forces in sumadija from where they could rapidly move either north or west strong detachments were posted in towns of valjevo and uzice and outposts were stationed at every important point on frontier at this stage all serbian general staff could do was wait until austro hungarian invasion plan materialized belgrade smederevo and veliko continued to be subjected to more vigorous artillery bombardments and a number of failed attempts to cross danube resulted in heavy austro hungarian losses bulk of austro hungarian forces were stationed in bosnia and serbian general staff were not misled by these feints on danube subsequently austro hungarians attempted to cross drina at and sava at sabac and these attacks were seen as more significant on 12 august austro hungarian troops entered serbia through town of loznica crossing drina there and in village of lesnica austro hungarian 13th army corps made a crossing while on same day austro hungarian 4th army corps crossed sava to north of sabac while other austro hungarian troops crossed drina town of sabac was quickly taken by 14 august over a front of about austro hungarians had crossed rivers and converged on valjevo austro hungarian 2nd and 5th armies moved towards belgrade where they encountered serbian 1st 2nd and 3rd armies on 15 august putnik ordered his forces into counterattack combat around 23 00 on 15 august elements of serbian 1st combined division encountered outposts set up by invading austro hungarian army on slopes of cer mountain and fighting erupted austro hungarian positions were lightly held and their defenders were driven back away from mountain by midnight fierce clashes between austro hungarians and serbs were underway and chaos ensued in darkness by morning of 16 august serbians had seized range and dislodged austro hungarians from their positions in village of selo austro hungarians who had suffered heavy casualties during fighting retreated in some disorder as day progressed serbs drove 21st infantry division off slopes of cer to prevent it from linking with 2nd army in sabac on 17 august serbs attempted to retake sabac but their efforts failed 1st combined division attacked villages of trojan and before moving on towards small town of kosanin grad elsewhere austro hungarians succeeded in repulsing serbian 3rd army forcing it to manoeuvre one of its divisions to protect approach to town of valjevo which was threatened by 42nd mountain division in early morning of 18 august austro hungarians launched another attack with intention of pushing 1st sumadija division off sabac bridgehead to allow 5th army to advance however attack failed as serbs defeated austro hungarians at dobrava river forcing their surviving soldiers to withdraw elsewhere serbian 2nd army s counter offensive continued along cer and iverak with 1st combined division attacking village of rasulijaca and coming under severe pressure at kosanin grad first serbian assault was fought off but a wave of further attacks followed throughout night in early morning of 19 august serbs finally defeated austro hungarians and seized small town 1st morava division drove 9th infantry division from its position and fought off division s subsequent counterattack inflicting heavy losses 4th corps renewed its attack against sumadija division forcing serbs to withdraw having only sustained light casualties because 4th corps did not break serbs austro hungarian division was unable to alter direction of its advance towards cer mountain since doing so would have put sumadija division in a position to attack 4th corps from rear as a result 4th corps was unable to join other austro hungarian forces fighting at cer thumb 250px cer mountain in northwestern serbia in 1914 mountain was site of eponymous battle in which austro hungarian forces were defeated by their numerically inferior serb opponents alt a valley mountain and forests photographed from side of a road serbs retook rasulijaca at noon and 1st combined division exploited this to advance towards lesnica meanwhile 1st morava division attacked iverak and managed to drive austro hungarians back village of velika fell to serbs before mid day and by late afternoon grob ridge had been retaken at around this time austro hungarians began retreating with increasing rapidity their will and cohesion apparently shattered 3rd army had similar success routing 36th infantry division and forcing it to retreat in considerable disorder serbs then moved to pursue fleeing austro hungarians all along front by 20 august austro hungarian forces were fleeing across drina river still being pursued by serbs back into bosnia with entire 5th army being forced across austro hungarian side of river many austro hungarian soldiers drowned in water as they fled in panic serbian military reports announced that enemy is withdrawing in greatest disorder putnik then notified king peter in a telegram saying main enemy has been defeated in jadar and on mount cer and our troops are in hot pursuit upon their triumph at cer mountain serbs sought to recapture heavily fortified town of sabac violent clashes occurred on 21 and 22 august during which serb forces fought their way to western approaches of town by 23 august serbs had encircled town and that evening they brought up their siege artillery on 24 august serbian forces entered sabac and discovered that austro hungarians had decamped previous night by 16 00 serbs reached banks of sava river bringing first austro hungarian invasion of serbia to an end casualties both sides suffered heavy casualties in battles estimates of number of austro hungarian casualties vary jordan states that austro hungarians suffered a total of 37 000 casualties in battle of whom 7 000 were fatalities misha glenny states that almost 30 000 austro hungarian soldiers were wounded and 6 000 10 000 were killed horne writes that austro hungarians had 8 000 soldiers killed and 30 000 wounded in battle compounded by loss of 46 guns 30 machine guns and 140 ammunition wagons historian david stevenson states that 4 500 austro hungarian soldiers were taken prisoner estimates of number of serbian casualties also vary horne and jordan both agree that approximately 3 000 serbian soldiers were killed and 15 000 were wounded in battle glenny counters that 3 000 5 000 serb soldiers were killed in battle nevertheless number of fatalities suffered by both sides heralded massive cost in human lives of first world war french journalist henry reported atrocities were committed by both austro hungarians and serbs although according to author lawrence sondhaus majority were committed by austro hungarians austro hungarians charged serb civilians with mutilating austro hungarian soldiers while undisciplined austro hungarian troops summarily executed hundreds of serb men and raped and murdered numerous women and children during battle which sondhaus ascribes to their hatred towards serbs for starting war many of those murdered by austro hungarians were victims of fellow south slavs croats and bosnian muslims serving in austro hungarian army serbian commanders noted that austro hungarians had committed numerous reprisal killings over course of battle general pavle jurisic sturm recounted legacy thumb right 180px monument to serbian soldiers killed in battle alt a large stone monument topped by an eagle although they succeeded in repelling austro hungarian attack serbs used up much of their ammunition during battle needing 6 5 million cartridges and 35 000 shells to prevail commander of serbian 2nd army general stepa stepanovic was promoted to rank of field marshal for his successful command in contrast austro hungarian commander oskar potiorek was humiliated in defeat and determined to launch a second invasion of serbia in september he was given permission to launch such an invasion provided that he not risk anything that might lead to a further fiasco defeat at cer mountain also affected morale of austro hungarian troops first aerial dogfight of war occurred during battle when serbian aviator miodrag tomic encountered an austro hungarian plane while performing a reconnaissance mission over enemy positions austro hungarian pilot fired at tomic with his revolver tomic managed to escape and within several weeks all serbian and austro hungarian planes were fitted with machine guns battle was first allied victory over central powers in first world war serbia s triumph on battlefield drew worldwide attention to country and won serbs sympathy from both neutral and allied countries a number of foreigners flocked to serbia in late 1914 offering financial political humanitarian and military aid articles in defence of serbia became more frequent in british press certain cultural circles in italy advocated entering war on allied side citing serbian and montenegrin battlefield successes serbian patriotic song march on drina was written by serbian composer stanislav binicki shortly after battle to commemorate victory binicki dedicated march to his favourite commander in army colonel milivoje stojanovic who was killed during fighting a yugoslav war film also titled march on drina was released
