performing and writing and less performing from guitarist johnny ramone bassist dee dee ramone wrote and sang more on this album than on previous albums and richie ramone became first drummer to write songs for band since tommy ramone band s original drummer album spawned four singles all of which charted on uk singles chart as well as other charts in addition to singles band promoted their album using a music video for something to believe in which parodied contemporary benefit concert live aid and hands across america lyrical themes of album range from band members frustrations with one another themselves and loved ones to more politically themed songs a rarity in ramones music my brain is hanging upside down bonzo goes to bitburg saw ramones criticizing u s president ronald reagan for his controversial visit to a military cemetery in bitburg germany despite johnny ramone disagreeing with song s message critically animal boy was not nearly as acclaimed as its predecessor too tough to die receiving generally mixed reviews critics were quick to point out that band had strayed far from their original style and were experimenting with several genres by this point however album charted in four different countries including united states and united kingdom background by 1985 there was a considerable amount of conflict between band members lead singer joey ramone went so far as to withdraw from writing process after having been a vital part of it on previous records leigh 2009 pp 258 261 joey recalled i d had it with ramones mental hell is about that part of it came from breaking up with then girlfriend angela other part of it was that i had really had it with band in later interviews however joey stated that it was not conflict that made him stop writing but rather that he d had ideas on bassist dee dee ramone claimed guitarist johnny ramone was reason for much of stress alleging that johnny did not want to do songs joey wrote for multiple reasons joey will present a great tune and johnny won t do it because it s this or it s that i m not going to play minor chords i m not going to play lead i m not going to come to england for god s sake that s why joey gotta do his solo album consequently somewhat recently added drummer richie ramone stepped up to writing process resulting in hit song somebody put something in my drink released as a single and later appearing on band s first compilation album ramones mania 1988 joey was always encouraging me to write songs explained richie but i didn t really need encouragement leigh 2009 p 261 this would be first time band featured drummer as a songwriter since original drummer tommy ramone with joey reasoning that he wanted to make richie feel like a part of band he felt past drummers had not been so much a part of band nor any good at writing and called richie a regular phil collins true 2005 ch 23 pp 10 11 johnny would later say album needed better production quality commenting that guitar moments did not sound like he had performed them producer on animal boy jean beauvoir johnny related was selected by label not us ramone 2012 ch animal boy p 1 marketing and promotion for album s front cover band wanted to take a photo with a monkey from bronx zoo george dubose originally took picture in zoo s monkey house but this photo was rejected by zoo director zoo would not allow band to borrow a chimp for photographing so dubose decided to try hiring zippy chimp a baby chimpanzee who had appeared on late night with david letterman and was successful resulting idea was to take picture of band standing in front of a gorilla cage with punk magazine founder legs mcneil in a gorilla costume richie is holding zippy and dubose had to refrain from flashing light so as not to frighten it however according to dubose chimp was already out of control zippy was getting wild dubose recalled he wasn t looking at camera and was fucking around with guys i wasn t getting picture because chimp was out of control so finally trainer goes up to zippy and whacks him across face lack of flash resulted in a warmer colored photograph which would be used as album s cover melnick melnick 2010 p 212

a good enough record single s jacket cover depicted president reagan giving a speech at bergen belsen concentration camp before going to bitburg but image was removed from later pressings british newspaper melody maker claimed it was removed because band received pressure from moral majority patriotic league of alamo and ss music video for something to believe in was a parody of both live aid

through beggars banquet ramone 2003 p 244 popoff 2010 p 971 lyrics and composition animal boy featured a range of genres and musical elements that were completely new to band and had not been featured on previous albums frequent use of synthesizers as well as minimalistic gimmicky lyrics caused critics and fans to feel as though ramones had strayed far away from their early raw punk sound despite animal boys predecessor too tough too die being acclaimed for band returning to their roots main problem with animal boy explained author everett true was that there was no longer one discernible ramones sound it sounds as disjointed as band members probably felt guitar parts could ve been played by anyone and richie s drumming was slipping away from tommy s original template ramones were turning into a 9 5 job night not day true 2005 ch 23 p 3 album begins with joey singing somebody put something in my drink written by richie who stated that he came up with lyrics while he was dating frankie valli s daughter and mistakenly drank after someone else in a nightclub rolling stone editor david fricke described joey s vocal performance in song as an exaggerated wino growl while johnny crushes chord changes with his trash compactor guitar animal boy and apeman hop were compositionally similar to hop from 1977 s rocket to russia but were described by true to be a thousandth as good true 2005 ch 23 p 4 love kills was inspired by alex cox biopic sid and nancy also known as sid and nancy love kills lyrics relate that couple will never be able to win with drugs despite fact that song s writer himself dee dee would later succumb to a heroin overdose animal boys fifth track she belongs to me is a ballad written by dee dee and beauvoir regarding unrequited love and features heavy use of synthesizers while earlier albums would have used a soft acoustic guitar or occasionally strings for ballad type songs side a of album concludes with crummy stuff played in a pop punk style with repetitive lyrics based on band s past of being chaotic and never meeting expectations side b begins with one of band s only politically based songs my brain is hanging upside down bonzo goes to bitburg lyrics encapsulated feelings of joey dee dee and while watching us president ronald reagan visit a military cemetery in bitburg west germany to pay tribute to victims of nazism in an interview with east coast rocker joey explained what reagan did was fucked up everybody told him not to go all his people told him not to go and he went anyway how can you fuckin forgive holocaust how can you say oh well it s ok now that s crazy true 2005 ch 21 p 30 dee dee also asserted that johnny had made band seem right winged it was first time we could make a statement to show we weren t prejudiced he explained we d just had these skinheads at our gigs punks walking around wearing swastikas johnny disliked song and refused to play song live saying that reagan was his favorite president of his lifetime mental hell next track and second written by joey dealt with his recent stress with band and his relationship with his girlfriend angela ending author dave thompson described

hanging upside down bonzo goes to bitburg rolling stone critic david fricke deemed album a reductionist masterpiece that proves they still have a lot more to give claiming that it rivaled previous albums leave home and rocket to russia eduardo rivadavia editor for allmusic later criticized album for using more modern commercial conventions and for its heavy use of synthesizers and keyboards in an attempt to reinvent band s style rivadavia specifically pointed to somebody put something in my drink which he claimed wastes an aggressive vocal performance from joey ramone by supporting it with a shamelessly polished synthesizer backing track and referred to something to believe in as unbearably soft he concluded that album had been a career low for ramones but still rated it three out of
