josiah willard gibbs february 11 1839 april 28 1903 was an american scientist who made significant theoretical contributions to physics chemistry and mathematics his work on applications of thermodynamics was instrumental in transforming physical chemistry into a rigorous inductive science together with james clerk maxwell and ludwig boltzmann he created statistical mechanics a term that he coined explaining laws of thermodynamics as consequences of statistical properties of ensembles of possible states of a physical system composed of many particles gibbs also worked on application of maxwell s equations to problems in physical optics as a mathematician he invented modern vector calculus independently of british scientist oliver heaviside who carried out similar work during same period in 1863 yale awarded gibbs first american doctorate in engineering after a three year sojourn in europe gibbs spent rest of his career at yale where he was a professor of mathematical physics from 1871 until his death working in relative isolation he became earliest theoretical scientist in united states to earn an international reputation and was praised by albert einstein as greatest mind in american history in 1901 gibbs received what was then considered highest honour awarded by international scientific community copley medal of royal society of london for his contributions to mathematical physics commentators and biographers have remarked on contrast between gibbs s quiet solitary life in turn of century new england and great international impact of his ideas though his work was almost entirely theoretical practical value of gibbs s contributions became evident with development of industrial chemistry during first half of 20th century according to robert a millikan in pure science gibbs did for statistical mechanics and thermodynamics what laplace did for celestial mechanics and maxwell did for electrodynamics namely made his field a well nigh finished theoretical structure biography family background thumb upright left willard gibbs as a young man gibbs was born in new haven connecticut he belonged to an old yankee family that had produced distinguished american clergymen and academics since 17th century he was fourth of five children and only son of josiah willard gibbs sr and his wife mary anna nee van cleve on his father s side he was descended from samuel willard who served as acting president of harvard college from 1701 to 1707 on his mother s side one of his ancestors was rev jonathan dickinson first president of college of new jersey later princeton university gibbs s given name which he shared with his father and several other members of his extended family derived from his ancestor josiah willard who had been secretary of province of massachusetts bay in 18th century bumstead 1928 elder gibbs was generally known to his family and colleagues as josiah while son was called willard cropper 2001 p 121 josiah gibbs was a linguist and theologian who served as professor of sacred literature at yale divinity school from 1824 until his death in 1861 he is chiefly remembered today as abolitionist who found an interpreter for african passengers of ship amistad allowing them to testify during trial that followed their rebellion against being sold as slaves education willard gibbs was educated at hopkins school and entered yale college in 1854 at age of 15 at yale gibbs received prizes for excellence in mathematics and latin and he graduated in 1858 near top of his class he remained at yale as a graduate student at sheffield scientific school at age 19 soon after his graduation from college gibbs was inducted into connecticut academy of arts and sciences a scholarly institution composed primarily of members of yale faculty rukeyser 1988 p 104 relatively few documents from period survive and it is difficult to reconstruct details of gibbs s early career with precision wheeler 1998 pp 23 24 in opinion of biographers gibbs s principal mentor and champion both at yale and in connecticut academy was probably astronomer and mathematician hubert anson newton a leading authority on meteors who remained gibbs s lifelong friend and confidant after death of his father in 1861 gibbs inherited enough money to make him financially independent rukeyser 1998 pp 120 142 recurrent pulmonary trouble young gibbs and his physicians were concerned that he might be susceptible to tuberculosis which had killed his mother he also suffered from astigmatism whose treatment was then still largely unfamiliar to so that gibbs had to diagnose himself and grind his own lenses wheeler 1998 pp 29 1988 p 143 though in later years he used glasses only for reading or other close work gibbs s delicate health and imperfect eyesight probably explain why he did not volunteer to fight in civil war of 1861 65 wheeler 1998 p 30 he was not conscripted and he remained at yale for duration of war rukeyser 1998 p 134 thumb upright alt portrait of willard gibbs as a yale college tutor gibbs during his time as a tutor at 1998 p 44 in 1863 gibbs received first doctorate of philosophy ph d

of 1866 67 in paris where gibbs attended lectures at sorbonne and college de france given by such distinguished mathematical scientists as joseph liouville and michel chasles wheeler 1998 p 40 having undertaken a punishing regime of study gibbs caught a serious cold and a doctor fearing tuberculosis advised him to rest on riviera where he and his sisters spent several months and where he made a full recovery wheeler 1998 p 41 moving to berlin gibbs attended lectures taught by mathematicians karl weierstrass and leopold kronecker as well as by chemist heinrich gustav magnus wheeler 1998 p 42

in natural sciences especially chemistry and thermodynamics rukeyser 1988 pp 158 161 gibbs returned to yale in june 1869 and briefly taught french to engineering students it was probably also around this time that he worked on a new design for a steam engine governor his last significant investigation in mechanical engineering wheeler 1998 pp 54 55 in 1871 he was appointed professor of mathematical physics at yale first such professorship in united states gibbs who had independent means and had yet to publish anything was assigned to teach graduate students exclusively and was hired

in 1873 his papers on geometric representation of thermodynamic quantities appeared in transactions of connecticut academy these papers introduced use of different type phase diagrams which were his favorite aids to imagination process when doing research rather than mechanical models such as ones that maxwell used in constructing his electromagnetic theory which might not completely represent their corresponding phenomena although journal had few readers capable of understanding gibbs s work he shared reprints with correspondents in europe and received an enthusiastic response from james clerk maxwell at cambridge maxwell even made with his own hands a clay model illustrating gibbs s construct he then produced two plaster casts of his model and mailed one to gibbs that cast is on display at yale physics department maxwell included a chapter on gibbs s work in next edition of his theory of heat published in 1875 he explained usefulness of gibbs s graphical methods in a lecture to chemical society of london and even referred to it in article on diagrams that he wrote for encyclopaedia britannica rukeyser 1988 p 201 prospects of collaboration between him and gibbs were cut short by maxwell s early death in 1879 aged 48 joke later circulated in new haven that only one man lived who could understand gibbs s papers that was maxwell and now he is dead rukeyser 1988 p 251 gibbs then extended his thermodynamic analysis to multi phase chemical systems i e to systems composed of more than one form of matter and considered a variety of concrete applications he described that research in a monograph titled on equilibrium of heterogeneous substances published by connecticut academy in two parts that appeared respectively in 1875 and 1878 that work which covers about three hundred pages and contains exactly seven hundred numbered mathematical equations cropper 2001 p 109 begins with a quotation from rudolf clausius that expresses what would later be called first and second laws of thermodynamics energy of world is constant entropy of world tends towards a maximum quoted in rukeyser 1988 p 233 gibbs s monograph rigorously and ingeniously applied his thermodynamic techniques to interpretation of physico chemical phenomena explaining and relating what had previously been a mass of isolated facts and observations wheeler 1998 ch v work has been described as principia of thermodynamics and as a work of practically unlimited scope it solidly laid foundation for physical chemistry wilhelm ostwald who translated gibbs s monograph into german referred to gibbs as founder of chemical energetics according to modern commentators gibbs continued to work without pay until 1880 when new johns hopkins university in baltimore maryland offered him

distinguished between dot and cross products of two vectors and introduced concept of similar work was carried out independently and at around same time by british mathematical physicist and engineer oliver heaviside gibbs sought to convince other physicists of convenience of vectorial approach over quaternionic calculus of william rowan hamilton which was then widely used by british scientists this led him in early 1890s to a controversy with peter guthrie tait and others in pages of nature gibbs s lecture notes on vector calculus were privately printed in 1881 and 1884 for use of his students and were later adapted by edwin bidwell wilson into a textbook vector analysis published in 1901 that book helped to popularize del notation that is widely used today in electrodynamics and fluid mechanics in other mathematical work he re discovered gibbs phenomenon in theory of fourier series which unbeknownst to him and to later scholars had been described fifty years before by an obscure english mathematician henry wilbraham thumb left alt plot of sine integral sine integral function which gives overshoot associated with gibbs phenomenon for fourier series of a step function on real line from 1882 to 1889 gibbs wrote five papers on physical optics in which he investigated birefringence and other optical phenomena and defended maxwell s electromagnetic theory of light against mechanical theories of lord kelvin and others in his work on optics just as much as in his work on thermodynamics gibbs deliberately avoided speculating about microscopic structure of matter and purposefully confined his research problems to those that can be solved from broad general principles and experimentally confirmed facts methods that he used were highly original and obtained results showed decisively correctness of maxwell s electromagnetic theory wheeler 1998 p 121 124 125 gibbs coined term statistical mechanics and introduced key concepts in corresponding mathematical description of physical systems including notions of chemical potential 1876 and statistical ensemble 1902 gibbs s derivation of laws of thermodynamics from statistical properties of systems consisting of many particles was presented in his highly influential textbook elementary principles in statistical mechanics published in 1902 a year before his death gibbs s retiring personality and intense focus on his work limited his accessibility to students his principal protege was edwin bidwell wilson who nonetheless explained that except in classroom i saw very little of gibbs he had a way toward end of afternoon of taking a stroll about streets between his study in old sloane laboratory and his home a little exercise between work and dinner and one might occasionally come across him at that time wilson 1931 gibbs did supervise doctoral thesis on mathematical economics written by irving fisher in 1891 after gibbs s death fisher financed publication of his collected works

congregational church at end of his freshman year and remained a regular attendant for rest of his life wheeler 1998 p 16 gibbs generally voted for republican candidate in presidential elections but like other mugwumps his concern over growing corruption associated with machine politics led him to support grover cleveland a conservative democrat in election of 1884 little else is known of his religious or political views which he mostly kept to himself gibbs did not produce a substantial personal correspondence and many of his letters were later lost or destroyed rukeyser 1988 pp 254 345

in his later years gibbs he was a careful investor and financial manager and at his death in 1903 his estate was valued at 100 000 roughly today for many years he served as trustee secretary and treasurer of his alma mater hopkins school wheeler 1998 p 144 us president chester a arthur appointed him as one of commissioners to national conference of electricians which convened in philadelphia

is available energy now called helmholtz free energy and ac capacity for entropy i e amount by which entropy can be increased without changing energy or volume gibbs s papers from 1870s introduced idea of expressing internal energy u of a system in terms of entropy s in addition to usual state variables of volume v pressure p and temperature t he also introduced concept of chemical potential of a given chemical species defined to be rate of increase in u associated with increase in number n of molecules of that species at constant entropy and volume thus it was gibbs who first combined first and second laws of thermodynamics by expressing infinitesimal change in internal energy du of a closed system in form where t is absolute temperature p is pressure ds is an infinitesimal change in entropy and dv is an infinitesimal change of volume last term is sum over all chemical species in a chemical reaction of chemical potential mi of ith species multiplied by infinitesimal change in number of moles of that species by taking legendre transform of this expression he defined concepts of enthalpy h and gibbs free energy g this compares to expression for helmholtz free energy a when gibbs free energy for a chemical reaction is negative reaction will proceed spontaneously when a chemical system is at equilibrium change in gibbs free energy is zero an equilibrium constant is simply related to free energy change when reactants are in their standard states chemical potential is usually defined as partial molar gibbs free energy gibbs also obtained what later came to be known as

formulated phase rule for number f of variables that may be independently controlled in an equilibrium mixture of c components existing in p phases phase rule is very useful in diverse areas such as metallurgy mineralogy and petrology it can also be applied to various research problems in physical chemistry wheeler 1998 p 79 statistical mechanics together with james clerk maxwell and ludwig boltzmann gibbs founded statistical mechanics a term that he coined to identify branch of theoretical physics that accounts for observed thermodynamic properties of systems in terms of statistics of ensembles a collection of many possible states of a system each assigned a certain probability he introduced concept of phase of a mechanical system he used concept to define canonical and grand canonical ensembles all related to gibbs measure thus obtaining a more general formulation of statistical properties of many particle systems than maxwell and boltzmann had achieved before him wheeler 1998 pp 155 159 according to henri poincare writing in 1904 even though maxwell and boltzmann had previously explained irreversibility of macroscopic physical processes in probabilistic terms one who has seen it most clearly in a book too little read because it is a little difficult to read is gibbs in his elementary principles of statistical mechanics gibbs s analysis of irreversibility and his formulation of boltzmann s h theorem and of hypothesis were major influences on mathematical physics of 20th century gibbs was well aware that application of equipartition theorem to large systems of classical particles failed to explain measurements of specific heats of both solids and gases and he argued that this was evidence of danger of basing thermodynamics on hypotheses about constitution of matter gibbs s own framework for statistical mechanics based on ensembles of macroscopically indistinguishable microstates could be carried over almost intact after discovery that microscopic laws of nature obey quantum rules rather than classical laws known to gibbs and to his contemporaries wheeler 1998 pp 160 161 his resolution of so called gibbs paradox about entropy of mixing of gases is now often cited as a of indistinguishability of particles required by quantum physics see e g vector analysis alt diagram representing cross product of two vectors right thumb diagram showing magnitude and direction of cross product of two vectors in notation introduced by gibbs british scientists including maxwell had relied on hamilton s quaternions in order to express dynamics of physical quantities like electric and magnetic fields having both a magnitude and a direction in three dimensional space following w k clifford in his elements of dynamic 1888 gibbs noted that product of quaternions could be separated into two parts a one dimensional scalar quantity and a three dimensional vector so that use of quaternions involved mathematical complications and redundancies that could be avoided in interest of simplicity and to facilitate teaching in his yale classroom notes he defined distinct dot and cross products for pairs of vectors and introduced now common notation for them through 1901 textbook vector analysis prepared by e b wilson from gibbs notes he was largely responsible for development of vector calculus techniques still used today in electrodynamics and fluid mechanics wheeler 1998 pp 107 108 110 while he was working on vector analysis in late 1870s gibbs discovered that his approach was similar to one that grassmann had taken in his multiple algebra letter by gibbs to victor schlegel quoted in wheeler 1998 pp 107 109 gibbs then sought to publicize grassmann s work stressing that it was both more general and historically prior to hamilton s quaternionic algebra to establish priority of grassmann s ideas gibbs convinced grassmann s heirs to seek publication in germany of essay theorie der ebbe und on tides that grassmann had submitted in 1840 to faculty at university of berlin in which he had first introduced notion of what would later be called a vector space linear space wheeler 1998 pp 113 116 as gibbs had advocated in 1880s and 1890s quaternions were eventually all but abandoned by physicists in favor of vectorial approach developed by him and independently by oliver heaviside gibbs applied his vector methods to determination of planetary and comet orbits he also developed concept of mutually reciprocal triads of vectors that later proved to be of importance in crystallography physical optics right thumb alt photograph showing by a calcite crystal a calcite crystal produces birefringence or double refraction of light a phenomenon which gibbs explained using maxwell s equations for electromagnetic phenomena though gibbs s research on physical optics is less well known today than his other work it made a significant contribution to classical electromagnetism by applying maxwell s equations to theory of optical processes such as birefringence dispersion and optical activity wheeler 1998 ch viii in that work gibbs showed that those processes could be accounted for by maxwell s equations without any special assumptions about microscopic structure of matter or about nature of medium in which electromagnetic waves were supposed to propagate so called luminiferous ether gibbs also stressed that absence of a longitudinal electromagnetic wave which is needed to account for observed properties of light is automatically guaranteed by maxwell s equations by virtue of what is now called their gauge invariance whereas in mechanical theories of light such as lord kelvin s it must be imposed as an ad hoc condition on properties of aether in his last paper on physical optics gibbs concluded that shortly afterwards electromagnetic nature of light was demonstrated by experiments of heinrich hertz in germany scientific recognition gibbs worked at a time when there was little tradition of rigorous theoretical science in united states his research was not easily understandable to his students or his colleagues and he made no effort to popularize his ideas or to simplify their exposition to make them more accessible his seminal work on thermodynamics was published mostly in transactions of connecticut academy a journal edited by his librarian brother in law which was little read in us and even less so in europe when gibbs submitted his long paper on equilibrium of heterogeneous substances to academy both elias loomis and h a newton protested that they did not understand gibbs s work at all but they helped to raise money needed to pay for typesetting of many mathematical symbols in paper several yale faculty members as well as business and professional men in new haven contributed funds for that purpose rukeyser 1998 pp 225 226 even though it had been immediately embraced by maxwell gibbs s graphical formulation of laws of thermodynamics only came into widespread use in mid 20th century with work of laszlo tisza and herbert callen wightman 1979 pp xiii lxxx according to james gerald crowther thumb alt image of burlington house london in 1873 burlington house site of royal society of london in 1873 on other hand gibbs did receive major honors then possible for an academic scientist in us he was elected to national academy of sciences in 1879 and received 1880 rumford prize from american academy of arts and sciences for his work on chemical thermodynamics he was also awarded honorary doctorates by princeton university and williams college in europe gibbs was inducted as honorary member of london mathematical society in 1892 and elected foreign member of royal society in 1897 he was elected as corresponding member of prussian and french academies of science and received honorary doctorates from universities of dublin erlangen and christiania now oslo royal society further honored gibbs in 1901 with copley medal then regarded as highest international award in natural sciences noting that he had been first to apply second law of thermodynamics to exhaustive discussion of relation between chemical electrical and thermal energy and capacity for external work gibbs who remained in new haven was represented at award ceremony by commander richardson clover us naval attache in london rukeyser 1998 p 345 in his autobiography mathematician gian carlo rota tells of casually browsing mathematical stacks of sterling library and stumbling on a handwritten mailing list attached to some of gibbs s course notes which listed over two hundred notable scientists of his day including poincare boltzmann david hilbert and ernst mach from this rota concluded that gibbs s work was better known among scientific elite of his day than published material suggests lynde wheeler reproduces that mailing list in an appendix to his biography of gibbs wheeler 1998 appendix iv that gibbs succeeded in interesting his european correspondents in his work is demonstrated by fact that his monograph on equilibrium of heterogeneous substances was translated into german then leading language for chemistry by wilhelm ostwald in 1892 and into french by henri louis le in 1899 wheeler 1998 pp 102 104 influence gibbs s most immediate and obvious influence was on physical chemistry and statistical mechanics two disciplines which he greatly helped to found during gibbs s lifetime his phase rule was experimentally validated by dutch chemist h w who showed how to apply it in a variety of situations thereby assuring it of widespread use in industrial chemistry gibbs s thermodynamics found many applications during early 20th century from electrochemistry to development of haber process for synthesis of ammonia when dutch physicist j d van der waals received 1910 nobel prize for his work on equation of state for gases and liquids he acknowledged great influence of gibbs s work on that subject max planck received 1918 nobel prize for his work on quantum mechanics particularly his 1900 paper on planck s law for quantized black body radiation that work was based largely on thermodynamics of kirchhoff boltzmann and gibbs planck declared that gibbs s name not only in america but in whole world will ever be reckoned among most renowned theoretical physicists of all times thumb upright alt

century saw publication of two influential textbooks that soon came to be regarded as founding documents of chemical thermodynamics both of which used and extended gibbs s work in that field these were thermodynamics and free energy of chemical processes 1923 by gilbert n lewis and merle randall and modern thermodynamics by methods of willard gibbs 1933 by edward a guggenheim gibbs s work on statistical ensembles as presented in his 1902 textbook has had a great impact in both theoretical physics and in pure mathematics according to mathematical physicist arthur wightman initially unaware of gibbs s contributions in that field albert einstein wrote three papers on statistical mechanics published between 1902 and 1904 after reading gibbs s textbook which was translated into german by ernst in 1905 einstein declared that gibbs s treatment was superior to his own and explained that he would not have written those papers if he had known gibbs s work gibbs s early papers on use of graphical methods in thermodynamics reflect a powerfully original understanding of what mathematicians would later call convex analysis wightman 1979 pp x xxxiv including ideas that according to barry simon lay dormant for about seventy five years important mathematical concepts based on gibbs s work on thermodynamics and statistical mechanics include gibbs lemma in game theory gibbs inequality in information theory as well as gibbs sampling in computational statistics development of vector calculus was gibbs s other great contribution to mathematics publication in 1901 of e b wilson s textbook vector analysis based on gibbs s lectures at yale did much to propagate use of vectorial methods and notation in both mathematics and theoretical physics definitively displacing quaternions that had until then been dominant in scientific literature at yale gibbs was also mentor to lee de forest who went on to invent triode amplifier and has been called father of radio seeger 1974 p 18 de forest credited gibbs s influence for realization that leaders in electrical development would be those who pursued higher theory of waves and oscillations and transmission by these means of intelligence and power another student of gibbs who played a significant role in development of radio technology was lynde wheeler gibbs also had an indirect influence on mathematical economics he supervised thesis of irving fisher who received first ph d in economics from yale in 1891 in that work published in 1892 as mathematical investigations in theory of value and prices fisher drew a direct analogy between gibbsian equilibrium in physical and chemical systems and general equilibrium of markets and he used gibbs s vectorial notation gibbs s protege edwin bidwell wilson became in turn a mentor to leading american economist and nobel laureate paul samuelson in 1947 samuelson published foundations of economic analysis based on his doctoral dissertation in which he used as epigraph a remark attributed to gibbs mathematics is a language samuelson later explained that in his understanding of prices his debts were not primarily to or but to great thermodynamicist willard gibbs of yale mathematician norbert wiener cited gibbs s use of probability in formulation of statistical mechanics as first great revolution of twentieth century physics and as a major influence on his conception of cybernetics wiener explained in preface to his book human use of human beings that it was devoted to impact of gibbsian point of view on modern life both through substantive changes it has made to working science and through changes it has made indirectly in our attitude to life in general commemoration thumb upright alt photograph of bronze memorial tablet of willard gibbs bronze memorial tablet originally

included gibbs s mathematical expression of phase rule for heterogeneous mixtures as well as a radar screen an oscilloscope waveform newton s apple and a small rendition of a three dimensional phase diagram gibbs s nephew ralph gibbs van name a professor of physical chemistry at yale was unhappy with rukeyser s biography in part because of her lack of scientific training van name had withheld family papers from her and after her book was published in 1942 to positive literary but mixed scientific reviews he tried to encourage gibbs s former students to produce a more technically oriented biography rukeyser s approach to gibbs was also sharply criticized by gibbs s former student and protege edwin wilson with van name s and wilson s encouragement physicist lynde wheeler published a new biography of gibbs in 1951 wheeler 1998 pp ix xiii both gibbs and rukeyser s biography of him figure prominently in poetry collection true north 1997 by stephanie strickland in fiction gibbs appears
