1988 pacific hurricane season was a pacific hurricane season that saw a below average amount of tropical cyclones form first time since 1981 it officially began may 15 in eastern pacific and june 1 in central pacific and lasted until november 30 these dates conventionally delimit period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in northeastern pacific ocean first named storm tropical storm aletta formed on june 16 and last named storm tropical storm miriam was previously named hurricane joan in atlantic ocean before crossing central america and re emerging in eastern pacific miriam continued westward and dissipated on november 2 season produced 23 tropical depressions of which 15 attained tropical storm status seven storms reached hurricane status three of which became major hurricanes strongest storm of season hurricane hector formed on july 30 to south of mexico and reached peak winds of 145 mph 230 km h category 4 status before dissipating over open waters on august 9 hector was never a threat to land tropical storm gilma was only cyclone in season to make landfall crossing hawaiian islands although there were numerous near misses gilma s hawaiian landfall was unusual but not unprecedented there were also two systems that successfully crossed over from atlantic aforementioned hurricane joan and hurricane debby which became tropical storm miriam and tropical depression seventeen e respectively three systems caused deaths tropical storm aletta caused one death in southwestern mexico hurricane uleki caused two drownings off coast of oahu as it passed by hawaiian islands and hurricane kristy caused 21 deaths in mexican states of oaxaca and seasonal summary left thumb 250px remnants of tropical storm gilma top left hurricane fabio center left and hurricane hector top right on august 3 1988 accumulated cyclone energy ace index for 1988 pacific hurricane season was 127 45 units 87 79 units from eastern pacific and 39 66 units from central pacific total tropical activity in season was below average there were 13 cyclones in eastern pacific as well as two in central of 15 cyclones one crossed from atlantic ocean into pacific and another moved from central pacific to western pacific in eastern pacific there were seven cyclones peaking as a tropical storm and six hurricanes of which two reached category 3 intensity or higher on saffir simpson hurricane scale a tropical storm and a major hurricane occurred in central pacific tropical storm gilma made only landfalls of season in hawaiian islands causing some rainfall but no direct deaths or damage occurred as a result of it these were only landfalls in season that were made which is unusual as most landfalls in eastern pacific occur on mexican coast this is due to closeness of mexican region to major source of tropical activity to west of central america hurricane uleki strongest hurricane in central pacific region during season caused two drownings in oahu and heavy waves hit coast of hawaiian islands tropical storm miriam last storm of season formed as a result of hurricane joan from atlantic and flooding resulted in parts of central america due to heavy rainfall systems tropical depression one e a tropical disturbance organized into first eastern pacific tropical depression of season on june 15 a convective band on north and west sides of system became well defined and anticyclonic outflow allowed for initial organization after forming depression tracked west southwestward and intensified due to disrupted outflow from a large air stream disturbance on june 16 strong convection with spiral banding developed over depression although it failed to strengthen further a low pressure system northwest of depression in combination with tropical storm aletta to northeast caused depression to weaken and it dissipated on june 18 tropical storm aletta a tropical wave moved off coast of africa and progressed westward through atlantic ocean and caribbean sea before crossing over central america on june 13 and emerging into warm waters of east pacific on june 14 shortly after satellite imagery showed good upper level outflow although cloud banding remained disorganized on june 16 broad circulation better organized on northeastern section with deep convection developing a tropical depression formed later that day about 200 miles 320 km to southeast of acapulco mexico it developed further as it moved northward toward southwest coast of mexico and had organized sufficiently to be named tropical storm aletta on june 17 cyclone drifted north northwest for next 36 hours before turning westward parallel to mexican coast storm began to lose its convection on june 19 and weakened into a tropical depression later that day depression weakened further into a weak low level circulation before dissipating on june 21 although aletta approached acapulco area of mexican coast it did not make landfall portion of coast affected by aletta received heavy rainfall unofficial reports state that one person died as a result of storm and storm produced some damage due to rainfall and flooding tropical storm bud satellite imagery first detected a low level circulation on june 20 associated with some heavy convection 200 miles 325 km south of mexico guatemala border and it intensified into a tropical depression cyclone moved northwest then west northwest over two days a 40 mph 65 km h wind report from a ship on june 21 allowed depression to be upgraded to tropical storm bud later that day for next day low level circulation moved away from its deep convection dissipating near acapulco mexico a portion of bud remaining over land may have been part of reason for lack of strengthening of cyclone tropical depression four e a system developed in eastern pacific and later strengthened into a tropical depression on july 1 when it obtained a better defined low level circulation center was exposed with little convection on northeast side due to shear aloft system moved to northwest while shear continued to move deep convection of cyclone to southwest of its center of circulation circulation completely lacked deep convection late on july 2 although it continued to have a well defined low level center depression drifted slowly northward located south of baja california before dissipating just south of peninsula on july 4 with no circulation or deep convection detected a small amount of associated rainfall affected baja california as cyclone passed near peninsula hurricane carlotta a tropical wave moved off western coast of africa on june 23 and for next two weeks moved through tropical waters of atlantic ocean and later crossed central america it began developing further when it entered pacific ocean and became a dense area of moisture and cloudiness wave developed into a disturbance on july 8 and attained tropical depression status in afternoon on july 8 south of mexico after entering a favorable area of warm waters depression strengthened to tropical storm carlotta on july 9 carlotta continued to develop reached peak strength and developed into hurricane carlotta on july 11 during duration of storm carlotta was not considered a hurricane however after post season reanalysis carlotta s strength was upgraded to minimal hurricane status as it moved into less favorable conditions it lost strength and weakened to a tropical storm on july 12 carlotta began to lose its deep convection and weakened into a tropical depression on july 13 as it moved into cooler waters it later moved west southwest and dissipated on july 15 tropical storm daniel a tropical wave moved off coast of northwestern africa on july 4 and moved through tropical regions of northern atlantic and caribbean sea without indication of development tropical disturbance crossed central america on july 14 and from then until july 18 westward motion decreased as convection and organization increased over warm waters it developed into a tropical depression on july 19 and into tropical storm daniel southwest of southern tip of baja california on july 20 a high pressure system over western united states and northern mexico forced daniel and an upper level low on parallel west northwest paths daniel stayed generally same strength for next few days reaching peak strength on july 23 daniel declined into a tropical depression on july 25 and dissipated on july 26 tropical storm emilia on july 15 a tropical wave exited africa and crossed atlantic ocean it crossed into pacific ocean on july 24 developing convection and outflow on july 27 it organized into a tropical depression off southwest coast of mexico continuing generally westward thunderstorm activity fluctuated and slowly developing it intensified into tropical storm emilia on july 29 storm attained peak winds of 70 mph 110 km h on july 30 although wind shear and interaction with nearby tropical storm fabio prevented further intensification low level circulation was located along northwest edge of deepest convection it became disorganized and difficult to locate on satellite imagery and soon circulation was exposed from thunderstorms on august 1 emilia weakened to tropical depression status and late on august 2 last advisory was issued as system had become very disorganized with minimal convection its remnants were tracked for next few days and although some deep convection returned momentarily system s convection soon disappeared hurricane fabio a well organized itcz disturbance with deep convection organized further over northeastern pacific ocean on july 28 it developed into a tropical depression later that day while southwest of southern tip of baja california position of fabio s formation was much further south and west than where most tropical cyclones form during same time period depression moved westward while gradually strengthening and it developed into tropical storm fabio on july 29 it intensified further over next few days and it intensified into a hurricane on july 31 system increased its speed as it steadily strengthened further a trough turned storm west northwestward on august 3 satellite estimates indicated that fabio reached its maximum intensity later on august 3 with a well defined eye with very deep convection surrounding it central pacific hurricane center issued a tropical storm watch for big island on august 4 due to threatening west northwest turn towards it however retreat of a trough later turned fabio back to west and cphc discontinued tropical storm watch on august 5 fabio s good upper level conditions later weakened and began to lose its convection over cooler waters fabio quickly weakened and it weakened into a tropical storm again later on august 5 and back to a depression on august 6 depression turned west northwestward again on august 8 but fabio dissipated on august 9 as cyclone moved near hawaiian islands heavy rainfall fell across chain peaking at near papa on island of hawaii tropical depression nine e a tropical depression developed in eastern pacific on july 28 forecast to be absorbed by a very close nearby depression later tropical storm gilma depression moved northward although in unfavorable conditions cyclone weakened as depression to southwest strengthened further limited deep convection developed with system although cyclone continued in unfavorable conditions with shearing visible satellite imagery later showed a very weak system and storm dissipated on july 29 tropical storm gilma a wave that previously moved through atlantic from northwest coast of africa crossed over central america into pacific on july 17 or july 18 on july 19 this disturbance was 700 miles 1125 km to southeast of developing tropical storm daniel system moved westward for following week without any signs of intensification however on july 26 and 27 system appeared to be strengthening due to a banding pattern by july 28 convection underwent further organization with some weak outflow high in storm it developed into a tropical depression later on july 28 much further west then most east pacific storms develop at for next day cyclone remained fairly stationary but began to strengthen over warm waters on july 29 depression strengthened into tropical storm gilma based on satellite imagery limited intensification followed due to shear high in storm it weakened a tropical depression again on july 30 due to weakness depicted in satellite imagery gilma then moved west northwestward through northeast pacific depression skirted hawaiian islands but dissipated near oahu on august 3 on hawaiian islands there were no direct damage or deaths although some rainfall occurred on islands hurricane hector a tropical depression formed on july 30 while 400 miles 645 km south of acapulco mexico depression tracked west northwestward becoming tropical storm hector on july 31 its west northwest motion continued due to an area of high pressure to its north and hector intensified into a hurricane on august 2 based on satellite data hurricane is estimated to have reached its peak intensity of 145 mph 235 km h on august 3 this made hector a category 4 hurricane on saffir simpson hurricane scale which was strongest storm of season hector began to move due west on august 5 and it had already begun weakening storm continued westward increasing its forward speed on august 6 it had appeared hector had strengthened but steadily weakened afterwards and finally dissipated on august 9 while 650 miles 1 045 km east of hilo hawaii hector never a threat to land hurricane iva a wave that first came off northwest coast of africa moved through atlantic before entering east pacific on august 4 wave developed more organized convection when it entered region and it turned into a tropical depression on august 5 while 165 miles 270 km south of oaxaca mexico it developed into tropical storm iva on august 6 iva turned on a west northwestward course and continued strengthening before it developed into a hurricane on august 7 cyclone moved northwestward after becoming a hurricane and satellites estimate it reached peak intensity on august 8 on same day iva passed within 50 miles 80 km of socorro island winds of 45 mph 70 km h were reported on island along with moderate rain storm moved through cooler waters for next day and began to weaken iva declined into a tropical storm again on august 9 and by august 10 cyclone lost its deep convection along with organization it intensified into a tropical depression again on august 11 and moved southwest due to a high pressure before dissipating on august 13 for unknown reasons iva was retired from lists of eastern pacific storm names but it was probably to avoid confusion with hurricane iwa of 1982 pacific season which was itself retired due to its damage in hawaii name was replaced with ileana for 1994 tropical depression thirteen e a tropical depression formed on august 12 with movement towards west northwest it continued toward west northwest near circulation of tropical storm iva low level circulation of cyclone was displaced to east of deep convection and system moved to northwest depression lost much of its convection later on august 13 and it had a less defined center cyclone turned to south and lost its associated deep convection some weak convection redeveloped near center but depression dissipated later on august 14 tropical storm john a disturbance that passed off northwestern african coast on august 3 crossed atlantic ocean before entering into pacific a tropical depression formed in east pacific on august 16 150 miles 240 km southwest of manzanillo mexico based on satellite estimates cyclone progressed slowly northwestward and intensified tropical storm john on august 17 less than 24 hours after its formation john continued northwest for a short while before low level center of circulation had been exposed john degenerated to a tropical depression on august 18 due to a lack of convection made a loop while less than 100 miles 160 km south of southern tip of baja california it shortly became a little better organized after completing loop on august 20 but john dissipated on august 21 southwest of baja california due to shearing and cold waters its remnants continued northwestward parallel to southwest coast of baja california john caused no reported deaths or damage tropical depression fifteen e on august 26 a disturbance south of baja california organized into tropical depression fifteen e initially system moved northwest towards cooler waters as location of low level circulation was to southwest of deep convection associated with cyclone center drifted to east of small area of concentrated convection and its intensity remained steady it weakened and became loosely defined due to upper level wind shear and storm lost all of its convection before dissipating and degenerating into a low level swirl hurricane uleki towards end of august tropical activity in itcz southeast of hawaiian islands began to be monitored on august 28 this tropical disturbance organized into a tropical depression as it was located about 800 miles 1 285 km southeast of big island it intensified at a fair rate and intensified tropical storm uleki next day it continued to strengthen and reached hurricane intensity on august 31 it moved slowly west northwest until steering currents collapsed on september 1 now a category 3 hurricane uleki slowly edged north towards hawaiian islands after looping uleki resumed its westward path on september 4 its stalling in ocean had weakened it and hurricane passed midway between johnston island and french frigate shoals uleki crossed dateline on september 8 it turned slightly to north and meandered in open pacific days until it dissipated on september 14 as uleki drifted towards hawaiian islands tropical storm watches were issued for oahu kauai and niihau on september 3 in addition reconnaissance missions were flown into hurricane uleki caused heavy surf on hawaiian islands that being its only significant effect this heavy surf flooded southeastern runway on midway island and produced two drownings on oahu nineteen people were also rescued from rough surf with five to six foot 1 5 to 1 8 meter waves off coast of beaches in hawaii hurricane kristy a tropical wave passed off northwestern coast of africa on august 6 it did not develop as it passed through atlantic ocean until august 19 when convection began to form on august 20 disturbance turned into tropical depression six in atlantic basin it passed from leeward islands up to central caribbean until it dissipated on august 23 as it passed over central america disturbance had little remaining convection however convection associated with system began to organize when it entered pacific and it strengthened into a tropical depression on august 29 while located 300 miles 485 km south southeast of acapulco mexico later that day depression intensified into tropical storm kristy based on ship reports of tropical storm force winds kristy strengthened into a hurricane on august 31 based solely on satellite imagery hurricane kristy had short lifespan though and weakened to a tropical storm on september 2 easterly shear associated with an anticyclone south of baja california which caused kristy s convection to be forced west of low level center of system and therefore weakened it kristy weakened further to a depression on september 3 and weak steering currents allowed cyclone to remain stationary on september 4 loop following day and then began to move eastward depression dissipated on september 6 weakening to a low level swirl kristy caused heavy rains and flooding in mexican states of chiapas and oaxaca although storm passed relatively close to coast no tropical cyclone warnings and watches were required as storm remained offshore however kristy produced heavy rains and widespread flooding in mexican states of chiapas and oaxaca as a result several rivers overflowed their banks thousands of tourists were stranded from beaches at least 21 deaths were attributed to kristy 16 in oaxaca and 5 in chiapas more than 20 000 people in former were evacuated from their homes consequently a state of emergency was declared outer rainbands of kristy delayed rescue of victims of a brazilian made aircraft that crashed west of sierra madre occidental mountain range no official damage figures were reported by mexican government tropical depression seventeen e debby remnants of hurricane debby moved over mountainous areas of mexico passing into pacific from pacific coast of mexico near manzanillo disturbance moved towards north northwest and organized into a tropical depression on september 6 just south of gulf of california cyclone remained stationary due to weak low level steering currents later drifting to north northwest with an area of deep convection causing rain on mexican coast it later moved to northwest with partial exposure of center of system and with some shear still affecting it cyclone continued to have shear over system which caused it not to strengthen and its movement became nearly stationary after remaining stationary longer system dissipated as a low level swirl tropical depression eighteen e a disturbance organized and based on satellite imagery it strengthened into a tropical depression on september 12 center of circulation remained on eastern fringe of its deep convection and storm moved west or west northwestward on september 13 depression underwent shearing while its low level circulation center had only a small amount of deep convection associated with it cyclone became poorly defined and its movement turned stationary on september 14 low level circulation of system remained visible even though it weakened due to shearing little deep convection remained associated with system and cyclone stayed stationary depression having no remaining convection and having become just a low level cloud swirl dissipated on september 15 tropical storm wila a tropical depression formed on september 21 as an area of deep convection cyclone organized slowly though drifting slowly initially west then to northwest however depression recurved northeast due to a trough as cyclone moved northeast system strengthened as indicated by an air force reconnaissance plane showing tropical storm force winds it therefore intensified into tropical storm wila on september 25 wila however weakened within a day and therefore became a tropical depression remnant low of wila produced some heavy rain over hawaiian islands on september 26 and 27 hurricane lane a wave moved westward off coast of africa passed through caribbean sea and into itcz of eastern pacific on september 20 system developed organized deep convection and strengthened into a tropical depression on september 21 while 300 miles 485 km southeast of acapulco mexico as low level circulation organized further in depression it intensified into tropical storm lane later on september 21 lane developed further with an upper level outflow pattern and cyclone turned into a hurricane on september 23 later on september 23 and on september 24 an eye appeared on satellite imagery a trough to northwest of lane disturbed its upper level outflow on september 24 diminishing convection and loss of its eye caused lane to weaken to a tropical storm on september 27 and into a depression on september 28 later on september 28 cyclone moved into cooler waters and lane lost nearly all of its deep convection it weakened into a low level swirl and lane dissipated on september 30 lane caused no reported casualties or damage tropical depression twenty e remnants of atlantic basin tropical storm isaac moved into eastern pacific these remnants underwent better organization and strengthened into a tropical depression on october 11 south of baja california strong vertical southwesterly wind shear affected cyclone with center of circulation later seen on west side of lessening amount of deep convection system remained poorly organized and had trouble strengthening to this continual poor organization as it moved westward system could not be located on satellite imagery and therefore dissipated on october 12 tropical storm miriam atlantic hurricane hurricane joan survived passage over central america and entered pacific although greatly weakened following policy at time joan was renamed miriam miriam brought heavy rains to parts of central america isolated flooding and mudslides happened although casualties and damage reports are not available of rain fell in lazaro cardenas mexico as a result of miriam and former joan guatemala s ports along its pacific coast were closed and people in el salvador were evacuated from low lying areas due to storm miriam then turned away from central america and weakened to a depression depression survived for over a week until it dissipated on october 30 tropical depression miriam s remnants regenerated next day and miriam finally dissipated on november 2 storm names following names were used to name storms that formed in northeastern pacific ocean during 1988 retired names were announced by world meteorological organization in spring of 1989 names not retired from this list were used again in 1994 season this is same list used in 1982 season aletta bud carlotta daniel emilia fabio gilma hector iva john kristy lane miriam norman unused olivia unused paul
