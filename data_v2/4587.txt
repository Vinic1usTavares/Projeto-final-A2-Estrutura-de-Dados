nicholas de balmyle d 1319 x 1320 also called nicholas of st andrews was a scottish administrator and prelate in late 13th century and early 14th century a graduate of an unknown university he served his earliest years as a clergyman at st andrews moving on to hold churches in lothian as well as deputising as official to two archdeacons of lothian in late summer and in autumn of 1296 between death of bishop william fraser and arrival of new bishop of st andrews william de lamberton nicholas was placed in charge of diocese of st andrews as official nicholas thereafter can be found exercising a senior role in scottish affairs and by early 1301 he was chancellor of scotland in his late 60s or more probably his 70s by this stage nicholas was an extremely old man yet in 1307 he became bishop of dunblane he held this position until his death in either 1319 or 1320 background and early life thumb modern ruins of st andrews cathedral although it is not known where nicholas attended university it is known that much of his early life was spent in and around this location it is highly unlikely that nicholas was born later than 1230s as he was styled magister by 1259 indicating that by that date he possessed a master s degree it was rare for someone under twenty years old or even older to have such a qualification in this period university or universities he attended are not known shead balmyle nicholas d 1319 20 until 1295 nicholas was referred to as nicholas of st andrews de sancto andrea but in february of that year he began to be called de balmyle one source referring to him as de de sancto andrea de balmyle called de watt dictionary p 23 it is probable that he adopted de sancto andrea when he finished training at st andrews and went elsewhere and that he dropped it in 1295 when he moved back nicholas apparent surname de balmyle points to an association with balmyle near in region where gowrie and angus border though that is only one of two possible locations shead balmyle nicholas d 1319 20 watt dictionary pp 23 4 early career as a graduate nicholas is first found active at st andrews in entourage of gamelin bishop of st andrews in 1259 he does not appear very often in any witness lists during following few decades but does appear along with other st andrews clerics witnessing a charter of william earl of mar at falkland on 21 january 1268 he disappeared from records until found as official to archdeacon of lothian 1283 x 1285 it is possible that during this period he left scotland for further study position of official was held under absentee archdeacon of lothian adam de gullane and afterwards archdeacon william frere and was probably held along with post of vicar of haddington latter he definitely held by 1295 watt dictionary p 24 watt murray fasti ecclesiae pp 400 1 nicholas is found as official in a document dating certainly between 1273 and 1285 a document which can probably be more precisely dated to between 1283 and 1285 namely because one nicholas de lochmaben is attested as official of archdeacon of lothian in 1283 see watt dictionary p 24 watt murray fasti ecclesiae p 424 he was pastor of church of calder comitis

was nicholas who was chosen to be official of diocese and to administer it during vacancy he performed this function until return to scotland from france of new bishop william de lamberton shead balmyle nicholas d 1319 20 watt dictionary p 24 after his return in august 1299 lamberton was guardian of scotland and nicholas became his close associate nicholas can be seen to have benefited as a result he became chancellor of scotland by 30 january 1301 this is first point in time in which he is attested in this office dowden bishops p 201 shead balmyle nicholas d 1319 20 watt dictionary p 24

four scottish envoys sent to canterbury for abortive talks with english and french in next few years nicholas activities are difficult to trace but he was probably involved in much diplomatic activity including perhaps having a hand in drawing up brief which baldred bisset would later deliver to pope in interests of scottish independence it was probably in this time too that nicholas became a clerk at arbroath abbey and perhaps a canon of dunblane cathedral watt dictionary pp 23 4 nicholas may have remained as chancellor until 1305 his accession as chancellor by 1301 corresponded with a renewed emphasis on authority of king john in government documents becoming chancellor by 1301 in words of geoffrey barrow meant that he became one of handful of key men who directed national struggle barrow
