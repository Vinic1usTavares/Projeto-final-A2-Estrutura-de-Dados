lifestyle of which tono is not a part alienates him and drives him to find a more traditional woman tham seong chee a political scientist from singapore views her as a weak willed character unwilling to act before meeting hartono again and even then unable to solve her marital difficulties with tono he also sees her as being by her own values which are incompatible with those held by general indonesian populace indonesian writer and literary critic goenawan mohamad views her as driven in part by stress placed on her by her husband s expectations rohayah rohayah also known by pseudonyms

although two fall deeply in love yah decides to leave tono and move to new caledonia because she feels that society would view doctor poorly if he married a former prostitute tham sees yah as being a good match for tono in personality as she shows a willingness to serve as traditional wife american scholar of indonesian literature harry aveling writes that yah s employment as a prostitute was likely a capitulation by pane to cultural constraints indonesian readers at time would not have accepted tono having an affair with someone of same socio economic status mohamad describes her as being fatalistic and notes that she downplays her past by saying that any of a thousand girls in tanjung priok could tell same story he found her touching without being melodramatic and notes that yah was first prostitute featured portrayed sympathetically in an indonesian work hartono hartono is tini s lover from university he was also tono s friend after hearing that tini enjoys partying he approaches her and they begin dating after they have sex he breaks off their relationship through a letter he then drops out of university and becomes involved with nascent nationalist movement

political character in novel women s group various members of tini s women s group including mrs mrs padma mrs rusdio and aminah aid her in planning different social events mrs rusdio is tini s friend from university aminah was one of tini s competitors for tono and enjoys interfering in couple s lives other two disapprove of tini s and her lack of attention to tono servants tono and tini are served by two men karno and abdul karno tono s loyal manservant dislikes tini and considers her overly emotional abdul is their driver who usually drives tono to meet his patients influences bakri siregar an indonesian literary critic associated with socialist literary organisation lekra notes that pane was influenced in part by sigmund freud s theories on psychoanalysis he writes that it is most evident in dialogue especially that of tini taum while noting psychoanalysis influence notes that novel follows individual characters stream of consciousness which gives reader a greater understanding of characters and their conflicts novel was written in middle of writer s career and two of pane s earlier short stories barang tiada berharga worthless thing 1935 and lupa forget 1936 contained plot points used in belenggu barang tiada berharga also dealt with a doctor and his wife named and who were characterised in a similar manner as sukartono and sumartini while lupa introduced main character sukartono as reigning dutch colonial government forbade involvement of politics in literature pane minimised explicit effects of colonialism in novel taum writes that belenggu theme of contrasting modernity and traditionalism may have been influenced by or even written as a response to sutan takdir alisjahbana s 1936 novel with sails unfurled which dealt with a similar theme but fully supported modernisation style belenggu uses ellipses and internal monologues heavily to represent main characters turmoil dutch scholar of indonesian literature a teeuw calls it a three pronged interior monologue noting that novel has minimal use of descriptive passages and dialogue unlike works published by balai pustaka belenggu does not provide full exposition instead it only explicitly states key points and leaves rest for reader to interpret thus inviting more active participation siregar notes that characters are introduced one at a time almost as if novel were a film he writes that as a result at times transition between characters is unclear unlike authors of earlier works published by balai pustaka pane does not use old malay proverbs he instead uses similes another way in which he writes differently from earlier writers is by limiting his use of dutch language earlier writers such as abdul muis and sutan takdir alisjahbana had used dutch words representative of dominant colonial power to illustrate intellectualism of main characters instead in belenggu pane relies on loanwords with a glossary of difficult or uncommon words provided with early editions of novel siregar wrote that pane s language reflected actual use of indonesian well symbolism according to taum title belenggu reflects inner conflicts main characters face that limit their actions taum points to climax of novel in which rohayah refuses to marry sukartono because if she were to marry him he would lose face because of her past as a prime example of these limitations siregar notes that such a reading is supported by dialogue between hartono and sukartono in which they note that humans are inherently held back by their reminiscences of past uncommonly for indonesian literature during this time period belenggu chapters were labelled with only a number other works such as abdul muis 1928 novel salah asuhan wrong upbringing gave both a number and subtitle to chapters according to taum this change in style represents a stream of consciousness as opposed to earlier style which kept chapters separate themes general teeuw notes that unlike most indonesian novels at time belenggu did not feature a good and pure protagonist in a struggle against an evil antagonist or present conflict and differences between generations it also eliminated common themes of forced marriage and youth s nonacceptance of adat traditional culture instead it showed a love triangle common in western literature but then unheard of in indonesian literature without an indication of whether any characters were good evil right or wrong teeuw writes that novel portrayed interior struggle of a new kind of human one who is result of a mixture of eastern and western cultures according to christie earlier themes in indonesian literature such as feudalism and forced marriage are not intrinsically significant to character s lives in belenggu living in past a main theme found in belenggu reflected in title is if one is shackled to past then one cannot flourish taum notes that this is reflected in hartono s dialogue to tini as follows mengapa mengapa zaman jangan jangan nanti sebagai angan angan belenggu ini apa pada zaman dulu why not why be hung up on past don t blow it out of proportion don t complicate simple things your thoughts will be as if they are shackled forget it kill those reveries release these shackles why be hung up on past several further instances have been expounded by critics taum notes that yah s guilt over her past as a prostitute leads her to unfounded fear that tono would leave her if their relationship were known her guilt ultimately causes their separation while tono feels nostalgic for past in which he felt happier balfas notes that a factor driving tono from tini is latter s former relationship with hartono due to her guilt over affair she is unable to express her love for doctor siregar writes that such a theme is reflected in dialogue between tono and hartono from which he suggests novel derives its title balfas writes that there is no solution to human problems presented in novel modernity and traditionalism taum indicates that belenggu presents modernity and traditionalism as a binary system contrasting new with old for example sukartono a doctor a position considered a symbol of modernity is obsessed with past including his schoolmate rohayah and prefers traditional kroncong music over modern genres through contrast of sukartono and his ultra modern emancipatory wife sumartini pane emphasises that modernity does not necessarily bring happiness aveling agrees writing that conflict arises over tini s refusal to mother her husband as expected from a traditional wife according to taum tono wishes for tini to perform traditional duties such as removing his shoes however tini refuses to do so and instead keeps herself busy with social activities this need for a wife who behaves as he wishes ultimately becomes a factor in his falling for yah who does everything expected from a traditional wife however in end neither modern nor traditional values alone are enough to guarantee happiness intellectuals in society christie notes that belenggu contains a strong sense of alienation he writes that characters seem to be part of a society suspended in a vacuum without an explicit connection to colonialism but also unable to come to terms with traditional mores christie describes sukartono s relationship with rohayah as symbolic of attempts by intellectual to engage with masses through a shared popular culture but ultimately failing taum notes such a thing occurring in a scene where tini plays a sonata by ludwig van beethoven on her violin in front of a group of regular citizens who prefer local music teeuw agrees writing that novel shows a psychological burden borne by native intellectuals who found themselves physically fit for a modern existence but mentally unprepared for transition from a traditional lifestyle to a more modern one he notes that sceptical modern intellectual a category in which he includes tono and tini was uncommon in local literature at time tham sees underlying message of yah s refusal to marry tono as that morals and ethical standards are frequently beyond ken of intellect reason or rationality indicating that intellectuals may not be able to collaborate effectively with masses johns notes that although tono and tini are thought to be decisive persons by society they are actually confused and unsure release belenggu was submitted to balai pustaka for publication in 1938 but was accepted because of its perceived dissonance with public morality particularly its portrayal of adultery and prostitution key components of plot as acceptable eventually belenggu was picked up by poedjangga baroe and published in a serial format in three editions between april and june 1940 belenggu was only novel published by magazine and first indonesian psychological novel in 1969 belenggu received first annual literary prize from government of indonesia along with marah rusli s sitti nurbaya 1922 salah asuhan and achdiat karta mihardja s atheist 1949 belenggu has been translated into multiple languages in 1962 mandarin as zhi gu in 1964 russian as in 1965 malay under original title in 1989 english as shackles and in 1993 german as in russian translation was done by a pavlenko english translation published by lontar foundation was done by john h mcglynn german translation was done by renate indonesian language edition has seen twenty one printings reception belenggu received a mixed reception upon its release proponents of novel stated that it was daring as it dealt with themes based on societal realities for example journalist s k trimurti wrote that novel clearly reflected issues faced by highly educated indonesians in dealing with traditional culture however opponents of novel dismissed it as pornographic emphasising traditionally taboo acts like prostitution and adultery december 1940 issue of poedjangga baroe included comments from several other writers and literary critics including alisjahbana hb jassin karim halim and s djojopoespito alisjahbana wrote that novel was fatalistic and defeatist as he felt it did not portray freedom of spirit necessary for people to choose their own destiny he decried plot as lacking causality jassin found characters to resemble caricatures as their emotions were overly melodramatic but considered novel representative of works yet to come halim wrote that belenggu represented a new school in indonesian literature with new language and new stories djojopoespito decried book s language which he did not consider smooth and plotlines which he found uninteresting according to teeuw initial mixed reception was due in part to indonesian readers accustomed to idealised literature being shocked by realistic portrayals in belenggu later reviews have generally been more positive in 1955 johns wrote that belenggu was a great advance on any previous work with which indonesian novel came to maturity he praises structure plot and presentation siregar writing in 1964 praised novel s diction noting that pane handled technical discussions especially well jassin wrote in 1967 that although he found characters still came across as caricatures novel was capable of making readers stop and think about modern conditions in 1969 indonesian writer and literary critic ajip rosidi wrote that novel was more interesting than earlier works because of its multi interpretable ending indonesian writer and literary critic muhammad balfas wrote in 1976 that belenggu was in every respect best novel of pre war indonesian literature in his 1980 book on indonesian literature teeuw wrote that despite several flaws in psychological portrayal of main characters belenggu was only novel from before indonesian national revolution in which a western reader would feel truly involved he also called novel pane s greatest contribution to indonesia literature tham writing in 1981 described novel as best reflection of then growing consciousness that western values such as individualism and intellectualism contradicted traditional values notes referencesfootnotesbibliography category 1940 novels category psychological novels category novels set in indonesia category
