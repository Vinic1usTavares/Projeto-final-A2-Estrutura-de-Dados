thumb saffron crocus flowers represented as small red tufts are gathered by two women in a fragmentary minoan fresco from excavation of akrotiri on aegean island of santorini human cultivation and use of saffron spans more than 3 500 years and extends across cultures continents and civilizations saffron a spice derived from dried stigmas of saffron crocus crocus sativus has through history remained among world s most costly substances with its bitter taste hay like fragrance and slight metallic notes rich saffron has been used as a seasoning fragrance dye and medicine wild precursor of domesticated saffron crocus was likely crocus cartwrightianus which originated in crete or central asia c and c are other possible sources although some doubts remain on its origin it is believed that saffron originated in iran persia however greece and mesopotamia have also been suggested as possible region of origin of this plant saffron crocus is now a triploid that is self incompatible and male sterile it undergoes aberrant meiosis and is hence incapable of independent sexual reproduction all propagation is by vegetative multiplication via manual divide and set of a starter clone or by interspecific hybridisation if c sativus is a mutant form of c cartwrightianus then it may have emerged via plant breeding which would have selected for elongated stigmas in late bronze age crete humans may have bred c cartwrightianus specimens by screening for specimens with abnormally long stigmas resulting saffron crocus was documented in a 7th century bc assyrian botanical reference compiled under ashurbanipal and it has since been traded and used over course of four millennia and has been used as treatment for some ninety disorders c sativus clone was slowly propagated throughout much of eurasia later reaching parts of north africa north america and oceania global production on a by mass basis is now dominated by iran which accounts for some 90 of annual harvest etymology it immediately stems from latin word via 12th century old french term safran french was borrowed from arabic za faran za faran and ultimately from persian which literally means golden leaves latin form is also source of catalan italian but portuguese and spanish come from arabic az latin term crocus is certainly a semitic loanword it is adapted from aramaic form via arabic term and greek intermediate krokos krokos which once again signifies yellowish sanskrit might be ultimately origin or in some way related to semitic term minoan and greco roman thumb this inaccurate reconstruction of a minoan fresco from knossos in crete depicts a man which should be a monkey gathering crocus harvest crocus cartwrightianus is a species of flowering plant in family iridaceae native to greece and crete c cartwrightianus is presumed wild progenitor of domesticated triploid crocus sativus saffron crocus saffron is triploid form of a species found in eastern greece crocus cartwrightianus it probably appeared first in crete an origin in western or central asia although often suspected has been disproved by botanical research saffron played a significant role in greco roman pre classical period bracketed by 8th century bc and 3rd century ad first known image of saffron in pre greek culture is much older and stems from bronze age a saffron harvest is shown in knossos palace frescoes of minoan crete which depict flowers being picked by young girls and monkeys one of these fresco sites is located in 3 building at akrotiri on aegean island of santorini ancient greeks knew it as thera these frescoes likely date from 16th or 17th century bc but may have been produced anywhere between 3000 and 1100 bc they portray a minoan goddess supervising plucking of flowers and gleaning of stigmas for use in manufacture of what is possibly a therapeutic drug a fresco from same site also depicts a woman using saffron to treat her bleeding foot these frescoes are first botanically accurate visual representations of saffron s use as an herbal remedy this saffron growing minoan settlement was ultimately destroyed by a powerful earthquake and subsequent volcanic eruption sometime between 1645 and 1500 bc volcanic ash from destruction entombed and helped preserve these key herbal frescoes ancient greek legends tell of brazen sailors embarking on long and perilous voyages to remote land of cilicia where they traveled to procure what they believed was world s most valuable saffron best known hellenic saffron legend is that of crocus and smilax handsome youth crocus sets out in pursuit of nymph smilax in woods near athens in a brief dallying interlude of idyllic love smilax is flattered by his amorous advances but all too soon tires of his attentions he continues his pursuit she resists she crocus he is transformed into a saffron crocus its radiant orange stigmas were held as a relict glow of an undying and unrequited passion tragedy and spice would be recalled later for ancient mediterraneans saffron gathered around cilician coastal town of soli was of top value particularly for use in perfumes and ointments herodotus and pliny elder however rated rival assyrian and babylonian saffron from fertile crescent as best to treat gastrointestinal or renal upsets greek saffron from corycian cave of mount parnassus was also of note color offered by corycian crocus is used as a benchmark in argonautica of apollonius rhodius and similarly with its fragrance in epigrams of martial cleopatra of late ptolemaic egypt used a quarter cup of saffron in her warm baths as she prized its colouring and cosmetic properties she used it before encounters with men trusting that saffron would render lovemaking yet more pleasurable egyptian healers used saffron as a treatment for all varieties of gastrointestinal ailments when stomach pains progressed to internal hemorrhaging an egyptian treatment consisted of saffron crocus seeds mixed and crushed together with tree remnants ox fat coriander and myrrh this ointment or poultice was applied to body physicians expected it to expel blood through mouth or rectum which resembles hog s blood when it is cooked urinary tract conditions were also treated with an oil based emulsion of premature saffron flowers mixed with roasted beans this was used topically on men women ingested a more complex preparation in greco roman times saffron was widely traded across mediterranean by phoenicians their customers ranged from perfumers of rosetta in egypt to physicians in gaza to townsfolk in rhodes who wore pouches of saffron in order to mask presence of malodorous fellow citizens during outings to theatre for greeks saffron was widely associated with professional courtesans and retainers known as hetaerae large dye works operating in sidon and tyre used saffron baths as a substitute there royal robes were triple dipped in deep purple dyes for robes of royal pretenders and commoners last two dips were replaced with a saffron dip which gave a less intense purple hue ancient greeks and romans prized saffron as a perfume or and scattered it about their public spaces royal halls courts and amphitheatres alike when nero entered rome they spread saffron along streets wealthy romans partook of daily saffron baths they used it as mascara stirred saffron threads into their wines cast it aloft in their halls and streets as a and offered it to their deities roman colonists took saffron with them when they settled in southern roman gaul where it was extensively cultivated until ad 271 barbarian invasion of italy competing theories state that saffron only returned to france with 8th century moors or with avignon papacy in 14th century middle eastern and persian thumb turkey saffron based pigments have been found in prehistoric paints used to illustrate beasts in 50 000 year old cave art found in modern day iraq which was even then northwest of persian empire sumerians used saffron as an ingredient in their remedies and magical potions sumerians did not cultivate saffron they gathered their stores from wild flowers believing that divine intervention alone enables saffron s medicinal properties such evidence suggests that saffron was an article of long distance trade before crete s minoan palace culture reached a peak in 2nd millennium bc saffron was also honoured as a sweet smelling spice over three millennia ago in hebrew tanakh according to talmud saffron was also among spices used in offered in temple in jerusalem babylonian talmud 6a thumb left a field of saffron crocuses in iran in ancient persia saffron crocus sativus was cultivated at and isfahan in 10th century bc there persian saffron threads have been found interwoven into ancient persian royal carpets and funeral shrouds saffron was used by ancient persian worshippers as a ritual offering to their deities and as a brilliant yellow dye perfume and a medicine thus saffron threads would be scattered across beds and mixed into hot teas as a curative for bouts of melancholy indeed persian saffron threads used to spice foods and teas were widely suspected by foreigners of being a drugging agent and an aphrodisiac these fears grew to forewarn travelers to abstain from eating saffron laced persian cuisine in addition persian saffron was dissolved in water with sandalwood to use as a body wash after heavy work and perspiration under hot persian sun later persian saffron was heavily used by alexander great and his forces during their asian campaigns they mixed saffron into teas and dined on saffron rice alexander personally used saffron sprinkled in warm bath water taking after cyrus great much like cyrus he believed it would heal his many wounds and his faith in saffron grew with each treatment he even recommended saffron baths for ordinary men under him greek soldiers taken with saffron s perceived curative properties continued practice after they returned to macedonia east and south asian thumb gomateshwara monolith is anointed with saffron every twelve years by thousands of devotees during mahamastakabhisheka various conflicting accounts exist that describe saffron s first arrival in south and east asia first of these rely on historical accounts gleaned from persian records these suggest to many experts that saffron among other spices was first spread to india via persian rulers efforts to stock their newly built gardens and parks they accomplished this by transplanting desired cultivars across persian empire phoenicians then began in 6th century bc to market new kashmiri saffron by utilising their extensive trade routes once sold kashmiri saffron was used in treatment of melancholy and as a fabric dye on other hand traditional kashmiri legend states that saffron first arrived in 11th or 12th century ad when two foreign and itinerant sufi ascetics masood wali and hazrat sheikh wandered into kashmir foreigners having fallen sick beseeched a cure for illness from a local tribal chieftain when chieftain obliged two holy men reputedly gave them a saffron crocus bulb as payment and thanks to this day grateful prayers are offered to two saints during saffron harvesting season in late autumn saints indeed have a golden domed shrine and tomb dedicated to them in saffron trading village of india however kashmiri poet and scholar mohammed yusuf teng disputes this he states that kashmiris had cultivated saffron for more than two millennia according to hindu religion lord krishna used to put tilak a mark on forehead of saffron daily ancient chinese buddhist accounts from mula monastic order or vinaya present yet another account of saffron s arrival in india according to legend an indian buddhist missionary by name of or was sent to kashmir in 5th century bc upon his arrival he seemingly sowed first kashmiri saffron crop from there saffron use spread throughout indian subcontinent in addition to use in foods saffron stigmas were also soaked in water to yield a golden yellow solution that was used as a fabric dye some historians believe that saffron first came to china with mongol invaders by way of persia saffron is mentioned in ancient chinese medical text shennong ben cao jing believed to be from 3rd century ad but attributed to mythological emperor shennong yet chinese were referring to saffron as having a kashmiri provenance chinese medical expert wan zhen wrote that t he habitat of saffron is in kashmir where people grow it principally to offer it to buddha wan reflected on how saffron was used in his time saffron crocus flower withers after a few days and then saffron is obtained it is valued for its uniform yellow colour it can be used to wine in modern times saffron cultivation has spread to afghanistan due to efforts of european union and united kingdom together they promote saffron cultivation among impoverished and cash strapped afghan farmers as an ideal alternative to lucrative and illicit opium production post classical european thumb medieval european illuminated manuscripts such as this 13th century depiction of archbishop of canterbury thomas becket s assassination often used saffron dyes to provide hues of yellow and orange saffron cultivation in europe declined steeply following fall of roman empire for several centuries thereafter saffron cultivation was rare or non existent throughout europe this was reversed when moorish civilisation spread from north africa to settle iberian peninsula as well as parts of france and southern italy one theory states that moors reintroduced saffron corms to region around poitiers after they lost battle of tours to charles martel in ad 732 two centuries after their conquest of spain moors planted saffron throughout southern provinces of andalucia castile la mancha and valencia in france saffron cultivation probably started during 13th century crocus sativus was likely introduced from spain and from middle east by pilgrims merchants and knights its first uses are documented in south west of kingdom around 1250 it is indeed unlikely that kings and religious didn t try growing crocus sativus by that time saffron was rare expensive and demanded and crocus sativus could be farmed under france s latitudes by 14th century wide use of saffron for spicing and coloring food is documented in recipe books such as de written by king s cook and by 15th century local saffron farming is attested with taxes levied by religious power which reveal how important saffron crops must have been for instance in 1478 saffron tax levied by bishop of albi reached 1 12th of saffron production saffron demand skyrocketed when black death of 1347 1350 struck europe it was coveted by plague victims for medicinal purposes and yet many of farmers capable of growing it had died off large quantities of non european saffron were therefore imported finest saffron threads from muslim lands were unavailable to europeans because of hostilities stoked by crusades so rhodes and other places were key suppliers to central and northern europe saffron was one of contested points of hostility that flared between declining landed gentry and upstart and increasingly wealthy merchants fourteen week long saffron war was ignited when one shipment of saffron was hijacked and stolen by nobles load which was en route to town of basel would at today s market prices be valued at more than 500 000 that shipment was eventually returned but wider 13th century trade was subject to mass piracy thieves plying mediterranean waters would often ignore gold stores and instead steal venetian and marketed saffron bound for europe wary of such unpleasantness basel planted its own corms several years of large and lucrative saffron harvests made basel extremely prosperous compared to other european towns citizens sought to protect their status by outlawing transport of corms out of town guards were posted to prevent thieves from picking flowers or digging up corms yet ten years later saffron harvest had waned basel abandoned crop pivot of central european saffron trade moved to nuremberg merchants of venice continued their rule of mediterranean sea trade trafficking varieties from sicily france and spain austria crete and greece and ottoman empire goods also made rounds those soaked in honey mixed with marigold petals or kept in damp cellars all to add quick and cheap bulk irritated nuremberg authorities passed code to de louse saffron trade were thus fined imprisoned and executed by immolation england was next to have its turn as a major producer one theory has it that crop spread to coastal regions of eastern england in 14th century ad during reign of edward iii in subsequent years saffron was fleetingly cultivated throughout england norfolk suffolk and south cambridgeshire were especially affected with corms rowland parker provides an account of its cultivation in village of foxton during 16th and 17th centuries usually by people holding a small amount of land an acre planted in saffron could yield a crop worth a kingly 6 making it a very profitable crop provided that plenty of unpaid labor was available unpaid labor was one of basic features of farming then and for another two centuries in france saffron production became very important in 17th and 18th centuries reaching a few tons by then saffron farming had spread throughout entire kingdom saffron was especially grown in gascony gatinais normandy perigord poitou provence and quercy its mysterious decline started during 18th century possibly due to pandemic fungal diseases destroying bulbs and crops to particularly cold winters and to competing market from mediterranean countries in england cultivation persisted only in light well drained and chalk based soils of north essex countryside essex town of saffron walden got its name as a saffron growing and trading centre its name was originally walden and culinary name change was effected to punctuate importance of crop to townsfolk town s arms still feature blooms from eponymous crocus yet as england emerged from middle ages rising puritanical sentiments and new conquests abroad endangered english saffron s use and cultivation puritanical partisans favoured increasingly austere unadorned and foods saffron was also a labor intensive crop which became an increasing disadvantage as wages and time opportunity costs rose and finally an influx of more exotic spices from far east due to resurgent spice trade meant that english as well as other europeans had many more and cheaper seasonings to dally over this trend was documented by dean of manchester reverend william herbert he collected samples and compiled information on many aspects of saffron crocus he was concerned about steady decline in saffron cultivation over course of 17th century and dawn of industrial revolution introduction in europe of easily grown maize and potatoes which steadily took over lands formerly flush with corms did not help in addition elite who traditionally comprised bulk of saffron market were now growing increasingly interested in such intriguing new arrivals as chocolate coffee tea and vanilla only in south of france or in italy and spain where saffron harvest was culturally primal did significant cultivation prevail north american saffron made its way to new world when thousands of alsatian german and swiss anabaptists and others fled religious persecution in europe they settled mainly in eastern pennsylvania in susquehanna river valley these settlers who became known as pennsylvania dutch were by 1730 widely cultivating saffron after corms were first brought to america in a trunk it was owned by german adherents of a protestant church known as church as members were known were great lovers of saffron and had grown it back in germany pennsylvania dutch saffron was soon being successfully marketed to spanish colonists in caribbean while healthy demand elsewhere ensured that its listed price on philadelphia commodities exchange was set equal to that of gold however war of 1812 destroyed many of merchantmen that ferried american saffron abroad pennsylvanian saffron growers were afterwards left with surplus inventory and trade with caribbean markets never recovered nevertheless pennsylvania dutch growers developed many uses for now abundant
