ambondro mahabo is a mammal from middle jurassic bathonian isalo iii formation about 167 million years ago of madagascar only described species of genus ambondro it is known from a fragmentary lower jaw with three teeth interpreted as last premolar and first two molars premolar consists of a central cusp with one or two smaller cusps and a cingulum shelf on inner or lingual side of tooth molars also have such a lingual cingulum they consist of two groups of cusps a trigonid of three cusps at front and a talonid with a main cusp a smaller cusp and a crest at back features of talonid suggest that ambondro had tribosphenic molars basic arrangement of molar features also present in marsupial and placental mammals it is oldest known mammal with putatively tribosphenic teeth at time of its discovery it antedated second oldest example by about 25 million years upon its description in 1999 ambondro was interpreted as a primitive relative of tribosphenida marsupials placentals and their extinct tribosphenic toothed relatives in 2001 however an alternative suggestion was published that united it with cretaceous australian ausktribosphenos and monotremes echidnas platypus and their extinct relatives into clade australosphenida which would have acquired tribosphenic molars independently from marsupials and placentals jurassic argentinean asfaltomylos and henosferus and cretaceous australian bishops were later added to australosphenida and new work on wear in australosphenidan teeth has called into question whether these animals including ambondro did have tribosphenic teeth other paleontologists have challenged this concept of australosphenida and instead proposed that ambondro is not closely related to ausktribosphenos plus monotremes or that monotremes are not australosphenidans and that remaining australosphenidans are related to placentals discovery and context ambondro mahabo was described by a team led by john flynn in a 1999 paper in nature scientific name derives from village of close to which fossil was found it is known from bathonian middle jurassic about 167 million years ago of mahajanga basin in northwestern madagascar in isalo iii unit youngest of three rock layers that make up isalo group this unit has also yielded crocodyliform and plesiosaur teeth and remains of sauropod flynn et al 1999 pp 57 58 description thumb alt see text

primitive mammals it is small each of teeth has a prominent cingulum shelf on inner lingual side flynn et al 1999 p 58 p last has a strong central cusp there is a cuspule small cusp on back of tooth and probably another on inner front corner this tooth resembles molars of symmetrodonts a group of primitive mammals but back cusp is smaller than metaconid of symmetrodonts flynn et al 1999 fig 3 front half of m1 and m2 consists of trigonid a group of three cusps forming a triangle paraconid at front on inner side protoconid in middle on outer labial side and metaconid at back on inner side see figure 2 three cusps form a right angle with each other at protoconid so that trigonid is described as open paraconid is higher than metaconid rauhut et al 2002 p 167 at front margin a cingulum is present that is divided into two small cusps unlike in various early tribosphenic mammals and close relatives there is no additional cuspule behind metaconid flynn et al 1999 fig 2 at back of trigonid crest known as distal metacristid is located relatively close to outer side of tooth and is continuous with another crest cristid obliqua which is in turn connected to back of tooth talonid another group of cusps makes up back of tooth it is wider than long and contains a well developed cusp hypoconid on outer side and a depression talonid basin in middle cristid obliqua connects to hypoconid smaller hypoconulid cusp is present towards inner side of tooth and hypoconid and hypoconulid are connected by a cutting edge which is suggestive of presence of a metacone cusp on upper molars further towards inner side a crest entocristid rims talonid basin on m1 it is swollen and on m2 it contains two small but a distinct entoconid cusp is absent this entocristid is continuous with lingual cingulum wear facets are areas of a tooth that show evidence of contact with a tooth in opposing jaw when teeth are brought together known as occlusion luo et al 2002 pp 22 29 flynn and colleagues identified two wear facets at front and back margins of talonid basin they argue that these wear facets suggest presence of a protocone another cusp on outer side of tooth on upper molars flynn et al 1999 p 59 in a 2005 paper on asfaltomylos a related primitive mammal from argentina thomas martin and oliver rauhut disputed presence of these wear facets within talonid basin in ambondro and instead identified wear facets on cusps and crests surrounding basin they proposed that wear in australosphenidan talonid occurs mainly on rims not in talonid basin itself and that australosphenidans may not have had a functional protocone martin and rauhut 2005 pp 422 423 interpretations figure 3 alternative views of relationships of ambondro top rougier et al 2007 fig 9 australosphenidans including monotremes and ambondro are distinct from boreosphenidans bottom woodburne et al 2003 fig 3 australosphenidans including ambondro but excluding monotremes are closely related to placentals many taxa are omitted from both trees for clarity in their paper flynn and colleagues described ambondro as oldest mammal with tribosphenic molars basic molar type of metatherian marsupials and their extinct relatives and eutherian placentals and their extinct relatives mammals characterized by protocone cusp on upper molars contacting talonid basin on lower molars in chewing discovery of ambondro was thought to extend known temporal range of tribosphenic mammals 25 million years further into past flynn et al 1999 p 57 rougier et al 2007 p 23 consequently flynn and colleagues argued against prevailing view that tribosphenic mammals originated on northern continents laurasia and instead proposed that their origin lies in south gondwana flynn et al 1999 p 60 they cited retention of a distal metacristid and an open trigonid as characters separating ambondro from more modern tribosphenidans in 2001 zhe xi luo and colleagues alternatively proposed that a tribosphenic molar pattern had arisen twice compare figure 3 top once giving rise to marsupials and placentals boreosphenida and once producing ambondro cretaceous australian ausktribosphenos and living monotremes which first appeared in cretaceous united as australosphenida luo et al 2001 p 56 they characterized australosphenida by shared presence of a cingulum on outer front corner of lower molars a short and broad talonid a relatively low trigonid and a triangulated last lower premolar luo et al 2001 pp 53 56 also in 2001 denise sigogneau russell and colleagues in their description of earliest laurasian tribosphenic mammal agreed with relationship between ausktribosphenos and monotremes but argued that ambondro was closer to laurasian tribosphenidans than to ausktribosphenos and monotremes as evidence against integrity of australosphenida they cited presence of lingual cingula in various non australosphenidan mammals presence of two cusps in anterior cingulum in ambondro as well as some boreosphenidans different appearance of premolar in ambondro flat and ausktribosphenos squared and contrast between talonids of ambondro with a well developed hypoconid on labial side and ausktribosphenos squared sigogneau russell et al 2001 p 146 next year luo and colleagues published a more thorough analysis confirming their previous conclusion and adding cretaceous australian bishops to australosphenida luo et al 2002 fig 1 they mentioned condition of hypoconulid which is inclined forward rather than backward as in boreosphenidans as an additional australosphenidan et al 2002 p 23 and noted that ausktribosphenos and monotremes were united to exclusion of ambondro by presence of a v shaped notch in distal metacristid luo et al 2002 p 22 in same year asfaltomylos was described from jurassic of argentina as another australosphenidan in contrast to ambondro this animal lacked a distal metacristid and did not have as well developed a lingual cingulum rauhut et al 2002 p 166 however in 2003 michael woodburne and colleagues revised phylogenetic analysis published by luo and colleagues making several changes to data particularly in monotremes woodburne 2003 pp 233 235 their results figure 3 bottom challenged division between australosphenida and boreosphenida as proposed by luo et al instead they excluded monotremes from australosphenida and placed remaining australosphenidans close to eutheria with ambondro most closely related to asfaltomylos woodburne 2003 fig 5 woodburne et al 2003 fig 3 in 2007 guillermo rougier and colleagues described another australosphenidan henosferus from jurassic of argentina they argued against a relationship between eutheria and australosphenida figure 3 top but were ambivalent about placement of monotremes within australosphenida rougier et al 2007 p 31 based in part on martin and rauhut s earlier work on wear facets in australosphenidans they questioned presence of a true functional protocone on upper molars of non monotreme australosphenidans none of which are known from upper teeth and consequently suggested that australosphenidans may not after all have had truly tribosphenic teeth rougier et al
