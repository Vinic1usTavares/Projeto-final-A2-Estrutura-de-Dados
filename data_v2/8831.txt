phan dinh phung 21 1896 was a vietnamese revolutionary who led rebel armies against french colonial forces in vietnam he was most prominent of confucian court scholars involved in anti french military campaigns in 19th century and was cited after his death by 20th century nationalists as a national hero he was renowned for his uncompromising will and principles on one occasion marr pp 61 62 he refused to surrender even after french had desecrated his ancestral tombs and had arrested and threatened to kill his family born into a family of mandarins from ha tinh province phan continued his ancestors traditions by placing first in metropolitan imperial examinations in 1877 phan quickly rose through ranks under emperor tu duc of nguyen dynasty gaining a reputation for his integrity and uncompromising stance against corruption phan was appointed as imperial censor a position that allowed him to criticise his fellow mandarins and even emperor as head of censorate phan s investigations led to removal of many incompetent or corrupt mandarins upon tu duc s death phan almost lost his life during a power struggle in imperial court regent ton that thuyet disregarded tu duc s will of succession and three emperors were deposed and killed in just over a year phan protested against thuyet s activities was stripped of his honours and briefly jailed before being exiled to his home province at time france had just conquered vietnam and made it a part of french indochina along with thuyet phan organised rebel armies as part of can vuong movement which sought to expel french and install boy emperor ham nghi at head of an independent vietnam this campaign continued for three years until 1888 when french captured ham nghi and exiled him to algeria phan and his military assistant cao thang continued their guerrilla campaign building a network of spies bases and small weapons factories however cao thang was killed in process in late 1893 decade long campaign eventually wore phan down and he died from dysentery as french surrounded his forces court official phan was born in village of dong thai in northern central coast province of ha tinh dong thai was famous for producing high ranking mandarins and had been home of senior imperial officials since time of le dynasty twelve consecutive generations of phan family had been successful mandarinate graduates all three of phan s brothers who lived to adulthood passed imperial examinations and became mandarins hodgkin p 117 early on phan indicated his distaste for classical curriculum required of an aspiring mandarin he nevertheless persevered with his studies passing regional exams in 1876 and then topping metropolitan exams following year marr p 61 in his exam response phan cited japan as an example of how an asian country could make rapid military progress given sufficient willpower hodgkin p 116 phan was never known for his scholarly abilities it was his reputation for principled integrity that led to his quick rise through ranks under reign of emperor tu duc he was first appointed as a district mandarin in ninh binh province where he punished a vietnamese roman catholic priest who with tacit support of french missionaries had harassed local non catholics amid diplomatic controversy that followed he avoided blaming unpopular alliance between vietnamese catholics and french on catholicism itself stating that partnership had arisen out of military and political vulnerabilities of vietnam s imperial government despite this hue court eventually removed phan from this post phan was transferred to hue court as a member of censorate a watchdog body that monitored work of mandarinate he earned ire of many of his colleagues but trust of emperor by revealing that vast majority of court mandarins were making a mockery of a royal edict to engage in regular rifle practice tu duc later dispatched phan on an inspection trip to northern vietnam his report led to ousting of many officials who were deemed corrupt or incompetent including viceroy of northern region marr p 62 he rose to become ngu su or imperial censor a position which allowed him to criticise other high officials and even emperor for misconduct phan openly criticised ton that thuyet foremost mandarin of court believing him to be rash and dishonest karnow p 121 aside from his work in rooting out corruption phan also compiled a historical geography of vietnam which was published in 1883 goscha p 24 despite his prominent position in nguyen dynasty little is known about phan s personal stance on vietnamese relations with france which was in process of colonising vietnam france had first invaded in 1858 mcleod p 43 beginning colonisation of southern vietnam mcleod pp 44 45 three provinces were ceded under 1862 treaty of saigon mcleod p 54 karnow p 119 and a further three in 1867 to form colony of cochinchina mcleod p 55 karnow p 90 during period there was debate in hue court on best strategy to regain territory one group advocated military means while another believed in use of diplomacy in addition to financial and religious concessions mcleod pp 51 53 by time of tu duc s death in 1883 whole of vietnam was colonised henceforth incorporated with laos and cambodia into french indochina marr p 55 karnow p 98 upon his death in 1883 childless tu duc had named his nephew kien phuc as his successor rather than duc duc his most senior heir tu duc had written in his will that duc duc was depraved and unworthy of ruling country chapuis p 15 however led by thuyet regents enthroned duc duc under pressure of ladies of court phan protested against violation of tu duc s will of succession and refused to sanction anyone other than kien phuc lucky to escape death penalty phan was stripped of his positions later duc duc was deposed and executed by thuyet on grounds of ignoring court etiquette ignoring mourning rites for tu duc and having affairs with late emperor s consorts phan again protested regents actions and was briefly imprisoned by thuyet before being exiled to his home province revolutionary career can vuong phan rallied to cause of boy emperor ham nghi fourth monarch in little over a year after an abortive royal uprising at hue in 1885 chapuis pp 15 18 thuyet and fellow regent nguyen van tuong had enthroned hoa after disposing of duc duc however new emperor was wary of regents behaviour and attempted to avoid their influence leading thuyet to organise his execution chapuis p 16 teenage kien phuc ascended throne but was poisoned by his adoptive mother hoc phi one of tu duc s wives whom he caught having intercourse with tuong chapuis p 17 kien phuc was thus replaced by his 14 year old brother ham nghi in meantime french concluded that regents were causing too much trouble and had to be disposed of thuyet had already decided to place ham nghi at head of phong can vuong loyalty to emperor movement which sought to end french rule with a royalist rebellion phan helped cause by setting up bases in ha tinh and creating his own guerrilla army thuyet had hoped to secure support from qing dynasty of china chapuis p 21 but phan thought that vietnam s best chance of effective support came from siam gia long founder of nguyen dynasty and great grandfather of tu duc had married his sister off to king of siam he had also used siam as a base in exile during his quest for throne in 1780s however direct appeals to siamese government only yielded a few pack trains of firearms and ammunition in preparation for revolt thuyet had been building up an armed base at tan so for over a year chapuis p 20 in any case can vuong revolt started on july 5 1885 when thuyet launched a surprise attack against colonial forces after a diplomatic confrontation with french marr p 47 karnow p 99 chapuis p 19 thuyet took ham nghi northwards to tan so mountain base near border with laos after attack failed campaign was launched when emperor issued can vuong edict that had been prepared by regent marr p 43 phan initially rallied support from his native village and set up his headquarters on mount vu quang which overlooked coastal french fortress at ha tinh phan s organisation became a model for future insurgents for flexibility he divided his operational zone into twelve districts his forces upheld military discipline and wore uniforms chapuis p 93 phan initially used local scholar gentry as his military commanders their first notable attack targeted two nearby catholic villages that had collaborated with french forces colonial troops arrived a few hours later quickly overwhelming rebels and forcing them to retreat to their home village where retribution was heavy phan managed to escape but his elder brother was captured by same former viceroy of northern vietnam who had been removed from office as a result of phan s critical report disgraced official was now a french collaborator serving as governor of nghe an province strategy of attempting to pressure phan into capitulating was a classical strategy of coercion french used an old friend and fellow villager to make an emotional and deeply confucian appeal for phan to surrender in order to save his brother his ancestral tombs and his entire village phan was reported to have replied phan was later reported to have simply retorted if anyone carves up my brother remember to send me some of soup however he held no illusions about prospect of successfully driving out french stating it is our destiny we accept it this incident and phan s response are often cited as one of reasons why he was so admired by populace and among future generations of vietnamese anti colonialists he adhered to highest personal standards of patriotism he identified with a countrywide cause far removed from questions of family and region phan s men were well trained and disciplined and military inspiration behind his rebellion was derived from cao thang a bandit leader who had been protected from royal forces by phan s brother a decade earlier they operated in provinces of thanh hoa in north ha tinh nghe an in centre and quang binh in south with their strongest areas being two central provinces in 1887 phan concluded that his tactics were misguided ordering his subordinates to cease open combat and resort to guerrilla tactics his men built up a network of base camps food caches intelligence agents and peasant supply contacts phan traveled to north in hope of coordinating strategic and tactical plans with other leaders in meantime cao thang led a force of around 1 000 men with some 500 firearms between them cao thang produced around 300 rifles by disassembling and copying 1874 model french weapons that had been captured goscha p 25 for purpose of creating such replica guns they captured vietnamese artisans according to french officers who later captured some of vietnamese copies weapons were proficiently reproduced only details in which they were regarded as being defective were in tempering of springs which were improvised with umbrella spokes and lack of rifling in barrels which curtailed range and accuracy marr p 64 nevertheless weaponry used by phan s rebels was far inferior to that of their adversaries and their inland positions were within firing range of french navy vietnamese could not rely on china to give them material support and other european powers such as portugal netherlands and united kingdom were unwilling to sell them weapons for various reasons thus phan had to explore overland routes to procure weapons from siamese sources using seafaring transport was impossible due to presence of french navy he instructed his followers to create a secret route from ha tinh through laos into northeastern siam one such route from mount vu quang was believed to have been created around 1888 it is unclear if phan himself went to thailand but a young female supporter named co tam was his designated arms buyer in tha which boasted a substantial expatriate vietnamese community in 1890 siamese army transported around 1 000 austrian repeating rifles from bangkok to luang in laos however it is unclear whether weapons found their way into vietnamese hands or whether they were related to co tam s activities after can vuong in 1888 ham nghi s bodyguard truong quang ngoc betrayed him chapuis p 62 leading to emperor s capture and deportation to algeria marr p 57 karnow p 100 phan and cao thang fought on in mountainous areas of ha tinh nghe an and thanh hoa another 15 bases were built along mountain to complement headquarters at vu quang each base had a subordinate commander leading units numbering between 100 and 500 men operations were funded by local villagers who were levied with a land tax in silver and rice local bases were supported by nearby villages and excess funds were sent to vu quang phan s men foraged and sold cinnamon bark to raise funds while lowland peasants donated spare metals for production of weapons when phan returned from north in 1889 his first order was to track down ham nghi s betrayer ngoc when he was found phan personally executed ngoc in hoa he then began a series of small unit attacks on french installations through summer of 1890 but these proved indecisive french relied mostly on district and provincial colonial units to man their perpetually increasing line of forts which were usually commanded by a french lieutenant in late 1890 a french effort to move into low lying villages and isolate populace from mountainous rebel bases failed in spring of 1892 a major french sweep of ha tinh failed and in august cao thang seized initiative with a bold counterattack on provincial capital rebels broke into prison and freed their compatriots killing a large number of vietnamese soldiers who defended penitentiary as members of french colonial forces this caused french to intensify their efforts against phan and a counteroffensive was conducted throughout remainder of 1892 forcing rebels to retreat back into mountains two of their bases fell and steady french pressure began to break their covert resistance links with lowland villages this compounded problems of securing food supplies intelligence data and recruits a ring of french forts continued to be erected increasingly pinning down phan s men only notable gain for phan s forces during this period was acquisition of gunpowder supplies from siam this enabled them to mix foreign and local powder in a 50 50 ratio rather than their previous weaker mixture of 20 80 marr pp 64 65 late in year burden on phan increased after loss of two can vuong allies in september tong duy tan who led royalists in thanh hoa was captured and publicly executed marr pp 60 61 nguyen thien who had been active in northern provinces of hung yen and hai duong fled to guangxi in china supporters of tan and moved south and integrated into phan s force in mid 1893 cao thang proposed a full scale attack on provincial seat of nghe an and surrounding posts plan proposed to phan included diversions to south and training of almost 2 000 men in conventional military tactics unconvinced of its viability phan reluctantly approved plan troops were eager but after overpowering several small posts en route main force was pinned down while attacking french fort of no on september 9 1893 along with his brother cao thang was mortally wounded while leading a risky frontal attack with 150 men and forces retreated in disarray phan regarded loss of cao thang as a significant one admitting as much in delivering eulogy and funeral oration marr p 65 according to historian david marr there was evidence that phan clearly realised advantages and limitations of prolonged resistance although phan had previously stated that he was not expecting ultimate success guerrilla leader thought that it was important to keep pressuring french in order to demonstrate to populace that there was an alternative to what he felt was a defeatist attitude from hue court marr p 66 downfall right thumb 200px hoang cao khai alt aged man with cylindrical headdress long flowing beard and moustache a traditional vietnamese tunic

to a degree that his french masters did not khai was from a scholar gentry family from same village as phan hodgkin p 113 he became main backer of a determined effort to crush phan s forces using every means available political psychological and economic by late 1894 relatives and suspected sympathisers of insurgents were intimidated and more resistance commanders had been killed communications were disrupted and rebel hideouts became increasingly insecure in an attempt to force phan to surrender french arrested his family and desecrated tombs of his ancestors publicly

that he would lobby governor general jean marie antoine de lanessan and other french officials for an amnesty in return for phan s surrender lam p 123 khai credited phan with righteousness loyalty and dedication towards monarchy according to marr phan dinh phung s reply was a classic in savage understatement utilizing standard formalism in interest of propaganda with deft denigration of his opponent phan appealed to vietnamese nationalist sentiment recalling his country s stubborn resistance to chinese aggression he cited defensive wars against han tang song yuan and ming dynasties asking why a country a thousand times more powerful could not annex vietnam lam p 125 phan concluded that it was because destiny of our country has been willed by heaven itself phan placed responsibility for suffering of people at feet of french who acted like a storm lam pp 126 127 after analysing his own actions phan concluded with a thinly veiled attack on khai and his collaborators khai s appeal was rebutted with an appeal to history nationalist sentiment and a demand that blame for death and destruction lay with colonial forces and their vietnamese assistants phan raised stakes above family and village to entire nation and its populace marr p 68 with phan s rebuke in his hands khai translated both documents into french and presented them to de lanessan proposing that it was time for final destruction of this scholar gentry rebellion in july 1895 french area commanders called in 3 000 troops to tighten cordon around three remaining rebel bases insurgents were able to execute ambushes at night but phan contracted dysentery and had to be carried on a stretcher whenever his unit moved a collaborator mandarin named nguyen than who had previous experience in pacification in quang ngai and quang nam was drafted in to isolate insurgents from their supporters in villages cut off from their supplies insurgents were left to survive by eating roots and occasional handfuls of dried corn their shoes were worn through and most were without blankets phan died of dysentery on january 21 1896 and his captured followers were executed a report submitted by de lanessan to minister of colonies in paris stated that soul of resistance to protectorate was gone legacy 150px thumb right statue of phan dinh phung in district 5 ho chi minh city vietnam alt side
