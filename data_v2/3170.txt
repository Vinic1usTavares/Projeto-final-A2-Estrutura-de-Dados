threshold issues are legal requirements in singapore administrative law that must be satisfied by applicants before their claims for judicial review of acts or decisions of public authorities can be dealt with by high court these include showing that they have standing locus standi to bring cases and that matters are amenable to judicial review and justiciable by court depending on interest that applicant seeks to represent standing can be categorized as either private or public standing applicants must establish they have private standing if they seek to represent personal interests in contrast an applicant who seeks to represent interests of a larger group or public at large must establish he or she has public or representative standing where private standing is concerned singapore courts have not yet directly addressed issue of standing required to obtain a declaration in an administrative law case but where constitutional claims are concerned court of appeal held that three elements must exist 1 applicant must have a real interest in bringing case 2 there must be a real controversy between parties to case and 3 a personal right possessed by applicant must have been violated court also suggested that same test applied to applications for prerogative orders legal position on public standing in administrative law cases is indeterminate as to date no applicant has sought to rely on public standing to obtain leave for judicial review in constitutional law cases court has drawn a distinction between public and private rights and held that people will not have standing to vindicate public rights unless they have suffered special damage and have genuine private interests to protect or further for a decision by a body to be amenable to judicial review united kingdom and singapore law requires decision to have some public element and not to relate exclusively to private law matters public element is determined by considering if body s power stems from a legal source source test or if nature of body is that it is carrying out some public function nature test if power exercised by a body has a legislative source it will ordinarily be amenable to judicial review in absence of compelling reasons to contrary but this is not an invariable rule and decisions without a sufficient public element will not be amenable to review latter is also result when a body is regarded as having acted pursuant to a contract between it and aggrieved party rather than having exercised its statutory powers subject matter of a dispute must be justiciable before high court will hear case a decision by an executive authority will generally be considered non justiciable if decision requires intricate balancing of various competing policy considerations and judges are ill equipped to decide case because of their limited training experience and access to materials if a judicial pronouncement could embarrass another branch of government or tie its hands in conduct of affairs traditionally falling within its purview or if decision involves exercise of a prerogative power that democratically elected branches are entrusted to take care of nonetheless a dispute may prima facie involve a non justiciable area but courts may decide that there is a justiciable matter within it or courts may be able to isolate a pure question of law from what is seemingly a non justiciable issue because of principle that all powers have legal limits attorney general s exercise of prosecutorial discretion and power to pardon or grant clemency to convicted persons exercised by president on cabinet s advice are both justiciable in exceptional cases for instance where powers have been exercised unconstitutionally or in bad faith introduction before an

an applicant must satisfy before a court will permit him or her to proceed with a claim for judicial review irc depending on facts of case applicant has to establish one of two categories of standing applicant seeks to establish private standing when he or she purports to represent his or her own interests in contrast applicant seeks to establish public or representative standing when he or she purports to represent interests of a larger group of people or public at large standing is a mixed question of fact and law which court determines based on legal principles irc p 631 doctrine of standing prevents applicants from burdening court with frivolous or vexatious claims this minimizes disruption in administrative process when an administrative decision by a public authority is challenged implementation of decision by authority may be delayed therefore courts want to restrict access to applicants who have a genuine interest in challenging decision furthermore since courts resources are limited restricting access to genuine claims ensures that judicial resources are appropriately allocated private standing declarations one of remedies that may be sought by an applicant for judicial review is a declaration which is a pronouncement by a court stating legal position between parties to an action based on facts that have been presented to court leyland anthony remedies

accorded at all has been a subject of considerable academic and judicial controversy it has been regarded by one academic commentator as litmus test of how liberal standing rules within a legal regime are common justifications for allowing this form of standing include need to vindicate rule of law and need to challenge particularly serious illegality where no individual is peculiarly affected by

standing to challenge such action before courts irc p 644 on other hand proponents of a more closed and restrictive system of rules of standing point towards need for increased certainty in law as well as possibility of abuse of process and conventional argument that there will be an unstoppable flood of litigation additionally it is argued that allowing more applications by persons with weak claims to standing may curtail efficiency of executive in practising good governance as resources would have to be channelled to defending lawsuits chan p 481 para 33 it may also delay implementation

minister for civil service 1983 lord diplock stated that for a decision to be susceptible to judicial review decision maker must be empowered by public law and ultimate source of power is nearly always a statute or subordinate legislation however this source test ignores many situations where decisions are not dependent on legal rules laid down by state this has become an increasing worry in modern polity as more privatized utilities and private bodies perform governmental functions that could potentially escape any form of scrutiny this has led to development of nature test in r v panel on take overs and mergers ex parte datafin plc 1986 r v panel on take overs and mergers ex parte datafin plc 1987 q b 815 at 847 court of appeal england and wales in this case issue was whether a body discharging functions that are quasi judicial in nature and which wields considerable de facto public powers is amenable to judicial review panel on take overs and mergers is an unincorporated association and does not derive its power directly from a legal source such as legislation rather it is an informal body which has adopted a self regulatory code to govern its members however sir john donaldson master of rolls observed that panel possesses immense power de facto by devising promulgating amending and interpreting city code on take overs and mergers and its decisions could lead to sanctions which indirectly affect rights of citizens datafin p 826 lord justice timothy lloyd acknowledged that source test is usually decisive but disagreed that it is sole test to determine whether a public body is subject to judicial review he explained that it is instead helpful to look at nature of power whether body in question exercises public law functions or if exercise of its functions has public law consequences datafin p 847 there remains some uncertainty whether source test or nature test ought to be determining test it appears though that impact of datafin remains qualified in light of other decisions where source of power was held to be determining factor leyland anthony introduction to judicial review pp 224 225 it is also worth noting that effect of nature test is greatly restricted in practice due to insistence on difference between contractual and governmental powers where there is a contractual relationship between an aggrieved person and body making a decision affecting person this tends to place dispute on private law side of public private divide making decision not amenable to judicial review position in singapore similar to united kingdom s position judicial review in singapore is confined to matters of public law and applicable tests are source test and nature test datafin decision was applied by singapore court of appeal in public

addition it noted that datafin had held that source test is not only applicable test lai swee lin linda p 154 para 41 however court did not embark on a discussion of nature test because it found that when respondent s employer had made decisions concerning her employment it had acted pursuant to her contractual terms of service and had not exercised its statutory powers thus decisions were not

characterized as a public function these factors include extent to which sgx st is interwoven into legislative and regulatory matrix whether reprimand function has a statutory underpinning and nature of reprimand function even though sgx st is not a statutory board it is an approved exchange under section 16 of securities and futures act which provides that it must take into account interests of both investing and general public when discharging its obligations also sgx st is a vital part of institutional ecosystem of singapore s financial sector its function to publicly reprimand a listed

said where there is a compelling reason which indicates absence of such a public element in what is nonetheless a statutory power or duty there would be no good reason to subject exercise of such a power or duty which may already be governed by private law obligations and remedies to public law remedies in judicial review proceedings emphasis added it has been suggested that court of appeal s judgment can be interpreted in one of two ways that exercise of a power is not amenable to judicial review either if it has no public element altogether or if it has an insufficient public element neither of these interpretations is without complications as regards first interpretation it may be difficult to conceive of an exercise of statutory power that has no public element at all if second interpretation is correct there is doubt as to level of sufficiency required for exercise of a power to be amenable to judicial review as court did not explain this also available online as exceptions decisions relating to internal procedures of parliament thumb parliament house singapore decisions made by parliament are generally not amenable to judicial review it is clearly established that

duties in relation to parliament s activities in prebble v television new zealand ltd 1994 privy council held that if any exceptions were made unless in most extreme circumstances members of

appeal t his application was made under o 53 of rsc that is this is procedure for judicial review by high court of judicial and quasi judicial functions of lower courts and tribunals it is not appropriate remedy against a decision of a high court or court of appeal court of appeal does not possess jurisdiction and power to entertain applications for supervision of a decision made by a subordinate court as it has no jurisdiction or power to hear any proceeding other than an appeal against a decision made by high court in exercise of its original jurisdiction ng chye huey p 138 para 63 emphasis in original neither may court judicially review high court decisions this is because court of appeal is a statutory creation and section 3 b of supreme court of judicature act states that it exercises only appellate civil and criminal jurisdiction issues over which judicial review has been excluded even when a decision made by a body possesses some public element judicial review of decision may be ousted where a statute expressly excludes court s power to review administrative decisions however effectiveness of an ouster clause depends on facts of each individual case examples of statutory ouster clauses in singapore are section 8b 2 of internal security act and section 47 of industrial relations act latter provision stipulates that any determination by industrial arbitration court is final and conclusive and shall not be subject to any quashing order prohibiting order mandatory order or injunction in any court on any account decisions without legal effect it

punishment high court held that not every act of or conduct by a public servant is justiciable by way of a judicial review court agreed with lord diplock in gchq case that gchq p 408 cited in tan eng chye p 527 para 7 in addition decision must have consequences which affect some person or body of persons other than decision maker although it may affect him or her too court held that report made by prison medical officer was obviously a decision but that alone did not make him a decision maker in sense explained by lord diplock this was because officer s report that appellant was fit for caning did not have legal effect district court judge was duty bound to impose sentence of caning irrespective of what officer might have said in his report hence it was not a case for judicial review at all court also said that another example of non decision making conduct was a police officer arresting a person suspected of committing an offence tan eng chye p 527 para 8 this approach was also adopted in comptroller of income tax v acc 2010 court of appeal held it is trite law that a quashing order will not lie unless a public authority has done something that a court can quash or in other words deprive of legal effect acc p 1196 para 16 citing it observed that a decision need not in itself have a direct legal effect or consequence before it can be quashed a decision which operates as a prerequisite to or a step in a process capable of altering rights interests or liabilities may also be subject of a quashing order acc p 1197 para 18 endorsing approach taken in court eventually concluded that a quashing order will only lie against decisions which have some form of actual or ostensible legal effect whether direct or indirect a mere opinion clearly does not fall within this category acc p 1198 para 21 at present approach in singapore to decisions without legal effect is less liberal than that in united kingdom it has been said that english courts now take a broad view and it is no longer necessary for a claimant to demonstrate that a decision or action has direct legal consequences upon claimant lord woolf et al p 123 for instance these courts have expanded scope of matters that fall within remit of judicial review challenges to encompass even press releases and policy guidance issued by public authorities this is illustrated by case of r axon v secretary of state for health 2006 in which guidance issued by department of health alleged to be unlawful and in contravention of article 8 of european convention on human rights was amenable to judicial review cases of this kind may be explainable on basis that actions in question have some indirect legal effect decisions having only private effect private associations and country clubs have no obvious public law function yet courts exercise judicial review over their decisions and proceedings such as hearings relating to disciplinary matters and those held to decide if persons should be deprived of their memberships in associations to ensure that they are fair and comply with requirements of natural justice it has been suggested that courts jurisdiction in such matters depends on contract rules

any club and its members lies in contract and rights of members are determined by terms of contract which are found in constitution or rules of club and need for hearings to be conducted in accordance

226 jurisdiction of courts in reviewing decisions of such domestic tribunals is of a limited nature court of appeal of england and wales held in dawkins v antrobus 1881 dawkins v antrobus 1881 l r 17 ch d 605 1881 1885 all e r rep 126 c a england and wales that before a member is expelled from a club for committing an offence against club s constitution member has to be given proper notice of meeting an opportunity to attend meeting and an opportunity to be heard moreover charges made against him and proceedings must be conducted bona fide fairly and in honest exercise of powers given to meeting by club however these conditions having been fulfilled court has no right to consider whether or not what was done by meeting was right or whether or not what was decided was reasonable

within scope of tribunal s inquiry maclean v workers union 1929 1 ch 602 at 602 h c chancery division england and wales in singapore position is similar it was held by court of appeal in singapore amateur athletics association v haron bin mundir 1993 that extent of duty to act fairly varies greatly from case to case basic norms of fairness in conduct of disciplinary proceedings need to be observed more strictly where vocational future of a person is at stake where there is an express duty on an association to make a decision only after conducting a hearing or an inquiry and where exercise of disciplinary powers may deprive a person of his or her property rights or impose a penalty on him or her haron bin mundir p 427 para 76 justiciability a legal issue must be justiciable before high court will grant an applicant leave to apply for judicial review justiciability recognizes limited capabilities of courts it delineates certain issues which fall beyond purview of judicial review because those matters are unsuited for adjudication due to nature of litigation process and judicial expertise doctrine is based on an understanding of separation of powers and need to find right constitutional balance between courts and executive for example matters of policy or subjective preference and public policy issues are better left in hands of an elected body of persons however justiciability is a concept that eludes precise categorization or definition and this has caused disquiet amongst some critics implication is that there may be some unfairness where questionable executive action remains unchallenged nonetheless concept of justiciability is useful in determining likelihood of whether an executive action is within purview of judicial review thio judiciary p 540 position in united kingdom prerogative powers and supervisory role of courts royal prerogative refers to exceptional powers and privileges only personally exercisable by monarch these important rights immunities and privileges arguably belong to crown which uses them for performance of its constitutional duties and governing of country important prerogatives include leyland anthony modern administrative state pp 32 72 at 35 legislative powers exercised through orders in council a form of delegated legislation powers in relation to conduct of foreign affairs in particular making of treaties and declarations of war powers in respect of organization and disposition of armed forces power to confer certain honours power required by government in times of emergency particularly during wartime and certain powers in respect of administration of justice these powers were generally devolved to prime minister and ministers matters are political by nature and call for political judgment rather than judicial control thus parliament is most appropriate forum for debate and best qualified to control executive however in practice parliamentary accountability of ministers is not entirely effective prerogative powers that government officials exercise on behalf of crown coupled with a weak system of checks and balances between parliament and executive can lead to an abuse of those powers which may be detrimental to people possibility of such abuse coupled with way administrative law and judicial review evolved since 1960s a period of judicial activism led courts in united kingdom to take an increasing interest in manner in which prerogative powers had been exercised leyland anthony express and implied limits on judicial review ouster and time limit clauses prerogative power public interest immunity pp 392 437 at 408 409 evolution towards reviewability traditionally regulation of executive action was met with judicial reluctance to intervene certain types of governmental discretion exercised using prerogative powers were regarded as beyond scope of judicial scrutiny because they involved issues of substantive policy however developments focused on substance of issues at hand rather than merely accepting that prerogative power is non justiciable per se simply put focus shifted from source of power to subject matter leyland anthony express and implied limits on judicial review pp 411 412 in chandler v director of public prosecutions 1962 lord devlin stated it is duty of courts to be as alert now as they have always been to prevent any abuse of prerogative chandler p 810 lord denning master of rolls applied a similar reasoning in laker airways ltd v department of trade 1976 and held that prerogative powers were as reviewable as any other power and could not be used by government to protect themselves when they were removing protection granted to parties under a statute leyland anthony express and implied limits on judicial review p 413 he stated obiter as follows laker airways p 705 thumb government communications headquarters gchq in cheltenham gloucestershire popularly known as doughnut in a 1984 decision house of lords held that although a government order banning gchq employees from joining trade unions was judicially reviewable court would not do so as matter involved national security and so was not justiciable in r v criminal injuries compensation board ex parte lain 1967 r v criminal injuries compensation board ex parte lain 1967 2 q b 864 c a england and wales it was held that powers of board were in principle reviewable despite it having been established under prerogative powers this case was cited with approval in gchq case which reflects modern position on reviewability of prerogative powers in united kingdom in this case their lordships unanimously held that executive action was not immune from judicial review merely because it was carried out in pursuance of a power derived from common law or prerogative rather than a statutory source it was subject matter that counted not source gchq p 407 in this case government through an order in council banned employees of government communications headquarters from joining a trade union house of lords held that this exercise of prerogative was judicially reviewable and trade unions had a legitimate expectation of prior consultation before ban was imposed however although failure to consult unions was unfair this lapse from proper procedure was overridden by national security considerations and thus not justiciable leyland anthony express and implied limits on judicial review p 414 in gchq lord scarman cited authority of ex parte lain and r v secretary of state for home department ex parte hosenball 1977 r v secretary of state for home department ex parte hosenball 1977 1 w l r 766 c a england and wales in stressing that modern law of judicial review had overwhelmed old restrictions on justiciability of prerogative legal implications of gchq were that many areas once considered were now potentially open to judicial scrutiny by united kingdom courts except for a list of prerogatives that lord roskill provided as being non reviewable because their nature and subject matter are such as not to be amenable to judicial process these included prerogative powers of treaty making defence of realm prerogative of mercy granting of honours dissolution of parliament and appointment of ministers gchq p 418 subsequent case law shows that this list has largely been accepted and there is indication that judges have continued to move with a degree of circumspection and sometimes even in reaction against such developments leyland anthony express and implied limits on judicial review pp 419 420 however in campaign for nuclear disarmament v prime minister 2002 justice maurice kay accepted that ambit of forbidden areas identified by lord roskill is not immutable and had been reduced in some cases campaign for nuclear disarmament para 50 attitude of courts in united kingdom is summarized in obiter comments of lord justice simon brown in r v ministry of defence ex parte smith 1995 position in singapore chng suan tze v minister for home affairs justiciability was applied as a threshold issue in singapore in chng suan tze v minister for home affairs 1988 chng suan tze v minister for home affairs sgca 16 html 1988 sgca 16 1988 2 s l r r 525 c a singapore archived from original on 24 december 2011 here appellants were arrested for allegedly being involved in a marxist conspiracy to undermine government and were issued detention orders under section 8 1 a of internal security act respondents submitted that as subject matter in ss 8 and 10 of isa relates to matters of national security court is precluded from reviewing exercising of such discretion since matters of national security should be left to those responsible for it chng suan tze p 554 para 87 court of appeal agreed with this submission stating that while an exercise of discretion is generally subject to judicial review on objective grounds a court will be precluded from reviewing a decision that was made for national security purposes this position was consistent with holdings in zamora 1916 and gchq case chng suan tze p 554 paras 88 89 court added that there is a need for decision maker to adduce evidence in court to prove that considerations of national security are involved a mere assertion by decision maker that a matter involves national security does not preclude court s judicial function of determining whether decision was in fact based on grounds of national security chng suan tze p 554 para 89 in other words national security cannot be raised as a plea in bar to prevent court from considering an application at all chng suan tze pp 556 557 para 94 however what court cannot do is decide what action national security requires this is to be left solely to those responsible for it on facts court held that a plain reading of section 8 of isa suggests that where a decision is made that it is necessary to detain someone with a view to preventing that person from acting in any manner prejudicial to security of singapore decision will clearly be based on national security considerations whether detention is necessary is a matter solely for executive s judgment however courts can still review decision in terms of whether exercise of discretion fell within scope of section 8 chng suan tze p 556 para 93 lee hsien loong v review publishing co ltd and subsequent developments law relating to justiciability was discussed comprehensively by judicial commissioner menon in high court decision lee hsien loong v review publishing co ltd 2007 after examining a line of cases judge laid down following principles principles concerning justiciability first there are provinces of executive decision making that are and should be immune from judicial review this is reflected doctrine of separation of powers embedded in singapore s westminster constitutional framework secondly span of executive decisions immune from judicial review include those involving matters of high policy such as dissolution of parliament conduct of foreign affairs making of treaties matters pertaining to war and deployment of armed forces and national defence deference should be accorded to executive branch in respect of decisions concerning these matters lee hsien loong pp 489 490 paras 95 96 high court examined three cases which fall comfortably within this class lee hsien loong pp 480 483 paras 75 80 in fagernes 1927 fagernes 1927 p 311 c a england and wales court of appeal of england and wales considered question of determining territorial boundaries and held that any definitive statement from proper representative of crown as to territory of crown must be treated as conclusive fagernes p 324 aksionairnoye obschestvo a m luther v james sagor co 1921 aksionairnoye obschestvo a m luther v james sagor co 1921 3 k b 532 c a england and wales and civil aeronautics administration v singapore airlines ltd 2004 civil aeronautics administration v singapore airlines ltd 2004 1 s l r r 570 c a singapore involved recognition of sovereign status it was held in singapore airlines that a question such as that which arises in present case whether an entity is a state so as to enjoy sovereign immunity in singapore is eminently a matter within exclusive province of executive to determine as what are involved in question are not only matters of fact but also matters of policy singapore airlines pp 578 579 para 22 thirdly apart from issues of foreign affairs and national defence there are other areas that are non justiciable such as interpretation of international treaties operating solely on international plane lee hsien loong p 490 para 97 this is illustrated by campaign for nuclear disarmament in which it was held that for court to assume jurisdiction in such areas would be an exorbitant arrogation of power as court could not presume that its ruling would bind other states campaign for nuclear disarmament para 37 another non justiciable area is where legislature has made it clear that a particular question is reserved to executive to answer as in singapore airlines which noted that section 18 of state immunity act requires those claiming sovereign immunity from lawsuits to first obtain certification from singapore government in such situations it is not for court to disregard executive s judgment judicial commissioner menon rejected a highly rigid and categorical approach to determining justiciability of an issue because theory of separation of powers is to be interpreted and applied sensibly intensity of review depends on context behind it and upon common sense lee hsien loong p 490 para 98 this was approach taken in marchiori v environment agency 2002 which noted that one context will shade into another marchiori para 39 he highlighted four principles that bear noting when determining whether an issue is justiciable lee hsien loong p 491 para 98 subject matter first justiciability of an issue depends on subject matter at hand and not source of decision making power this was principle stated in gchq and reiterated in campaign for nuclear disarmament campaign for nuclear disarmament para 50 where executive has best access to available materials its views should be decisive or at least highly persuasive it was acknowledged in singapore airlines that there may be matters of fact not in public domain which may be known only to executive where sensitive facts are concerned singapore s adversarial system is undesirable as parties must adduce evidence at a trial furthermore not all pertinent facts might be presented before court ability of judges to balance competing policy considerations where decision requires intricate balancing of various competing policy considerations judges may be ill equipped to decide because of their limited training experience and access to materials thus courts should avoid reviewing merits of such executive decisions this was mentioned in gchq where lord diplock held that type of evidence admissible in judicial process and way in which it is adduced tends to exclude from attention of court competing policy considerations which need to be weighed against one another gchq p 411 embarrassing or tying hands of executive court should abstain from interfering where a judicial pronouncement could embarrass another branch of government or tie its hands in conduct of affairs traditionally falling within its purview in campaign for nuclear disarmament divisional court of england and wales held that applicant s true purpose for seeking court s interpretation of a united nations security council resolution was to limit government s freedom in relation to use of military force and to exercise diplomatic pressure in advance thus matter should be regarded as non justiciable campaign for nuclear disarmament para 59 areas entrusted to democratically elected branches court should always exercise restraint and keep in mind fact that singapore system of government operates within framework of three co equal branches and there are areas of prerogative power that democratically elected branches are entrusted to take care of marchiori explained that graver a matter of state and more widespread its possible effects more respect will be given within framework of constitution to democracy to decide its outcome marchiori para 38 in such instances executive and legislature are accountable to electorate not judiciary those who are unsatisfied should sound their dissatisfaction in ballot box in lee hsien loong appellants which were in hong kong challenged jurisdiction of high court to hear a defamation suit brought by respondents on ground among others that service of writ should have been effected in accordance with civil procedure convention set down in treaty of judicial assistance in civil and commercial matters between republic of singapore and people s republic of china lee hsien loong p 458 paras 3 5 thus although this was not a judicial review case court had to consider justiciability of determining whether treaty applied to hong kong and whether court could depart from views of executive branch on matter which were stated in a letter issued by ministry of foreign affairs lee hsien loong p 480 para 75 court held that present case did not involve exercise of sovereign or legislative prerogative in matters of high policy rather it was concerned with effect and not making of treaty or whether it was advisable thus letter from ministry was not an exercise of executive prerogative power but merely a statement of opinion lee hsien loong p 491 para 100 furthermore appeal did not engage foreign policy considerations lee hsien loong p 492 para 102 treaty was a civil convention between two countries and an agreement to render mutual judicial assistance and had nothing to do with foreign affairs other than that it was made between state parties lee hsien loong p 496 para 118 it also did not involve policing of government conduct in international affairs because it only implicated procedures private litigants had to take to serve writs on defendants residing in hong kong when interpreting treaty court only had to determine domestic legal obligations of respondents seeking to serve a writ out of jurisdiction thus issue of whether treaty applied to hong kong was justiciable and ministry s letter was not decisive on matter lee hsien loong p 492 para 103 justiciability of prosecutorial discretion article 35 8 of constitution of singapore empowers attorney general to institute conduct or discontinue any criminal proceedings this provision confers wide discretionary powers upon attorney general however since unfettered discretion contradicts rule of law attorney general s powers are not absolute and are subject to legal limits chng suan tze p 533 para 86 in law society of singapore v tan guat neo phyllis 2008 a three judge bench of high court consisting of chief justice chan sek keong judge of appeal andrew phang and justice andrew ang held that although prosecutorial power is a constitutional power it is not absolute and its exercise can be challenged in very exceptional case s tan guat neo phyllis pp 313 314 paras 149 150 court held that it can judicially review exercise of prosecutorial power and declare a prosecution to be unconstitutional for breach of constitutional power for example if a prosecution is brought in bad faith for an ulterior motive and not to punish an accused person for an offence he or she committed a prosecution can also be found to have infringed accused person s constitutional rights this may happen if law enforcement officers themselves commit crimes by using agents provocateur in a particularly egregious manner to entrap accused persons into committing crimes and attorney general elects to prosecute only accused persons but not officers as this may infringe accused persons right to equality guaranteed by article 12 1 of constitution tan guat neo phyllis pp 312 314 paras 147 150 justiciability of clemency power traditionally at common law prerogative of mercy that is power of executive government to pardon or to grant clemency to a convicted criminal was regarded as outside courts supervisory jurisdiction and hence non justiciable this changed with divisional court s decision in r v secretary of state for home department ex parte bentley 1993 which held that prerogative of mercy is reviewable in some circumstances ex parte bentley pp 362 363 this case was considered by singapore court of appeal in yong vui kong v attorney general 2011 chief justice chan expressing opinion that case clearly decided that prerogative of mercy would be reviewable if it were exercised based on an error of law in that case home secretary s of type of pardon which home office could grant or based on arbitrary and or extraneous considerations though courts still cannot review merits of any clemency decision yong vui kong p 1218 para 44 in yong vui kong court described clemency power in singapore as vested exclusively in executive constitution art 22p and thus not justiciable on merits despite this it is not an extra legal power that is beyond any legal constraints yong vui kong p 1232 paras 75 76 agreeing with tan guat neo phyllis court held that clemency power is subject to judicial review if it can be shown to have been exercised unconstitutionally in bad faith or for extraneous purposes yong vui kong p 1234 para 80 citing tan guat neo phyllis p 313 para 149 in addition fact that article 22p 2 of constitution stipulates specific procedural safeguards in death penalty cases indicates that clemency power must be reviewable to ensure that these safeguards have been complied with article 22p 2 requires documents from trial judge and appellate court and attorney general s opinion on case to be sent to cabinet for consideration so that it can advise president on exercise of clemency power these procedural requirements imply that cabinet has a constitutional duty to consider documents in good faith before advising president if evidence is adduced to show that cabinet did not consider offender s case impartially and in good faith for example it never met to discuss case or tossed a coin instead of properly considering materials transmitted to it cabinet would have breached article 22p 2 in such a situation courts must be able to review clemency decision this conclusion is also mandated by guarantee in article 9 1 of constitution that a person may not be deprived of either life or personal liberty save in accordance with law yong vui kong pp 1234 1236 paras 81 86 exceptions even if subject matter of a case is generally non justiciable there are exceptions where courts will still review case for instance a dispute may prima facie involve a non justiciable area but on a closer look courts may decide that there is a justiciable matter within it in such a situation courts will intervene and review case an example of this was given by judicial commissioner menon in lee hsien loong w here what appears to raise a question of international law in fact bears on application of domestic law that is something court may well find justiciable in campaign for nuclear disarmament court similarly distinguished a pronouncement on interpretation of a treaty generally which is impermissible from consideration of application of an international treaty by reference to facts of an individual case which is allowed also in r v secretary of state for foreign and commonwealth affairs ex parte everett 1988 r v secretary of state for foreign and commonwealth affairs ex parte everett 1989 1 q b 811 c a england and wales court of appeal of england and wales took view that a decision by secretary of state exercised under royal prerogative to deny a passport to a british citizen residing abroad raised a justiciable issue because it was not a high policy matter involving foreign affairs but a matter of administrative decision affecting rights of individuals and their freedom of travel ex parte everett p 820 judicial commissioner menon also mentioned another exception to justiciability rule when courts are able to isolate a pure question of law from what is seemingly a non justiciable issue however judge did not explain this exception further and it has not yet
