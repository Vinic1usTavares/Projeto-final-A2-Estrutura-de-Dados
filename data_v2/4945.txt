first ostend raid part of operation zo was first of two attacks by royal navy on german held port of ostend during late spring of 1918 during first world war ostend was attacked in conjunction with neighbouring harbour of zeebrugge on 23 april in order to block vital strategic port of bruges situated inland and ideally sited to conduct raiding operations on british coastline and shipping lanes bruges and its satellite ports were a vital part of german plans in their war on allied commerce because bruges was close to troopship lanes across english channel and allowed much quicker access to western approaches for u boat fleet than their bases in germany plan of attack was for british raiding force to sink two obsolete cruisers in canal mouth at ostend and three at zeebrugge thus preventing raiding ships leaving bruges ostend canal was smaller and narrower of two channels giving access to bruges and so was considered a secondary target behind zeebrugge raid consequently fewer resources were provided to force assaulting ostend while attack at zeebrugge garnered some limited success assault on ostend was a complete failure german marines who defended port had taken careful preparations and drove british assault ships astray forcing abortion of operation at final stage three weeks after failure of operation a second attack was launched which proved more successful in sinking a blockship at entrance to canal but ultimately did not close off bruges completely further plans to attack ostend came to nothing during summer of 1918 and threat from bruges would not be finally stopped until last days of war when town was liberated by allied land forces bruges bruges had been captured by advancing german divisions during race for sea and had been rapidly identified as an important strategic asset by german navy bruges was situated inland at centre of a network of canals which emptied into sea at small coastal towns of zeebrugge and ostend this land barrier protected bruges from bombardment by land or sea by all but very largest calibre artillery and also secured it against raiding parties from royal navy capitalising on natural advantages of port german navy constructed extensive training and repair facilities at bruges equipped to provide support for several flotillas of destroyers torpedo boats and u boats messimer p 57 by 1916 these raiding forces were causing serious concern in admiralty as proximity of bruges to british coast to troopship lanes across english channel and for u boats to western approaches heaviest shipping lanes in world at time messimer p 58 in late spring of 1915 admiral reginald bacon had attempted without success to destroy lock gates at ostend with monitors messimer p 60 this effort failed and bruges became increasingly important in atlantic campaign which reached its height in 1917 by early 1918 admiralty was seeking ever more radical solutions to problems raised by unrestricted submarine warfare including instructing allied naval and marine forces department to plan attacks on u boat bases in belgium snelling p 200 allied naval and marine forces was a newly formed department created with purpose of conducting raids and operations along coastline of german held territory organisation was able to command extensive resources from both royal and french navies and was commanded by admiral roger keyes and his deputy commodore hubert lynes keyes lynes and their staff began planning methods of neutralising bruges in late 1917 and by april 1918 were ready to put their plans into operation planning thumb 150px right admiral roger keyes to block bruges keyes and lynes decided to conduct two raids on ports through which bruges had access to sea zeebrugge was to be attacked by a large force consisting of three blockships and numerous supporting warships ostend was faced by a similar but smaller force under immediate command of lynes plan was for two obsolete cruisers and to be expended in blocking canal which emptied at ostend these ships would be stripped to essential fittings and their lower holds and ballast filled with rubble and concrete this would make them ideal barriers to access if sunk in correct channel at correct angle bennett p 270 when weather was right force would cross english channel in darkness and attack shortly after midnight to coincide with zeebrugge raid a few miles up coast by co ordinating their operations assault forces would stretch german defenders and hopefully gain element of surprise covering inshore squadron would be heavy bombardment from an offshore squadron of monitors and destroyers as well as artillery support from royal marine artillery near ypres in allied held flanders closer support would be offered by several flotillas of motor launches small torpedo boats and coastal motor boats which would lay smoke screens to obscure advancing blockships as well as evacuate crews of cruisers after they had blocked channel british order of battle offshore squadron lord clive class monitors with guns and m15 class monitors with guns destroyers and french navy and light craft 4 torpedo boats 4 french motor launches inshore squadron blockships destroyers destroyer leader light craft 18 motor launches 8 coastal motor boats artillery support was also provided by royal marine heavy artillery in allied held flanders force was covered in english channel by seven light cruisers and 16 destroyers none of which saw action ellis cox p 223 attack on ostend assaults on zeebrugge and ostend were launched on 23 april after being twice delayed by poor weather ostend force arrived off port shortly before midnight and made final preparations monitors took up position offshore and small craft moved forward to begin laying smoke covering approach monitors opened fire on german shore defences including powerful tirpitz battery which carried guns messimer p 173 as a long range artillery duel developed cruisers began their advance towards harbour mouth searching for marker buoys which indicated correct passage through diverse sandbanks which made navigation difficult along belgian coast it was at this stage that attack began to go seriously wrong strong winds blowing off land swept smoke screen into face of advancing cruisers blinding their commanders who attempted to navigate by dead reckoning same wind disclosed inshore squadron to german defenders who immediately opened up a withering fire on blockships with their volunteer crews suffering heavy casualties commanders increased speed despite poor visibility and continued groping through narrow channels inshore searching for bank buoy which directed shipping into canal commander alfred godsal led assault in hms brilliant and it was he who stumbled into most effective german counter measure first as brilliant staggered through murk lookout spotted buoy ahead and godsal headed directly for it coming under even heavier fire as he did so passing navigation marker at speed cruiser was suddenly brought to a halt with a juddering lurch throwing men to decks and sticking fast in deep mud well outside harbour mouth before warnings could be relayed to sirius following up close behind she too passed buoy and her captain lieutenant commander henry hardy was shocked to see brilliant dead ahead with no time to manoeuvre sirius ploughed into port quarter of brilliant blockships settling into mud in a tangle of wreckage artillery and long range machine gun fire continued to riddle wrecks and combined crews were ordered to evacuate as officers set scuttling charges which would sink blockships in their current useless locations perrett p 225 as men scrambled down side of cruisers into coastal motor boats which would relay them to offshore squadron destroyers moved closer to ostend to cover retreat and monitors continued their heavy fire godsal was last to leave picked up by launch commanded by lieutenant rowley bourke with main assault a complete failure blockading forces returned to dover and dunkirk to assess disaster messimer p 175 their lordships will share our disappointment at defeat of our plans by legitimate ruse of enemy admiral keyes report to admiralty bennett p 276 when forces had reassembled and commanders conferred full facts of failed operation were revealed german commander of ostend had been better prepared than his counterpart at zeebrugge and had recognised that without navigation buoy no night attack on ostend could be successful without a strong familiarity with port which none of british navigators possessed however rather than simply remove buoy german commander had ordered it moved east of canal mouth into centre of a wide expanse of sandbanks acting as a fatal decoy for any assault force arthur p 364 aftermath assault at zeebrugge a few miles away from ostend was more successful and blocking of major channel did cause some consternation amongst german forces in bruges larger raiders could no longer leave port but smaller ships including most submarines were still able to traverse via ostend in addition within hours a narrow channel had also been carved through zeebrugge too although british intelligence did not realise this for several weeks defeat at ostend did not entirely dampen exuberant british media and public reaction to zeebrugge but in admiralty and particularly in allied naval and marine forces failure to completely neutralise bruges rankled snelling p 248 a second operation was planned for 10 may using cruiser and proved more successful but ultimately it also failed to completely close off bruges messimer p 176 a third planned operation was never conducted as it rapidly became clear that new channel carved at zeebrugge was enough to allow access for u boats thus calling for an even larger double assault which would stretch resources of allied naval and marine forces too far perrett p 226 british losses in three futile attempts to close bruges cost over 600 casualties and loss of several ships but bruges would remain an active raiding base for german navy until october 1918 tarrant p 62 notes footnotes references
