candidates in massachusetts elections of 1854 born in dorchester gardner was a dry goods merchant from boston active in local whig party in early 1850s with sudden and secretive rise of nativist know nothings in 1854 gardner opportunistically repudiated previously held positions and joined movement winning a landslide victory over whig emory washburn during his three terms in office know nothing legislatures enacted legislation on a wide ranging reform agenda and made several significant changes to state constitution including important electoral reforms such as replacement of majority voting with plurality voting know nothing movement began to disintegrate not long after its 1854 victory dividing over slavery gardner won reelection in 1856 only with republican support given in exchange for know nothing support for republican presidential candidate john fremont republican nathaniel prentice banks easily defeated gardner in 1857 and know nothing movement effectively dissolved by 1860 gardner had left politics and returned to his business interests he died in relative obscurity early life henry joseph gardner was born in dorchester massachusetts then a community separate from

elected to boston city council serving until 1853 he was a moderately conservative websterite whig who was involved in state party organization serving on its central organizing committee in 1854 he broke with whigs over their support of pro slavery kansas nebraska act and became involved in nativist know nothing movement anbinder p 91 this shift in position was fairly radical on gardner s part and was viewed by contemporaries and recent historians as politically opportunist mulkern p 96 prior to joining know nothings he had not displayed any nativist sentiments and had even supported an irish american in a bid to become justice of peace he also switched from a moderate websterite position on slavery to an abolitionist stance and supported positions on prohibition of alcohol that he had previously opposed whig statesman edward everett described gardner as a man of some cleverness but no solidity of character p 136 know nothing convention in october 1854 chose gardner as its gubernatorial candidate anbinder p 90 in part because his stand on slavery was not as radical as that of republican candidate henry wilson who was also seeking know nothing support wilson eventually made a deal with know nothings withdrawing from race at last moment in exchange for know nothing support in a united states senate bid campaign was relatively sedate because both whigs and democrats did not organize large scale events larger parties may have been concerned that rallies would be poorly attended due to defections to know nothings aristocratic whigs fielded incumbent governor emory washburn to stand for reelection they were particularly dismissive of know nothings one commentator described know nothing ticket as ministers lying and priests who were led by that rickety vermin of a henry j gardner mulkern p 75 gardner was however optimistic warning one journalist that he would win by a large majority election was a landslide gardner won 79 of vote and state legislature and congressional delegation were almost entirely populated by know nothings anbinder p 92 governor of massachusetts legislature elected in know nothing sweep was unlike any that preceded it almost all of its members were new to elected office 1855 session was one of most productive in state s history with about 600 bills and resolutions passed in his inaugural address gardner set what he hoped was a tone that would solidify his position has party leader speech focused almost to exclusion on nativist issues and included hyperbolic claims that level of immigration was reaching crisis proportions gardner notably omitted popular substantive reform issues such as ten hour workday and also avoided contentious subject of slavery mulkern pp 95 96 107 reforms 1855 legislature passed a wide variety of reform legislation most of which gardner signed a board of insurance with broad powers of inspection was created bankruptcy laws were changed to benefit lower class individuals imprisonment for

major reforms that was not enacted despite vigorous debate was legislation calling for a ten hour workday formisano p 340 several amendments to state constitution were enacted during gardner s term all of them originated in 1853 constitutional convention whose proposals although popular were poorly organized and defeated in a popular referendum plurality voting which had previously been enacted legislatively to apply to federal elections was extended to state elections more state executive offices were made elective including governor s council attorney general secretary of state auditor and treasurer state s rules for districting were reformed so that they were based on districts drawn by population instead of by towns formisano pp 334 335 one reform that was immediately a subject of controversy was a harsh prohibition law which criminalized service of a glass of grog with a six month jail sentence bill signed into law by gardner was immediately protested and legislators who passed it were later criticized for charging bar tabs to state when they traveled mulkern pp 101 102 nativist issues some legislation and executive action was squarely aimed at addressing nativist concerns so called foreign militia composed of irish immigrants were disbanded and foreigners were not allowed in police forces or state government jobs formisano p 334 state deported more than 1 000 allegedly indigent aliens inciting protest over abuses one notable case involved deportation to liverpool of a woman with an american born infant without any means of support gardner reported that state saved 100 000 by this process mulkern p 103 most scandalous aspect of nativist agenda was legislature s investigation of alleged abuses in roman catholic boarding houses joseph hiss one of principal investigators was reported to have made lewd remarks to nuns in these establishments and was later found to engage in drinking and hiring of prostitutes scandal received a great deal of press and badly tarnished know nothings voss hubbard 2002 p 170 slavery before gardner s election on may 24 1854 anthony burns was arrested in boston as a fugitive under fugitive slave law of 1850 von frank p 1 edward g loring a suffolk county probate judge who also served as u s commissioner of circuit court in massachusetts ordered that burns be forced back into slavery in virginia outraging abolitionists and increasingly antislavery public in massachusetts under pressure of a public petition campaign spearheaded by william lloyd garrison legislature passed two bills of address in 1855 and 1856 calling for judge loring to be removed from his state office but in both cases gardner declined to remove loring a third bill of address to remove loring from office was later approved by gardner s republican successor nathaniel prentice banks voss hubbard 1995 pp 173 174 know nothing legislature also passed over gardner s veto one of most stringent personal liberty laws designed to make enforcement of fugitive slave act of 1850 as difficult for slave claimants as possible voss hubbard 2002 p 172 gardner said that law would exacerbate relations between north and south and called for its repeal voss hubbard 1995 p 173 minority parties in legislature sought to weaken bill but its major provisions including rights of habeas corpus jury trial and state funded defense survived voss hubbard 1995 pp 175 177 later elections thumb right upright nathaniel prentice banks a former know nothing defeated gardner in 1857 in 1855 national know nothing convention split on subject of slavery prominent antislavery know nothing supporters in massachusetts including henry wilson began another attempt after having failed in 1854 to form a party with abolition as a major focus duberman pp 364 365 this effort resulted in formation of republican party which sought to negotiate with know nothings for a fusion of two parties however massachusetts know nothing leadership refused fusion and republican leadership refused coalition duberman p 366 with many republicans skeptical of gardner s fidelity to antislavery cause despite his support for fusion duberman p 367 parties ended up fielding separate slates of candidates and many know nothing politicians and supporters switched allegiance in fall election gardner running on a strictly nativist platform garnered 38 of vote to 27 of republican julius rockwell with new plurality voting rule in effect gardner won election duberman pp 368 369 but split and disaffection in some circles with know nothing agenda cost him support from former free soilers and democrats baum pp 966 967 in 1856 election gardner benefited from a deal with republicans who refused to run a candidate for governor in exchange for know nothing support for their presidential candidate john c fremont he easily won reelection although many republicans voted for a protest candidate instead of supporting him baum pp 968 969 he attempted to parlay republican support into an election to united states senate a matter then decided by state senate early in its session replacing charles sumner however republican operatives maneuvered senate into voting before gardner s speech opening 1857 session and sumner was easily reelected donald pp 320 322 although nation was wracked by panic of 1857 and bleeding kansas election in massachusetts that year hinged on other factors gardner was opposed by republican and former know nothing nathaniel prentice banks and democrat erasmus beach gardner was accused of having become little more than a tool of formerly whig industrial interests and banks was adept at bringing many former know nothings into his camp most importantly john z goodrich who attested to banks strong antislavery credentials gardner sought to focus contests on local issues but slavery predominated as an issue stampp p 242 and banks won a comfortable victory p 35 in 1858 gardner sought to bring what remained of know nothings into a coalition with democrats but his attempts to find a suitable candidate were unsuccessful that year s know nothing candidate amos a lawrence trailed well behind banks baum pp 972 973
