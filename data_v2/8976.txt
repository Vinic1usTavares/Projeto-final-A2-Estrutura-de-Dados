it was worth trying out and that time creators had put into making game was obvious jose rodriguez of website ign praised deep and realistic story and said that game gave priority to narrative and that it will appeal to casual gamers because of its realism and leisurely gameplay rodriguez criticised duration of game saying that it is quite short for its price andrea maderna also from ign said that game was not suited for everybody but that those who appreciate games based on interactive storytelling should try playing it colin campbell from website polygon described game as emotional and compared gloomy visual tones to another video game that dragon cancer campbell said that fragments of him took time to rise to its emotional peak but when it does it reaches it with a searing and open humanity that connects player with each of game s characters he continued by saying that game contained excellent voice acting and writing laura kate dale writing for blog destructoid also compared fragments of him to that dragon cancer many reviewers praised game s narrative andrea maderna said that it gave off an emotional vibe and had fantastic narrative choices and structure though player s role is limited laura kate dale was disappointed saying that narrative would shine more in form of a short film as it seemed more impressive when it was a five minute convention floor demo than as a two and a half hour long finished product eric swain of on line magazine popmatters said that he found himself asking why is this a game and suggested that it would work better as an audio drama game
