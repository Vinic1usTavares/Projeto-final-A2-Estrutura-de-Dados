1971 atlantic hurricane season was fairly active with several notable storms hurricane edith strongest of season was a category 5 on saffir simpson scale highest category on scale it struck nicaragua at peak intensity killing dozens and later hit southern louisiana until 2003 hurricane ginger held record for longest known duration of a north atlantic tropical cyclone lasting 27 25 days from early september to early october it is currently second longest lasting atlantic hurricane ginger moved ashore in north carolina producing heavy rains and damaging winds an unnamed storm in august attained hurricane status further north than any other atlantic hurricane between 11 and 12 september five tropical cyclones were active at same time record for atlantic basin season officially began on june 1 and lasted until november 30 1971 these dates conventionally delimit period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in atlantic basin with thirteen tropical storms of which six became hurricanes season was active despite activity damage in united states totaled about 235 million 1971 usd usd which national hurricane center forecaster paul hebert noted was pretty small considering we had five storms in a row strike u s most of damage came from tropical storm doria which affected much of east coast of united states hurricane fern struck texas after executing an unusual track dropping heavy rainfall and producing flooding first storm arlene developed on july 4 off coast of north carolina activity was steady through most of season and last storm laura dissipated on november 22 systems tropical storm arlene origins of arlene were from a cold front that exited east coast of united states on july 2 and stalled offshore a frontal wave developed next day steadily developing due to thermal instability on july 4 system organized into a tropical depression about 120 mi 195 km southeast of cape hatteras north carolina while in its formative stages it dropped rainfall along coast of carolinas peaking at in south carolina depression tracked northeastward due to a ridge over new england and cyclone passed just southeast of outer banks after a hurricane hunters plane observed gale force winds depression was upgraded to tropical storm arlene late on july 5 in post season summary meteorologist neil frank noted surprising element in development of arlene was rapidity of transformation process upon being named arlene continued northeastward possessing a circular mass of convection with spiral rainbands late on july 6 storm attained peak winds of 65 mph 100 km h based on a ship report it weakened thereafter and arlene transitioned into an extratropical cyclone late on july 7 just south of newfoundland cyclone last observed early following day storm capsized a boat in grand banks of newfoundland and crew of 12 was rescued hurricane two a hybrid type depression formed east of bermuda on july 29 it moved rapidly southwestward before turning to a northwest drift on august 3 it was classified as a tropical depression and next day system passed near bermuda depression accelerated to northeast strengthening into a tropical storm on august 5 it intensified further due to baroclinity or enhanced instability through different levels of atmosphere caused by temperature and moisture gradients on august 6 a drilling rig about southeast of newfoundland recorded sustained winds of with gusts to 126 mph 204 km h at an altitude of this suggested storm attained hurricane status at north which is northernmost location for a tropical storm to intensify into a hurricane despite intensity cyclone was not purely tropical although radius of maximum winds was only thermal structure did not resemble a tropical cyclone and there was no precipitation or convection near center it continued northeastward and dissipated on august 7 to southwest of greenland it was not named operationally but it was later added to atlantic hurricane database hurricane beth on august 9 an upper level low developed off coast of florida and next day spawned a tropical depression newly developed cyclone tracked slowly northeastward eventually encountering conditions favorable for development on august 14 depression intensified into tropical storm beth off coast of north carolina and it quickly strengthened into a hurricane by august 15 after reaching peak winds of off coast of cape cod beth slightly weakened and later moved ashore near copper lake nova scotia shortly thereafter beth was swept up by a nearby cold front and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone hurricane left extensive damage in its wake especially to crops and infrastructure halifax international airport reported 10 49 in 266 mm of rainfall in a 30 hour span which caused widespread flooding several bridges in region were washed out while railways were covered by water forcing trains to suspend their operation overall monetary damage from beth is estimated up to 5 1 million 1971 usd usd one person was indirectly killed by hurricane in a traffic accident induced by heavy rainfall tropical depression eight on august 11 tropical depression eight developed southwest of fort myers florida it quickly moved ashore reaching lake okeechobee before looping to northwest while moving across state it dropped heavy rainfall of around along west coast in pinellas park heavy rains led to flash flooding that forced 200 families from their house including one that required evacuation from a helicopter damage in region was estimated at 250 000 1971 usd usd depression emerged into gulf of mexico on august 15 near tampa and later turned to northeast ahead of an upper level low on august 16 it intensified as it moved ashore near cedar key where hurricane force wind gusts were briefly observed depression dissipated on august 17 over south carolina although in that state it produced its heaviest rainfall totaling in sullivan s island in nearby savannah georgia rainfall forced about 100 families from their houses in low lying areas remnants continued northeastward through mid atlantic states and new england crossing into canada on august 20 tropical storm chloe a tropical wave moved off coast of africa on august 13 moving westward for several days before organizing into a tropical depression on august 18 about east of barbados it quickly moved through lesser antilles where it produced wind gusts up to cyclone also dropped heavy rainfall up to on barbados and martinique after entering eastern caribbean sea depression intensified into tropical storm chloe on august 20 about 18 hours after attaining tropical storm status chloe quickly strengthened to peak winds of about 215 mi 345 km south of mona passage as reported by reconnaissance aircraft after reaching peak intensity chloe began weakening as it turned to west southwest and late on august 22 it was downgraded to a tropical depression as a weakening ridge to its north cut off low level inflow for several days it continued generally westward gradually losing organization while passing south of jamaica storm prompted evacuation of ss hope a hospital ship at kingston on august 25 chloe moved ashore in belize as a weak tropical depression and dissipated shortly thereafter without ever having caused significant damage or deaths remnants of chloe later spawned hurricane lily in eastern pacific ocean tropical storm doria tropical storm doria costliest storm of season developed from a tropical wave on august 20 to east of lesser antilles and after five days without development attained tropical storm status to east of florida doria turned to north and reached peak winds of 65 mph 105 km h as it was making landfall near morehead city north carolina it turned to northeast and moved through mid atlantic and new england as a tropical storm before becoming an extratropical storm over maine on august 29 in north carolina doria produced moderate rainfall resulting in localized flooding and damage storm spawned a tornado near norfolk virginia damaging twelve houses and downing hundreds of trees tropical storm doria dropped heavy precipitation in new jersey peaking at 10 29 in 261 mm in little falls rainfall led to record breaking river levels and flooding in several houses resulting in damage to dozens of houses across state moderate damage and rainfall continued along its path into new england and southeastern canada in all tropical storm doria caused seven deaths and 147 6 million 1971 usd usd hurricane fern hurricane fern was first of four tropical systems to develop in association with an extended surface trough across gulf of mexico into open atlantic along with ginger heidi and a strong tropical depression fern developed on september 3 in central gulf of mexico it moved over southern louisiana next day but due to increased ridging to north depression moved southwestward back over water on september 7 depression intensified into tropical storm fern it is rare for a tropical depression to move over land in continental united states excluding florida and later attain tropical storm status fern later turned to northwest intensifying into a hurricane on september 8 it quickly reached peak winds of but later weakened as it curved to southwest moving ashore on september 10 between freeport and matagorda texas as a tropical storm fern dissipated on september 13 over northeastern mexico precursor of fern dropped rainfall up to of rainfall across south florida while totals of up to were reported in southeastern louisiana where it made its first landfall as it struck texas fern produced strong winds up to along with storm tides and heavy rainfall highest precipitation total was in heavy rainfall caused severe flash flooding that isolated numerous small towns in southeastern portion of state damaging 7 500 buildings in all fern left two indirect deaths and moderate damage totaling 30 2 million 1971 usd usd hurricane edith hurricane edith strongest storm of season developed from a tropical wave on september 5 to east of southern lesser antilles it moved quickly across southern caribbean sea intensifying into a hurricane just off north coast of south america edith rapidly intensified on september 9 and made landfall on cape gracias a dios as a category 5 hurricane on saffir simpson hurricane scale it quickly lost intensity over central america and after briefly entering gulf of honduras it crossed yucatan peninsula in mexico after moving across gulf of mexico a trough turned storm to northeast and edith after having restrengthened while accelerating towards coast made landfall on louisiana with winds of 105 mph 170 km h on september 16 edith steadily weakened over land and dissipated over georgia on september 18 hurricane killed two people when it passed near aruba striking northeastern central america as a category 5 hurricane edith destroyed hundreds of homes and killed at least 35 people in texas high tides caused coastal flooding but little damage edith caused moderate to heavy damage in portions of louisiana due to flooding and a tornado outbreak from storm one tornado rated f3 on fujita scale damaged several homes and injured multiple people in baton rouge tornado outbreak extended eastward into florida damage in united states totaled 25 million 1971 usd usd hurricane ginger hurricane ginger was longest lasting atlantic hurricane on record until 2003 when 1899 san ciriaco hurricane was retroactively found to have lasted longer eighth tropical cyclone and fifth hurricane of season ginger spent 27 25 days as a tropical cyclone and lasted from september 6 to october 3 storm developed in a large region of convection across gulf of mexico and western atlantic and for first nine days of its duration tracked generally east or northeastward while gradually strengthening to peak winds of 110 mph 175 km h on september 14 ginger slowed and turned to a general westward track passing near bermuda on september 23 there hurricane produced gusty winds and high waves but no damage while over western atlantic ocean ginger became last target of project stormfury which sought to weaken hurricanes by depositing silver iodide into tropical cyclone rainbands plane dropped silver iodide into center of ginger although there was no effect due to ginger s large eye and diffuse nature ginger was last seeding done by project ginger ultimately struck north carolina on september 30 as a minimal hurricane lashing coastline with gusty winds that caused power outages across region heavy rainfall flooded towns and left heavy crop damage with 3 million bushels of corn and 1 million bushels of soybean lost damage in state was estimated at 10 million 1971 usd usd further north moderate rainfall and winds spread through mid atlantic states although no significant damage was reported outside of north carolina tropical storm heidi tropical storm heidi was last of four tropical systems to develop from extended surface trough of low pressure forming on september 11 northeast of bahamas and intensifying into a tropical storm next day after initially moving to northwest heidi curved northeastward and attained its peak intensity of 65 mph 100 km h on september 14 off coast of virginia storm failed to become a well organized system and it gradually weakened while accelerating north northeastward on september 15 shortly after heidi moved ashore in maine it was absorbed by a broad extratropical cyclone over northern appalachians heidi did not directly cause any fatalities or severe damage however larger extratropical storm drew in moisture from heidi producing rainfall from north carolina through northern new england including a peak of in southeastern pennsylvania heavy rains triggered extensive flooding that caused over a dozen fatalities and left thousands of residents homeless in pennsylvania and new jersey in chester pennsylvania a stone dam collapsed forcing hundreds of families to evacuate and damaging homes businesses roads and bridges governor milton declared a state of emergency in several pennsylvania counties following floods hurricane irene a tropical wave spawned a tropical depression on september 11 about 800 mi 1300 km east of windward islands cyclone tracked nearly due westward at a low latitude passing through southern windward islands and later over northern south america in southwest caribbean sea it intensified to a tropical storm and later a hurricane irene made landfall on southeastern nicaragua on september 19 and maintained its circulation as it crossed low lying terrain of country restrengthening after reaching pacific irene was renamed hurricane olivia which ultimately attained peak winds of 115 mph 185 km h before weakening and dissipating over northwestern mexico in atlantic irene produced moderate rainfall and winds along its path although impact was greatest in nicaragua where it moved ashore as a hurricane a total of 96 homes were destroyed and 1 200 people were left homeless rainfall resulted in widespread flooding killing three people in rivas in neighboring costa rica hurricane irene caused more than 1 million 1971 usd usd in damage to banana crop hurricane was first actively tracked tropical cyclone that moved into eastern pacific ocean from atlantic ocean tropical storm janice origins of janice were from a tropical wave that moved off coast of africa on september 18 it developed into a tropical depression on september 21 about 1050 mi 1700 km west southwest of cape verde which was easternmost formation of named storms this season next day depression intensified into tropical storm janice and quickly reached peak winds of storm never became well organized with its peak winds located east of broad center despite being in a climatologically favored region for further development janice weakened due to increased wind shear from hurricane ginger circulation became elongated and separated from convection and on september 24 storm weakened to a tropical depression later that day janice dissipated just northeast of lesser antilles as it was absorbed by ginger around that time it produced rainfall in northeastern caribbean reaching on saint kitts no damage or fatalities were reported tropical storm kristy interaction between a tropical wave and an upper level trough led to development of a tropical depression on october 18 about 685 mi 1100 km northeast of puerto rico it moved quickly north northeastward followed by a curve to northeast on october 20 a ship reported winds of indicating depression intensified into tropical storm kristy as it reached this strength an approaching cold front produced cooler drier air over storm kristy intensified slightly further to peak winds of 50 mph 85 km h before becoming indistinguishable from cold front by october 21 it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone before dissipating near azores tropical storm laura final storm of season laura formed on november 12 in western caribbean sea and reached winds of 70 mph 120 km h as it approached western cuba across island storm produced heavy rainfall peaking at 32 5 in 830 mm resulting flooding killed one person and caused crop damage and also forced 26 000 people to evacuate their homes initially laura was forecast to move across island and impact southern united states but it executed a small loop and turned to southwest storm moved ashore on belize one of only four november storms to affect country little impact occurred during laura s final landfall and it dissipated on november 22 over central guatemala other systems thumb right 300px tracks of all depressions during 1971 in addition to named storms and otherwise notable cyclones there were several weak depressions during season after a june devoid of activity three tropical depressions developed within first ten days of july first became tropical storm arlene on july 4 and second formed off coast of louisiana on july 6 tropical depression two moved westward due to a ridge to its northeast and it struck just west of texas louisiana border before dissipating on july 8 its precursor dropped near carrabelle florida but much less along its path just two days later another tropical depression formed in northwestern gulf of mexico quickly moving ashore in southern texas before dissipating on july 11 it dropped light rainfall along its path in august there were two tropical depressions in addition to named storms and notable tropical depression eight first tropical depression five developed in central gulf of mexico on august 6 it made landfall in louisiana three days later eventually dissipating over mississippi other designated tropical depression eleven formed over bahamas on august 28 it moved westward crossing florida and gulf of mexico before dissipating over southeastern louisiana on september 1 depression dropped moderate rainfall along gulf coast peaking at at gulf shores alabama there were three non developing tropical depressions in september first of which just off coast of africa on september 3 it moved west northwestward passing near cape verde before dissipating on september 8 next tropical depression eighteen originated on september 8 east of florida from same trough that also spawned fern ginger and heidi it initially moved northward before curving to west making landfall near georgia south carolina border on september 11 before dissipating following day other tropical depression nineteen developed off coast of africa on september 10 moving westward before dissipating on september 14 final non developing tropical depression of season formed on october 6 in western caribbean sea it crossed yucatan peninsula next day dropping heavy rainfall up to depression turned to northeast due to an approaching upper level trough and it transitioned into a frontal wave on october 10 as trough advanced ahead of storm a ridge built across southeast united states causing cyclone to turn northward and parallel west coast of florida it regained tropical characteristics before moving ashore near apalachicola and dissipating on october 14 storm names following names were used for named storms tropical storms and hurricanes that formed in north atlantic in 1971 names that were not assigned are
