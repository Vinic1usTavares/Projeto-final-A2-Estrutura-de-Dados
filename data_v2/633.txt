a6 motorway is a motorway in croatia spanning it connects nation s capital zagreb via a1 to seaport of rijeka motorway forms a major north south transportation corridor in croatia and is a part of european route e65 nagykanizsa zagreb rijeka zadar split dubrovnik podgorica a6 motorway route also follows pan european corridor vb a6 motorway runs near a number of croatian cities provides access to risnjak national park and indirectly to numerous resorts notably in istria and kvarner gulf regions motorway route was completed in 2008 motorway is nationally significant because of its positive economic impact on cities and towns it connects and because of its contribution to tourism in croatia importance of motorway as a transit route will be further increased upon completion of a proposed expansion of port of rijeka and rijeka transport node thumb left 250px alt a trumpet motorway interchange bosiljevo 2 interchange northern terminus of a6 motorway motorway consists of two traffic lanes and an emergency lane in each driving direction separated by a central reservation sections of motorway that have a gradient greater than 4 are divided into three lanes to prevent traffic problems caused by slower vehicles these sections have no emergency lanes similarly there are no emergency lanes in tunnels all intersections of a6 motorway are grade separated as route traverses rugged mountains it requires numerous long bridges viaducts tunnels and other structures as of 2010 there are nine exits and three rest areas situated along route majority of motorway is a ticket system toll road with pricing tied to vehicle classification each exit between grobnik mainline toll plaza and bosiljevo 2 interchange has a toll plaza no toll is charged at bosiljevo 2 where traffic switches to a1 motorway traffic is tolled upon leaving a1 motorway exits between mainline toll plaza and orehovica interchange have no toll plazas as that part of a6 route is not tolled a motorway connecting zagreb and rijeka was originally designed in early 1970s and construction started north of rijeka and south of zagreb first section between rijeka and kikovica opened on september 9 1972 and a zagreb karlovac section followed on december 29 1972 those sections were first modern motorways to be built in croatia and yugoslavia due to political upheavals in croatia and yugoslavia construction of motorway was labeled a nationalist project and along with proposed zagreb split motorway was cancelled in 1971 after croatian war of independence efforts to build motorway were renewed and construction resumed in 1996 in 2004 a two lane single carriageway expressway was completed between sections completed 25 years previously and second carriageway was built motorway was completed on october 22 2008 construction costs are estimated at 661 5 million euro although hrvatske autoceste normally designs builds and operates motorways in croatia a6 motorway is operated and maintained by autocesta rijeka zagreb route description thumb left 200px alt a trumpet motorway interchange orehovica interchange southern terminus of a6 motorway a6 motorway is a significant north south motorway in croatia connecting largest seaport of country rijeka to its hinterland and to rest of croatian motorway network via a1 motorway bosiljevo 2 interchange motorway follows a route through gorski kotar region part of road network of croatia motorway is also part of european route e65 nagykanizsa zagreb rijeka zadar split dubrovnik podgorica motorway is of major importance to croatia in terms of development of economy it is especially important for tourism and as a transit transport route road serves tourist resorts in istria and kvarner gulf islands because of link formed between zagreb and rijeka tourism related traffic originating from countries neighbouring croatia to north flows via this road to adriatic coast on south road also serves tourists originating in northern inland areas of croatia a6 route predominantly follows an east west orientation but motorway is locally regarded as a north south communication ultimate importance of motorway as a transit route shall be achieved upon completion of proposed expansion of port of rijeka and rijeka transport node expansion is planned to encompass an enhancement of cargo handling capacity of port of rijeka improved railroad links and a new rijeka bypass motorway linking a6 via a new interchange with present routes of a7 and a8 motorways one of aims of project is to increase traffic along a6 route as of june 1997 pan european transport conference in helsinki motorway is a part of pan european corridor vb motorway spans between bosiljevo 2 interchange and rijeka orehovica interchange on a7 motorway route serves vrbovsko via d42 delnice via d3 crikvenica and krk via and bakar via d40 state road route is complete and further development of motorway includes only construction of additional rest areas a6 motorway consists of at least two traffic lanes and an emergency lane in each driving direction along its entire length except in tunnels where there are emergency bays instead sections of a6 motorway steeper than 4 grade have three traffic lanes and slow vehicles are restricted to driving in rightmost lane all of interchanges are trumpet interchanges there are a number of rest areas along motorway providing various types of services ranging from simple parking spaces and restrooms to filling stations restaurants and hotels as of october 2010 motorway has nine interchanges providing access to numerous towns and cities and croatian state road network motorway is operated by autocesta rijeka zagreb thumb right 250px alt variable traffic signs placed on a gantry spanning three motorway traffic lanes indicating slippery pavement and reduced speed limit variable traffic signs on a6 an automatic traffic monitoring and guidance system is in place along motorway it consists of measuring control and signalling devices located in zones where driving conditions may vary at interchanges near viaducts bridges tunnels and in zones where fog and strong wind are known to occur system comprises variable traffic signs used to communicate changing driving conditions possible restrictions and other information to motorway users a6 motorway mainly runs through mountainous gorski kotar region requiring not only large bridges and viaducts and long tunnels along route but also special care must be paid to protection of environment as route is located in karst terrain with numerous water supply protection zones and significant natural heritage risnjak national park is located near a6 route and is accessed via delnice interchange due to motorway access and its proximity to a number of seaside resorts risnjak is most visited national park in croatia karst terrain is especially susceptible to water pollution so a6 motorway is equipped with a closed water drainage system designed to channel rainwater meltwater and any to purpose built processing facilities approximately 200 karst features caves and other types of karst features were observed and protected during construction of motorway an extraordinary example of this was a cavern long by wide and tall found during execution of long vrata tunnel cavern was bridged by one of tunnel tubes which was sealed to protect cavern and water flowing through it toll thumb right 250px alt six lane toll plaza with variable traffic signs placed above toll plaza gates ostrovica toll plaza a6 is a tolled motorway based on vehicle classification in croatia using a closed toll system integrated with a1 motorway two roads connect at bosiljevo 2 interchange forming a unified toll system since a1 motorway is operated jointly by autocesta rijeka zagreb and hrvatske autoceste toll collection system is operated jointly by two operators as of october 2010 toll charged along a6 route between bosiljevo 2 interchange a1 bosiljevo exit and kikovica mainline toll plaza varies depending on length of route travelled and ranges from 6 00 kuna 0 82 euros to 33 00 kuna 4 52 euros for passenger cars and 25 00 kuna 3 42 euro to 139 00 kuna 19 04 euro for semi trailer trucks toll is payable in either croatian kuna or euros and by major credit cards and debit cards a number of prepaid toll collection systems are also used including various types of smart cards issued by motorway operator and enc an electronic toll collection etc system which is shared by most motorways in croatia and provides drivers with discounted toll rates for dedicated lanes at toll plazas toll collected by autocesta rijeka zagreb for use of a6 motorway is not reported separately autocesta rijeka zagreb only reports it total toll revenue including toll revenue collected on a7 motorway rupa jurdani section and a1 motorway lucko bosiljevo 2 section as well as on krk bridge in first half of 2010 their toll revenue was 188 2 million

by german motoring club adac tested tuhobic tunnel twice once in 2004 when it achieved poor results and again in 2009 after implementation of eurotap safety recommendations 2009 test ranked tunnel as second safest in europe an unusual feature associated with a6 tunnels is close proximity of javorova kosa and podvugles tunnels they are separated by less than of road in order to prevent abrupt changes in road conditions caused by weather distance between tunnels is covered by translucent roofing tunnels are located on vrbovsko ravna gora section other significant tunnels on a6 motorway are veliki glozac and vrata tunnels while former as with all other tunnels mentioned is significant due to its length latter is notable for large cavern encountered during its excavation most significant bridges and viaducts on a6 motorway route are bajer bridge spanning lake bajer near fuzine on vrata ostrovica section and zeceve drage and severinske drage viaducts two viaducts are and long

direction and speed limit enforced are visible at tunnel entrance and to side of road tuhobic tunnel longest tunnel on a6 route transport links between rijeka and zagreb have always been of substantial importance because of transport requirements of port of rijeka this was first recognised by habsburg empire in 1728 when carolina road was completed and again in 1780 when road was modernized original rijeka zagreb road was replaced in 1811 by a new route louisiana road in order to avoid steep sections of its predecessor new road remained primary transport link to rijeka until 1873 when first railroad to city was built further development of port and industry in rijeka and zagreb required a more efficient road which was built in 1954 that road was to remain principal road transport link between two cities for decades zagreb rijeka motorway of which a6 motorway is a part was one of three routes defined in 1971 as priority transport routes of yugoslavia that were to be developed as motorways first section of a6 motorway between orehovica and kikovica was long and opened on september 9 1972 section was also first six lane motorway built in yugoslavia long zagreb karlovac section now designated a1 motorway was completed on december 29 1972 further construction was suspended for following 25 years as a political decision had been made by yugoslav leadership to withdraw funding for construction funds were instead allocated to construction of a motorway that would travel between ljubljana zagreb belgrade and skopje then known as brotherhood and unity highway croatian section of highway later became a3 motorway after breakup of yugoslavia construction of rijeka zagreb motorway was still on hold due to croatian war of independence and no further construction took place until 1996 sole exception to 25 year long hiatus was long kikovica ostrovica section which was originally executed as an expressway and opened in 1982 in 1996 construction of a6 motorway resumed and in 1997 a further of expressway between ostrovica and kupjak was completed in december 1997 government of republic of croatia founded autocesta rijeka zagreb company and tasked it with operating completed sections of motorway and construction of remainder of route new motorway operator resumed construction in three stages during first stage of expressway between kupjak and karlovac were completed by end of june 2004 comprising of motorway and semi motorway in second stage expressway was upgraded to a full motorway by end of october 2008 this stage required additional construction along of route upgraded motorway was officially opened on october 22 2008 by prime minister ivo sanader at a ceremony held at southern portal of tuhobic tunnel opening ceremony coincided with opening of a new bridge over river mura on border between croatia and hungary connecting a4 to hungarian m7 motorway thus route spanning budapest zagreb rijeka was completed as a modern motorway construction costs incurred are estimated at 661 5 million euros even though hrvatske autoceste normally develops motorways in croatia a6 motorway is operated and maintained by autocesta rijeka zagreb traffic volume right thumb alt bar graph of 2009 a6 traffic volume counting data traffic volume measured on a6 motorway 2009 traffic is regularly counted by means of a traffic census at toll stations and reported by autocesta rijeka zagreb operator of motorway and published by hrvatske ceste reported traffic volume exhibits no significant variations as motorway chainage increases and as it passes by various major destinations and interchanges that serve them except at vrata interchange where traffic to and from krk island crikvenica and novi vinodolski flows greatest volume of traffic is registered between delnice and vrata interchanges with a 12 600 vehicle annual average daily traffic aadt and a 21 150 vehicle average summer daily traffic asdt figure sections south of kikovica interchange likely carry substantial traffic volume as they serve rijeka commuter traffic as well as volume registered between ostrovica and kikovica interchanges however no traffic volume figures are published for those sections since motorway traffic is counted by means of toll ticket sales analyses and sections south of kikovica interchange are not tolled substantial variations observed between aadt and asdt are normally attributed to fact that motorway carries significant tourist traffic to istria and kvarner gulf seasonal increase in traffic volume ranges from 41 on ostrovica kikovica section to 69 as measured on bosiljevo 2 vrbovsko section average summer season traffic volume increase on motorway is 65 a6 traffic volume details road counting site aadt asdt notes 25px alt a6

section of route applicable legislation provides for four types of rest areas designated as types a through d a type rest areas comprise a full range of amenities including a filling station a restaurant and a hotel or a motel b type rest areas have no lodging c type rest areas are very common and include a filling station and a cafe but no restaurants or accommodations and d type rest areas offer parking spaces only with possibly some picnic tables benches and restrooms even though rest areas found along a6 motorway generally follow this ranking system there are considerable variations as some of them offer extra services most notable example is lepenica rest area even though it has no restaurant and therefore falls below b type rest area standard there is for instance an rv park available filling stations typically have small convenience stores and some of them offer lpg fuel as of october 2010 all of rest areas found along a6 motorway comply with c type rest area standards or above primary motorway operator autocesta rijeka zagreb leases rest areas to various operators through public tenders as of october 2010 there are three such rest area operators on a1
