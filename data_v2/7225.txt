hurricane faith reached northernmost latitude and had longest track of any atlantic tropical cyclone sixth named storm and fifth hurricane of 1966 atlantic hurricane season faith developed from an area of disturbed weather between cape verde and west coast of africa on august 21 tracking westward depression gradually intensified and became tropical storm faith on following day moving westward across atlantic ocean it continued to slowly strengthen reaching hurricane status early on august 23 about 42 hours later faith reached an initial peak with winds of 105 mph 165 km h before weakening slightly on august 26 located near lesser antilles outer bands of faith produced gale force winds in region especially puerto rico virgin islands and antigua minor coastal damage occurred as far south as trinidad and tobago by august 28 storm began to re intensify after curving north northwestward near bahamas at 0000 utc on following day faith peaked as a 125 mph 205 km h category 3 hurricane saffir simpson hurricane scale eventually storm weakened back to a category 2 hurricane and re curved to northeast one person drowned in western atlantic after his ship sank heavy rainfall and strong winds pelted bermuda though no damage occurred storm maintained nearly same intensity as a category 2 hurricane for several days while tracking northeastward into far north atlantic ocean faith finally weakened while north of scotland and became extratropical near faroe islands on september 6 three other drowning deaths occurred in north sea near denmark a fifth death occurred after a man succumbed to injuries sustained during a boating incident related to storm meteorological history television infrared observation satellite xi tiros xi imagery indicated presence of an area of disturbed weather over ivory coast on august 18 system moved slowly westward and eventually reached atlantic ocean it is estimated that a tropical depression developed at 0000 utc on august 21 while located about southeast of cape verde continuing westward depression intensified and was upgraded to tropical storm faith on following day gradual intensification persisted as tropical storm faith headed nearly due westward at by august 23 faith was upgraded to a category 1 hurricane curving slightly west northwestward storm reached category 2 intensity and briefly peaked at sustained winds of 105 mph 165 km h hurricane faith curved to northwest and weakened back to a category 1 hurricane while approaching northeastern leeward islands on august 25 initially faith was scheduled to be seeded as part of project stormfury however scheduled seeding was cancelled as faith was approaching bahamas bypassing leeward islands faith remained at nearly same intensity until re strengthening into category 2 hurricane on august 28 near turks and caicos islands storm quickly intensified further into a category 3 hurricane only six hours later thumb nimbus 2 satellite image of precursor to faith on august 20 emerging off west coast of africa at 00 00 utc on august 29 faith attained its maximum sustained winds of 125 mph 205 km h after reaching maximum sustained winds late on august 29 faith began to gradually weaken and decreased to category 2 hurricane intensity early on august 30 by that time storm turned to northeast around periphery of an atlantic subtropical anticyclone while located about midway between bermuda and florida faith remained well offshore of east coast of united states and atlantic canada after veering eastward on september 1 thereafter it began to accelerate and eventually curved northeastward while approaching europe faith s forward speed increased to as much as 50 mph 75 km h at 0600 utc on september 3 a minimum barometric pressure of was recorded lowest in relation to storm after remaining a category 2 hurricane since august 29 faith weakened slightly to a category 1 hurricane early on september 6 as it neared faroe islands crossing north sea faith finally transitioned into an extratropical storm at 1200 utc later that day while centered about 125 miles 200 km east northeast of torshavn extratropical remnants of faith headed eastward and affected norway with winds as high as 60 mph 95 km h tracking over scandinavia extratropical storm weakened to equivalent of a tropical depression before entering soviet union present day russia eventually storm degenerated into an extratropical low pressure area curved northward and retained its identity until september 15 when it was over franz josef land which is roughly 600 miles 965 km from north pole impact and records thumb left track map of hurricane faith as an extratropical cyclone in leeward islands approach of faith caused tracking station on antigua which was monitoring an unmanned rocket launched by national aeronautics and space administration nasa to shut down 45 minutes after rocket lifted off faith also produced gale force winds across puerto rico and virgin islands though only minor damage and no fatalities or injuries were reported further south faith brought rough seas to trinidad and tobago with waves ranging from these conditions inflicted minor damage to small boats and jetties in turks and caicos islands sea defenses suffered some damage as faith passed about 65 miles 105 km to east northeast along east coast of united states storm produced rough seas and high tides from cape canaveral then cape kennedy florida to virginia capes additionally weather bureau warned of possible gale force winds in carolinas and virginia but also noted that area would only experience fringe effects from storm in bermuda outer rainbands of hurricane faith produced heavy rainfall and wind gusts up to five people died as a result of storm though only one of them on land rough seas in western atlantic battered alberto pitching one man overboard two others drowned near denmark while attempting to cross atlantic ocean in a rowboat another man was missing and presumed dead after heavy seas forced him and his shipmates to abandon their boat off northern coast of denmark property damage was minimal mainly because areas impacted by faith were sparsely populated a 2 726 ton norwegian car ferry known as began to sink as it headed for hirtshals in region nordjylland of denmark waves pounded side hatches which flooded in engine room causing ship to become disabled a large scale search operation was conducted to rescue 144 passengers aboard all passengers were rescued and treated for their injuries in hjorring denmark however one person later died in hospital in norway remnants of faith impacted areas between and sunnfjord storm brought heavy rainfall and resulted in glacier melting which in turn caused rampant flooding in some locations discharge from folgefonna and sunnfjord glaciers reached a record high melt due to remnants of faith throughout its duration faith traveled for making it longest track of an atlantic hurricane and second longest worldwide after hurricane john in 1994 in eastern pacific ocean faith also traveled to northernmost latitude of any atlantic tropical cyclone reaching as far north as 61 see also
