carries a57 road between manchester and sheffield but it is no longer main signposted route between those two cities like several other roads that cross pennines snake pass has a poor accident record compared with roads in uk generally although more favourable compared with other roads in area it is regularly closed in winter because of snow and has seen several longer term closures owing to subsidence following heavy rain road remains a popular route for tourists and motorcycles however and sections have been used for semi professional cycling races such as tour of britain route and location thumb left pennine way crosses snake pass at its summit snake pass runs through national trust s high peak estate and lies within high peak borough of derbyshire much of it falls within hope woodlands parish remainder being within charlesworth parish it is part of shortest route by road from manchester to sheffield pass starts east of glossop and climbs to pennines watershed between moorland plateaux of kinder scout and to a high point of above sea level where it crosses pennine way after this it passes a public house that used to be known as snake inn and descends through forest to ladybower reservoir at ashopton name of road matches its winding route but actually derives from emblem of snake inn one of few buildings on high stretch of road in turn pub s name and sign were derived from serpent on cavendish arms of william cavendish 6th duke of devonshire in early 21st century inn was renamed snake pass inn such that inn now refers to road that referred to itself history thumb snake pass inn was originally called snake inn but is now named after pass itself which in turn was named after pub first road between glossop and ashopton was doctor s gate a roman road that follows shelf brook between shelf moor and coldharbour moor a route popular today with walkers and mountain bikers in 1932 an iron age axe thought to be more than 2 000 years old was found near site of this road current road further south was designed as a toll road by thomas telford to improve communications east of glossop which was expanding as an industrial town it was originally called sheffield to glossop turnpike and run by a turnpike trust sheffield and glossop trust an act of parliament to build road was passed in 1818 and construction was financed by duke of norfolk and duke of devonshire road opened in 1821 having cost ps18 625 to build upon opening it was highest turnpike road in england road was immediately popular and increased toll collections of traffic heading to glossop tolls were abolished on road in june 1870 eastern end of pass is by river derwent river is bridged by ashopton viaduct built as part of ladybower reservoir project between 1935 and 1945 although snake pass is still shortest route between manchester and sheffield more northerly woodhead pass which is less steep and at a lower altitude is now primary road link between two cities unlike snake pass woodhead route is a trunk road traffic levels on both passes remained similar until 1980s but woodhead pass route is now favoured as it connects directly to m1 while snake pass leads into centre of sheffield despite sheffield and manchester being among largest uk cities by population there is no direct motorway link between two a manchester to sheffield motorway was first proposed in 1966 and a small section bypassing denton and hyde has been built now woodhead tunnel was closed in 1981 in anticipation of a road replacement but linking cities would have meant constructing many costly tunnels and viaducts across peak district consequently plans were shelved but reports in december 2014 announced a revival of scheme road remains popular with drivers in 2008 a survey by caterham cars rated snake pass best driving road in uk following year it was listed as one of best roads for driving in britain by auto trader magazine who described it as offering unparalleled views

in winter road is often first of routes between sheffield and manchester to be closed following snow in area in bad storms entire road over summit including marker poles has been buried in snow in winter months road becomes icy but gritting is not a priority as a57 is only a secondary road at this point local councils prefer to treat streets in towns that are more likely to be used as they believe that roads such as snake pass will be closed anyway in 1924 derbyshire county council spent ps2 000 installing underground telegraph wire cables beneath road as above ground installations were continually broken and disrupted following snowstorms british winter of 2010 11 was coldest for decades and road was closed on numerous occasions snake pass has also been closed for longer periods owing to subsidence in local area following rain in january 1932 road was closed after 200 tonnes of debris fell on it during a heavy rainstorm covering surface in as much as in places in january 2008 a landslip at moor following heavy rain caused road to be closed to all traffic between ladybower and glossop although access was still available to local premises and businesses including snake pass inn a subsequent investigation by british geographical survey showed road has had a history of subsidence related long term closures dating back to 1930s including a 1970s project that attempted to strengthen layer below tarmac with local rock fill road reopened in february but with temporary traffic lights at point of slip restricting traffic to one direction at a time in 2012 road had to be closed several times for resurfacing and strengthening cycling snake pass is a popular route for cyclists a 1902 report on leisure cycling in lancashire evening post described eastward journey from
