and john hannah as holden radcliffe would be starring in episode following airing of previous episode executive producer jed whedon teased that let me stand next to your fire would explore dynamic between luna s ghost rider robbie reyes and elias morrow his uncle but would be pivoting from storyline in comics we re pulling characters character names and relationships but i think you can already feel that we ve changed it those dynamics will be entirely different we re using them as inspiration thumb upright guest star axle whitehead returns from third season as inhuman j t james in addition to luna as reyes and whitehead as james guest stars for episode include mallory jansen as aida jose zuniga as morrow kerr smith as joseph phil tyler as watchdog 1 sergio enrique as guard tanner fontana as elliot and lilli birdsell as lucy luna jansen whitehead and birdsell reprise their roles from earlier in series when asked whether series still wanted to pursue stories about inhumans such as james whedon said they are still in our world so we still have some of these people in mix but right now we re on ghost rider kick on having johnson and reyes join up with s h i e l d whedon called it uneasy for everyone involved daisy has made it very clear that she doesn t want to be with our team there s all that history and pain there for robbie this is a guy who has never had a team and probably doesn t function well within one we ll see pretty quickly that it s an uneasy alliance and it s going to cause a lot of drama discussing simmons actions in episode henstridge noted that previous episodes in season had established character s new position high in s h i e l d hierarchy so that this episode could see her abuse that power using her position to help her friends including now ex s h i e l d agent johnson rather than agency of its director henstridge said that this is whole reason that she got herself into a position of power but it is a turning point for because in that moment she could ve gone other way and chose to protect her new position henstridge appreciated episode exploring relationship between simmons and johnson feeling that there was so much bad blood between them after events of third season that could be explored she compared this to a relationship between sisters filming and effects episode s central car chase features coulson s flying 1962 chevrolet corvette lola chasing reyes fiery hellcharger a 1969 dodge charger nicknamed lucy sequence was filmed in los angeles with location scouting for sequence beginning by searching for an ideal corner for charger to make a big hard left streets around corner were then augmented with directed traffic in a near miss configuration to make sequence more dynamic it sees charger weaving between other vehicles and them veering away in opposite direction for added effect one stunt sees a large truck backing out of a driveway with stunt team timing it so that charger can drive around back but much smaller lola has to drive underneath it in episode s climactic fight between reyes and james in a fireworks factory a moment sees james burn through a brick wall and two falling into factory below sequence was choreographed with two stunt doubles descending through a fake wall on wires but on day filming schedule was changed and there was no longer time to set up wire rig instead stunt team had doubles fall through wall without wires and land on pads below which stunt coordinator tanner gill said ultimately worked really effectively for subsequent fireworks factory explosion a practical explosion was created by series effects team and then cg fireworks were added by pixomondo practical explosion shook all stages around abc studios lot release let me stand next to your fire

most of this is just preamble to sight of two guys with a lot of attitude and similar pyrokinetic powers unleashing holy hell on one another in a building chock full of explosives i am than okay with this a v clubs alex graded episode a b praising episode for focusing season s overarching storyline and for emotional reunions between johnson and core s h i e l d agents he was positive of ongoing ghost rider storyline and episode s action sequences but thought aida s story was much more intriguing long term story it offers unusual opportunity for agents of s h i e l d to dig into some juicy subtext and weighty concepts kevin fitzpatrick of screen crush felt line had to see that coming applied to many elements of episode but said there s a lot of fun to be had and praised use of character james dealing with character s self loathing well while acknowledging his status as series pre ghost rider ghost rider fitzpatrick added that he was still not crazy about whatever s going on with lucy and her terrible ghost effects and felt aida story was being pushed aside in favor of a seemingly corporate mandated ghost rider focus terri schwartz at ign gave episode a great 8 5 out of 10 praising executive producers for their timing in bringing season s different groups of characters together in this episode schwartz praised car chase handling of relationship between simmons and fitz in regards to his keeping aida a secret from her and use of james taking advantage of audience s familiarity of him from previous season at den of geek marc buxton scored episode 3 5 stars out of 5 praising episode for balancing all of its different plot lines he appreciated time spent with johnson and simmons and called car chase an absolute blast he felt newly introduced origin for ghost rider was diluting elegance of source material while aida s storyline was more effective though he said it seems so redundant when compared to utter perfect exploration of same subject on westworld collider s evan valentine gave episode a very good 4 stars out of 5 calling it wall to wall fun and praising car chase as probably one of highlights of season so far for me and calling ghost rider vs hellfire fight a blast to watch valentine also praised episode s handling of aida and its balancing of different stories and characters references external links let me stand next to your fire at abc category
