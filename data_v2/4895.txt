shergar 3 march 1978 was an irish bred british trained thoroughbred racehorse after a very successful season in 1981 he was retired to ballymany stud in county kildare ireland in 1983 he was stolen from stud and a ransom of ps2 million was demanded it was not paid and negotiations were soon broken off by thieves in 1999 a supergrass formerly in provisional irish republican army ira stated they stole horse ira has never admitted any role in theft aga khan shergar s owner sent horse for training in britain in 1979 and 1980 shergar began his first season of racing in september 1980 and ran two races that year where he won one and came second in other in 1981 he ran in six races winning five of them in june that year he won 202nd epsom derby by ten lengths longest winning margin in race s history three weeks later he won irish sweeps derby by four lengths a month after that he won king george vi and queen elizabeth stakes by four lengths in his final race of year he came in fourth and aga khan took decision to retire him to stud in ireland after shergar s epsom derby win aga khan sold 40 shares in horse valuing it at ps10 million retaining six shares he created an owners syndicate with remaining 34 members shergar was stolen from aga khan s stud farm by an armed gang on 8 february 1983 negotiations were conducted with thieves but gang broke off all communication after four days when syndicate did not accept as true proof provided that horse was still alive in 1999 sean o callaghan a former member of ira published details of theft and stated that it was an ira operation to raise money for arms he said that very soon after theft shergar had panicked and damaged his leg which led to him being killed by gang an investigation by sunday telegraph concluded that horse was shot four days after theft no arrests have ever been made in relation to theft shergar s body has never been recovered or identified it is likely that body was buried near aughnasheelin near ballinamore county leitrim in honour of shergar shergar cup was inaugurated in 1999 his story has been made into two screen dramatisations several books and two documentaries background and early training shergar was a thoroughbred bay colt with a white blaze four white socks and a wall blue eye he was foaled on 3 march 1978 at private stud of aga khan iv near curragh racecourse in county kildare ireland shergar was sired by great nephew a british stallion whose wins included prix du moulin and prix dollar in france in 1967 great nephew s other progeny included grundy mrs penny and shergar s dam was a seventh generation descendant of mahal a horse that is described by national sporting library as one of most important broodmares of 20th century in 1978 aga khan leader of nizari philanthropist and horse owner announced he would send some of his yearlings for training in england for a trainer he chose michael stoute who was based at newmarket stoute had a good year in 1978 and had trained winners of oaks irish oaks and yorkshire oaks with fair and gold cup with shergar was sent into training with stoute in 1979 as aga khan s second year of sending horses to england according to stoute and ghislain drion manager of aga khan s irish studs shergar was easy to break and had a good temperament he responded very well to training particularly in september 1980 when jockey lester piggott rode him in run up to shergar s debut race racing career 1980 two year old season thumb upright alt green racing hat and shirt with a red bar on each shoulder racing silks of aga

geldings over a straight at newbury listed as favourite with odds of 11 8 he kept in behind leaders before opening up and winning by lengths richard baerlein racing correspondent for observer thought shergar s run was best from a two year old that season after race stoute said horse would run one more race that year to gain experience before resting until following year shergar s second race was william hill futurity stakes at doncaster run on 25 october 1980 he was again ridden by piggott with odds of 5 2 in a very experienced field of seven shergar sat behind pace setting leader for much of race and when that horse faded running was taken up by beldale flutter shergar challenged for lead but beldale flutter pulled away and won by lengths shergar came in second following race michael seely racing correspondent of times thought shergar s run was significant and that he was a magnificent stamp of a horse whose odds of 25 1 for following year s derby were worth considering 1981 three year old season over late 1980 and early 1981 shergar filled out and was stronger by april 1981 stoute had decided that shergar should run in that year s derby and planned season accordingly first race to prepare him was guardian newspaper classic trial run at sandown on 25 april 1981 where he was ridden by walter swinburn in a 9 horse mile 2 0 km race shergar raised his pace after a mile and won by 10 lengths baerlein had written in his column before race that at 25 1 odds for shergar to win derby were excellent after win he noted them shortening to 8 1 where bet is still worth pressing he continued if shergar wins his next race at chester or ladbroke lingfield trial as easily he will be down to less than 4 1 surely this is time to bet like men as further training for derby stoute decided that shergar needed practice on a left hand cornered course he selected chester where chester vase was run on 5 may 1981 after keeping pace with leaders with half a mile to go swinburn urged shergar to increase speed and he did overtaking leaders and going clear to win by 12 lengths thumb alt home stretch of 1981 derby with shergar about ten lengths ahead of other horses shergar on his way to winning 1981 epsom derby on 3 june 1981 shergar ran in derby set over a mile 2 4 km course at epsom downs racecourse in surrey derby is a group 1 flat race open to three year old thoroughbred colts and fillies after top of uphill straight start of course shergar was well placed and moving through other runners at tattenham corner final bend of course shergar took front of race and opened up a lead over others commentating on race peter bromley informed listeners that there s only one horse in it you need a telescope to see rest swinburn eased off pace with two furlongs to go and won by ten lengths it was largest winning margin of any epsom derby john matthias jockey of second placed horse glint of gold said that i thought i d achieved my life s ambition only then did i discover there was another horse on horizon in light of shergar s run of wins particularly derby baerlein wrote that horse was one of finest he had seen while out on gallops on 15 june shergar threw his rider ran through a hedge onto road and trotted along to local village he was spotted by a local resident who followed horse until it stopped to graze on a hedge and then led him back to stables shergar was unharmed during event and stoute recalled it s very lucky nothing happened to him there s a crossing there and it s a difficult thing by time irish derby was run at curragh on 27 june 1981 swinburn was suspended following an infringement at royal ascot so piggott returned to ride shergar at half way point in race shergar was in third place but increased his pace to take lead with three furlongs to go he slowed during last furlong and won by four lengths as horse approached line michael o hehir commentator informed viewers that he s winning it so easily it s shergar first and rest are nowhere after race piggott told reporters that he had no doubt that shergar would win as horse never struggled in race he also said that shergar was one of best horses he had ever raced on thumb upright alt aga khan giving a speech into a microphone shergar s owner aga khan in 2014 following shergar s epsom derby win a group of us horse owners had offered 40 million to syndicate horse aga khan turned down offer and instead decided to syndicate shergar for ps10 million at ps250 000 for each of forty shares a record price at time aga khan kept six shares for himself and others were sold individually to buyers from nine countries shareholders had option each year of selecting a mare to be covered or of selling that option on stud fees were ps60 000 80 000 per cover which meant that shareholders could expect to make a profit from stud within four years shergar had a break of almost a month until he ran in king george vi and queen elizabeth diamond stakes at ascot on 25 july 1981 race was slow paced to start and shergar was boxed in by other horses but found a way out by time leaders had reached final straight and accelerated to win by four lengths for baerlein race showed that shergar was best horse he had ever seen race michael phillips racing correspondent for times wrote that win proved that shergar is a cut above average but not exceptional phillips continued that shergar failed to fill me and many more besides with magic that was in air after nijinsky and mill reef had won same race aga khan and stoute considered entering shergar into prix de l arc de triomphe that autumn but decided that he needed one more race to prepare they entered him into what would be his final race st leger stakes at doncaster on 12 september 1981 with swinburn as jockey ten days before race a story was published in racing newspaper sporting life that shergar had not been practising well and had become stoute stated that rumours were untrue shergar was running well in race although soft ground was not to his liking but on final straight when swinburn tried to get him to accelerate to front horse would not respond shergar came in fourth lengths behind cut above winner surprised by manner of loss stoute and aga khan ran a series of tests on shergar all showed horse was in good health and he worked well in training after race unwilling to risk horse without knowing what had happened at st leger aga khan did not enter him into arc and instead retired him to ballymany stud near curragh he later explained to a racing journalist he was just an exceptional athlete all through spring and summer he completely dominated european racing in a very dramatic manner and after he had run so uncharacteristically in st leger we knew something had gone wrong but we didn t know what it was so it was an easy decision to retire him before arc stud career aga khan turned down large offers to put shergar to stud in us and instead chose to stand him at ballymany stud in ireland he arrived in october 1981 and was paraded down main street of newbridge county kildare milton toby writer on thoroughbred racing and equine law judges shergar to have been a national hero in ireland one of most recognizable sports personalities horse or human in ireland in 1982 his only rutting season shergar covered 44 mares from which 36 foals were produced 17 colts and 19 fillies of these three won group races and most successful of his progeny was authaal when sold as a weanling between six months and a year authaal reached 325 000 guineas he was sold a year later where he fetched 3 1 million guineas in 1986 he won irish st leger by five lengths toby considers that shergar s progeny were perhaps not a disappointing first crop but certainly below expectations for a horse with shergar s racing prowess at start of february 1983 shergar s second stud season was about to begin and he was in high demand and had a full book of 55 mares to cover he was expected to earn ps1 million for season february 1983 onwards theft on 8 february 1983 at around 8 30 pm three men all armed and wearing masks entered house of jim fitzgerald head groom at ballymany they were part of a group of at least six and possibly up to nine men one of men said to him we have come for shergar we want ps2 million for him fitzgerald said men were not rough although one of them who carried a pistol was very aggressive fitzgerald s family were locked into a room while he was taken at gunpoint out to shergar s stable and was told to put horse in back of a horsebox after horsebox was driven away fitzgerald was told to lie on floor of a van and his face was covered with a coat he was driven around for four hours before being released near village of approximately from ballymany he was told not to contact garda siochana gardai irish police or he and his family would be killed but to wait for gang to contact him he was given code phrase king neptune which gang would use to identify themselves men did not say that they were from ira or give any other indication as to who they were although one of men spoke with a northern irish accent and another seemed to be experienced with horses fitzgerald walked on to next village and called his brother to pick him up on arrival back at ballymany he rang ghislain drion to inform him of theft and urged him not to call police because of threats that had been made drion attempted to reach aga khan in switzerland to inform him then rang stan cosgrove shergar s vet who was also a shareholder cosgrove contacted a retired irish army captain sean berry who was manager of irish thoroughbred breeders association berry contacted alan dukes a friend of his who was serving minister for finance who suggested that berry speak to michael noonan minister for justice noonan and dukes told him to call gardai by 4 00 am drion had managed to contact aga khan who told him to phone gardai straight away force were then contacted but it was eight hours after shergar had been stolen and any possible trail had already gone cold aga khan had several reasons for non payment of ransom including that he was only one of 35 members and could not negotiate or pay on behalf of others he was unsure whether shergar would be returned even if money was paid and concerned that if kidnappers demands were met it would make every high value horse in ireland a target for future thefts shareholders were divided on approach brian sweeney a veteran of american horseracing industry thought that if you ask a mother who has had a child that has been kidnapped if a ransom should be paid i think answer would be yes and quickly another shareholder lord derby disagreed and said if ransom money is paid for this horse then there is a danger of other horses being kidnapped in years to come and that simply cannot be tolerated first approach by thieves thumb upright alt a head and shoulders photograph of derek thompson sports commentator derek thompson who became involved in negotiations for shergar first phone call from thieves was on night shergar was stolen fitzgerald was not back at ballymany by that time and had not had chance to tell news of theft to anyone call was to jeremy maxwell a horse trainer based in northern ireland caller demanded ps40 000 although this figure was later raised to ps52 000 maxwell was told that negotiations would only be with three british horse racing journalists derek thompson and john of itv and peter campling from sun men were told to be at europa hotel in central belfast by thursday evening europa was known as most bombed hotel in europe after having suffered multiple bomb attacks during troubles when three sports journalists arrived at europa they were contacted by phone and told to go to maxwells house to await further calls on orders from police thompson kept person talking for as long as possible but caller rang off at 80 seconds before call could be traced there were a series of calls to maxwells house later that night and at 1 30 am thompson managed to keep caller talking for over 90 seconds which would have been enough to trace call he was told that person who was doing call intercepts had finished his shift at midnight and gone home at 7 00 am on 12 february another call was put through to maxwells house which said that things had gone wrong and that shergar was dead although a committee put together by syndicate to co ordinate their response later considered that this was a hoax toby argues that as call about theft preceded fitzgerald s return to ballymany i e before anyone knew about theft and as callers used code phrase king neptune in their communications it is more likely that calls and ensuing focus on high profile activity in belfast were undertaken to distract authorities from what was happening with shergar elsewhere second approach by thieves on 9 february thieves opened a second line of negotiation contacting ballymany stud directly and speaking to drion call which came in at 4 05 pm was short drion was not a fluent speaker of english and struggled to understand irish accent of caller caller similarly had problems with drion s heavy french pronunciation ninety minutes later caller tried again with drion asking him to speak slowly a demand of ps2 million was made for return of shergar and for a contact number in france through which further negotiations could be made drion provided number of aga khan s french office thumb alt a close up grainy black and white photograph probably of left side of shergar s face probably one of photographs sent by thieves during negotiations as proof that shergar was still alive syndicate which owned shergar brought in risk and strategic consulting firm control risks to handle negotiations they negotiated from paris office with a series of telephone calls over four days on friday 11 february negotiators demanded proof that shergar was still alive as there had been some speculation in press that shergar was dead thieves said that a representative of syndicate should go to crofton hotel in dublin and ask for any messages for johnny logan name of an irish singer stan cosgrove went to hotel and asked for any messages armed members of special detective unit domestic security agency of gardai were present in an undercover role no message was delivered and cosgrove returned home after waiting shortly afterwards negotiators received a phone call from thieves angry at presence of police and threatening that if any members of gang were captured or killed negotiators and police would be murdered in retribution on saturday 12 february thieves contacted negotiators and said that proof had been left at rosnaree hotel when this was picked up it contained several polaroid pictures showing shergar some of pictures showed horse s head next to a copy of irish news dated 11 february cosgrove saw photograph and confirmed that it definitely was him although he added it wasn t proof that horse was alive at that point you d want to get much more definite evidence if you d have seen complete horse it would have been different but this was just head in a telephone call from thieves to negotiators at 10 40 pm on 12 february it was explained that syndicate were not satisfied with pictures of horse which they explained did not constitute enough proof caller told negotiators if you re not satisfied that s it call was ended and thieves never made any further contact syndicate attempted to re establish contact with gang but there was no response to newspaper requests to do so negotiations examined syndicate committee put together a report for full syndicate which examined possible motives behind theft they concluded that theft of shergar was either undertaken to create confusion and publicity rather than obtaining money or that negotiations were undertaken with naivety they reached this conclusion after taking a number of factors into account many of demands were physically impossible ransom demand included ps100 notes which did not exist in one call at 5 45 pm to drion in ballymany he was told to deliver ps2 million to paris before noon following day in a call at 5 00 pm paris negotiators were told to get ps2 million by end of night after parisian banks had closed in another call negotiator in paris was told to get agreement for a ransom but told he should not contact anyone in ireland despite some of shareholders being there it also became clear during course of negotiations that gang thought that aga khan was sole owner of shergar they had no knowledge of other shareholders and did not take into account complexity of liaising and organising all 35 shareholders into a position of agreement police investigation initial police investigation was hindered by eight hour lapse before crime was reported and by a local thoroughbred auction which meant several were travelling in area leading investigation was chief superintendent james murphy a highly experienced detective in his first press conference murphy described how he was slightly concerned about theft and told reporters that i have no leads his comment about a lack of leads was not truthful as murphy withheld much information from media including police finding magazine for a steyr mpi 69 submachine gun which suggested a link to an ira active service unit in south armagh murphy had a strong irish brogue wore a trilby hat and had a self effacing sense of humour at one press conference he announced a clue that is something we haven t got several people claiming to have paranormal powers contacted gardai with their thoughts murphy reported that diviners clairvoyants and psychic persons they re in three different categories they must be running into fifties now during one press conference six photographers turned up wearing similar to policeman times called him a stage irishman one reviewer of a documentary in 2004 called murphy most richly comic copper since inspector clouseau after eight days with no progress he was replaced as public figure of investigation but continued to lead it on 16 february a description of horsebox used by thieves from a description given by fitzgerald was released it was either light green or light blue with no working lights and no licence plates huge police search of possible hiding places for shergar by gardai in irish republic and royal ulster constabulary ruc in northern ireland found no trace of horse or horsebox but several ira caches of arms and explosives were uncovered leading to loss of several safe houses up to 70 detectives were working on case at one point two weeks after shergar was stolen police search was scaled down although investigation continued speculation and hoaxes with no definite news of shergar s whereabouts and with gardai limiting information they released to press media took to speculation to cover story baerlein observes that in reporting shergar case press speculation was remarkable for its enthusiasm and its inaccuracy over a long period of time such media claims included that shergar had been stolen by colonel gaddafi as part of a deal to supply arms to ira that according to tabloid newspaper sunday sport shergar was spotted being ridden by missing lord lucan that a middle eastern horse breeder had stolen him for stud and that mafia had undertaken act to punish aga khan over a previous sale of a horse which had gone badly eight weeks after shergar was stolen stan cosgrove was approached by senior detectives within gardai who introduced him to dennis minogue a horse trainer minogue claimed to have a contact within ira who had shown him a photograph of shergar and that he could help get shergar released for a ransom of 000 gardai asked cosgrove to assist them in a sting operation to lure thieves out cosgrove agreed and on 20 july 1983 detective garda martin kenirons assisted operation he put money in boot of his car in a remote village which minogue was to collect once horse had been released following day kenirons found boot of his car forced open and money missing minogue had also disappeared and money was never recovered a subsequent internal gardai enquiry dismissed kenirons from force for breaching gardai regulations in an interview in 2018 he reiterated his long stated innocence and said when it all went wrong everyone jumped for high ground they senior gardai officers all denied that they had anything to do with ransom insurance shergar was insured through several different insurance companies lloyd s of london insurance brokers hodgson covered ps3 625 000 of total and added a theft clause to policy other shareholders accountable for ps1 5 million worth of shares had insurance that did not include a theft clause cosgrove was one of mortality only insured members shareholders accounting for ps3 million did not take out insurance aga khan was one of uninsured members of syndicate cosgrove was insured with norwich union now part of aviva who refused to pay even when it became clear that shergar was probably dead company s liability was ps144 000 20 policies that included a theft clause were all settled in full in june 1983 even though there was a question of whether there was a need to terry hall an animal insurance insurer with lloyd s of london observes that while theft was clear cut demand of a ransom meant that action was considered extortion rather than theft which meant mortality and theft policies did not have to be paid out legal advice was sought by lloyd s of london who were told that although it was a grey area payment was advised possible identification of criminals police and intelligence sources considered ira as most likely suspects behind theft during 1980s irish republican movement followed armalite and ballot box strategy in which electoral success was chased by sinn fein while an armed struggle was continued by ira strategy was expensive requiring payment for arms and explosives for ira and for political activity advertising and salaries for sinn fein annual budget for movement was estimated at between ps2 million and ps5 million and it was always under financial pressure in october 1981 ira army council leadership group of organisation approved kidnapping of ben dunne then head of chain of stores dunne was released unharmed after a week both dunne family and gardai deny a ransom of ps300 000 was paid according to intelligence subsequently received by intelligence sources after success of operation it was decided to undertake another ransom through kidnapping or theft this time of shergar in 1999 sean o callaghan a former member of ira who had been working within organisation as a supergrass for gardai since 1980 published his autobiography in it he states that plot to steal and ransom shergar was devised by kevin mallon a leading ira member who sat on army council mallon came up with idea while serving time in portlaoise prison mallon was put in charge of a special operations unit with orders to raise several million pounds and several ira men were taken from under o callaghan s control in ira southern command and put into mallon s unit these included ira members gerry fitzgerald paul stewart rab butler and nicky kehoe two weeks after shergar s kidnap gerry fitzgerald told o callaghan that he had been involved in theft and that shergar had been killed early on in process after horse panicked and no one present could cope with him in process horse damaged its left leg and decision was made to kill it in his 1999 autobiography o callaghan states that shergar was killed within days of theft in an interview for rte irish broadcaster in 2004 he stated that gerry fitzgerald strongly suggested that shergar had been killed within hours of his kidnap ira then kept up a deception that horse was still alive and in their care kevin o connor a journalist with rte identifies three parts of gang a section to undertake high profile activity in belfast to focus media attention in north one part negotiating discreetly with aga khan and one part guarding horse according to o callaghan in august 1983 in an effort to raise money that they failed to do with shergar theft fitzgerald and his group attempted to kidnap businessman galen weston at his home in county wicklow gardai had been forewarned and took over house while weston was in uk after a gun battle gerry fitzgerald kehoe and three others were arrested they received long prison sentences o callaghan stated that essentially same team that went to kidnap shergar went to kidnap galen weston no arrests have ever been made in relation to shergar s theft ira have never admitted any role in theft or its aftermath mallon and kehoe deny any involvement in events toby raises a query over o callaghan s story saying ira informant was a confessed informer whose life depending on his ability to weave a convincing web of lies without more evidence o callaghan s story is just that an interesting story in 2008 a special investigation by sunday telegraph obtained information from another ira member who said that o callaghan had not been told full story because gang was so embarrassed by what happened a vet that ira had arranged to look after shergar did not turn up because his wife threatened to leave him if he did once ira realised that aga khan was not going to pay army council ordered horse to be released extensive search by gardai hampered any release and mallon thought he was under close surveillance and that releasing horse was too risky so he ordered that it should be killed ira source told newspaper that two men went into stable where shergar was being held one carried a machine gun shergar was machine gunned to death there was blood everywhere and horse even slipped on his own blood there was lots of and because horse wouldn t die it was a very bloody death remains shergar s body has never been recovered or identified several sources including o callaghan sunday telegraph and observer consider it likely that body was buried near aughnasheelin near ballinamore county leitrim o callaghan said that as far as he knew remains had been buried on farm of an ira veteran from 1940s and that it would be difficult to get permission to dig on land ballinamore is a town of strong republicanism once nicknamed falls road of south a reference to falls road belfast a highly republican area during troubles there have been several claims of equine skeletons being that of shergar des leadon a specialist horse vet with knowledge of equine pathology has assisted gardai in several instances where a horse s remains may have been those of shergar he retains some strands of hair from shergar s mane and tail which he says may contain sufficient dna to confirm an identification legacy in 1999 in honour of shergar shergar cup was inaugurated at goodwood racecourse in a format that put a european team of jockeys against one from middle east race was later moved to ascot racecourse and is a competition between four teams great britain and ireland europe rest of world and an all women team winners of competition are presented with a trophy showing shergar this was donated by aga khan on twentieth anniversary of shergar s derby win a
