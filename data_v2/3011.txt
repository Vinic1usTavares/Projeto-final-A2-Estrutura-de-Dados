microscopium microscope is a minor constellation in southern celestial hemisphere one of twelve created in 18th century by french astronomer nicolas louis de lacaille and one of several depicting scientific instruments name is a latinised form of greek word for microscope its stars are faint and hardly visible from most of non tropical northern hemisphere constellation s brightest star is gamma microscopii of apparent magnitude 4 68 a yellow giant 2 5 times sun s mass located 223 8 light years distant it passed within 1 14 and 3 45 light years of sun some 3 9 million years ago possibly disturbing outer solar system two star systems wasp 7 and hd 205739 have been determined to have planets while two others young red dwarf star au microscopii and sunlike hd 202628 have debris disks au microscopii and binary red dwarf system at microscopii are probably a wide triple system and members of beta pictoris moving group nicknamed speedy mic bo microscopii is a star with an extremely fast rotation period of 9 hours 7 minutes characteristics microscopium is a small constellation bordered by capricornus to north piscis austrinus and grus to east sagittarius to west and indus to south touching on telescopium to southwest recommended three letter abbreviation for constellation as adopted by international astronomical union in 1922 is mic official constellation boundaries as set by eugene delporte in 1930 are defined by a polygon of four segments illustrated in infobox in equatorial coordinate system right ascension coordinates of these borders lie between and while declination coordinates are between 27 45deg and 45 whole constellation is visible to observers south of latitude 45degn given that its brightest stars are of fifth magnitude constellation is invisible to naked eye in areas with polluted skies features thumb left constellation microscopium as it can be seen by naked eye stars french astronomer nicolas louis de lacaille charted and designated ten stars with bayer designations alpha through to iota in 1756 a star in neighbouring indus that lacaille had labelled nu indi turned out to be in microscopium so gould renamed it nu microscopii francis baily considered gamma and epsilon microscopii to belong to neighbouring constellation piscis austrinus but subsequent cartographers did not follow this in his 1725 catalogus britannicus john flamsteed labelled stars 1 2 3 and 4 piscis which became gamma microscopii hr hr 8110 and epsilon microscopii respectively within constellation s borders there are 43 stars brighter than or equal to apparent magnitude 6 5 depicting eyepiece of microscope is gamma microscopii which at magnitude of 4 68 is brightest star in constellation having spent much of its 620 million year lifespan as a blue white main sequence star it has swollen and cooled to become a yellow giant of spectral type with a diameter ten times that of sun measurement of its parallax yields a distance of 223 8 light years from earth at around 2 5 times mass of sun it likely passed within 1 14 and 3 45 light years of sun some 3 9 million years ago possibly massive enough and close enough to disturb oort cloud alpha microscopii is also an ageing yellow giant star of spectral type with an apparent magnitude of 4 90 located 400 30 light years away from earth it has swollen to 17 5 times diameter of sun alpha has a 10th magnitude companion visible in 7 5 cm telescopes though this is a coincidental closeness rather than a true binary system epsilon microscopii lies 166 5 light years away and is a white star of apparent magnitude 4 7 and spectral type and microscopii make up a wide double whose components are to naked eye both are white a class magnetic spectrum variable stars with strong metallic lines similar to cor caroli they mark constellation s specimen slide many notable objects are too faint to be seen with naked eye ax microscopii better known as lacaille is a red dwarf which lies only 12 9 light years from solar system at magnitude 6 68 it is brightest red dwarf in sky bo microscopii is a rapidly rotating star that has 80 diameter of sun nicknamed speedy mic it has a rotation period of 9 hours 7 minutes an active star it has prominent stellar flares that average 100 times stronger than those of sun and are emitting energy mainly in x ray and ultraviolet bands of spectrum it lies 218 4 light years away from sun at microscopii is a binary star system both members of which are flare star red dwarfs system lies close to and may form a very wide triple system with au microscopii a young star which appears to be a planetary system in making with a debris disk three stars are candidate members of beta pictoris moving group one of nearest associations of stars that share a common motion through space astronomical society of southern africa in 2003 reported that observations of four of mira variables in microscopium were very urgently needed as data on their light curves was incomplete two of them r and s microscopii are challenging stars for novice amateur astronomers and other two u and ry microscopii are more difficult still another red giant t microscopii is a semiregular variable that ranges between magnitudes 7 7 and 9 6 over 344 days of apparent magnitude 11 dd microscopii is a symbiotic star system composed of an orange giant of spectral type k2iii and white dwarf in close orbit with smaller star ionizing stellar wind of larger star system has a low metallicity combined with its high galactic latitude this indicates that star system has its origin in galactic halo of milky way hd 205739 is a yellow white main sequence star of spectral type f7v that is around 1 22 times as massive and 2 3 times as luminous as sun it has a jupiter sized planet with an orbital period of 280 days that was discovered by radial velocity method wasp 7 is a star of spectral type with an apparent magnitude of 9 54 about 1 28 times as massive as sun its hot jupiter planet wasp 7b was discovered by transit method and found to orbit star every 4 95 days hd 202628 is a sunlike star of spectral type with a debris disk that ranges from 158 to 220 au distant its inner edge is sharply defined indicating a probable planet orbiting between 86 and 158 au from star deep sky objects describing microscopium as totally unremarkable astronomer patrick moore concluded there was nothing of interest for amateur observers ngc 6925 is a barred spiral galaxy of apparent magnitude 11 3 which is lens shaped as it lies almost edge on to observers on earth 3 7 degrees west northwest of alpha microscopii sn a type ii supernova in ngc 6925 was discovered by stu parker in new zealand in july 2011 ngc lies nearby and is a magnitude fainter still microscopium void is a roughly rectangular region of relatively empty space bounded by incomplete sheets of galaxies from other voids microscopium supercluster is an overdensity of galaxy clusters that was first noticed in early 1990s component abell clusters and 3696 are likely to be gravitationally bound while relations of abell clusters and in same field are unclear meteor showers thumb seen in 1824 star chart set urania s mirror in lower left are a minor meteor shower that appear from june to mid july history stars that comprise microscopium are in a region previously considered hind feet of sagittarius a neighbouring constellation john ellard gore wrote that al sufi seems to have reported that ptolemy had seen stars but he al sufi did not pinpoint their positions microscopium itself was introduced in 1751 52 by lacaille with french name le microscope after he had observed and catalogued 10 000 southern stars during a two year stay at cape of good hope he devised fourteen new constellations in uncharted regions of southern celestial hemisphere not visible from europe all but one honoured instruments that symbolised age of enlightenment commemorating compound microscope microscope s name had been latinised by lacaille to microscopium by 1763 notes references citations cited texts category southern constellations category constellations listed by lacaille
