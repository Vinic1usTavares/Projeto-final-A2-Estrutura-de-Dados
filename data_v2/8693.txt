operation freshman was codename given to a british airborne operation conducted in november 1942 during world war ii it was first british airborne operation conducted using airspeed horsa gliders and its target was vemork norsk hydro chemical plant in telemark norway which produced heavy water for nazi germany by 1942 german nuclear weapons programme had come close to being able to develop a nuclear reactor but in order for reactor to function it would require a great deal of heavy water source of heavy water was norsk hydro plant which had been occupied in 1940 when british government learned of german nuclear developments it was decided that a raid would be launched to destroy plant and deny germans heavy water required to develop a nuclear weapon several tactics were discussed and discarded as impractical and it was finally decided that a small airborne force composed of sappers from royal engineer units attached to 1st airborne division would land by glider a short distance from plant demolish it with explosives and then escape over norwegian border into sweden after a period of extensive training airborne force took off in two aircraft glider combinations on night of 19 november 1942 both managed to reach norwegian coast but neither was able to reach their objective first pair suffered from navigational difficulties and severe weather which resulted in tow rope snapping and first glider crash landing with its halifax tug aircraft returning to base three airborne troops were killed outright with survivors captured shortly after crash second pair fared even worse with both aircraft and glider crashing into a mountain for unknown reasons aircrew and some airborne troops were killed outright and those who survived were taken prisoner none survived for very long being executed as a result of adolf hitler s commando order which stated all commando personnel were to be immediately executed upon capture at end of war wehrmacht personnel were tried and condemned to death for their part in executions background german government began development of an atomic weapons programme in april 1939 when two scientists irene and frederic joliot curie declared in an issue of scientific journal nature degroot p 19 that atomic fission was possible and could produce immense amounts of power joliot curies argued that not only did it have possibilities as a power source it might also be used to create an extremely powerful weapon by september 1941 german scientists assigned to programme had determined how a nuclear reactor could be developed this required significant quantities of heavy water to act as a neutron moderator to encase uranium which would be used to provide material for a nuclear weapon degroot p 26 heavy water was extremely scarce and difficult to produce and germany only possessed a small amount which had been produced in laboratories norway possessed a large stockpile which was produced by vemork norsk hydro chemical plant near village of rjukan but norwegian government would not sell more than three gallons of heavy water a month becoming suspicious of sudden increase in demand for water by german government when norway was invaded and occupied by germany in april 1940 this obstruction ended vemork plant was captured and began producing heavy water for german atomic weapons programme lynch p 34 production of heavy water was slowed initially due to effects of fighting in norway and a drought in area which led to a lack of water to provide hydroelectric power for plant once weather improved and snow began to melt providing enough water to create sufficient hydroelectric power production continued dahl p 147 by mid 1942 it had come to attention of british government that plant had begun to produce large quantities of heavy water and was stockpiling it for later use decision was therefore taken that plant and stockpiles of heavy water would have to be destroyed in order to impede german programme dahl p 193 several methods for destroying plant were considered first was a mass raid by royal air force raf bombers but this was rejected due to difficulty in locating plant during night bombing principal bombing tactic used by raf at time and heavy casualties that would be inflicted on local norwegian population during a night raid an attack by norwegian saboteurs was also ruled out as was landing troops by pby catalina flying boat on lake mosvatn from target latter due to steepness of surrounding mountain slopes and inability of flying boats to land on ice mears p 73 it was decided that a raid by glider borne airborne troops would have greatest chance of success area around plant would be difficult to land on but a possible landing site for gliders was located near mosvatn dam although it would require considerable skill on part of glider pilots in order to land safely preparations operation grouse in march 1942 british special operations executive soe had recruited einar skinnarland a norwegian engineer who worked at mosvatn dam skinnarland had successfully sailed to britain and was parachuted back to telemark after ten days of intensive training mears pp 23 24 having several contacts within vemork he was able to roughly identify disposition of german troops and other defences mears p 42 additionally soe decided to send an advance party of norwegian agents into telemark and began intensively training a four man team over summer party code named operation grouse was led by jens anton poulsson and also included knut claus helberg and arne mears p 47 norwegians all people local to area with exceptional outdoors skills mears pp 27 30 underwent extra outdoor training in scotland as well as learning skills necessary to operate in occupied territory including sabotage radio transmitting and irregular warfare mears p 36 grouse team were ready to be inserted by october several flights were made but aborted due to bad weather before team finally dropped on 18 october mears p 46 team landed at on hardangervidda a large wilderness avoided by german forces mears p 48 and spent next 15 days trekking towards mosvatn where they made contact with skinnarland s brother torstein mears p 61 once they had established contact with london party began making preparations for arrival of british commandos a suitable glider landing site was chosen south west of mosvatn p 63 and team reconnoitred area to help combined operations decide best way to attack plant mears p 70 german defences geography of area around village and plant meant that attacking plant and destroying existing stocks of heavy water would be extremely difficult both were situated in a deep valley which possessed thickly forested sides that rose almost vertically from a narrow river bed and which was overlooked by a mountain approximately high plant itself had been built on a broad rock shelf above river bed otway p 70 einar skinnarland had observed german defences over summer and passed information back to soe later reconnaissance by torstein and grouse team was also transmitted to london in weeks leading up to operation mears p 68 in early october generaloberst nikolaus von falkenhorst commander in chief of german forces in norway had visited plant mears p 69 while there he warned local garrison that he believed plant was a likely target for british commando raids but crucially he did not have resources to increase manpower there although einar skinnarland had observed a garrison of 100 men in village of rjukan 20 at dam and about 55 near main plant during summer by october this had been reduced to about 12 at plant 12 at dam and approximately 40 in rjukan most of men were elderly or infirm austrians under command of an elderly captain although well trained german regulars periodically passed through telemark skinnarland also believed that gestapo agents were in area germans had erected three iron across valley to prevent low flying bombing raids but on ground most of their defences were positioned to prevent an assault from ridge above plant direction from which they believed an attack was most likely minefields and booby traps predominantly protected this side of plant but there were also searchlights on roof and a machine gun nest near entrance a single bridge crossed steep gorge in front of plant but was normally only protected by two guards there were 300 000 german troops in norway at this time and reinforcements could quickly be called into area which would complicate commandos escape to swedish border planning headquarters staff of combined operations at war office was tasked with devising a plan for glider borne assault on plant as it had been with previous airborne and commando operations such as operation biting this was first british airborne operation ever to use gliders all previous operations had been conducted solely with parachutists otway p 73 staff decided that although gliders would be most suitable for operation due to heavy loads to be carried by airborne troops and possibility that they could be widely dispersed if they were dropped by parachute airborne troops would still be trained for a possible parachute insertion if landing zone for gliders was found to be unsuitable because of complicated and technical nature of operation which would see plant rigged with explosives and then detonated it was believed that a minimum of twelve to sixteen men was required and that they would all have to be skilled engineers important nature of operation also led to force being doubled in order to duplicate it to ensure that even if half of force were killed survivors would have necessary skills to complete operation lynch p 35 selected troops were volunteer parachutists chosen from sappers of 9th field company airborne royal engineers and field park company airborne royal engineers attached to 1st airborne division because only parachute trained royal engineers unit in existence at time 1st parachute squadron royal engineers was already deployed in north africa with 1st parachute brigade otway p 71 both of duplicated units that were to participate in operation were to be commanded by officers from royal engineers first by lieutenant a c allen and second by second lieutenant m d green who was later replaced by lieutenant d a methven when he was injured during a training accident three days before operation was to begin thumb alt snow covered winter wooded landscape with factory on opposite slope of hills upright vemork hydroelectric plant in snow in 2008 royal air force unit selected to transport sappers was 38 wing which was commanded by group captain t b cooper it was provided with a special allotment of three handley page halifax heavy bombers for operation which were only british aircraft in existence at time which were capable of towing horsa gliders distance required and then returning to their base soe agents selected a landing zone for sappers which was approximately from norsk hydro plant and could not be observed by german patrols wiggan p 50 plan for operation called for sappers to land in two gliders at landing zone guided in by soe agents equipped with eureka radio beacons once they had successfully landed sappers would be escorted to plant by soe agents demolish plant and its stocks of heavy water and then cross norwegian border into neutral sweden combined operations initially suggested men should fight their way to swedish border but believed their chances of survival were better if they attempted to disguise themselves as norwegians and travel in pairs mears p 76 in order to facilitate their escape men were provided with civilian clothes to be worn after operation mears p 77 simple norwegian phrases in hope no german they encountered would speak norwegian mears p 78 and escape sets containing money and maps they were also ordered to shave any moustaches and grow their hair long in order to blend in with norwegian men training training began in early october in wales and was designed to be extremely arduous not only to ensure that those who took part were at peak of their physical and mental fitness but also to eliminate any men unable to cope with long marches and difficult terrain that would be encountered during operation harclerode p 221 when this portion of training had been completed sappers were then transferred to area around fort william in scotland where they were familiarised with a hydroelectric plant similar in design to one in norway and received training on most efficient way to plant explosives in norsk hydro plant to cause maximum damage training also took place at port sunlight where they were shown how to destroy large condensers of kind found in plant sappers were given detailed briefings on plant and surrounding area and were trained on large models and mock ups of buildings that plant was composed of all based on information provided by soe agents who had arrived earlier in month because operation was considered to be extremely important and its results vital to allied war effort security efforts were extremely thorough a cover story was provided for sappers as they conducted their training a rumour was spread that they were training to compete against a company of american engineers in a fictional washington cup athletic event which involved a long route march to be completed either by glider or parachute followed by a complex demolition task and finally a demanding endurance test mears p 75 departure airfield was also sealed off to civilians and non essential military personnel and all mail and telephone calls were censored operation after their training had been completed on 17 november sappers were transported to an raf airfield at skitten in scotland with operation scheduled to commence two days later otway p 72 on evening of 19 november group captain cooper with aid of a norwegian meteorologist and regular reports from soe agents stationed near landing zone decided that although weather was not perfect it would be best to launch operation that night cooper believed that if it were delayed weather might deteriorate on subsequent days and prevent operation from being conducted entirely dahl p 342 first aircraft glider combination took off from airfield at 17 50 with second following at 18 10 after circling airfield several times two combinations headed out across north sea towards their objective first combination first combination flew through poor weather conditions and managed to reach norway and fly towards its objective during flight over norway rebecca receiver which was supposed to pick up transponder signal from eureka beacons being used by norwegian soe agents developed a mechanical problem and was unable to pick up signal this left aircrew with only map reading available to locate landing zone but poor weather made this almost impossible on a second attempt to find correct area combination flew into thick clouds approximately northwest of rjukan and ice began to form on both aircraft and glider as well as towing rope connecting two at this point combination began to lose altitude and towing rope snapped setting glider free low on fuel aircraft was forced to turn back after signaling to skitten at 23 55 that it had released glider and only just succeeded in landing back in britain shortly after releasing glider aircraft broadcast a second message glider in sea indicating air crew s belief that glider had crashed royal navy was asked to begin a search and rescue mission but had no ships in area an aerial search of area was instead conducted but did not find glider wiggan p 54 glider crash landed in an area called overlooking mears p 85 of seventeen men on board three were killed outright thorvald fylgjedalen a local farmer found some of injured soldiers from glider but knew no english and was unable to communicate with them nonetheless fylgjedalen and his neighbour jonas haaheller decided that they would assist wounded soldiers and did not contact german authorities wiggan pp 62 63 after contacting more of local residents soldiers asked for their assistance in escaping to sweden but haaheller and others convinced them that this would be impossible as it would involve travelling across entirety of norway thus norwegians sheltered and gave medical attention to injured soldiers but did not allow any of them to leave wiggan pp 64 66 norwegians also burned all of maps and documents from glider crash before germans could arrive and managed to keep entire operation secret for almost twenty four hours wiggan pp 66 67 german soldiers including troops from both waffen ss and army arrived next afternoon on two boats from a nearby camp they took british soldiers prisoner and departed with them on boats despite grave injuries suffered by some of soldiers they were still forced to walk under their own power and ride in unsheltered boats in cold wiggan p 68 dead soldiers were buried in a shallow grave mears p 86 second combination second combination managed to reach coast of norway but fared even worse than first combination because of a turn in weather wiggan p 59 tow aircraft second halifax piloted by flight lieutenant roland parkinson rcaf wiggan p 53 released glider at a great height and then crashed into a mountain at in high winds rain and hail mears p 90 all of aircrew were killed instantly workmen in area heard plane pass overhead shortly before crashing and alerted german authorities who arrived quickly finding no survivors germans threw bodies of aircrew into a nearby bog and left area wiggan p 62 released just before tow aircraft crashed second glider spiralled out of control and crash landed in mountains between helleland and mears p 89 seven of men were killed instantly and rest were injured to varying degrees wiggan p 64 survivors were unwilling to leave seriously wounded and two of british soldiers left crash site to search for help after searching for some time they arrived in hamlet of helleland about from where they had crashed and made contact with one of local residents trond hovland soldiers told hovland about their injured comrades and asked if he could help them find a doctor hovland agreed to help but informed them that nearest doctor lived away in town of egersund in order to contact him hovland would have to use telephone system controlled by german authorities which would alert them to presence of soldiers believing that there was no alternative soldiers agreed to contact germans expecting that they would be taken as prisoners of war wiggan pp 59 60 a party from norwegian labour service arrived at crash site shortly afterwards and helped tend to injured soldiers who burned all of their sensitive documents and materials a german party arrived about twenty minutes later and british then submitted without a struggle after their arrest prisoners were taken to german camp at slettebo near egersund and shot wiggan pp 60 61 aftermath allies were unaware of fate of operation until they intercepted a german communique stating that two gliders and one aircraft had been forced down and crews engaged and annihilated mears p 84 on 11 december they received a message from an soe agent explaining that second gliders occupants had all been shot mears p 87 many of details about fate of two glider combinations were only discovered after war had ended none of soldiers or aircrew who survived crashes remained alive for very long of soldiers from first glider three of four injured men were tortured by gestapo and later killed by a doctor who injected air into their fourth injured man was shot in back of head next day all four bodies were dumped at sea five uninjured men were held at grini concentration camp until 18 january 1943 when they were taken to nearby woods blindfolded and executed by gestapo german wehrmacht and gestapo argued over fate of prisoners from second glider mears p 88 wehrmacht believed they should be treated in accordance with geneva convention but in end survivors were interrogated and executed within a few hours of their capture at german barracks at they were taken into nearby woods and shot one by one each being forced to listen to man before him being executed their bodies were stripped and thrown into an unmarked grave all of executions were conducted in accordance with commando order issued by adolf hitler in october 1942 which stated that all commando troops were to be killed immediately upon capture local norwegian population were unable to prevent prisoners being executed but tended graves of dead until end of war although allied soldiers believed that they had burnt all of their maps one from second glider was missed when germans found it they were able to identify vemork plant as target and increased their defence accordingly mears p 94 german reprisals started instantly and 200 armed gestapo agents swept into rjukan where they arrested 21 norwegians for questioning mears p 92 but members of operation grouse slipped away into wilderness of hardangervidda they later contributed to successful operation in february 1943 when a small team of norwegian soe agents were parachuted into area and demolished much of vemork heavy water plant dahl p 204 plant eventually resumed operation but further bombing raids ensured it produced little heavy water for german atomic weapons programme dahl p 236 although operation had been a failure it demonstrated range flexibility and possibilities of airborne forces and glider operations and also highlighted equipment failures that were rectified for later operations this included developing a new version of rebecca eureka homing device system mk ii which was ready by 1943 and proved to be very successful when used in later airborne operations during operation market garden and operation varsity aircraft that used system reported a 95 success rate otway p 406 alt building in wooded hills thumb vemork hydroelectric plant as it looks today heavy water production took place in now demolished hydrogen production plant formerly situated to left i e in front of building in picture when 1st airborne division arrived in norway in may 1945 they were informed of fate of prisoners and cooperated with norwegian government to have men buried with full military honours five from first glider were re interred at commonwealth war graves plot at vestre near oslo second glider s occupants were reburied at churchyard in stavanger and halifax aircrew were reburied at helleland mears p 91 head of gestapo in oslo who had signed order for prisoners executions killed himself several days prior to 1st airborne division s arrival in may 1945 but several wehrmacht personnel implicated in decision to execute prisoners were put on trial and found guilty one was shot and another hanged whilst a senior non commissioned officer who had shot a prisoner in back of head was extradited to soviet union for alleged abuse conducted against soviet prisoners commander of german forces in norway generaloberst
