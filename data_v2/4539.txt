positive they only expressed concern with a very brief scene in which cecil talks to a visible character whom he refers to as maris in frasier maris crane is an unseen character and producers of frasier asked that scene be removed many of interactions between bob and cecil were based on those of niles and frasier cecil was drawn to resemble david hyde pierce while retaining a visual

entertaining and episode didn t result in a whole lot of laughs he noted that only italian bob and ninth ranked funeral for a fiend were only ones i d consider remaining episodes are all quite fun analysis in planet simpson author chris turner writes that bob is built into a highbrow snob and conservative republican so that writers can continually use him as a strawman and pincushion he represents high culture while krusty represents low culture and bart stuck in between always wins out in book leaving springfield david l g arnold comments that bart is a product of a mass culture upbringing and thus is bob s enemy arnold pp 2 3 frustrated by his early role as target of krusty s cheap gags bob frames krusty and takes over show he changes content of that show to present readings of classic literature and segments examining emotional lives of pre teens he believes that by exposing kids to high culture he will improve their lives arnold writes that bob s own conscience and morality are clearly unaffected by high culture he represents he also tries to manipulate tastes of masses by becoming a criminal mastermind arnold pp 12 13 arnold believes that this is most apparent in sideshow bob roberts wherein he rigs election to become mayor of springfield when accused of election fraud he rants your guilty consciences may force you to vote democratic but secretly you yearn for a cold hearted republican who ll cut taxes brutalize criminals and rule you like a king you need me springfield he considers himself a member of social elite and happily uses machiavellian methods to acquire and maintain power arnold p 17 bob s intelligence serves him in many ways during episode cape feare for example parole board asks bob why he has a tattoo that says die bart die bob replies that it is german for bart members of board are impressed by his reasoning believing that nobody who speaks german could be an evil man they release him however his love of high culture is sometimes used against him in same episode bob agrees to perform operetta h m s pinafore in its entirety as a last request for bart tactic stalls bob long enough for police to arrest him arnold p 16 references
