greatest films of 21st century plot in 1987 two university students in an unnamed romanian town otilia mihartescu and gabriela gabita dragut are roommates in a dormitory when gabita becomes pregnant two young women arrange a meeting with mr bebe in a hotel where he is to perform an illegal abortion at college dorm gabita and otilia review items they need for day as gabita nervously sits and waits otilia barters and buys soap and cigarettes from dormitory shop afterwards otilia takes a bus to visit her boyfriend adi from whom she borrows money adi asks otilia to visit his family that night as it is his mother s birthday otilia initially declines relenting after adi becomes upset otilia heads to hotel where gabita has booked a room only to be informed by an unfriendly receptionist that there is no reservation under gabita s last name consequently otilia visits another hotel tineretului and after much begging and haggling is able to book a room at an expensive rate after speaking with gabita on telephone otilia goes to a rendezvous point to meet with mr bebe although he had asked gabita that she meet him personally mr bebe grows angry upon hearing that gabita is not at planned hotel at tineretului mr bebe discovers that gabita s claim that her pregnancy was in its second or third month was a lie and that it has been at least four months this changes procedure and also adds risk of a murder charge while two women were certain that they would pay no more than 3 000 lei for abortion it slowly becomes clear that mr bebe expects both women to have sex with him desperate and distressed otilia has sex with mr bebe so that he will not walk out on them as does gabita mr bebe then performs abortion by injecting a probe and an unnamed fluid into gabita s uterus and leaves otilia instructions on how to dispose of fetus when it comes out otilia is exasperated by gabita s lies yet continues to help and care for her otilia leaves gabita at tineretului to attend adi s mother s birthday party she is still disturbed but stays and has dinner with adi s mother s friends who are mostly doctors they converse about trivial matters while otilia and adi remain silent after otilia accepts a cigarette in front of adi s parents one of guests starts talking about lost values and respect for elders adi and otilia retreat to his room where she tells him about gabita s abortion they begin debating what would happen if it were otilia who was pregnant as adi is opposed to abortion after argument otilia calls gabita from adi s house gabita does not answer so otilia decides to return to hotel when otilia enters hotel room gabita is lying on bed and she tells otilia that fetus has been expelled and is in bathroom otilia wraps fetus with some towels and puts it in a bag while gabita asks her to bury it otilia walks outside finally climbing to top of a building as mr bebe had suggested and dropping bag in a trash chute she returns to tineretului and finds gabita sitting in its restaurant otilia sits and tells gabita that they are never going to talk about episode again otilia stares blankly at gabita production historical background thumb film is based on nicolae ceausescu s romania of 1980s romanian communist party general secretary nicolae ceausescu enacted abortion law decree 770 in 1966 in order to increase birth rates in country procedure was permitted in only extremely limited circumstances law was not based on any religious opposition to abortion but on government s authority and control over its citizens academic adriana cordali gradea further argued justifications for decree rendered a view of women as second class citizens with no right to be heard in 1980s decree was strengthened to mandate gynecological appointments to assess if individual women could reproduce author dominique nasta judged film to be an accurate portrait of oppression and on poor state of economy of socialist republic of romania in later days of ceausescu s regime during years of decree 770 only available abortion methods all illegal could prove fatal to women causing thousands of deaths according to mungiu s notes he shared with press death toll was 500 000 gradea cited a conservative 10 000 estimate sanctions against contraception were also in place and sex education was rare following 1989 revolution abortion was made lawful and subsequently unrestricted in first 14 weeks development initial idea for 4 months 3 weeks and 2 days was inspired by an anecdote from communist romania that director cristian mungiu had heard though he had heard it from a friend 15 years prior to film incident occurred five years before that in 1987 a date that mungiu noted in screenplay mungiu himself a born in time of decree 770 wanted to create a serious film focusing on true story which still affected him and felt tragic more than 15 years later he conducted interviews with others who lived through period to determine if experience was common aside from anecdote depicting 1980s in romania was appealing because he remembered time and attraction is for stories that i know from that period they belong to me they belong to my generation he hoped that basing story on a factual account would also distinguish it from previous romanian films in setting out to write screenplay he intended focus to be less on abortion and more on time and its people he said it s also a film about responsibilities and decision making as he continued writing he stated pushing a political point was not so much a factor in editing as he opted not to delete potential scenes if they felt credible asking would this reasonably have happened and does it make sense to story to keep it mungiu revised screenplay numerous times during productions creating 17 drafts major revision was emergence of otilia as sole protagonist while gabita s part was reduced in mungiu s mind otilia had become determined to help gabita because their shared life in dormitory over four years would have created an emotional tie between them film was produced on a budget of under eur600 000 casting actor role otilia mihartescu gabriela gabita dragut mr viorel bebe adi radu gina radu adi s mother dr radu adi s father dora casting took place during autumn of 2006 because of extended takes mungiu sought actors who could remember large amounts of dialogue and found that vlad ivanov was ideal for a 25 minute sequence mungiu viewed auditions of many young women for two protagonists anamaria marinca had not worked with mungiu before reading screenplay and found story intriguing she had performed on television but had not appeared in a film before on initially meeting marinca director could not picture her in lead role but was won over when she began reading first page of screenplay she had experience on stage so lengthy takes were agreeable to her laura vasiliu also had stage experience filming filming began in october 2006 with objective to complete it by may so that it could be entered into 2007 cannes film festival after location scouting during fall most of filming was done in bucharest with some scenes filmed in a hotel in ploiesti bucharest in 2006 was no longer how it would have appeared in 1987 due to new windows and other additions to historic buildings production designer mihaela drew on her recollections of period to prepare locations mr bebe character was also given a red dacia car in several scenes indoor locations were so small that camera had to be placed outside of room thumb a red dacia was used in production to highlight emotional state of characters film was shot in long takes close ups were avoided and a score was not used in mungiu s mind this would keep a proper distance from subject and be honest with story cinematographer oleg mutu opted for a minimalist approach lighting backgrounds to display items common in 1987 while attempting not to distract from characters too much mutu and mungiu had previously developed a formula of lengthy takes and medium shots with director s first feature film occident with 4 months 3 weeks and 2 days mutu used an arriflex 535 mungiu found dinner scene to be most difficult to shoot as including a large number of actors in a long take made it difficult to focus it took 17 attempts over five days to complete scene in one scene aborted fetus is visible on screen for approximately 14 seconds length it took for actors to deliver dialogue with mungiu opting not to edit out shot since it was part of story chute featured at end of film was constructed for film as there was not one at location crew dropped bags of cabbage and potatoes to create sound effect due to mungiu saying romania did not use streetlights in 1987 mutu considered other ways to light final scenes where camera would move with marinca for 200 metres mutu set up lights from building roofs for this sequence employing a rod and paper lanterns for camera a scene showing gabita visiting her father played by babu was deleted for narrative purposes given otilia is protagonist themes and interpretations academic judit summed up plot as story of a friendship facing a moral test scholar florentina c andreescu opined two female protagonists share emotional loyalty while in wake of mr bebe s abuses otilia becomes increasingly suspicious of adi professor laszlo said that film emphasises ways that romania s abortion laws inflicted humiliations on protagonists particularly between people of differing authority and sex he argued that class and generational conflicts are presented in dinner party scene where characters have more food than lower classes discuss social issues such as conscription into romanian armed forces and treat otilia as representative of new generation that does not appreciate what it has been given academic claudiu turcus remarked that dinner scene where characters look down on some careers and act as if smoking in front of one s elders is disrespectful shows how regressive they are ovidius university author ileana jitaru credited film for reconstructing an entire communist class ideology which divided society into working class people and intellectuals jitaru specifically cited dinner scene where conversation makes much of divide between those with university degrees and those with none attendees boast about belonging to middle class and make denigrating comments about otilia s rural origins term communism is never mentioned existence of decree 770 is only implied and dictator nicolae ceausescu is never named despite this communism is a major subject andreescu found that in many locations one power is dominant in some government while in others an underground power or forms hotel room where abortion is performed becomes a location outside of government s supervision mr bebe exploits this boasts of worth of his expertise and notes risk he is taking in order to extort women for sex turcus instead interpreted scene as mr bebe presenting himself as new man sharing women s legal peril and an openness to sexuality while in fact being communist brute jump cut writer constantin parvulescu stated 4 months 3 weeks and 2 days provides an astute balance of and anti communist memorial parvulescu elaborated that beginning gives a view of place and possessions that could be nostalgic but these become overruled by crisis in communist society essayist adriana cordali gradea suggested that silence is a theme of film and that citizens of communist nations would use silence to endure and resist this is seen at end where otilia forbids further discussion of abortion lack of a score can also be seen as contributing to a sense of pending danger thumb dinner scene is accidentally reminiscent of last supper fact that characters live in poverty is reflected in a scene where mr bebe his mother for wanting to buy sugar when otilia is searching for mr bebe there is also a line of people visible in background queuing for food reflecting lack of food security in 1980s additionally characters are often impolite towards each other mungiu explained that this was related to poverty saying you need people in a society to have reached a certain standard of living before they can be polite bartering scenes reflect how corporate goods common west of iron curtain were prohibited in romania and were viewed as luxuries dinner scene is reminiscent of last supper author doru pop acknowledged differing number of characters and no male jesus but asserted that it is relevant to have a dinner while a tragedy is unfolding mungiu conceded that such similarities were accidental and that once he appreciated potential analogy during production filmmakers added a more focused view of otilia to reveal her stress style thumb an empire critic positively reviewed colour scheme which academic ileana jitaru identified as including desaturated greys blues and greens scholar dominique nasta saw style as a minimalist less is more line british film institute writer ben walters judged it simple and rigorous with scenes composed of only one or two shots walters remarked on handheld mobile almost literally breathtaking shots and on impact of still scenes despite handheld camera mungiu said crew developed a style where shots were taken so action is followed but camera s movements would not be overly obvious to audience journalist brian gibson assessed photography as patient alert dogged in its observation of otilia s endeavours surveying photography academic ileana jitaru found simple austere and realistic compositions in which black humour is a stylistic means of anchoring theme s jitaru also commented on colour scheme observing cold desaturated colours particularly greys blues and greens in beginning additionally story set during a single day is related by real time narrative in its scenes although minutes or hours may separate events in separate scenes according to mungiu real time was meant to achieve a sense of continuity true to life guardians peter bradshaw interpreted style as a nightmare of social realist suspense independent critic jonathan romney characterized it as claustrophobic in parts and an intense realist exercise despite this he also believed that hotel scenes communicate a sense of almost supernatural horror and asks of noise heard after mr bebe chastises his mother a backfire a gunshot who can tell but it lends scene its bizarre oppressive air of ill omen critic peter debruge declared style antithesis of your well lit elegantly shot hollywood movies or locally made films of mungiu s childhood journalist steven boone said that while film was well reviewed for its bracing drabness its ugliness its lack of style he believed it was beautiful and stylized because it is alive and piercingly present tense he compared it with films of brothers mungiu said he aimed to begin scenes including first without giving audience background information and letting viewers discern what was happening journalist lauren judged story a suspense thriller comparable to work of alfred hitchcock she felt heat in each frame writing we re waiting for bomb constant threat of imprisonment or death that defined life under nicolae aside from reflecting length of fictional pregnancy 4 3 2 form of title creates impression of rushed countdown reinforcing thriller genre aspects gradea wrote responding to analogies to style mungiu said in 2008 that he had only seen their la promesse 1996 but was now interested in seeing more and that he had asked brothers to attend a showing of his film mungiu compared his style more to those of milos forman and jiri menzel though he said he was influenced more by certain films than by a director s general filmography release thumb director cristian mungiu at 2007 san sebastian international film festival film debuted on first day of cannes film festival in may 2007 at cannes ifc films purchased

greatest films of 21st century abortion debate on its international release film became partially viewed through lens of abortion debate with emma wilson writing in film quarterly that imdb user reviews were highlighting this and comparing it to juno wilson observed 4 months 3 weeks and 2 days displayed aborted fetus comparable to u s pro life movement s use of such images but argued film was closer to pro choice ideology in its focus on law s harm to women wilson further argued that true point was loyalty of two characters mungiu said fetus shot was not linked to pro life movement as romanians did not commonly use these depictions and abortion debate was no longer prominent there anti abortion protests comparable to those in u s or ireland did not occur in romania until 2005 when orthodox church commented on matter mungiu also declined to state his position on abortion and said he attempted to keep his film and his personal position separate scholars oana kenworthy and oana popescu sandu argued film was simply about communism and minimalism allowed for foreign audiences to see what they wanted including a statement on abortion debate in canadian feminist magazine reviewer maureen medved judged 4 months 3 weeks and 2 days to approximate a horror film in depicting abuses that women suffer when abortion is illegal in anticipation of 2008 u s presidential election time critics mary and richard corliss also cited film to discourage electing a candidate opposed to roe v wade saying film revealed potential negative consequences in australian feminist law journal fiona jenkins interpreted story as a morally ambiguous argument that safe abortion services should be allowed but that otilia telling gabita they will never talk about matter reflects her trauma not only of what she has undergone but what she has done peter t chattaway writing for christianity today opined that abortion itself is handled in a way that could be seen to support both sides of abortion debate given abuse to women but also portrayal of procedure s bloody aftermath writer maierhofer also interpreted it as not simply for or against abortion maierhofer commented a woman will consider many things in making a choice including health finances and what potential child would face in a discussion with adi otilia indicates she would not be ready to enter a marriage and raise a family gabita s reasons are never said it can be presumed she made decision herself though maierhofer wrote at times she appears irresponsible accolades at 2007 cannes film festival cristian mungiu became first romanian filmmaker to win palme d or festival s highest honour later it became first romanian work to receive european film award for best film in its home country it was nominated for 15 gopo awards and won nine including best film despite competing for academy award for best foreign language film 4 months 3 weeks and 2 days was not shortlisted creating controversy among critics and online film fans as it had won palme d or controversy caused an academy member to pledge nomination reform though category had often sparked criticism mungiu later said omission and subsequent furor brought picture substantial publicity and that experience taught him that critics and festival juries have differing tastes from academy legacy following academy award controversy academy reformed its methodology of choosing best foreign language film nominees allowing a committee of approximately 20 members to name three favourite candidates balancing out a shortlist composed by a second committee made up of hundreds of voters steven zeitchik of los angeles times remarked nominees of 2011 reflected change displaying unorthodox and challenging subject matter such as youth violence in a better world incest by rape and particularly torture in 2013 wrap named mungiu man who changed oscar s rules mungiu reportedly planned 4 months 3 weeks and 2 days to be first in a loose series of films titled tales from a golden age mungiu explained that golden age of romania is a term used nationally for ceausescu s final nine years in power though he said people then suffered shortages and hardship he intended to make six short films under banner tales from golden age and then allow younger directors to take over series in 2009 he released a single film called tales from golden age following 4 months 3 weeks and 2 days in depicting ceausescu era and starring vlad ivanov his next film beyond hills 2012 similarly depicted romanian extremism and mungiu was inspired to make cinematic adaptation after seeing stage version in new york while promoting 4 months 3 weeks and 2 days notes see also list of romanian submissions for academy award for best foreign language film
