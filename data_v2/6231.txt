cryptoprocta spelea also known as giant fossa alcover and mcminn 1994 table 1 is an extinct species of carnivore from madagascar in family eupleridae which is most closely related to mongooses and includes all malagasy carnivorans it was first described in 1902 and in 1935 was recognized as a separate species from its closest relative living fossa cryptoprocta ferox c spelea is larger than fossa but otherwise similar two have not always been accepted as distinct species when and how larger form became extinct is unknown there is some anecdotal evidence including reports of very large fossas that there is more than one surviving species species is known from subfossil bones found in a variety of caves in northern western southern and central madagascar in some sites it occurs with remains of c ferox but there is no evidence that two lived in same places at same time living species of comparably sized related carnivores in other regions manage to coexist suggesting that same may have happened with both c spelea and c ferox c spelea would have been able to prey on larger animals than its smaller relative could have including recently extinct giant lemurs taxonomy in 1902 guillaume grandidier described subfossil carnivoran remains from two caves on madagascar as a larger variety of living fossa cryptoprocta ferox c ferox var spelea g petit writing in 1935 considered spelea to represent a distinct species goodman et al 2004 p 130 charles lamberton reviewed subfossil and living cryptoprocta in 1939 and agreed with petit in recognizing two species goodman et al 2004 pp 130 131 naming this species from a specimen found at ankazoabo cave near itampolo specific name spelea means cave and was given because of location of its discovery goodman et al 2003 p 1167 however lamberton apparently had at most three skeletons of living fossa not nearly enough to capture range of variation in that species and some later authors did not separate c spelea and c ferox as species goodman et al 2004 p 131 steven goodman and colleagues using larger samples compiled another set of cryptoprocta measurements that was published in a 2004 article they found that some subfossil cryptoprocta fell outside range of variation of living c ferox and identified those as representing c spelea goodman et al 2004 p 136 grandidier had not designated a type specimen for species and to maintain c spelea as name for larger form of fossa goodman and colleagues designated a specimen to serve as type specimen specifically a neotype goodman et al 2004 pp 136 137 lamberton recognized a third species cryptoprocta antamba on basis of a mandible lower jaw with abnormally broad spacing between condyloid processes at back lamberton 1939 p 191 he also referred two femora upper leg bones and a tibia lower leg bone intermediate in size between c spelea and c ferox to this species lamberton 1939 p 193 specific name refers to antamba an animal allegedly from southern madagascar described by etienne de flacourt in 1658 as a large rare leopard like carnivore that eats men and calves and lives in remote mountainous areas goodman et al 2003 p 1169 2004 p 131 it may have been giant fossa turvey 2009 p 34 goodman and colleagues could not locate lamberton s material of cryptoprocta antamba but suggested that it was based on an abnormal c spelea goodman et al 2004 p 137 together fossa and c spelea form genus cryptoprocta within family eupleridae which also includes other malagasy carnivorans falanouc and dna sequence studies suggest that eupleridae form a single natural monophyletic group and are most closely related to mongooses of eurasia and mainland africa garbutt 2007 p 208 description thumb left alt a cat like mammal on a rock fossa cryptoprocta ferox is a smaller relative of c spelea that still survives although some morphological differences between two fossa species have been described lamberton 1939 p 182 these may be allometric growth related and in their 1986 mammalian species account of fossa michael kohncke and klaus leonhardt wrote that two were morphologically identical kohncke and leonhardt 1986 p 2 however remains of c spelea are larger than any living c ferox goodman and colleagues found that skull measurements in specimens they identified as c spelea were 1 07 to 1 32 times as large as in adult c ferox and postcranial measurements were 1 19 to 1 37 times as large only specimen of c spelea in which condylobasal length a measure of total skull length could be ascertained measured 153 4 mm 6 04 in compared to a range of 114 5 to 133 3 mm 4 51 to 5 25 in in adult c ferox humerus upper arm bone length in twelve c spelea is 122 7 to 146 8 mm 4 83 to 5 78 in averaging 137 9 mm 5 43 in compared to 108 5 to 127 5 mm 4 27 to 5 02 in averaging 116 1 mm 4 57 in in extant fossa goodman et al 2004 table 1 body mass estimates for c spelea range from 17 kg 37 lb personal communication from r in burness et al 2001 table 1 to 20 kg 44 lb wroe et al 2004 p 297 and it was among largest carnivores of island burness et al 2001 table 1 by comparison adult c ferox range from 5 kg 11 lb to 10 kg 22 lb garbutt 2007 p 211 distribution ecology and extinction collection sites site spe fer ankazoabo antsirabe belo sur mer ny lelia abbreviations spe c spelea fer c ferox cryptoprocta spelea is only extinct carnivoran mammal known from madagascar recently extinct madagascan animals also include at least 17 species of lemurs most of which are larger than living forms as well as elephant birds and malagasy hippopotamuses among others burney et al 2004 p 25 subfossil remains of giant fossa have been found in holocene cave sites from northern end of madagascar along west coast to far south and in central highlands some sites have yielded both c spelea and smaller remains referable to living species c ferox however lack of robust stratigraphic knowledge and no available radiocarbon dating on subfossil cryptoprocta bones makes it uncertain whether two species lived in same region at same time goodman et al 2003 pp 1167 1168 2004 pp 140 141 size ratio between two species is within range of ratios seen between similar sized living cats and mongooses found in same areas suggesting that two species may have been able to occur together goodman et al 2004 p 141 with its large size and massive jaws and teeth goodman et al 2004 p 138 c spelea was a formidable puma like goodman 2003 quoted in colquhoun 2006 p 148 predator and in addition to smaller lemurids it may have eaten some of big now extinct subfossil lemurs that would have been too large for c ferox goodman et al 2004 pp 138 140 colquhoun 2006 pp 148 156 no subfossil evidence has been found to definitively show that lemurs were its prey this assumption is based on diet of smaller extant species of fossa goodman 2003 p 1227 other possible prey include tenrecs smaller euplerids and even young malagasy hippopotamuses alcover and mcminn 1994 p 14 its extinction may have changed predation dynamics on madagascar while not known it is possible that c spelea went extinct before 1400 goodman et al 2004 p 140 iucn red list currently lists c spelea as an extinct species why and when it became extinct remains unknown however local people on madagascar often recognize two forms of fossa a larger fosa mainty or black cryptoprocta and a smaller fosa mena or reddish cryptoprocta goodman et al 2003 p 1168 2004 p 141 there are also some anecdotal records of very large living fossas such as a 2 m 7 ft 30 kg 70 lb fossa at morondava
