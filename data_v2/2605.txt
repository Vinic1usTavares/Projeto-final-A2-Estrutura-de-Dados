spouting smoke swallowing and nut and handkerchief swallowing followed by disgorgement in an order chosen by audience ali s most famous stunt and highlight of his act was drinking copious amounts of water followed by kerosene and then acting by turns as a human flamethrower and fire extinguisher as he expelled two liquids onto a theatrical prop while these stunts were performed a panel of audience members was invited to watch show up close to verify that no trickery was employed although he never gained wide fame ali had a dedicated following on vaudeville circuit in united states he

died in england his body was offered to johns hopkins university for study though offer was declined background hadji ali was born into a working class family in approximately 1887 or 1892 depending on source consulted probably in egypt his fame was as a practitioner of a recognized vaudeville subgenre known as a regurgitation act involving swallowing of material or objects and their regurgitation in various ways ali became aware as a child that he possessed an unusual gastric ability he explained in response to audience questions at a performance held at st mary s hospital in niagara falls new york in may 1926 that while swimming in nile as a ten year old boy he naturally discovered that he could swallow a large amount of water and blow it out like a whale spouting he continued to develop and refine ability as he grew older a more dramatic version of these events was provided by ali s daughter almina ali in an interview in england after his death she stated that his abilities were first learned through a single incident while bathing in nile he inadvertently swallowed a fish and an ample volume of water instead of dying as those present thought he might ali simply regurgitated liquid and fish without ill effect ali learned that his regurgitation talents had potential to entertain and to earn money through performance at age of fifteen i tried out my tricks first of all in street swallowing many glasses of water and then pouring forth a great fountain from one side of road to other a cafe proprietor saw me doing this one day and chased me down street i thought he wanted to beat me up but no all he did was to put a coin in my hand and ask me to repeat trick finally he was so delighted that he asked me to come to his cafe and entertain customers taking his abilities on road ali met an italian man in cairo who signed him to a contract for music hall performances ali performed under contract throughout europe and at times for heads of state according to ali in or about 1914 he was summoned by tsar nicholas ii of russia to perform at winter palace in saint petersburg russia he stated that tsar must have liked my performance because he awarded me a special decoration which is now one of my most treasured possessions following world war i ali began managing his own affairs and toured world learning more tricks as he went left

sensation ali came to united states with almina in mid 1920s they performed together at fairs carnivals and in vaudeville sometimes advertised under collective name hadji ali co almina played part of assistant in her father s act billed in his shows as princess ali alone had a variety of stage names including great egyptian miracle man amazing regurgitator egyptian enigma human aquarium human volcano and 9th wonder of scientific world ali has been described as a large barrel chested and bearded man that cut an imposing figure in his arab costume although ali spoke a number of languages and became a naturalized u s citizen it was reported that almina acted as his interpreter in united states and other places as he did not speak english and was illiterate once he had gained some notoriety ali took on as his manager hubert julian a former colonel in abyssinian air force although he developed a significant following even being named judy garland s favorite vaudevillian ali remained more a sideshow curiosity than a true vaudeville headliner according to at least one source nevertheless at time of his death in 1937 julian commented that ali had earned big money in america 1 000 a week sometimes i was building him up here in europe and had a continental tour arranged performance thumb right alt hadji ali standing outdoors before four people his head back and hands on hips with a stream of water gushing like a fountain from his mouth hadji ali demonstrating his skills mainstay of ali s act was water spouting after swallowing large amounts of water 60 to 100 glasses at a time he spouted water in a continuous stream for a sustained period of time sometimes approaching one minute another common trick was to swallow 30 to 50 hazelnuts although one of his posters advertised 40 pecans followed by another nut of a different variety such as an almond ali then brought them up one by one with odd nut out produced at a mark called out by audience p p in another trick ali swallowed three to six handkerchiefs of different hues and then produced them in a color order requested by audience members in a 1929 article appearing in lowell sun newspaper physician morris fishbein speculated that for ali s nut feat one nut of a different variety was held in mouth rather than swallowed thus allowing him to produce it on cue dr fishbein also stated that unnamed investigators were convinced that for ali s handkerchief stunt to produce them in sequence stipulated by audience ali flavored cloth and could therefore taste for correct one as he brought them up ali also swallowed live goldfish watches coins costume jewelry paper money peach pits stones live mice buttons pool balls and other odd objects p p p p in another standard performance segment he placed eight or more lit cigarettes in his mouth but instead of inhaling he swallowed smoke and after a significant time had passed issued it forth in a steady stream like an erupting volcano ali s longstanding finale was swallowing of copious amounts of water again but this time followed by a pint of kerosene a prop was then produced typically a model castle or house made of metal set on a table within which a small flame burned lighter than water and immiscible with it kerosene floated above liquid in ali s gut allowing him to disgorge it first stage thus set and to a drum roll or an imitation of fire bells ali became a human flamethrower spewing accelerant in a long stream over sacrificial prop setting it ablaze once kerosene was exhausted water followed streaming out his mouth in a long flow from up to six feet away extinguishing fire at some performances a panel or jury from audience was invited on stage to verify that no trick mechanism was being employed that he was actually swallowing items in question and delivering them back through acts of regurgitation sometimes ali would stroll into audience during his nut swallowing trick his stomach exposed by his standard costume he invited audience members to pat his stomach allowing them to hear nuts rattling within one newspaper reported that ali s feats essentially controlled vomiting were performed in a manner without least bit of unpleasantness or anything bordering on repulsiveness not everyone felt same at least one of ali s engagements was cut short once proprietor realized that nature of act was killing their supper shows famed and magician harry houdini remarked in his 1920 work miracle mongers and their methods that water spouting was a performance that could not fail to disgust a modern audience abilities of ali fascinated public and medical authorities as reported in a 1928 sheboygan press article at one of ali s acts a number of doctors attended and thoroughly examined him during performance they came away satisfied that he was actually and regurgitating material and objects as claimed but remained mystified over his extraordinary performance according to an article appearing in daily news physicians of three continents have puzzled over gastronomical mechanism of this human ostrich without success x ray experiments have been made during his exhibition without a plausible explanation forthcoming that satisfies critical in fact profession of surgery has thrown up its hands in amazement over this human ostrich film appearances ali s act was captured in two films 1930

england from heart failure during a bout of bronchitis even before his death a rumor had circulated that rockefeller institute sought to procure ali s stomach upon his death and would pay as much as
