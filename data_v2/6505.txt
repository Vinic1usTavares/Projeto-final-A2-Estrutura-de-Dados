best and second fastest leg for team usa which turned in fastest preliminary swim and third fastest among all 64 swimmers he attributed his performance to concentrating exclusively on freestyle during two months between trials and games of his olympic experience tarwater said even at 28 with a lot of international experience nothing matches olympics my heart was pumping so intensely that i was just trying to calm myself down standing on blocks waiting to take exchange i was just saying breathe breathe breathe it s such a rush typically relay team for finals is composed of top two qualifiers plus two fastest swimmers in preliminaries in 2012 however u s team had its top three swimmers in reserve as phelps would swim relay final despite dropping individual 200 meter freestyle from his program after tarwater s fast preliminary swim u s coaches strongly considered replacing number three olympic trials qualifier ricky berens with tarwater in finals before electing to go with berens due to berens greater experience in finals u s relay team beat second place french team by three seconds winning tarwater a gold medal tarwater did not immediately announce whether he would retire again

challenged tarwater to re examine his worldview a ha moments were many tarwater later recalled b y time i had ability to repent and rebuke stuff in my life i was finally at a good time in life i would
