to colonel and assumed command of regiment succeeding elzey warner p 290 who was promoted to brigadier general he soon began to acquire a reputation as a strict disciplinarian and gained admiration of his men goldsborough p 30 though he was initially unpopular as a result steuart was said to have ordered his men to sweep bare dirt inside their bivouacs and rather more eccentrically was prone to sneaking through lines past unwitting sentries in order to test their vigilance on one occasion this plan backfired as steuart was pummeled and beaten by a sentry who later claimed not to have recognized general green p 125 eventually however steuart s rigid system of discipline quietly and quickly to health and morale of this splendid command according to major w w goldsborough who served in steuart s maryland infantry at gettysburg it was not only his love for a clean camp but a desire to promote health and comfort of his men that made him unyielding in enforcement of sanitary rules

immediate divisional commander allan p 143 proper channels had not been followed a frustrated pendleton then rode two miles to find ewell who duly gave order but seemed surprised that general steuart had not gone on immediately steuart eventually gave chase and overtook advance of confederate infantry picking up many prisoners but as a result of delay confederate cavalry did not overtake federal army until it was in words of jackson s report beyond reach of successful pursuit jackson continued there is good reason for believing that had cavalry played its part in this pursuit but a small portion of banks army would have made its escape to potomac goldsborough p 46 it remains unclear precisely why steuart was reluctant to pursue banks defeated army more vigorously and contemporary records shed little light on matter freeman p 215 it may be that his thirteen years training as a cavalry officer led him to obey orders to letter with little or no room for personal initiative or variation from strict due process no charges were brought against him however despite jackson s reputation as a stern disciplinarian freeman p 216 it is possible that jackson s leniency had to do with strong desire of confederacy to recruit marylanders to southern cause and need to avoid offending marylanders who might be tempted to join lee s army soon after winchester on june 2 steuart was
