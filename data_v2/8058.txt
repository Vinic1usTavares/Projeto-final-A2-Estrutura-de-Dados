in february 1961 he married hayfron in a roman catholic ceremony conducted in salisbury she had converted to catholicism to make this possible british government held a salisbury conference in 1961 to determine southern rhodesia s future nkomo led an ndp delegation which hoped that british would support creation of an independent state governed by black majority representatives of country s white minority who then controlled southern rhodesia s government were opposed to this promoting continued white minority rule following negotiations nkomo agreed to a proposal which would allow black population representation through 15 of 65 seats in country s parliament mugabe and others in ndp were furious at nkomo s compromise following conference southern rhodesia s african nationalist movement fell into disarray mugabe spoke at a number of ndp rallies before party was banned by government in december 1961 many of its members re grouped as zimbabwe african people s union zapu several days later with mugabe appointed as zapu s publicity secretary and general secretary racial violence was growing in country with aggrieved black africans targeting white community mugabe deemed such conflict a necessary tactic in overthrow of british colonial dominance and white minority rule this contrasted with nkomo s view that african nationalists should focus on international diplomacy to encourage british government to grant their demands nine months after it had been founded zapu was also banned by government and in september 1962 mugabe and other senior party officials were arrested and restricted to their home districts for three months both mugabe and his wife were in trouble with law he had been charged with making subversive statements in a public speech and

tightening security and establishing full independence from united kingdom mugabe met with colleagues at his house in salisbury s highbury district where he argued that as political demonstrations were simply being banned it was time to move towards armed resistance both he and others rejected nkomo s proposal that they establish a government in exile in dar es salaam he and hayfron skipped bail to attend a zapu meeting in city there party leadership met tanganyika s president julius nyerere who also dismissed idea of a government in exile and urged zapu to organise their resistance to white minority rule within southern rhodesia itself in august hayfron gave birth to mugabe s son whom they named nhamodzenyika a shona term meaning suffering country mugabe insisted that she take their son back to ghana while he decided to return to southern rhodesia there african nationalists opposed to nkomo s leadership had established a new party zimbabwe african national union zanu in august ndabaningi sithole became group s president while appointing mugabe to be group s secretary general in absentia nkomo responded by forming his own group people s caretaker council which was

a leave of absence to visit his wife in ghana he never forgave prison authorities for refusing this request claims have also circulated among those who knew him at time that mugabe was subjected to both physical and mental torture during his imprisonment according to father emmanuel ribeiro who was mugabe s priest during his imprisonment mugabe got through experience partly through strength of his spirituality but also because his real strength was study and helping others to learn while mugabe was imprisoned in august 1964 rhodesian front government now under leadership of ian smith banned zanu and zapu and arrested all remaining leaders of country s african nationalist movement smith s government made a unilateral declaration of independence from united kingdom in november 1965

government among revolutionaries it was known as second chimurenga paramilitary groups based themselves in neighbouring tanzania and zambia many of their fighters were inadequately armed and trained zanu s military wing zimbabwe african national liberation army zanla consisted largely of shona it was based in neighbouring mozambique and gained funds from people s republic of china zapu s military wing zimbabwe people s revolutionary army zipra was instead funded by soviet union was based in zambia and consisted largely of ndebele mugabe and other senior zanu members had growing doubts about sithole s leadership deeming him increasingly irritable and irrational in october 1968 sithole had tried to smuggle a message out of prison commanding zanu activists to assassinate smith his plan was discovered and he was put on trial in january 1969 desperate to avoid a death sentence he declared that he renounced violence and his previous ideological commitments mugabe denounced sithole s treachery in rejecting zanu s cause and executive removed him as zanu president in a vote of no confidence selecting mugabe as his successor in november 1974 zanu executive voted to suspend sithole s membership of organisation fearing that guerrilla war would spread south south african government pressured rhodesia to advance process of detente with politically moderate black governments of zambia

was released in november 1974 he moved in with his sister sabina at her home in highfield township he was intent on joining zanu forces and taking part in guerrilla war recognising that to secure dominance of zanu he would have to take command of zanla this was complicated by internal violence within paramilitary group predominately between members of and groups of shona guerrilla war chimurenga 2 1975 1979 thumb flag of zimbabwe african national union zanu in march 1975 mugabe resolved to leave rhodesia for mozambique ambitious to take control of zanu s guerrilla campaign after his friend maurice was arrested he feared same fate but was hidden from authorities by ribeiro ribeiro and a sympathetic nun then assisted him and edgar tekere in smuggling themselves into mozambique mugabe remained in exile there for two years mozambique s marxist president samora machel was sceptical of mugabe s leadership abilities and was unsure whether to recognise him as zanu s legitimate leader machel gave him a house in quelimane and kept him under partial house arrest with mugabe requiring permission to travel it would be almost a year before machel accepted mugabe s leadership of zanu mugabe travelled to various zanla camps in mozambique to build support among its officers by mid 1976 he had secured allegiance of zanla s military commanders and established himself as most prominent guerrilla leader battling smith s regime in august 1977 he was officially declared zanu president at a meeting of party s central committee held in chimoio during war mugabe remained suspicious of many of zanla s commanders and had a number of them imprisoned in 1977 he imprisoned his former second in command wilfred for suspected disloyalty after josiah tongogara was killed in a car accident in 1979 there were suggestions made that mugabe may have had some involvement in it these rumours were never substantiated mugabe remained aloof from day to day military operations of zanla which he entrusted to tongogara in january 1976 zanla launched its first major infiltration from mozambique with nearly 1000 guerrillas crossing border to attack white owned farms and stores in response smith s government enlisted all men under age of 35 expanding rhodesian army by 50 zanla s attacks forced large numbers of white landowners to abandon their farms their now unemployed black workers joined zanla by thousands by 1979 zanla were in a position to attack a number of rhodesian cities over course of war at least 30 000 people were killed as a proportion of their wider population whites had higher number of fatalities and by latter part of decade guerrillas were winning thumb left mugabe in a meeting with romanian communist leader nicolae ceausescu in 1979 mugabe focused on propaganda war making regular speeches and radio broadcasts in these he presented himself as a marxist leninist speaking warmly of marxist leninist revolutionaries like vladimir lenin joseph stalin and fidel castro despite his marxist views mugabe s meetings with soviet representatives were unproductive for they insisted on nkomo s leadership of revolutionary struggle his relationship with people s republic of china was far warmer as chinese marxist government supplied zanla with armaments without any conditions he also sought support from western nations visiting western embassies in mozambique and travelled to both western states like italy and switzerland and marxist governed states like soviet union china north korea vietnam and cuba mugabe called for overthrow of rhodesia s predominately white government execution of smith and his criminal gang expropriation of white owned land and transformation of rhodesia into a one party marxist state he repeatedly called for violence against country s white minority referring to white rhodesians as blood sucking exploiters sadistic killers and hard core racists in one typical example taken from a 1978 radio address mugabe declared let us hammer white man to defeat let us blow up his citadel let us give him no time to rest let us chase him in every corner let us rid our home of this settler vermin for mugabe armed struggle was an essential part of establishment of a new state in contrast to other black nationalist leaders like nkomo mugabe opposed a negotiated settlement with smith s government in october 1976 zanu nevertheless established a joint platform with zapu known as patriotic front in september 1978 mugabe met with nkomo in lusaka he was angry with latter s secret attempts to negotiate with smith lancaster house agreement 1979 under pressure from south african prime minister b j vorster smith accepted in principle that white minority rule could not be prolonged indefinitely he oversaw 1979 general election which resulted in abel muzorewa a politically moderate black bishop being elected prime minister of reconstituted zimbabwe rhodesia both zanu and zapu had boycotted election which did not receive international recognition at commonwealth heads of government meeting 1979 held in lusaka british prime minister margaret thatcher surprised delegates by announcing that uk would officially recognise country s independence if it transitioned to democratic majority rule thumb lancaster house in london s west end negotiations took place at lancaster house in london and were led by conservative party politician peter carington mugabe refused to attend these london peace talks opposing idea of a negotiated rather than military solution to rhodesian war machel insisted that he must threatening to end mozambican support for zanu pf if he did not mugabe arrived in london in september 1979 there he and nkomo presented themselves as part of patriotic front but established separate headquarters in city at conference pair were divided in their attitude nkomo wanted to present himself as a moderate while mugabe played up to his image as a marxist revolutionary with carington exploiting this division throughout negotiations mugabe did not trust british and believed that they were manipulating events to their own advantage lancaster house agreement called for all participants in rhodesian bush war to agree to a ceasefire with a british governor christopher soames arriving in rhodesia to oversee an election in which various factions could compete as political parties it outlined a plan for a transition to formal independence as a sovereign republic under black majority rule also maintaining that rhodesia would be renamed zimbabwe a name adopted from iron age archaeological site of great zimbabwe agreement also ensured that country s white minority retained many of its economic and political privileges with 20 seats to be reserved for whites in new parliament by insisting on need for a democratic black majority government carington was able to convince mugabe to compromise on other main issue of conference that of land ownership mugabe agreed to protection of white community s privately owned property on condition that uk and u s governments provide financial assistance allowing zimbabwean government to purchase much land for redistribution among blacks mugabe was opposed to idea of a ceasefire but under pressure from machel he agreed to it mugabe signed agreement but felt cheated remaining disappointed that he had never achieved a military victory over rhodesian forces electoral campaign 1980 returning to salisbury in january 1980 mugabe was greeted by a supportive crowd he settled into a house in mount pleasant a wealthy white dominated suburb machel had cautioned mugabe not to alienate rhodesia s white minority warning him that any white flight after election would cause economic damage as it had in mozambique accordingly during his electoral campaign mugabe avoided use of marxist and revolutionary rhetoric mugabe insisted that in election zanu would stand as a separate party to zapu and refused nkomo s request for a meeting he formed zanu into a political party known as zimbabwe african national union patriotic front zanu pf predictions were made that zanu pf would win election on basis of country s ethnic divisions mugabe was shona a community that made up around 70 of country s population while nkomo was ndebele a tribal group who made up only around 20 for many in white community and in british government this outcome was a terrifying prospect due to mugabe s avowed marxist beliefs and inflammatory comments that he had made about whites during guerrilla war thumb left mugabe on a visit to netherlands in 1979 during campaign mugabe survived two assassination attempts in first which took place on 6 february a grenade was thrown at his mount pleasant home where it exploded against a garden wall in second on 10 february a roadside bomb exploded near his motorcade as he left a fort victoria rally mugabe himself was unharmed mugabe accused rhodesian security forces of being responsible for these attacks in an attempt to quell possibility that rhodesia s security forces would launch a coup to prevent election mugabe met with peter walls commander of rhodesia s armed forces and asked him to remain in his position in event of a zanu pf victory at time walls refused electoral campaign was marred by widespread voter intimidation perpetrated by nkomo s zapu abel muzorewa s united african national council uanc and mugabe s zanu pf commenting on zanu pf s activities in eastern rhodesia nkomo complained that word intimidation is mild people are being terrorised it is terror reacting to zanu pf s acts of voter intimidation mugabe was called before soames at government house mugabe regarded meeting as a british attempt to thwart his electoral campaign under terms of negotiation soames had power to disqualify any political party guilty of voter intimidation rhodesia s security services nkomo muzorewa and some of his own advisers all called on soames to disqualify zanu pf after deliberation soames disagreed believing that zanu pf were sure to win election and that disqualifying them would wreck any chance of an orderly transition of power in february election zanu pf secured 63 of national vote gaining 57 of 80 parliamentary seats allocated for black parties and providing them with an absolute majority zapu had gained 20 seats and uanc had three mugabe was elected mp for salisbury constituency of highfield attempting to calm panic and prevent white flight mugabe appeared on television and called for national unity stability

announcing that rhodesia would be renamed zimbabwe and pledged racial reconciliation soames aided mugabe in bringing about an orderly transition of power for this mugabe remained grateful describing soames as a good friend mugabe unsuccessfully urged soames to remain in zimbabwe for several more years and also failed to convince uk to assume a two year guiding role for his government because most zanu pf members lacked experience in governing zanu pf s absolute parliamentary majority allowed them to rule alone but mugabe created a government of national unity by inviting members of rival parties to join his cabinet mugabe moved into premier s residence in salisbury which he left furnished in same style as smith had left it across country statues of cecil rhodes were removed and squares and roads named after prominent colonial figures were renamed after black nationalists in 1982 salisbury was renamed harare mugabe employed north korean architects to design heroes acre a monument and complex in western harare to commemorate struggle against minority rule zimbabwe also received much aid from western countries whose governments hoped that a stable and prosperous zimbabwe would aid transition of south africa away from apartheid and minority rule united states provided zimbabwe with a 25 million three year aid package uk financed a land reform program and provided military advisers to aid integration of guerrilla armies and old rhodesian security forces into a new zimbabwean military members of both zanla and zipra were integrated into army though there remained a strong rivalry between two groups as prime minister mugabe retained walls as head of armed forces mugabe s government continued to make regular pronouncements about converting zimbabwe into a socialist society but did not take concrete steps in that direction in contrast to mugabe s talk of socialism his government s budgetary policies were conservative operating within a capitalist framework and emphasising need for foreign investment in office mugabe sought a gradual transformation away from capitalism and tried to build upon existing state institutions from 1980 to 1990 country s economy grew by an average of 2 7 a year but this was outstripped by population growth and real income declined unemployment rate rose reaching 26 in 1990 government ran a budget deficit year on year that averaged at 10 of country s gross domestic product under mugabe s leadership there was a massive expansion in education and health spending in 1980 zimbabwe had just 177 secondary schools by 2000 this number had risen to 1 548 during that period adult literacy rate rose from 62 to 82 one of best records in africa levels of child immunisation were raised from 25 of population to 92 a new leadership elite were formed who often expressed their newfound status through purchasing large houses and expensive cars sending their children to private schools and obtaining farms and businesses to contain their excesses in 1984 mugabe drew up a leadership code which prohibited any senior figures from obtaining more than one salary or owning over 50 acres of agricultural land there were exceptions with mugabe giving permission to general solomon mujuru to expand his business empire resulting in him becoming one of zimbabwe s wealthiest people growing corruption among socio economic elite generated resentment among wider population much of which was living in poverty thumb left prime minister mugabe departs andrews air force base after a state visit to united states in 1983 zanu pf also sought to establish its own business empire founding m s syndicate in 1980 and holdings in 1981 by 1992 party had fixed assets and businesses worth an estimated z 500 million us 75 million in 1980 zanu pf used nigerian funds to set up mass media trust through which they bought out a south african company that owned most of zimbabwe s newspapers white editors of these newspapers were sacked and replaced by government appointees these media outlets subsequently became a source of party s propaganda at independence 39 of zimbabwe s land was under ownership of around 6000 white large scale commercial farmers while 4 was owned by black small scale commercial farmers and 41 was communal land where 4 million people lived often in overcrowded conditions lancaster house agreement ensured that until 1990 sale of land could only take place on a willing seller willing buyer basis only permitted exceptions were if land was underutilised or needed for a public purpose in which case government could compulsorily purchase it while fully compensating owner this meant that mugabe s government was largely restricted to purchasing land which was of poor quality its target was to resettle 18 000 black families on 2 5 million acres of white owned land over three years this would cost ps30 million us 60 million half of which was to be provided by uk government as per lancaster house agreement in 1986 mugabe became chair of non aligned movement nam a position that he retained until 1989 as leader of one of front line states countries bordering apartheid south africa he gained credibility within anti apartheid movement race relations mugabe initially emphasised racial reconciliation and he was keen to build a good relationship with white zimbabweans he hoped to avoid a white exodus and tried to allay fears that he would nationalise white owned property he appointed two white ministers david smith and denis norman to his government met with white leaders in agriculture industry mining and commerce and impressed senior figures in outgoing administration like smith and ken flower with his apparent sincerity with end of war petrol rationing and economic sanctions life for white zimbabweans improved during early years of mugabe s rule in economic boom that followed white minority which controlled considerable property and dominated commerce industry and banking were country s main beneficiaries nevertheless many white zimbabweans complained that they were victims of racial discrimination many whites remained uneasy about living under government of a black marxist and they also feared that their children would be unable to secure jobs there was a growing exodus to south africa and in 1980 17 000 whites approximately a tenth of white zimbabwean population emigrated mugabe s government had pledged support for african national congress and other anti apartheid forces within south africa but did not allow them to use zimbabwe as a base for their military operations to protest apartheid and white minority rule in south africa mugabe s government banned zimbabwe from engaging south africa in any sporting competitions in turn south africa tried to destabilise zimbabwe by blocking trade routes into country and supporting anti militants among country s white minority thumb left mugabe in netherlands 1982 in december 1981 a bomb struck zanu pf headquarters killing seven and injuring 124 mugabe blamed south african backed white militants he criticised reactionary and counter revolutionary elements in white community stating that despite fact that they had faced no punishment for their past actions they rejected racial reconciliation and are acting in collusion with south africa to harm our racial relations to destroy our unity to sabotage our economy and to overthrow popularly elected government i lead increasingly he criticised not only militants but entire white community for holding a monopoly on zimbabwe s economic power this was a view echoed by many government ministers and government controlled media one of these ministers tekere was involved in an incident in which he and seven armed men stormed a white owned farmhouse killing an elderly farmer they alleged that in doing so they were foiling a coup attempt tekere was acquitted of murder however mugabe dropped him from his cabinet racial mistrust and suspicion continued to grow in december 1981 elderly white mp wally was accused of being a south african agent arrested and tortured generating anger among whites in july 1982 south african backed white militants destroyed 13 aircraft at thornhill a number of white military officers were accused of complicity arrested and tortured they were put on trial but cleared by judges after which they were immediately re arrested their case generated an international outcry which mugabe criticised stating that case only gained such attention because accused were white his defence of torture and contempt for legal procedures damaged his international standing white flight continued to grow and within three years of mugabe s premiership half of all white zimbabweans had emigrated in 1985 election smith s conservative alliance of zimbabwe won 15 of 20 seats allocated for white zimbabweans mugabe was outraged by this result lambasting white zimbabweans for not repenting in any way by continuing to support smith and other white politicians who had committed horrors against people of zimbabwe relations with nkomo zapu and operation gukurahundi 1982 1987 thumb flag of zapu which was largely eliminated by zanu pf in gukurahundi under new constitution zimbabwe s presidency was a ceremonial role with no governmental power first

had happened stating that it was an act of madness it was wrong and both sides were to blame his biographer martin meredith argued that mugabe and his zanu pf were solely to blame for massacres

for white representatives and left parliament less relevant and independent in build up to 1990 election parliamentary reforms increased number of seats to 120 of these twenty were to be appointed by

government to expropriate land at a fixed price while denying land owners right of appeal to courts government hoped that by doing so it could settle 110 000 black families on 13 million acres which would require expropriation of approximately half of all white owned land zimbabwe s commercial farmers union argued that proposed measures would wreck country s economy urging government to instead settle landless blacks on half a million acres of land that was either unproductive or state owned concerns about proposed measure particularly its denial of right to appeal were voiced by uk u s and catholic commission for justice and peace u s uk international monetary fund and world bank threatened that if zimbabwe implemented law it would forfeit foreign aid packages responding to criticisms government removed ban on court appeals from bill which was then passed as law over following few years hundreds of thousands of acres of largely white owned land were expropriated in april 1994 a newspaper investigation found that not all of this was redistributed to landless blacks much of expropriated land was being leased to ministers and senior officials such as witness who was leased a

enemy and accused his black opponents of being dupes of whites amid growing internal opposition to his government he remained determined to stay in power he revived regular use of revolutionary rhetoric and sought to reassert his credentials as an important revolutionary leader mugabe also developed a growing preoccupation with homosexuality lambasting it as an un african import from europe he described gay people as being guilty of sub human behaviour and of being worse than dogs and pigs this attitude may have stemmed in part from his strong conservative values but it was strengthened by fact that several ministers in british government were gay mugabe began to believe that there was a gay mafia and that all of his critics were homosexuals critics also accused mugabe of using homophobia to distract attention from country s problems in august 1995 he was due to open a human rights themed zimbabwe international book fair in harare but refused to do so until a stall run by

rule his labour government expressed reticence toward restarting land resettlement payments promised by lancaster house agreement with minister clare short rejecting idea that uk had any moral obligation to fund land redistribution this attitude fuelled anti imperialist sentiment across africa in october 1999 mugabe visited britain and in london human rights activist peter tatchell attempted to place him under citizen s arrest mugabe believed that british government had deliberately engineered incident to embarrass him it further damaged anglo zimbabwean relations with mugabe expressing scorn for what he called blair and company in may 2000 uk froze all development aid to zimbabwe in december 1999 imf terminated financial support for zimbabwe citing economic mismanagement and widespread corruption as impediments to reform to meet growing demand for constitutional reform in april 1999 mugabe s government appointed a 400 member constitutional commission to draft a new

attackers as war veterans but majority were unemployed youth too young to have fought in rhodesian war mugabe claimed that attacks were a spontaneous uprising against white land owners although government had paid z 20 million to s war veterans association to lead land invasion campaign and zanu pf officials police and military figures were all involved in facilitating it some of mugabe s colleagues described invasions as retribution for white community s alleged involvement in securing success of no vote in recent referendum mugabe justified seizures by fact that this land had been seized by white settlers from indigenous african population in 1890s he portrayed invasions as a struggle against colonialism and alleged that uk was trying to overthrow his government in may 2000 he issued a decree under presidential powers temporary measures act which empowered government to seize farms without providing compensation insisting that it was british government that should make these payments in march 2000 zimbabwe s high court ruled that land invasions were illegal they nevertheless continued and mugabe began vilifying zimbabwe s judiciary after supreme court also backed this decision government called on its judges to resign successfully pressuring chief justice anthony to do so zanu pf member godfrey was appointed to replace him while number of supreme court judges

heroes burial took place on 28 september in a courtyard of his family home ideology mugabe embraced african nationalism and anti colonialism during 1960s j ndlovu gatsheni characterised mugabeism as a populist movement that was marked by ideological simplicity emptiness vagueness imprecision and multi class character further noting that it was a broad church he also characterised it as a form of left nationalism which consistently railed against imperialism and colonialism he also argued that it was a form of nativism which was permeated by a strong cult of victimisation in which a binary view was propagated where africa was a victim and west was its tormentor he suggested that it had been influenced by a wide range of ideologies among them forms of marxism like stalinism and maoism as well as african nationalist ideologies like ujamaa pan africanism and african neo traditionalism mugabeism sought to deal with problem of white settler racism by engaging in a project of anti white racism that sought to deny white zimbabweans citizenship by constantly referring to them as boers thus enabling their removal from their land zanu pf claimed that it was influenced by marxism leninism onslow and redding stated that in contrast to marxist emphasis on urban proletariat as main force of socio economic change mugabe s party accorded that role to rural peasantry as a result of this pro rural view they argued mugabe and zanu pf demonstrated an anti urban bias english academic claire met mugabe in 1962 later noting that he struck me as not so much a doctrinaire marxist but an old fashioned african nationalist while tekere claimed that for mugabe marxism leninism was just rhetoric with no genuine vision or belief behind it carington noted that while mugabe used marxist rhetoric during lancaster house negotiations of course he didn t actually practise what he preached did he once in office he became a capitalist mugabe has stated that socialism has to be much more christian than capitalism zimbabwean scholar george shire described mugabe s policies as being broadly speaking social democratic during 1980s mugabe indicated his desire to transform zimbabwe from a multi party state into a one party state in 1984 he stated that one party state is more in keeping with african tradition it makes for greater unity for people it puts all opinions under one umbrella whether these opinions are radical or reactionary political scientist sue onslow and historian sean redding stated that zimbabwe s situation was more complex than pure dictatorship but that it was an dictatorship ndlovu gatsheni argued that since mid 1990s mugabe s rhetoric and speeches came to be dominated by three main themes an obsession with a perceived british threat to re colonise zimbabwe to transfer land controlled by white farmers to black population and issues of belonging and patriotism references to rhodesian bush war featured prominently in his speeches scholar of african studies abiodun alao noted that mugabe was determined to take advantage of past in order to secure a firm grip on national security david blair stated that mugabe s collected writings amount to nothing more than crude marxism couched in ponderous english of mission school remarking that they were heavily informed by karl marx mao zedong and frantz fanon and displayed little originality blair noted that mugabe s writings called for command economics in a peasant society mixed with anti colonial nationalism and that in this he held same opinions as almost every other african guerrilla leader of that period mugabe argued that following overthrow of european colonial regimes western countries continued to keep african countries in a state of subservience because they desired continent s natural resources while preventing it from industrialising personal life thumb mugabe meeting russian president vladimir putin in 2015 mugabe measured a little over and exhibited what his biographer david blair described as curious effeminate mannerisms mugabe took great care with his appearance typically wearing a three piece suit and insisted that members of his cabinet dressed in a similar anglophile fashion on taking power in 1980 mugabe s hallmark was his wide rimmed glasses and he was also known for his tiny moustache unlike a number of other african leaders mugabe did not seek to mythologise his childhood he avoided smoking and drinking and according to his first biographers david smith and colin simpson had enormous affection for children during his early life he had an operation on his genitals which generated rumours that he had only one testicle or half a penis such rumours were used by opponents to ridicule him and by supporters to bolster claim that he was willing to make severe sacrifices for revolutionary cause mugabe spoke english fluently with an adopted english accent when pronouncing certain words he was also a fan of english game of cricket stating that cricket people and creates good gentlemen david blair noted that this cultivation of british traits suggested that mugabe respected and perhaps admired britain while at same time resenting and loathing country holland suggested that these anglophile traits arose in early life as mugabe who had long experienced anti black racism of rhodesian society grasped englishness as an antidote to self loathing induced by societal racism academic blessing miles tendi stated that mugabe was an extremely complex figure not easily captured by conventional categories similarly david blair described him as an exceptionally complex personality smith and simpson noted that zimbabwean leader had been a serious young man something of a loner diligent hard working a voracious reader who used every minute of his time not much given to laughter but above all single minded blair commented that mugabe s self discipline intelligence and appetite for hard work were remarkable adding that his prime characteristics were ruthlessness and resilience blair argued that mugabe shared many character traits with ian smith stating that they were both proud brave stubborn charismatic deluded meredith described mugabe as having a soft spoken demeanour broad intellect and articulate manner all of which disguised his hardened and single minded ambition ndlovu gatsheni characterised him as one of most charismatic african leaders highlighting that he was very eloquent and was able to make fine speeches jonathan moyo who briefly served as mugabe s information minister before falling out with him stated that president could express himself well that is his great strength tendi stated that mugabe had a natural but often hid this behind an outwardly pensive and austere manner and his penchant for ceremony and tradition heidi holland suggested that due to his dysfunctional upbringing mugabe had a fragile self image describing him as a man cut off from his feelings devoid of ordinary warmth and humanity according to her mugabe had a marked emotional immaturity and was homophobic as well as racist and xenophobic according to meredith mugabe presented himself as articulate thoughtful and conciliatory after his 1980 election victory blair noted that at this period of his career mugabe displayed genuine magnanimity and moral courage despite his intense personal

saw quite clearly sometimes colin legum a journalist with observer argued that mugabe had a personality in that while he did not suffer from clinical paranoia he did behave in a paranoid fashion when placed under severe and sustained pressure mugabe biographer andrew norman suggested that leader may have suffered from antisocial personality disorder several mugabe biographers have observed that he had an obsession with accruing power according to meredith power for mugabe was not a means to an end but end itself conversely onslow and redding suggested that mugabe s craving for power stemmed from ideological and personal reasons and his belief in illegitimacy of his political opposition denis norman a white politician who served in mugabe s cabinet for many years commented that mugabe isn t a flashy man driven by wealth but he does enjoy power that s always been his motivation marriages and children thumb mugabe s first wife first lady sally hayfron in 1983 according to holland mugabe s first wife sally hayfron was mugabe s confidante and only real friend being one of few people who could challenge mugabe s ideas without offending him their only son michael nhamodzenyika mugabe born 27 september 1963 died on 26 december 1966 from cerebral malaria in ghana where sally was working while mugabe was in prison sally mugabe was a trained teacher who asserted her position as an

with his secretary grace marufu she was 41 years his junior and at time was married to stanley in 1988 she bore mugabe a daughter bona and in 1990 a son robert relationship was kept secret from zimbabwean public hayfron was aware of it according to her niece patricia with whom she was particularly close hayfron was not happy that mugabe had an affair with marufu but she did what she used to tell me to do talk to your pillow if you have problems in your marriage never ever humiliate your husband her motto was to carry on in gracious style hayfron died in 1992 from a chronic kidney ailment following hayfron s death in 1992 mugabe and marufu were married in a large catholic ceremony in august 1996 as first lady of zimbabwe grace gained a reputation for indulging her love of luxury with a

birth to couple s third child chatunga bellarmine robert mugabe jr and his younger brother chatunga bellarmine are known for posting their lavish lifestyle on social media which has drawn accusations from tendai biti that they are wasting zimbabwean taxpayers money public image and legacy by twenty first century mugabe was regarded as one of world s most controversial political leaders according to black scholar journal depending on who you listen to mugabe is either one of world s great tyrants or a fearless nationalist who has incurred wrath of west he has been widely described as a dictator a tyrant and a threat and has been referred to as one of africa s most brutal leaders at same time he continued to be regarded as a hero in many third world countries and received a warm reception when travelling throughout africa for many in southern africa he remained one of grand old men of african liberation movement according to ndlovu gatsheni within zanu pf mugabe was regarded as a demi god who was feared and rarely challenged within zanu movement a cult of personality began to be developed around mugabe during bush war and was consolidated after 1980 mugabe had a considerable following within zimbabwe with david blair noting that it would be wrong to imply that he lacked genuine popularity in country holland believed that great majority of zimbabwe s population supported him enthusiastically during first twenty years of his regime his strongholds of support were zimbabwe s shona dominated regions of mashonaland and while he remained far less popular in non shona areas of matabeleland and bulawayo and among zimbabwean diaspora living abroad at time of his 1980 election victory mugabe was internationally acclaimed as a revolutionary hero who was embracing racial reconciliation and for first decade of his governance he was widely regarded as one of post colonial africa s most progressive leaders david blair argued that while mugabe did exhibit a conciliatory phase between march 1980 and february 1982 his rule was otherwise dominated by a ruthless quest to crush his opponents and remain in office at whatever cost in 2011 scholar blessing miles tendi stated that mugabe is often presented in international media as epitome of popular leader gone awry independence struggle hero who seemed initially a egalitarian but has gradually been corrupted through his attachment to power during a long and increasingly repressive spell in office tendi argued that this was a misleading assessment because mugabe had displayed repressive tendencies from his early years in office namely through repression of zapu in matabeleland abiodun alao concurred suggesting that mugabe s approach had not changed over course of his leadership but merely that international attention had intensified in twenty first century for many africans mugabe exposed double standards of western countries latter had turned a blind eye to massacre of over 20 000 black ndebele civilians in but strongly censured zimbabwean government when a small number of white farmers were killed during land seizures thumb left example of foreign criticism a demonstration
