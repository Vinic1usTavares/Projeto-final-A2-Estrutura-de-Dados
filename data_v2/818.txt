episode of office is a success this is one of my favorite episodes i can remember in a long time not too plot driven and chock full of solid comedic writing plus a handful endearing moments that just made me feel good to get a few of my favorite lines just keep reading myles mcnutt from a v club gave episode a b rating and although commenting on lack of stakes for characters remarked that jury duty had a certain confidence to it it may not have satisfyingly explored jim s character but it ended with a clear statement of his role as a father reintroducing jenna fischer into cast and putting a button on that particular story development however several critics gave episode a mixed review dan forcella from tvfanatic gave episode a 3 5 out of 5 stars and wrote there were definitely some ups and some downs in jury duty however he did praise action of several characters most notably kevin and dwight joseph kratzer from whatculture gave episode 3 out of 5 stars and wrote i truly appreciate talented writing of aaron shure who crafted a genuinely well structured episode i guess i just didn t feel like jim s story held any actual stakes and dwight s just felt random references external
