alexisonfire who replaced original gallows singer frank carter when latter left band in july 2011 ep was recorded in los angeles and produced by joby j ford of bronx it includes a re recording of track true colours previously released as a free download in august 2011 background frank carter original vocalist of gallows announced in early july 2011 that he would be leaving gallows because of differing opinions in writing band s follow up album to their second release grey britain his departure was effective on 1 august after band s final tour dates just eight days after frank s departure on 9 august 2011 macneil was confirmed as new gallows vocalist macneil has stated that members of gallows asked him initially out of coincidence that alexisonfire had disbanded and gallows needed a new singer with frank s departure fans of band started to believe that he left because he wanted to continue playing heavy music while band wanted to go in a more melodic direction band decided to release something to show this as false from moment wade s arrived in britain in july gallows started writing new material to follow up to their 2009 album grey britain ep itself was both written and recorded in a short period of time a majority of music featured on extended play was written by band before wade had joined and that they put finishing touches on record with him lee barratt summarises ep as a good release of anger and that all band felt particularly venomous when wade joined just a few months later in november band made announcement that new extended play would be released in early december after band s infamous split from warner bros band decided to work on an independent record label for release thirty days of night whom they considered as gallows family themes ep has been seen by critics simply as unapologetic hardcore punk and being most aggressive work gallows had done so far a more americanised influence can be heard throughout ep as it s been likened to bands like cancer bats and every time i die macneil had always stated ep helped build on what he has always liked about gallows he considers it being four songs like a kick in teeth in writing of new extended play band focused on less typical song structures and focused on chaotic sound from live shows macneil believed that sometimes you don t need to things obviously we re trying to write music that s chaotic and is going to be something that comes across vicious sounding live you don t repeat it four times you do it once and you don t have a bridge gallows guitarist laurent barnard said how ep would not sound similar to band s third studio album by saying if you re going to make a punk rock ep you might as well make it most punk rock thing you can really music critics have described true colours upon its release as a single as most brutal thing gallows has done andrew ford of hit floor magazine considered it a 36 second middle finger to all those who have suggested this is end of road for watford lads something which both critics and wade macneil himself have acknowledged is his distinct tone of voice from frank carter even to point in which their fan base could be divided over decision to have wade in band wade wanted ep and future lyrics of gallows records to have a much more global view believing that band s second studio album grey britain had too much of a british perspective release and promotion thumb left upright alt wade macneil formerly of alexisonfire replaced frank carter as gallows lead singer in 2011 band released first song from ep true colours for free download on 29 august 2011 from their band website they then released mondo chaos as a digital single on 25 november just a few days before that on 17 november song was leaked gallows completed their first tour after release of true colours with macneil as front man in united states and canada in november alongside four year strong title fight and and sharks band incorporated songs from first two albums live set lists macneil said that he aimed to alter songs in a way that breathes some life into them but also wanted to keep what people love about those songs and what i love about those songs 6131 records released ep in north america on vinyl record reception death is birth received positive reception from music critics british publication kerrang gave album a excellent four out of five k s describing ep as snarling rebirth of uks best punk band vincent danger when writing for thrash hits gave album a 5 out of 6 stars giving album a positive review praising their choice of front man to replace carter there s only so much one can say about 459 seconds of music there s enough here to prove that lags barnard s songwriting skills aren t on wane and that wade macneil is a more than able replacement for carter alternative press writer jason pettigrew appreciated album s short but violent writing in his 4 out of 5 star review saying ep is steeped in impenetrable relentless nihilism and thrashing madness that s one part noise weapon true colours one part circle pit centrifuge hate hate hate and two parts hateful hardcore mondo chaos and title track dan a writer for alter press gave album a score of 4 5 in an otherwise positive review did see fault in change of front man some fans will undoubtedly find it hard to get past fact that he isn t frank carter but a little scratch at surface will reveal same aggression and similar bile filled lyrics you d expect from one of britain s most hateful bands track listing personnel wade macneil lead
