thumbnail university of birmingham poynting physics building blue plaque to physicists frisch and peierls frisch peierls memorandum was first technical exposition of a practical nuclear weapon it was written by expatriate german physicists otto frisch and rudolf peierls in march 1940 while they were both working for mark oliphant at university of birmingham in britain during world war ii memorandum contained first calculations about size of critical mass of fissile material needed for an atomic bomb it revealed for first time that amount required might be small enough to incorporate into a bomb that could be delivered by air it also anticipated strategic and moral implications of nuclear weapons it helped send both britain and america down a path which led to maud committee tube alloys project manhattan project and ultimately atomic bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki background thumb right william penney otto frisch rudolf peierls and john cockcroft wearing medals of freedom awarded in 1946 for their services to manhattan project rudolf peierls rudolf peierls was born in berlin in 1907 he studied physics at university of berlin at university of munich under arnold sommerfeld university of leipzig under werner heisenberg and eth zurich under wolfgang pauli after receiving his dphil from leipzig in 1929 he became an assistant to pauli in zurich in 1932 he was awarded a rockefeller fellowship which he used to study in rome under enrico fermi and then at cavendish laboratory at university of cambridge under ralph h fowler due to adolf hitler s rise to power in germany he elected to not return home in 1933 but to remain in britain he worked with hans bethe at university of manchester then at mond laboratory at cambridge in 1937 mark oliphant australian newly appointed professor of physics at university of birmingham recruited him for a new chair there in applied mathematics otto frisch otto robert frisch was born in vienna in 1904 he studied physics at university of vienna from which he received his dphil in 1926 he worked at technische in berlin until 1930 when he obtained a position at university of hamburg under nobel prize winning scientist otto stern as non aryans stern and frisch were dismissed after hitler s accession stern found frisch a position in britain with patrick blackett at college at university of london and a grant from academic assistance council he followed this with a five year stint at niels bohr institute in copenhagen with niels bohr where he increasingly specialised in nuclear physics particularly physics of neutrons which had been discovered by james chadwick in 1932 oliphant invited frisch to come to university of birmingham in summer of 1939 when outbreak of second world war in september 1939 prevented his return to copenhagen oliphant found him a position at university of birmingham nuclear fission during christmas holiday in 1938 frisch visited his aunt lise meitner in in sweden where she had been forced to relocate after germany s annexation of austria made her a german citizen while there she received news that her former colleagues otto hahn and fritz strassmann in berlin had discovered that collision of a neutron with a uranium nucleus produced barium as one of its byproducts frisch and meitner hypothesized that uranium nucleus had split in two they estimated energy released at around 200 mev and frisch appropriated term fission from biology to describe it hahn s paper described experiment and finding of barium byproduct meitner s and frisch s paper explained physics behind phenomenon paper is dated 16 january 1939 frisch went back to copenhagen where he was able to isolate fragments produced by fission reactions frisch later recalled that news of discovery of fission was brought to america by bohr in january 1939 bohr and john a wheeler set to work applying liquid drop model developed by bohr and fritz kalckar to explain mechanism of nuclear fission george placzek who was skeptical about whole idea of fission challenged bohr to explain why uranium seemed to fission with both very fast and very slow neutrons bohr had an epiphany that fission at low energies was due to uranium 235 isotope while at high energies it was mainly due to more abundant uranium 238 isotope former makes up just 0 7 of natural uranium while that latter accounts for 99 3 on 16 april bohr placzek wheeler eugene wigner and leon rosenfeld discussed whether it would be possible to use a nuclear chain reaction to make an atomic bomb and concluded that it was not bohr observed that it would take entire efforts of a country to make a bomb british response in britain scientists also considered whether an atomic bomb was practical at university of liverpool chadwick and polish refugee scientist joseph rotblat tackled problem but their calculations were inconclusive at cambridge nobel prize in physics laureates george paget thomson and william lawrence bragg wanted government to take urgent action to acquire uranium ore to keep it out of german hands secretary of committee for imperial defence major general hastings ismay asked sir henry tizard for an opinion tizard was sceptical of likelihood of an atomic bomb being developed reckoning odds of success at 100 000 to 1 even at such long odds danger was sufficiently great to be taken seriously it was not considered worthwhile to immediately acquire uranium but tizard s committee on scientific survey of air defence was directed to conduct research into feasibility of atomic bombs thomson at imperial college london and oliphant at university of birmingham were tasked with carrying out a series of experiments on uranium by february 1940 thomson s team had failed to create a chain reaction in natural uranium and he had decided that it was not worth pursuing memorandum thumb right poynting physics building at university of birmingham where peierls and frisch wrote memorandum as enemy aliens at least until peierls naturalisation papers came through in february 1940 frisch and peierls were excluded from most important and secret war work being done by oliphant s team at birmingham that on radar however oliphant would ask peierls a theoretical question about say solution to maxwell s equations in a hemispheric cavity peierls knew that questions of this nature related to work on microwave radar and oliphant was doubtless aware of this too but facade of secrecy was maintained nuclear investigation was not yet secret so frisch was available to work on it he began experimenting with uranium enrichment through thermal diffusion a process first demonstrated in germany by klaus clusius progress was slow required equipment was not available and radar project had first call on available resources francis perrin had defined a critical mass of uranium to be smallest amount that could sustain a chain reaction and had calculated critical mass of uranium oxide not metal to be about he reckoned that if a neutron reflector were placed around it of materials such as iron or lead which did not greatly impede fast neutrons this might be reduced to peierls also attempted to simplify problem by using fast neutrons produced by fission thus omitting consideration of moderator he then calculated critical mass of a sphere of uranium metal in a theoretical paper written in 1939 he later recalled that size of critical mass was of order of tons it therefore appeared to me that paper had no relevance to a nuclear weapon however bohr had argued that uranium 235 isotope was far more likely to capture neutrons so fissile even using neutrons of low energy frisch wondered what would happen if he were able to produce a sphere of pure uranium 235 when he used peierls formula to calculate this he received a startling answer peierls later observed that realising sensitive nature of document peierls typed it himself one carbon copy was made today original is in bodleian library at oxford university non technical memorandum was written in two parts first was an elegant and comprehensive outline of implications of their calculations it included a proposal that best defence against such a weapon would be to develop one before germany did so in a few short pages these two scientists anticipated policies of deterrence which would shape cold war geopolitics second was an explanation of science supporting their conclusions memorandum opens with calculations peierls starting point was a paper by francis perrin in which he had derived critical mass calculations in terms of nuclear constants physicists considered a sphere which has minimum surface area for a given volume a critical mass occurs when number of neutrons produced equals number that escape perrin assumed that mean free path was much larger than radius of sphere peierls did not agree and commenced his own calculations a key insight came from frisch who wondered what would happen if instead of natural uranium someone gave you a sphere of uranium 235 isotope by definition mean free path is where is mean free path is number of target particles per unit volume and is effective fission cross section area peierls did not perform calculation leaving this task to frisch chemistry of uranium was not well known at time and frisch believed that its density was true value is more like fission cross section value was more problematic for this frisch turned to a 1939 nature article by l a goldstein a rogozinski and r j at radium institute in paris who gave a value of this was too large by an order of magnitude a modern value is about using values he had frisch calculated value of mean free path for uranium 235 using avogadro s constant peierls and frisch claimed that critical radius was about 0 8 times mean free path from this frisch could calculate volume of sphere from well known equation mass then comes out to be frisch and peierls then considered speed of a uranium fission chain reaction exponential in nature where t is time required for neutron density to multiply by a factor e available data was very approximate but their central point that a bomb was possible using fast neutrons remains jeremy bernstein remarked of this effort let me make same point by asking a somewhat different question but using correct numbers how much time does it take to fission a kilogram of 235u using fast neutrons using modern values he found that to be equal to about a microsecond which makes point about rapidity of fission with fact sic neutrons in original memorandum if neutrons had velocities of 109 cm s then they would have an average time between fission collisions of therefore bernstein s time for a kilogram of uranium 235 to fission is found by solving where was mean time for fission neutron density to increase by e given doubling time this implied a mean fission exponential folding time of this led to a calculation of energy released which peierls reckoned as approximately where m is mass of sphere r is radius and is critical mass radius conclusion drawn was that a few kilograms would explode with energy of thousands of tons of dynamite influence memorandum was given to oliphant who passed it on to tizard in his capacity as chairman of committee for scientific survey of air warfare cssaw he in turn passed it to thomson chairman of committee to which cssaw had delegated responsibility for uranium research thomson s committee was about to disband it had studied nuclear reactions in uranium and use of graphite as a neutron moderator in a nuclear reactor but its results had been negative and it had concluded that rate of capture of neutrons by graphite was too great to make such a reactor a practical proposition frisch peierls memorandum caused thomson to reconsider after discussions between cockcroft oliphant and thomson cssaw created maud committee to investigate further as enemy aliens peierls and frisch were initially excluded from its deliberations but they were later added to its technical subcommittee research from maud committee was compiled in two reports commonly known as maud reports in july 1941 first report use of uranium for a bomb discussed feasibility of creating a super bomb from uranium which they now thought to be true second use of uranium as a source of power discussed idea of using uranium as a source of power not just a bomb maud committee and report helped bring about british nuclear program tube alloys project not only did it help start a nuclear project in britain but it helped jump start american project without help of maud committee american program manhattan project would have started months behind instead they were able to begin thinking about how to create a bomb not whether it was possible historian margaret gowing noted that events that change a time scale by only a few months can nevertheless change history in august 1941 oliphant was sent to us to assist americans with microwave radar he took initiative to enlighten scientific community there of ground breaking discoveries of maud committee he travelled to berkeley to meet with his friend ernest lawrence who soon caught his enthusiasm oliphant convinced americans to move forward with nuclear weapons and his lobbying resulted in vannevar bush taking report directly to president leo szilard later wrote if congress knew true history of atomic energy project i have no doubt but that it would create a special medal to be given to meddling foreigners for distinguished services and that dr oliphant would be first to receive one notes references external links memorandum on properties of a radioactive super bomb on construction of a super bomb based on a nuclear chain reaction in
