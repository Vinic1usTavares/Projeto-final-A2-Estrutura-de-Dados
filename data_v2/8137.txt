thumb descent of peace 1803 1817 most likely c 1815 william blake drew and painted illustrations for john milton s nativity ode on morning of christ s nativity between 1803 and 1815 a total of 16 illustrations are extant two sets of six watercolours each and an additional four drawings in pencil dating of sets is unknown as is blake s intended sequence for illustrations two sets of watercolours are known as butts set and thomas set after their respective patrons or as huntington set and whitworth set after huntington library and whitworth art gallery which now hold sets in their collections provenance there is little record of provenance of thomas set or butts set before 1852 and 1872 which has led to disputes about dating what is known is that thomas set was commissioned by reverend joseph thomas butlin 389 who had also commissioned illustrations to milton s comus and paradise lost from blake no contract for commission is extant but commissioning probably took place in 1809 which is year in which illustrations were completed blake was eager to accept commission according to g e bentley because milton illustrations were a kind of work which blake could not resist bentley 2003 p 357 they presumably stayed in revd thomas s family until they were bought at sotheby s from an anonymous seller in 1872 by 1876 they were in collection of j e taylor who gave them to whitworth in 1892 even less is known about dates of composition for butts set between 1811 and 1820 blake created at least thirty three designs for thomas butts which included illustrations of on morning of christ s nativity bentley 2003 p 288 later they passed from butts to his son who sold them at sotheby s in 1852 passed through several more hands were sold at christie s in 1912 and in 1916 were sold to henry huntington butlin 393 thumb overthrow of apollo and pagan gods watercolour 25 x 19 3 cm 1809 figure of apollo in this illustration is a combination of apollo belvedere and laocoon dating and sequence illustrations themselves do not make dating any easier edges of thomas set were trimmed before sale at sotheby s leaving 18 or 180 on most of sheets butlin 390 only night of peace bears full date of 1809 butts set is entirely undated dates from 1803 to 1817 have been proposed for it werner 117 behrendt argues that butts set predates thomas set by six years behrendt stephen c blake s illustrations to milton s nativity ode in philological quarterly lv winter 1976 pp 65 95 quoted in butlin 390 and collins baker and r r wark place it in 1809 but earlier than thomas set c h collins baker enlarged and revised by r r wark catalogue of william blake s drawings and paintings in huntington library first published 1938 quoted in butlin 390 sequence of illustrations is also a topic of scholarly dispute mountings of thomas set were inscribed on their backs with numbers 1 6 but these were added during or after 1872 sotheby s sale and so are unlikely to follow blake s intended order this original order ran thus descent of peace annunciation to shepherds flight of moloch old dragon overthrow of apollo and pagan gods night of peace geoffrey keynes placed them in 1 6 2 3 4 5 order so that night of peace followed descent of peace because of their similar subjects keynes geoffrey notes on illustrations in on morning of christ s nativity milton s hymn with illustrations by william blake 1923 p 31 2 quoted in butlin 390 butlin and nearly all subsequent scholars have rejected this as much commentary has centered upon blake s use of similar images to frame sequence butlin instead rearranges original sequence as 1 2 4 5 3 6 moving flight of moloch to second to last so that it matches order of corresponding verses in milton s poem dunbar also follows butlin s order behrendt adopts a 1 2 5 3 4 6 order seeing a thematic progression from destruction of classical aesthetics to old testament cruelty of moloch who resembles blake s urizen to satan himself behrendt 40 41 this order is followed by werner in her blake s vision of poetry of milton analysis thumb flight of moloch watercolour 25 7 x 19 7 cm 1809 blake s literary debt to milton is key to understanding his illustrations of earlier poet s writings in general milton a poem is a guide to blake s idea of milton that he possessed true spiritual vision but fell by his adherence to moralistic and repressive tenets of puritanism and by his preference for cruel and distant jehovah of old testament over redemptive figure of christ in that regard nativity ode is to blake rebirth of milton s poetry into creative imagination of christ behrendt 39 blake also sees a return to prophetic christian ideals of poetry rather than pagan classical aesthetic represented in overthrow of apollo and pagan gods by figure of apollo who is modeled on apollo belvedere behrendt 40 blake s prophetic book europe a prophecy was especially influenced by on morning of christ s nativity frye 262 in that poem messianic orc a symbol of pure creative energy rises against repressive institutions of church and state orc is part of a doomed cycle his rebellion is inevitably countered by increased institutional repression of urizen europe in that light is seen as a pessimistic parody of milton s poem werner 115 orc is often associated with fire and closest parallel with him is found in flight of moloch where a child is about to be given to god of sacrifice similarity of orifice that frames child to shape of stable in other illustrations underscores purpose of christ s birth and foreshadows harrowing of hell werner 130 illustrations emphasize simultaneous occurrence of events they depict by presence of stable in almost every image and by framing set with two very similar images that focus on peaceful victory of christ over darkness dunbar 92 descent of peace also has neo platonic implications it represents descent of soul into body which is symbolized by cramped stable dunbar 94
