earwigs make up insect order dermaptera with about 2 000 species in 12 families they are one of smaller insect orders earwigs have characteristic cerci a pair of forceps like pincers on their abdomen and membranous wings folded underneath short rarely used forewings hence scientific order name skin wings some groups are tiny parasites on mammals and lack typical pincers earwigs are found on all continents except antarctica earwigs are mostly nocturnal and often hide in small moist crevices during day and are active at night feeding on a wide variety of insects and plants damage to foliage flowers and various crops is commonly blamed on earwigs especially common earwig forficula auricularia earwigs have five molts in year before they become adults many earwig species display maternal care which is uncommon among insects female earwigs may care for their eggs and even after they have hatched as nymphs will continue to watch over offspring until their second molt as nymphs molt sexual dimorphism such as differences in pincer shapes begins to show some earwig specimen fossils are in extinct suborders archidermaptera or eodermaptera former dating to late triassic and latter to middle jurassic many orders of insect have been theorized to be closely related to earwigs though of notoptera are most likely etymology thumb right 200px earwig diagram with wings extended and closed scientific name for order dermaptera is greek in origin stemming from words meaning skin and pteron plural ptera wing it was coined by charles de geer in 1773 common term earwig is derived from old english which means ear and which means insect or literally beetle entomologists suggest that origin of name is a reference to appearance of hindwings which are unique and distinctive among insects and resemble a human ear when unfolded name is more popularly thought to be related to old wives tale that earwigs burrowed into brains of humans through ear and laid their eggs there earwigs are not known to purposefully climb into ear canals but there have been anecdotal reports of earwigs being found in ear distribution thumb 200px right an earwig from western ghats earwigs are abundant and can be found throughout americas and eurasia common earwig was introduced into north america in 1907 from europe but tends to be more common in southern and southwestern parts of united states only native species of earwig found in north of united states is spine tailed earwig doru found as far north as canada where it hides in leaf axils of emerging plants in southern ontario wetlands however other families can be found in north america including forficulidae doru and forficula being found there anisolabididae and labiduridae few earwigs survive winter outdoors in cold climates they can be found in tight crevices in woodland fields and gardens out of about 1 800 species about 25 occur in north america 45 in europe including 7 in great britain and 60 in australia morphology thumb 350px male earwig external morphology click on image for a larger view most earwigs are flattened which allows them to fit inside tight crevices such as under bark with an elongated body generally long largest extant species is australian giant earwig which is approximately long while possibly extinct saint helena earwig reached earwigs are characterized by cerci or pair of forceps like pincers on their abdomen male earwigs generally have more curved pincers than females these pincers are used to capture prey defend themselves and fold their wings under short tegmina antennae are thread like with at least 10 segments forewings are short oblong leathery plates used to cover hindwings like elytra of a beetle rather than to fly most species have short and leather like forewings with very thin hindwings though species in former suborders arixeniina and hemimerina epizoic species sometimes considered as ectoparasites are wingless and blind with filiform segmented cerci today these are both included merely as families in suborder neodermaptera hindwing is a very thin membrane that expands like a fan radiating from one point folded under forewing even though most earwigs have wings and are capable of flight they are rarely seen in flight these wings are unique in venation and in pattern of folding that requires use of cerci internal neuroendocrine system is typical of insects there is a brain a ganglion three thoracic ganglia and six abdominal ganglia strong neuron connections connect neurohemal corpora to brain and frontal ganglion where closely related median corpus produces juvenile hormone iii in close proximity to neurohemal dorsal digestive system of earwigs is like all other insects consisting of a fore mid and hindgut but earwigs lack gastric which are specialized for digestion in many species of insect long slender excretory malpighian tubules can be found between junction of mid and hind gut reproductive system of females consist of paired ovaries lateral oviducts spermatheca and a genital chamber lateral ducts are where eggs leave body while spermatheca is where sperm is stored unlike other insects gonopore or genital opening is behind seventh abdominal segment ovaries are primitive in that they are nurse cells and oocytes alternate along length of in some species these long ovarioles branch off lateral duct while in others short ovarioles appear around duct life cycle and reproduction thumb right 100px life cycle and development of a male earwig from egg to each instar earwigs are hemimetabolous meaning they undergo incomplete metamorphosis developing through a series of 4 to 6 molts developmental stages between molts are called instars earwigs live for about a year from hatching they start mating in autumn and can be found together in autumn and winter male and female will live in a chamber in debris crevices or soil deep after mating sperm may remain in female for months before eggs are fertilized from midwinter to early spring male will leave or be driven out by female afterward female will begin to lay 20 to 80 pearly white eggs in 2 days some earwigs those parasitic in suborders arixeniina and hemimerina are viviparous give birth to live young they would be fed by a sort of placenta when first laid eggs are white or cream colored and oval shaped but right before hatching they become kidney shaped and brown each egg is approximately tall and wide earwigs are among few non social insect species that show maternal care mother will pay close attention to needs of her eggs such as warmth and protection though studies have shown that mother does not pay attention to eggs as she collects them mother has been shown to pick up wax balls by accident but they would eventually be rejected as they do not have proper scent mother will also faithfully defend eggs from predators not leaving them to eat unless clutch goes bad another distinct maternal care unique to earwigs is that mother continuously cleans eggs to protect them from fungi studies have found that urge to clean eggs persists for days after they are removed when eggs were replaced after hatching mother continued to clean them for up to 3 months eggs hatch in about 7 days mother may assist nymphs in hatching when nymphs hatch they eat egg casing and continue to live with mother nymphs look similar to their parents only smaller and will nest under their mother and she will continue to protect them until their second molt nymphs feed on food regurgitated by mother and on their own molts if mother dies before nymphs are ready to leave nymphs may eat her after five to six instars nymphs will molt into adults male s forceps will become curved while females forceps remain straight they will also develop their natural color which can be anything from a light brown as in tawny earwig to a dark black as in ringlegged earwig in species of winged earwigs wings will start to develop at this time forewings of an earwig are sclerotized to serve as protection for membranous hindwings behavior most earwigs are nocturnal and inhabit small crevices living in small amounts of debris in various forms such as bark and fallen logs species have been found to be blind and living in caves or reported to be found on island of hawaii and in south africa food typically consists of a wide array of living and dead plant and animal matter for protection from predators species doru of earwigs can squirt foul smelling yellow liquid in form of jets from scent glands on dorsal side of third and fourth abdominal segment it aims discharges by revolving abdomen a maneuver that enables it simultaneously to use its pincers in defense ecology earwigs are mostly scavengers but some are omnivorous or predatory abdomen of earwig is flexible and muscular it is capable of maneuvering as well as opening and closing forceps forceps are used for a variety of purposes in some species forceps have been observed in use for holding prey and in copulation forceps tend to be more curved in males than in females thumb left a male of forficula auricularia feeding on flowers common earwig is an omnivore eating plants and ripe fruit as well as actively hunting arthropods to a large extent this species is also a scavenger feeding on decaying plant and animal matter if given chance observed prey include largely plant lice but also large insects such as bluebottle flies and woolly aphids plants that they feed on typically include clover butterfly bush lettuce cauliflower strawberry blackberry sunflowers celery peaches plums grapes potatoes roses seedling beans and beets and tender grass shoots and roots they have also been known to eat corn silk damaging corn species of suborders arixeniina and hemimerina are generally considered epizoic or living on outside of other animals mainly mammals in arixeniina family arixeniidae species of genus arixenia are normally found deep in skin folds and gular pouch of malaysian hairless bulldog bats torquatus apparently feeding on bats body or glandular secretions on other hand species in genus xeniaria still of suborder arixeniina are believed to feed on guano and possibly arthropods in bat s roost where it has been found hemimerina includes araeomerus found in nest of long tailed pouch rats beamys and hemimerus which are found on giant cricetomys rats earwigs are generally nocturnal and typically hide in small dark and often moist areas in daytime they can usually be seen on household walls and ceilings interaction with earwigs at this time results in a defensive free fall to ground followed by a scramble to a nearby cleft or crevice during summer they can be found around damp areas such as near sinks and in bathrooms earwigs tend to gather in shady cracks or openings or anywhere that they can remain concealed during daylight picnic tables compost and waste bins patios lawn furniture window frames or anything with minute spaces even artichoke blossoms can potentially harbour them predators and parasites earwigs are regularly preyed upon by birds and like many other insect species they are prey for insectivorous mammals amphibians lizards

triassic to early jurassic period about in england and australia and comprises about 70 specimens in extinct suborder archidermaptera some of traits believed by to belong to modern earwigs are not found in earliest fossils but adults had five segmented tarsi final segment of leg well developed ovipositors veined tegmina forewings and long segmented cerci in fact pincers would not have been curled or used as they are now theorized stem group of dermaptera are protelytroptera these insects which resemble modern blattodea or cockroaches owing to shell like forewings and large unequal anal fan are known from permian of north america europe and australia there are no fossils from triassic when morphological changes from protelytroptera to dermaptera took place most likely and most closely resembling related order of insects is notoptera theorized by giles in 1963 however other arguments have been made by other authors linking them to embioptera plecoptera and dictyoptera archidermaptera is believed to be sister to remaining earwig groups extinct eodermaptera and living suborder neodermaptera former suborders forficulina hemimerina and arixeniina extinct suborders have tarsi with five segments unlike three found in neodermaptera as well as unsegmented cerci no fossil hemimeridae and arixeniidae are known species in hemimeridae were at one time in their own order or hemimerina like most other epizoic species there is no fossil record but they are probably no older than late tertiary some evidence of early evolutionary history is structure of antennal heart a separate circulatory organ consisting of two ampullae or vesicles that are attached to frontal cuticle to bases of antennae these features have not been found in other insects an independent organ exists for each antenna consisting of an ampulla attached to frontal cuticle medial to antenna base and forming a thin walled sac with a valved ostium on its ventral side they pump blood by elastic connective tissue rather than muscle molecular studies suggest that this order is sister to plecoptera or to ephemeroptera wan x kim mi kim mj kim i 2012 complete mitochondrial genome of free living

large forceps like structures first epizoic species of earwig was discovered by a london taxidermist on body of a malaysian hairless bulldog bat in 1909 then described by karl jordan by 1950s two suborders arixeniina and hemimerina had been added to dermaptera arixeniina represents two genera arixenia and xeniaria with a total of five species in them as with hemimerina they are blind and wingless with filiform segmented cerci hemimerina are viviparous ectoparasites preferring fur of african rodents in either cricetomys or beamys genera hemimerina also has two genera hemimerus and araeomerus with a total of 11 species phylogeny thumb a female of common earwig in a threat pose dermaptera is relatively small compared to other orders of insecta with only about 2 000 species 3 suborders and 15 families including extinct suborders archidermaptera and eodermaptera with their extinct families and phylogeny of dermaptera is still debated extant dermaptera appear to be monophyletic and there is support for monophyly of families forficulidae labiduridae and anisolabididae however evidence has supported conclusion that former suborder forficulina was paraphyletic through exclusion of hemimerina and arixeniina which should instead be nested within forficulina thus these former suborders were eliminated in most recent higher classification relationship with humans earwigs are fairly abundant and are found in many areas around world there is no evidence that they transmit diseases to humans or other animals their pincers are commonly believed to be dangerous but in reality even curved pincers of males cause little or no harm to humans earwigs have been rarely known to crawl into ears of humans but they do not lay eggs inside human body or human brain there is a debate whether earwigs are harmful or beneficial to crops as they eat both foliage and insects eating such foliage such as aphids though it would take a large population to do considerable damage common earwig eats a wide variety of plants and also a wide variety of foliage including leaves and petals they have been known to cause economic losses in fruit and vegetable crops some examples are flowers hops red raspberries and corn crops in germany and in south of france earwigs have been observed feeding on peaches and apricots earwigs attacked mature plants and made
