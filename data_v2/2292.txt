and have become involved in their local community having raised money for a local shelter for victims of domestic violence among other charity work he still works as a producer but is more selective about projects he works on production style szymczyk s has frequently been noted as sort of producer who pushes bands to expand their musical horizons he has been brought in with specific intent of changing a band s sound he himself has credited this tendency to his lack of musical knowledge stating i m a professional listener i listen and i react i never was a musician so i don t bring any preconceived prejudices to table i don t favour guitar over keyboard and so forth i just listen and try to figure out if i have anything i can bring to a song for his work with eagles he has been cited for his innovative mixing of drums laboriously working to get right microphones and placements for just right sound rather than recording harmony vocals individually and mixing them together later as was common szymczyk preferred to capture eagles singing in ensemble often spending many hours to record each phrase just right for elvin bishop hit fooled around and fell in love it was szymczyk who suggested inclusion of song on bishop s struttin my stuff album feeling blues oriented album lacked a pop single song would go on to become bishop s biggest hit such a pattern was repeated throughout his career eagles brought him in to refine and improve their rock sound and all of their biggest selling albums and songs were produced martin turner of wishbone ash has called him my all time favourite producer while two did not always get along during recording usually over turner s bass playing style turner does credit szymczyk with giving band a more commercial sound on one
