thumb right amtrak s livery has included a variety of designs most based on a red white and blue color scheme lead locomotive here is in phase ii livery while trailing locomotive is still in phase i amtrak has used a variety of liveries on its rolling stock since taking over intercity passenger rail service in united states in 1971 a series of six schemes termed phases first introduced in 1972 have seen widest use phases primarily use geometric arrangements of red white and blue national colors of united states part of amtrak s patriotic visual identity amtrak began operations in may 1971 with a mixture of equipment still painted in distinct liveries of freight railroads that relinquished their passenger service to amtrak amtrak picked and chose equipment that it determined to be in best condition and elected not to keep same rolling stock on same routes since prior to amtrak s operation one almost never found rolling stock from anywhere in country on any train let alone rolling stock from competing railroads mixed together on same train that period was later known as rainbow era to build brand of amtrak as a unified passenger railroad rolling stock was gradually repainted into system wide phases starting around 1972 with phase i phases are sequentially numbered using roman numerals phases were painted on all rolling stock with locomotives and passenger cars often painted in different styles of same phase most current locomotives use 2000 introduced phase v while passenger cars use 2002 introduced phase vi a modified phase iii scheme was introduced for some equipment in 2013 non revenue equipment uses bright lime green or a variation of phase v three routes under amtrak california branch capitol corridor pacific surfliner and san joaquin use equipment painted in several custom schemes as do cascades and piedmont amtrak has repainted equipment in unique livery for special uses including its 40th anniversary in 2011 and to promote operation lifesaver safety campaign equipment has also been wrapped for advertising promotions when testing equipment from other railroads amtrak has mostly kept existing livery though some longer term tests used phase schemes rainbow era thumb a rainbow era amtrak trainset 1971 when amtrak took over intercity passenger rail service on may 1 1971 it inherited a collection of rolling stock from twenty different railroads each with its own distinct colors and logos needing only to operate 184 of 366 trains that had been run nationwide by private railroads amtrak was able to pick 1 200 best passenger cars to lease from 3 000 that private railroads had owned this equipment was haphazardly mixed to form consists resulting in trains with mismatched colors of several predecessor railroads this rainbow era was short lived amtrak began purchasing some of leased equipment in mid 1971 setting stage for wholesale repainting from 1972 to 1974 phase paint schemes phase i introduced in 1972 phase i was first paint scheme to be implemented system wide on amtrak s trains except for a small number of locomotives that had been painted into experimental and promotional paint schemes it was first new paint for most equipment under amtrak scheme was part of amtrak s larger move to a visual identity featuring national colors of red white and blue locomotives were painted a light gray platinum mist with a black roof amtrak pointless arrow chevron logo on side and a red nose which led to a bloody nose nickname passenger cars were silver or left bare stainless steel with a red and bright blue stripe bracketed by thin white stripes at window level and chevron logo at one or both ends a number of variants were made for non revenue locomotives gg1 locomotives and turboliner trainsets and self propelled rdc and metroliner railcars phase ii phase ii paint scheme was introduced in late 1974 with arrival of new ge e60 locomotives red nose and chevron logo on locomotives were replaced with stripes similar to passenger cars most passenger cars were essentially unchanged from phase i except for removal of chevron logo new lounges had a higher stripe with an angled transition on each end phase iii phase iii introduced in 1976 is still used on some equipment on both passenger cars and locomotives outer white pinstripes were removed while inner stripe was widened resulting in red white and blue stripes of equal width turboliners and lrc test train were painted in white with stripes at bottom of train this scheme was introduced for safety graphic aid and saving money as white band was highly reflective and provided a place for car information and standard widths made better use of raw material several types of locomotives that were acquired later were given variations on phase iii aem 7 locomotives had blue stripe expanded to cover entire lower part of body on dash 8 locomotives a deeper blue and red was used stripes had additional pinstripes and angled upward across middle of body similarity to pepsi logo led to units being nicknamed pepsi cans genesis locomotives had a lighter roof and narrower white stripe stripes angled downward on sloped nose and faded towards rear that variant was created by industrial designer cesar vergara who also designed angular bodies of locomotives in october 2013 amtrak introduced a new variant of phase iii with production of new viewliner ii cars first of which entered service in 2015 viewliner cars have some changes from previous phase iii passenger cars including a red reflective stripe at bottom and a newer travelmark logo in january 2016 amtrak revealed a p32ac dm that was repainted into phase iii similar to that of heritage units 145 and 822 but featuring modern logos and empire service emblems on sides all p32ac dms will eventually be repainted into this scheme with costs shared between amtrak and state of new york phase iv beginning in 1993 phase iv was introduced as a striking departure from traditional red white and blue style seen previously brought into service with delivery of newer superliner ii cars phase iv has two thin red stripes and a thick dark blue stripe in 1997 amtrak extended scheme to locomotives initially ge p42dc diesel locomotives on northeast corridor services phase v phase v was introduced with arrival of acela express high speed train sets in 2000 and is used on most locomotives locomotives are painted light gray with a blue stripe darker than phases i iii but lighter than iv at top and a thin red reflective stripe at bottom blue stripe has a wavy bottom on genesis locomotives and a flat bottom on other locomotives and ex f40ph non powered control units npcus amtrak travelmark logo is painted near front or rear of unit sc 44 locomotives used on midwest routes have a variant of phase v with a blue front and a transition into grey side non passenger cars like auto train are all gray except for logo and red stripe express box cars had blue stripes on top and bottom acela express trainsets have grey and stainless steel bodies with lower red stripe with wavy blue roof and acela logo on power cars only acela passenger cars have no blue stripe colored blobs called mobiles are used to indicate type of car business class cafe bistro or first class when acela express was introduced regional trains on northeast corridor were briefly designated acela regional amfleet coaches for these trains received capstone livery which had a window stripe with various patterns of blue light blue and green to indicate type of service rebuilt turboliners had a similar variant of capstone livery phase vi phase vi commonly referred to as phase ivb introduced in 2002 is used on most passenger cars it retains same stripe style as phase iv wide window stripes on single level cars and narrow stripes on superliners red reflective sill stripe and mid tone blue on phase v are used single level cars have white logos within blue stripe while superliners have blue logos below stripes route specific paint schemes five state funded corridor routes cascades capitol corridor pacific surfliner piedmont and san joaquin are operated by amtrak using equipment that is largely owned by states in which they operate and painted in custom schemes that deviate from national amtrak livery several other route specific paint schemes have been used in past amtrak california three routes

to supplement its newly built express box car fleet rebuilt cars arrived in their original southern pacific olive green paint scheme rather than phase v scheme of newer cars though some were later repainted advertising thumb right century express at union station in washington d c in 1999 since late 1990s amtrak has occasionally rented advertising space on exterior of its passenger equipment
