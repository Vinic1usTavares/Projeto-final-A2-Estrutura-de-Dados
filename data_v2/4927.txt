by thomas beckington this included a gallery over gate into cathedral for vicars convenience vicars chapel and library right thumb vicars chapel and library chapel was built between 1424 and 1430 at north end of close it is eight degrees out of alignment with rest of close this is because northern wall of chapel was built on top of old wall enclosing liberty of st andrew liberty encompassed broadly situated to east of city centre of wells main part of liberty formed a walled precinct within city which was otherwise not walled and this included wells cathedral cathedral green bishop s palace old deanery and vicars close to compensate for misalignment of chapel roof slopes to west so that it appears level from close most of vicars chapel is rubble masonry however south face which can be seen from close is of white conglomerate quarried locally shields on wall are those of nicholas suggesting that construction was started during his reign as bishop between 1407 and 1424 and john stafford who was bishop from 1424 until 1443 suggesting that construction was completed under his episcopate lower floor was a chapel and a spiral stair led up to library chapel was dedicated to assumption of blessed virgin mary and st katherine it is now used by chaplain of wells cathedral school interior is decorated with 19th century gesso work by heywood sumner residences thumb left upright close seen from tower of cathedral residences are built of stone from mercia mudstone group there were originally 22 houses on east side and 20 on west they line each side of a quadrangle which appears longer than it is because of false perspective achieved by building houses at upper northern end nearest chapel closer together than those at lower southern end closest to vicars hall each house originally comprised a ground floor hall of approximately and an upper floor of same size both had a fireplace in front wall washing facilities and a latrine were outside back door date of some of buildings is unclear but it is known that some had been built by 1363 and rest were completed by 1412 there were originally 42 houses each for one vicar however in a charter of c 1582 queen elizabeth restricted number of vicars to twenty and vicars choral currently number twelve men no 1 vicars close was once a larger property but has since been divided and part of building is now called no 1 st andrew street following 15th century reformation when clerical marriage was permitted larger households would have been required and as a result some of houses were altered and combined by knocking through walls into larger dwellings others had extensions built to rear water supply was originally from two wells one at each end of close by 1468 lead pipes had been installed to bring water into houses although wells continued to function until 19th century number 22 is house which still has most of its original medieval structure as it was originally built thumb shrewsbury house in fifteenth century bishop thomas beckington left much of his estate to vicars choral enabling repairs to be carried out gardens in front of houses were not part of original scheme with garden walls being added as part of this development walls are on average from front of houses he unified appearance of terraces including installation of a single arch braced and wind braced trussed sloping roof
