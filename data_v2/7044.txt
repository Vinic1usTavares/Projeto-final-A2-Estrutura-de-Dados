action of 30 may 1798 was a minor naval engagement between a small british squadron and a small french squadron off coast of normandy france during french revolutionary wars a british blockading force which had been conducting patrols in region in aftermath of battle of st earlier in month encountered two french vessels attempting to sail unnoticed between le havre and cherbourg closing with french british commander sir francis laforey sought to bring french ships to battle as they attempted to turn back to le havre before british squadron could attack french were unable to escape and laforey s ship fifth rate engaged french corvette confiante while two smaller british ships chased vesuve after a brief exchange of fire their crews ran both french ships onshore close to mouth of river dives where several of landing barges that had survived attack on british held iles saint marcouf were sheltering confiante was badly damaged and boarding parties from hydra and other ships were able to board and burn her following morning vesuve had suffered less than confiante and troops onshore were able to protect her from further attack until her crew could bring her into nearby harbour of sallenelles there she was repaired and eventually she returned to le havre background by 1798 british royal navy had successfully contained french navy within its own harbours employing a strategy of close blockade to ensure dominance at sea during french revolutionary wars strategy was particularly effective in english channel where proximity of british bases and importance in limiting movements of french invasion forces stationed around boulogne focused british attention on normandy coast this was essential to prevent concentration of a large force of invasion barges that had been constructed at various harbours under guidance of a captain muskein gardiner p 105 to improve royal navy s ability to observe french movements on normandy coast a force under command of captain sir sidney smith seized garrisoned and fortified uninhabited iles saint marcouf in 1795 woodman p 102 during spring of 1798 muskein concentrated over 50 of landing barges in saint vaast la hougue and on 6 may launched an attack on iles saint marcouf while a combination of wind and tide prevented blockade squadron from intervening fortified islands were too well defended however and over 900 french soldiers died in ensuing battle before french abandoned attack french subsequently dispersed remaining landing barges to various ports on normandy coast in response royal navy increased its patrols in region with intention of intercepting convoys and destroying barges gardiner p 107 french movements along coast were not solely confined to landing barges on 29 may 1798 two warships 20 or 24 gun confiante under captain de vaisseau etienne and 20 gun vesuve under lieutenant de vaisseau jean baptiste louis lecolier sailed from le havre travelling westwards across baie de la seine to cherbourg accompanied by a small armed cutter james p 119 battle of 30 may engagement at sea on morning of 30 may a british squadron sailing off la havre spotted french ships pulling to west and gave chase captain laforey leading in 38 gun followed by bomb vessel under captain robert fitzgerald and 12 gun cutter under lieutenant henry garrett clowes p 342 discovering british in pursuit pevrieux ordered his squadron to retreat towards shore tacking in front of hydra and opening an ineffective fire at long range laforey continued his approach and a 06 00 successfully tacked hydra into a position between confiante and vesuve which had turned back towards shore although british frigate came under fire from both french ships their attacks had little impact laforey was able to concentrate his broadside against vesuve and rapidly forced french corvette to turn inshore pursued by vesuvius and trial laforey then set off in pursuit of confiante which was attempting to turn back towards le havre french cutter was unable to escape british pursuit and its crew deliberately drove it ashore near mouth of dives river at 06 30 hydra caught up with pevrieux on confiante and began a heavy fire which french warship returned when possible exchange continued for 45 minutes until 07 15 when confiante having suffered serious damage drove aground on a sandbank near a village a short distance to west of mouth of dives as confiante struck sandbank her mainmast collapsed rending further manoeuvre under hostile fire impossible james p 120 vesuve too drove ashore to avoid british attack lieutenant lecolier managing to beach his ship within dives estuary itself as rising tide brought corvette off beach lecolier made a brief attempt to escape westwards towards caen but trial and vesuvius were alert and drove vesuve back to shore clowes p 343 there two small british vessels opened up a distant fire on corvette as did hydra to west against confiante at 09 30 falling tide forced british ships to retreat off shore laforey gathering his vessels approximately northeast of beached french convoy attack by boats during day french strengthened positions of both battered ships soldiers from surrounding area gathering on beaches to deter any boat attacks on grounded vessels among soldiers were men taken from several of muskein s landing barges that were sheltering in dives river these troops were identified by trial which briefly closed with confiante to determine her condition and was fired on by remaining guns in operation on frigate with their evacuation covered from shore most of crew were removed from confiante including all wounded french eventually abandoned wrecked corvette in evening vesuve was in better condition and remained well protected her crew shored up their vessel at low tide to prevent her falling over and prepared to heave ship off as tide rose due to strong french military presence laforey decided to delay any operation against beached vessels until circumstances were more favourable at 10 00 on morning of 31 may laforey sent boats from his squadron inshore to attack grounded confiante coming alongside wreck at 12 45 british boarding party under lieutenants george acklom and william j simonds found no one alive on ship but counted a large number of french dead still on board removing french colours and paperwork boarding party started fires in bow and stern of corvette before withdrawing despite a steady but ineffective musket fire from french troops overlooking beach and a force of cavalry moving along shore fire rapidly destroyed confiante and british boarding party retired without casualties as british attack proceeded against confiante crew of vesuve succeeded in refloating her and soon had their ship anchored under protection of gun batteries at sallenelles these defences were augmented by additional batteries set up by 200 soldiers under captain muskein drawn from barges that had been trapped in town by british blockade james p 121 by time confiante had been destroyed mouth of dives had been heavily fortified and even arrival of 38 gun frigate under captain sir richard strachan on 1 june was insufficient to counterbalance french numerical superiority eventually laforey was forced to retire from blockade of sallenelles and while he was absent vesuve managed to get underway and reach le havre without further incident gardiner p 98 aftermath french casualties in engagement are uncertain due to circumstances of destruction but based on acklom s report from boarding party they were believed to be heavy british losses were negligible with not one man killed or seriously wounded and only minor damage inflicted on hydra and none on smaller vessels conduct of lieutenant lecolier was subject of much criticism in france after battle in french history victories et lecolier was accused of failing to support pevrieux and grounding his ship while outcome of battle was still undecided british historian william james is less critical of lecolier focusing much of blame for french defeat on more senior pevrieux james p 122 restriction of french movement along their own coastline had serious effects for development of french forces in region and played a significant role in failure of french to pose a realistic invasion threat to britain gardiner p 97 notes citations and
