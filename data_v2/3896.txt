2013 atlantic hurricane season was a well below average atlantic hurricane season and first since 1994 with no major hurricanes it was a well below average season for both hurricanes and major hurricanes but it was a slightly above average season for named storms it was also first season since 1968 with no storms of at least category 2 intensity on saffir simpson hurricane wind scale first tropical cyclone of this hurricane season andrea developed on june 5 while final cyclone an unnamed subtropical storm dissipated on december 7 throughout year only two storms humberto and ingrid reached hurricane intensity this was lowest seasonal total since 1982 season s impact was minimal although 15 tropical cyclones developed most were weak or remained at sea tropical storm andrea killed four people after making landfall in florida and moving up east coast of united states in early july tropical storm chantal moved through leeward islands causing one fatality but minimal damage overall tropical storms dorian and erin and hurricane humberto brought only squally weather to cape verde islands mexico where hurricane ingrid tropical depression eight and tropical storms barry and fernand all made landfall was hardest hit ingrid alone caused at least 32 deaths and 1 5 billion 2013 usd in damage in early october karen brought showers and gusty winds to central gulf coast of united states all major forecasting agencies predicted an above average season all reduced their seasonal predictions in early august but even revised predictions were too high lack of activity was primarily caused by an unexpected significant weakening of atlantic ocean thermohaline circulation between winter and spring this resulted in continuation of spring weather pattern over atlantic ocean with strong vertical wind shear mid level moisture and atmospheric stability which suppressed tropical cyclogenesis seasonal forecasts predictions of tropical activity in 2013 1981 2010 12 1 6 4 2 7

most recent of several such occurrences see all in advance of and during each hurricane season several forecasts of hurricane activity are issued by national meteorological services scientific agencies and noted hurricane experts these include forecasters from united states national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa s national hurricane and climate prediction center tropical storm risk united kingdom s met office and philip j klotzbach william m gray and associates at colorado state university csu forecasts include weekly and monthly changes in significant factors that help determine number of tropical storms hurricanes and major hurricanes within a particular year according to noaa and csu average atlantic hurricane season between 1981 and 2010 contained roughly 12 tropical storms six hurricanes three major hurricanes and an accumulated cyclone energy ace index of 66 103 units noaa typically categorizes a season as either above average average or below average based on cumulative ace index but number of tropical storms hurricanes and major hurricanes within a hurricane season are considered occasionally as well pre season forecasts multiple agencies predicted above average activity citing forecasts for slower than average trade winds warmer than normal sea surface temperatures abnormally low wind shear and unlikelihood of an el nino developing prior to peak of season on december 5 2012 tropical storm risk tsr a public consortium consisting of experts on insurance risk management and seasonal climate forecasting at university college london issued an extended range forecast in its report organization called for 15 4 4 3 named storms 7 7 2 9 hurricanes 3 4 1 6 major hurricanes and a cumulative accumulated cyclone energy ace index of 134 while no value was placed on number of expected landfalls during season tsr stated that landfalling ace index was expected to be above average four months later on april 5 tropical storm risk issued its updated forecast continuing to call for an above average season with 15 2 4 1 named storms 7 5 2 8 hurricanes 3 4 1 6 major hurricanes and an ace index of 131 landfalling ace index was once again forecast to be higher than normal meanwhile on april 8 weather services international wsi issued its first forecast for hurricane season in its report organization forecast 16 named storms nine hurricanes and five major hurricanes on april 10 colorado state university csu issued its first forecast for season calling for a potentially hyperactive season with 18 named storms nine hurricanes four major hurricanes and an ace index of 165 probabilities of a major hurricane hitting gulf coast and east coast were well above average on may 15 united kingdom met office ukmo predicted 14 named storms with a 70 chance that number would be between 10 and 18 and nine hurricanes with a 70 chance that number would be between 4 and 14 it also predicted an ace index of 130 with a 70 chance that index would be in range 76 to 184 on may 23 2013 noaa issued its first seasonal outlook for year stating there was a 70 likelihood of 13 to 20 named storms of which seven to eleven could become hurricanes including three to six major hurricanes these ranges are greater than seasonal average of twelve named storms six hurricanes and three major hurricanes on may 30 florida state university center for ocean atmospheric prediction studies fsu coaps issued its first and only prediction for season organization called for 12 to 17 named storms of which five to ten would further intensify into hurricanes no forecast was given for number of major hurricanes in addition an ace index of 135 units was forecast mid season outlooks in june predictions from csu and tsr were similar to pre season forecasts due to a lack of an el nino and warmer than average sea surface temperatures across atlantic ocean however by july and august csu and tsr all adjusted their forecasts downward because of predictions of cooler than average sea surface temperatures and above average wind shear noaa also decreased amount of activity in its final outlook despite predicting a wetter than average western africa and above average sea surface temperatures in its report on june 3 csu issued its first mid season prediction for remainder of year in its report organization continued to predict well above average activity with eighteen named storms nine hurricanes four major hurricanes and an ace index of 165 units csu stated that there was a 72 chance of at least one major hurricane impacting any stretch of united states coastline chances of a major hurricane hitting east coast and gulf coast were 48 and 47 respectively following day tropical storm risk issued its third forecast for 2013 atlantic hurricane season calling for sixteen named storms eight hurricanes four major hurricanes and an ace of 134 units this activity was predicted to be roughly 30 above 1950 2012 long term mean tsr gave a 65 probability that landfalling ace index would be above average a month later tsr lowered its numbers to 15 named storms seven hurricanes and three major hurricanes on august 2 colorado state university issued another update for season lowering its numbers slightly however organization continued to state that there was an above average probability of a united states and caribbean major hurricane landfall finally on august 8 noaa issued its second and final outlook for season predicting 13 to 19 named storms six to nine hurricanes and three to five major hurricanes these numbers were down slightly from its may outlook post season review with 13 tropical storms two hurricanes and no major hurricanes activity fell far below predictions brian mcnoldy at university of miami noted several reasons why noaa should not cease seasonal predictions including variability of hurricane seasons and value of supplementing climatology with seasonal forecasts further mcnoldy argued that forecasting a hurricane season challenges us to better understand how atmosphere works on november 29 dr phil klotzbach of csu noted that dr gray and i have been doing these forecasts for 30 years and that s probably biggest forecast bust that we ve had program which had already lost contributions from an insurance company in june was defunded further following botched season forecasts however gray and klotzbach were able to issue predictions for 2014 season seasonal summary atlantic hurricane season officially began on june 1 2013 it was a below average season in which 14 tropical cyclones and one subtropical cyclone formed thirteen of fifteen designated cyclones attained tropical storm status however only two of those became hurricanes fewest since 1982 neither of these intensified into a major hurricane first such occasion since 1994 2013 was also most active season without a major hurricane by default 2013 extended period without major hurricane landfalls in united states to eight years since hurricane wilma in 2005 further neither hurricane exceeded category 1 intensity for first time since 1968 throughout season noaa and united states air force reserve flew a total of 45 reconnaissance missions over atlantic basin totaling 435 hours this was lowest number of flight hours since 1966 one hurricane and three tropical storms made landfall during season causing 47 deaths and about 1 51 billion in damage tropical storm chantal also caused losses and fatalities even though it did not strike land last storm of season dissipated on december 7 a week after official end of hurricane season on november 30 2013 activity was primarily suppressed by significant weakening of atlantic ocean thermohaline circulation thc early in year representing largest reduction in strength of thc since ncep ncar reanalysis began weakening of thc was possibly result of lowered ocean salinity and a decrease in north atlantic deep water formation oceanic and atmospheric gyres were able to strengthen in subtropical atlantic allowing southward advection of cold air and water consequently there was a significant cooling of sea surface temperatures over portions of north atlantic this resulted in a continuation of spring weather pattern over atlantic ocean with strong vertical wind shear reduced mid tropospheric moisture and high atmospheric stability weak thc also resulted in slightly stronger trade winds and less wind convergence and rainfall in intertropical convergence zone with an increase in upper level zonal winds and higher environmental air pressures collectively these factors worked to suppress tropical cyclogenesis tropical cyclogenesis began in early june with development of tropical storm andrea in gulf of mexico on june 5 twelve days later tropical storm barry formed in northwestward caribbean sea two named storms originated in month of july tropical storms chantal and dorian similarly there were two tropical storms in august erin and fernand in september four tropical cyclones formed three of which strengthened into tropical storms two of those reached hurricane status most intense tropical cyclone hurricane humberto peaked with maximum sustained winds of on september 11 which is a category 1 on saffir simpson hurricane wind scale other hurricane ingrid was most devastating storm of season and peaked at slightly less intensity activity began to slow in october with development of only two tropical storms karen and lorenzo tropical cyclogenesis then halted for almost a month until tropical storm melissa formed over eastern atlantic ocean on november 18 this was only tropical cyclone in month of november final system was an unnamed subtropical storm that developed south of azores on december 5 after meandering for two days it degenerated into a remnant low pressure area on december 7 season s activity was reflected with an accumulated cyclone energy ace rating of 36 well below 1981 2010 median of 92 and lowest value since 1994 broadly speaking ace is a measure of power of a tropical or subtropical storm multiplied by length of time it existed therefore a storm with a longer duration such as humberto will have high values of ace it is only calculated for full advisories on specific tropical and subtropical systems reaching or exceeding wind speeds of accordingly tropical depressions are not included here after storm has dissipated typically after end of season nhc reexamines data and produces a final report on each storm these revisions can lead to a revised ace total either upward or downward compared to operational value systems tropical storm andrea an area of low pressure in eastern gulf of mexico developed into tropical storm andrea on june 5 despite strong wind shear and an abundance of dry air storm strengthened while initially heading north northeastward before turning northeastward later that day andrea intensified and peaked as a strong tropical storm with winds at on june 6 a few hours later storm weakened slightly and made landfall near steinhatchee florida it began losing tropical characteristics while tracking across florida and georgia andrea transitioned into an extratropical cyclone over south carolina on june 7 though remnants continued to move along east coast of united states until being absorbed by another extratropical system off maine on june 10 precursor to andrea dropped nearly of rainfall on yucatan peninsula in cuba storm brought flooding with over 1 000 people fleeing their homes mainly along cuyaguateje river in pinar del rio province in area five tornadoes were spawned one of which damaged three homes in florida storm brought heavy rainfall to some areas causing localized flooding there were 10 tornadoes worst of which touched down in acreage twister downed power lines and trees causing significant roof damage to several houses there was also one injury a surfer went missing in south carolina and was presumed to have drowned remnants of andrea spawned one tornado in north carolina though damage was minor additionally flooding was reported in some areas of northeastern united states three fatalities occurred due to weather related traffic accidents in virginia and new jersey remnants of andrea brought gusty winds to atlantic canada causing thousands of power outages in nova scotia and new brunswick tropical storm barry a tropical wave emerged into atlantic ocean from west coast of africa on june 8 system moved westward and an area of low pressure developed over southwestern caribbean sea on june 16 low then moved across honduras where heavy rainfall triggered flooding that damaged 60 homes and affected 300 people low later re emerged into caribbean sea and developed into a tropical depression at 12 00 utc on june 17 while situated east of monkey river town about 10 hours later it made landfall near big creek belize in that country an estimated of rain fell in 24 hours causing several rivers to overflow their banks in some areas culverts were washed away at least 54 people living along hope creek were relocated to shelters in el salvador flooding and lightning caused one fatality each despite decreasing wind speeds as storm crossed land circulation became better defined early on june 19 depression emerged into bay of campeche and began strengthening due to warm sea surface temperatures around 12 00 utc depression intensified into tropical storm barry after about 12 hours barry attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of and a minimum barometric pressure of at 11 15 utc on june 20 barry made landfall near veracruz at same intensity storm rapidly weakened and degenerated into a remnant low early on june 21 in mexican state of yucatan wind gusts up to and heavy rains downed trees and power lines more than 26 000 residents temporarily lost power after lightning struck a nearby power station leading to a fire four deaths were reported in mexico due to drowning tropical storm chantal a large tropical wave emerged into atlantic ocean from west coast of africa on july 4 system moved rapidly westward under influence of a subtropical ridge scatterometer passes indicating a closed circulation confirmed that tropical storm chantal had developed by 12 00 utc on july 7 while located about east southeast of barbados chantal continued to move swiftly west northwestward and was one of fastest moving tropical cyclones in deep tropics during satellite era while approaching lesser antilles it became disorganized due to wind shear but at 12 00 utc on july 9 chantal peaked with sustained winds of shortly thereafter it crossed through lesser antilles and continued weakening in caribbean sea by late on july 10 chantal diminished into a tropical wave while located south of hispaniola storm brought heavy rainfall to lesser antilles in dominica several mudslides were reported wind gusts up to were observed on island de roofing houses and causing power outages strong winds were reported on martinique with gusts up to observed in fort de france trees were knocked onto roads and power lines leaving about 33 000 homes without electricity elsewhere damage reported in lesser antilles was minimal and there were no casualties although sustained winds in puerto rico remained below tropical storm force a weather station at las in observed a wind gust of late on july 9 winds toppled trees and power lines blocking several roads in hispaniola heavy rains caused flooding over portions of island but fast moving nature of system precluded a more severe flooding event in dominican republic a firefighter from community of was killed as he was swept away by flood waters while attempting to clear a clogged storm drain chantal s remnant moisture interacted with a surface boundary over northeastern florida contributing to widespread thunderstorms that produced locally heavy rainfall and gusty winds overall storm caused less than 10 million in damage tropical storm dorian early on july 22 a tropical wave with an associated low pressure area emerged off western coast of africa based on satellite data wave was upgraded to a tropical depression at 18 00 utc on july 23 while located about south of cape verde islands and further intensified into tropical storm dorian by 06 00 utc following day storm tracked swiftly west northwest over warm ocean temperatures and within an environment of low wind shear initially allowing it to attain peak winds of by july 25 however entrainment of drier mid level air and cooler ocean waters caused a weakening trend late on july 27 a closed low level circulation ceased to exist and dorian degenerated into an open tropical wave remnants continued west northwest until august 1 at which time disturbance reached western extend of a ridge and curved northward despite continued unfavorable wind shear a broad area of low pressure formed off east coast of florida and became increasingly better defined convection gained enough organization for system to be re designated as a tropical depression by 18 00 utc on august 2 however strong northerly winds caused depression to deteriorate into a remnant low about 24 hours later southeast of charleston south carolina on august 4 remnant low was absorbed into a trough off coast of north carolina tropical storm erin a tropical wave accompanied by a misshapen center of surface low pressure and a large area of disorganized showers and thunderstorms emerged from west coast of africa on august 15 wave moved west northwestward along southern periphery of a ridge to its north system quickly organized and its circulation became more defined warranting its classification as a tropical depression early on august 15 at time depression was situated about south of praia cape verde prompting issuance of tropical storm warnings for southernmost islands deep convection continued to develop over center and depression intensified into tropical storm erin six hours after its initial designation however dry air quickly became entrained into circulation and convection waned operationally in real time erin was briefly downgraded to a tropical depression on august 16 though post storm analysis indicated it retained tropical storm intensity that day early on august 17 ship british cygnet measured winds in relation to cyclone around this time it was estimated that erin attained its peak intensity with sustained winds of and a barometric pressure of a temporary northwesterly turn occurred around this time as storm moved through a weakness in ridge later on august 17 increasing wind shear took its toll on erin and convection became displaced from center following day erin degenerated into a remnant low about halfway between lesser antilles and west coast of africa remnants proceeded westward on low level trade winds before opening up into a trough early on august 20 and ultimately dissipated several days later tropical storm fernand on august 10 a tropical wave emerged into atlantic ocean from west coast of africa another tropical wave which spawned tropical storm erin emerged into atlantic on august 13 waves moved westward and merged into a single area of disturbed weather east of lesser antilles further development did not occur until it crossed caribbean sea and reached bay of campeche on august 25 a tropical depression formed around 12 00 utc that day about north northeast of coatzacoalcos veracruz six hours later depression deepened into tropical storm fernand early on august 26 fernand peaked with sustained winds of at 04 45 utc storm made landfall near veracruz at same intensity fernand weakened to a tropical depression later on august 26 hours before dissipating on august 25 a tropical storm warning was posted for gulf coast of mexico from veracruz northward to tampico warnings were canceled north of barra de nautla veracruz early on august 26 and discontinued entirely after fernand weakened to a tropical depression mexican navy helped people in veracruz evacuate their homes efficiently classes at all levels of education in state were closed during storm s passage impact from storm in mexico was most severe in veracruz where 13 people were killed by landslides nine in three in tuxpan and one in in city of veracruz heavy rainfall flooded roads while downed trees caused power outages in boca del rio flooding stranded people at a shopping plaza damage was reported in 19 municipalities mostly in northern and central veracruz storm damaged 457 homes and caused 4 rivers to overflow in oaxaca a man died after being swept away by a swollen river after storm veracruz governor javier duarte declared a state of emergency for 92 municipalities which allowed farmers who sustained damage to receive aid tropical storm gabrielle in late august a tropical wave accompanied by a broad area of low pressure exited west coast of africa while wave was south of puerto rico another tropical wave reached system and enhanced deep convection late on september 4 a tropical depression developed about south southeast of puerto rico operationally depression was upgraded to tropical storm gabrielle early on september 5 however in post analysis it was determined that gabrielle was never a tropical storm in caribbean depression moved west northwestward and lost its closed circulation near eastern tip of hispaniola late on september 5 during a 48 hour period disturbance brought of rain to some areas of puerto rico a mudslide detached part of a small bridge on highway 184 on saint croix minor street flooding was reported and several trees were downed remnant system was monitored for regeneration by september 9 wind shear began decreasing and system re developed into a tropical depression early on september 10 six hours later depression moved northward and strengthened into tropical storm gabrielle by 12 00 utc on september 10 it peaked with maximum sustained winds of and a minimum barometric pressure of storm passed about east of hamilton bermuda early on september 11 strong winds on island downed trees branches caused minor infrastructural damage and left minor power outages after marked oscillations in intensity on september 12 gabrielle finally succumbed to wind shear midway between bermuda and cape cod tropical depression eight eighth tropical depression of season originated from a tropical wave that crossed western coast of africa on august 23 tracking westward wave reached caribbean sea and became increasingly ill defined while in central caribbean an increase in convection was observed on september 1 and subsequent day as wave entered western caribbean after moving into bay of campeche a broad low pressure area formed in association with system on september 5 an increase in deep convection on september 6 led to formation of a tropical depression by 12 00 utc located approximately east northeast of tampico mexico cyclone then moved west southwest under influence of an anticyclone around 18 00 utc on september 6 depression made landfall near tampico once inland depression quickly diminished to a remnant low by 06 00 utc on september 7 it dissipated six hours later heavy rains across tamaulipas and veracruz triggered flooding in areas that had been affected by tropical storm fernand just two weeks prior most significant effects were in veracruz where hundreds of homes were inundated record breaking rains in mexico city falling at rates of per hour caused significant flooding many streets were inundated paralyzing traffic and prompting water rescues an estimated 20 000 homes were damaged by floods and officials opened four shelters in area hurricane humberto a tropical wave exited west coast of africa on september 7 and spawned a low pressure area by following day at 18 00 utc on september 8 a tropical depression developed about west southwest of dakar senegal depression moved steadily westward and intensified into tropical storm humberto early on september 9 despite moderate wind shear humberto continued to strengthen while passing south of cape verde due to a moist atmosphere and warm ocean temperatures storm brought squalls to cape verde southwestern islands experienced wind gusts exceeding which downed several trees heavy rains in many areas triggered flooding that washed out roads and damaged homes offshore freighter rotterdam went missing with a crew of six amid swells vessel eventually reached sao tome and principe though that country s port institute and coast guard denied her entrance later on september 10 storm s deepening briefly halted as it curved northwest in response to a developing mid level trough over central atlantic at 12 00 utc on september 11 humberto reached hurricane status while turning northward about six hours later it peaked with sustained winds of by late on september 12 increasing wind shear cooling sea surface temperatures and a more stable atmosphere led to a weakening trend of storm around 12 00 utc on next day humberto fell to tropical storm intensity while curving west northwestward in low level flow south of azores surface high pressure early on september 14 storm degenerated into a remnant low however deep convection began re developing later that day at 00 00 utc on september 15 humberto regenerated into a tropical storm about southwest of ponta delgada azores an approaching mid to upper level cyclone began to capture humberto causing storm to decelerate between late on september 16 and early on september 17 when humberto s low level circulation became vertically stacked under non tropical cyclone system transitioned into a subtropical storm on september 17 humberto then weakened to a subtropical depression early next day about south of ponta delgada subtropical depression continued north northwestward until degenerating into an open trough and was soon absorbed by a cold front hurricane ingrid a tropical wave spawned an area of low pressure in bay of campeche early on september 12 several hours later it matured into a tropical depression about east southeast of city of veracruz initially depression moved slowly due to weak steering currents around midday on september 13 depression strengthened into tropical storm ingrid after initially moving westward toward veracruz storm turned northeastward away from coast favorable conditions allowed it to attain hurricane status on september 14 and next day ingrid attained peak winds of subsequently heightened wind shear eroded storm s convection caught between a trough over eastern mexico and a ridge over southeastern united states storm turned sharply northwestward and later to west on september 16 ingrid made landfall just south of la pesca tamaulipas in northeastern mexico as a strong tropical storm early on september 17 storm weakened to a tropical depression shortly before degenerating into an area of low pressure ingrid struck shortly after hurricane manuel on mexico s pacific coast creating first instance of two landfalling tropical cyclones in nation within same 24 hour period since 1958 combined impacts of hurricanes ingrid and manuel affected two thirds of mexico killing 192 people and causing 75 billion pesos mxn us 5 7 billion in damage most of destruction has been attributed to manuel but ingrid was directly responsible for at least 23 deaths and 20 billion pesos mxn us 1 5 billion in losses two storms produced approximately 5 7 trillion cubic feet 160 billion m3 of rainwater equivalent to combined volume of every reservoir in mexico rainfall from storm peaked at in tuxpan veracruz rains caused widespread flooding that damaged at least 14 000 houses and hundreds of roads and bridges in tamaulipas where storm made landfall rainfall damaged crops and flooded rivers effects of storm spread into southern texas causing high tides and some flooding after ingrid s onslaught mexican government declared states of emergency in several municipalities relief agencies distributed food and other aid to hardest hit areas though in tamaulipas residents had to rely on assistance from local gulf cartel tropical storm jerry a tropical wave exited west coast of africa on september 24 interaction with a mid to upper level low pressure forced wave to split with southern portion spawning tropical storm octave in eastern pacific ocean on october 12 as evidenced by scatterometer wind data northern portion moved north northwestward and transitioned into a low pressure area early on september 28 after convection gradually became better organized a tropical depression developed early on september 29 about east northeast of leeward islands depression moved northeastward and initially struggled to intensify due to presence of dry mid level air however early on september 30 depression strengthened into tropical storm jerry while curving eastward shortly thereafter vigorous deep convection developed allowing storm to deepen further at 00 00 utc on october 1 jerry attained its peak intensity with sustained winds of and a minimum barometric pressure of however strong wind shear soon weakened jerry later on october 1 a blocking high pressure ridge briefly impeded storm s northeastward motion but it resumed moving in that direction by following day after losing all deep convection late on october 3 jerry became extratropical at about southwest of central azores remnants persisted for a few days until being absorbed by a larger extratropical low on october 6 tropical storm karen on september 16 a tropical wave emerged into atlantic from west coast of africa minimal tropical cyclogenesis occurred until wave reached western caribbean sea on september 27 around that time wave encountered an upper level trough generating deep convection over region on september 28 a broad area of low pressure formed southeast of jamaica based on surface observations it is estimated that tropical storm karen developed near northeastern tip of yucatan peninsula early on october 3 despite a deteriorating cloud pattern karen deepened and peaked with winds of later that day wind shear and dry air caused storm to weaken beginning early on october 4 throughout day only sporadic bursts of deep convection occurred storm moved northwestward at inconsistent forward speeds around a low to mid level ridge early on october 6 karen weakened to a tropical depression and several hours later disintegrated into an open trough off coast of louisiana since beginning of reconnaissance flights in 1943 karen was one of few named storms to dissipate in gulf of mexico without making landfall while storm was threatening gulf coast of united states nhc issued several tropical cyclone warnings and watches as karen approached additionally states of emergency were issued in portions of alabama louisiana mississippi and florida mayor of town of grand isle louisiana evacuated island on october 4 while residents were also ordered to flee lafourche and plaquemines parishes federal emergency management agency fema and united states department of interior called back workers furloughed because of government shutdown to assist state and local agencies louisiana governor bobby jindal authorized mobilization of state s national guard members to active duty abnormally high tides were reported along coast of louisiana at grand isle tar balls from deepwater horizon oil spill in 2010 were washed ashore in texas storm brought minor coastal flooding to brazoria county additionally moisture associated with remnants of karen was absorbed into a frontal system and caused minor flooding in a few states including delaware georgia new jersey and pennsylvania tropical storm lorenzo a tropical wave exited west coast of africa and entered atlantic on october 11 four days later a mid to upper level trough increased convection along northern portion of wave southern portion of wave continued westward while northern portion moved slowly west northwestward and developed into a surface trough eventually system transitioned into a broad surface low despite southwesterly vertical shear deep convection began to increase by late on october 20 after becoming better defined system developed into a tropical depression at 06 00 utc on october 21 while located about east southeast of bermuda six hours later depression strengthened into tropical storm lorenzo on october 21 storm moved north northeastward around northwestern periphery of a mid level ridge lorenzo strengthened further and peaked with sustained winds of and a minimum barometric pressure of at 12 00 utc on october 22 around that time satellite imagery indicated increased banding and an eye like feature cyclone then turned eastward in weak westerly low to mid level flow early on october 23 strong wind shear began impacting lorenzo causing circulation to become exposed to deep convection at 00 00 utc on following day lorenzo weakened to a tropical depression and dissipated into a remnant low 12 hours later low persisted for a few days until it degenerated into an open trough on october 26 remnants of lorenzo fueled st jude storm which struck northern europe with hurricane force winds on october 27 and october 28 tropical storm melissa early on november 17 an extratropical low developed along a stationary front over central atlantic it moved northward and became co located with an upper level low after fronts dissipated deep convection began to initiate near center as a result subtropical storm melissa developed at 12 00 utc on november 18 about east southeast of bermuda melissa moved generally northward and strengthened slightly on november 19 but weakened later that day after convection diminished early on november 20 convection increased again and after storm acquired a warm core it was reclassified as a tropical storm after becoming a tropical cyclone on november 20 melissa accelerated northeastward and slowly strengthened later that day storm attained its peak intensity with sustained winds of and a minimum barometric pressure of amid colder ocean temperatures melissa lost all of its deep convection and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone at 00 00 utc on november 22 at about north northeast of flores island azores remnants merged with another system several hours later unnamed subtropical storm in early december an upper level trough became trapped in steering currents near british isles when an upper level low strengthened to its west an extratropical cyclone formed in response on december 3 cyclone then completed a clockwise loop in response to blocking area of high pressure to its north that would have otherwise caused storm to move towards mainland europe shortly thereafter radius of maximum winds which are usually large in extratropical cyclones began to contract signifying onset of a subtropical transition despite being over sea surface temperatures low wind shear in area allowed system to transition into a subtropical storm on december 5 on 00 00 utc however national hurricane center did not initiate advisories particularly due to predictions of stronger wind shear and decreasing sea surface temperatures preventing additional development storm continued to show more signs of becoming tropical however it failed to complete transition by december 7 stronger wind shear and cooler waters took its toll on system and it weakened to a remnant low dissipating shortly afterwards storm produced sustained winds of on santa maria island in azores with gusts to storm names following list of names
