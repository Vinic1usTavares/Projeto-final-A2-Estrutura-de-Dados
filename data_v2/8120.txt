it is ultimately weaker of two comedic moments that string together hurley s journey only go so far and rest feels a bit too much like filler if conclusion of lie is any indication though outside world may prove to be just as strange as island ign later ranked lie 84th out of 115 lost episodes writing this isn t a terrible episode but it feels like a bit of a stop gap in midst of a very cool run of episodes on island we do get to see a pretty cool looking flaming arrow attack that kills uber annoying frogurt but encounter group has at end with some men dressed as soldiers is just set up for awesome jughead on a similar list los angeles times ranked it at number 69 explaining this isn t a bad episode like most hurley episodes it features a lot of very sweet funny material but it is a bit of a time killer between two really fantastic hours a v club gave episode a b rating and stated that it s enough for me i don t know about you but i m ready to get lost again references external
