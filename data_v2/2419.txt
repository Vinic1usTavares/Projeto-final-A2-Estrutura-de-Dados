home believing that everyone is asleep elizabeth tries to escape but ike stops her from doing so next morning clarice notices ike is missing and heads off to find him she searches woods and is consequently apprehended by a patrolling hartman upon disparaging both him and his dead daughter he impulsively kills her as others watch from a distance horrified elizabeth flees with jackson in tow as a police car passes she screams for help causing deputy to notice them deputy attempts to call for backup but an enraged jackson murders him panicking jackson and elizabeth steal his vehicle and

basement jedidiah crafts faces of hal hartman and elizabeth into a mask donning it to a mirror as he applies lipstick film ends with him smashing mirror at sight of his reflection cast and characters stephen dorff as texas ranger hal hartman stephen dorff portrays hal hartman an unhinged texas ranger that pursues leatherface and his family for revenge for murder of his daughter dorff described leatherface as a survival and retribution film for his character but that you want to stay clear away from sawyers and not confront them he was given reign by directors to develop character way he envisioned him from reading script vanessa grasse as elizabeth lizzy white lizzy played by vanessa grasse is a nurse working at gorman house youth reformery sam strike as jedidiah sawyer jackson sam strike plays jackson born jedidiah sawyer as one of four inmates that escape mental institution before ultimately becoming eponymous leatherface after enduring tragedies that destroy his cognitive stability leatherface is a mentally disabled serial killer seen throughout tcm franchise known for wearing masks made of human skin and using a chainsaw and mallet as his signature weapons strike joined film after reading script which he opined was for a horror film very character driven he felt that there needed to be a contrast between two sides of character to show how a somewhat kind person can become such a killer it could happen to anybody he had it in him because of his mother but was at mercy of his environment strike integrated aspects from original film into his performance out of respect but wanted to give his own interpretation instead of imitating what came before to make character s transformation more believable strike intentionally tried to gain physical body weight before filming to look physically menacing he said i was trying to eat as much as i could to just feel physically capable chainsaws are very heavy especially ones that are manufactured back in 50s and 60s strike believed that character s bursts of rage throughout film contributed to his final permanent state as a monster he developed a battle cry for whenever leatherface lost his temper as a character who was taken from his biological family and put into foster care at an early age jedidiah sawyer was written in screenplay to have been adopted at an early age by a family wanting a little girl forcing him to wear drag clothing as a child and foreshadowing his gender ambiguity in 1974 texas chain saw massacre this plot point was absent from final cut of film lili taylor as verna sawyer verna is matriarch of sawyer family a bloodline of killers from which leatherface was spawned according to taylor what attracted me to leatherface was really talking with directors they wanted to do something that was a cross between terrence malick like badlands and virgin suicides i thought i m there because what i love is this stuff that s happening with people pushing a genre as far as they could push it taylor chose to concentrate more on verna s maternal instincts for her family than her murderous ways with character having a denial or compartmentalization about her motherhood and murder film reunites taylor with stephen dorff who both starred in 1996 film i shot andy warhol chris adamson as doctor lang chris adamson s renewed interest in horror film genre stemmed from his viewing of 1931 s frankenstein to prepare for his role in leatherface he watched texas chain saw massacre and 2003 remake preferring former it seemed to have an innocence somehow compared to some of chopped up limb movies which i have sometimes worked on character doctor lang is director of mental institution from which jedidiah sawyer and other inmates escape gorman house youth reformery finn jones as deputy sorells character of deputy sorells is hal hartman s fellow law enforcement officer and is played by actor finn jones james bloor as ike character ike is performed by james bloor jessica madsen as clarice clarice is one of escaped inmates and was originally intended to be an homage to chop top sawyer a character from texas chainsaw massacre 2 but was later developed into her own character sherwood stated that dna of chop top is present in clarice describing him as his favourite sawyer a revisionist take on chop top was added due to diminished role of family in earlier drafts of script but was removed when filmmakers began to feel that she was more of a rip off than a genuine tribute version of clarice that appears in final film emerged when sherwood imagined an image of this little girl in pigtails burning down her house with her parents inside out of all performances in leatherface sherwood called jessica madsen s most accurate of what he envisioned while writing deciding that clarice is much more than just a pyromaniac julien maury and alexandre bustillo removed scenes detailing her backstory such as her fire for first time her addiction for watching moving flames and exposition on her family s disappearance as film begins it remains ambiguous as to which inmate is actually jedidiah sawyer eventual leatherface maury and bustillo even considered leading audience to believe that clarice could become titular character it wasn t a so crazy idea to have regarding passion leatherface had for dresses and makeup in previous movies sam coleman as bud sam coleman portrays bud a hulking mental patient that escapes institution with jackson clarice and ike additionally ian fisher as dave julian kostov portrays ted hardesty in film father of sally and franklin hardesty final girl and her brother from texas chain saw massacre although his role is brief there was going to be an additional scene exploring his family that was removed for budgetary reasons nubbins sawyer older brother of leatherface known simply as hitchhiker in texas chain saw massacre is played by dejan angelov fills role of hal hartman s daughter whose death sets plot into motion while boris plays jedidiah sawyer in his child years other acting credits include dimo alexiev nathan cooper and nicole andrews production concept and development thumb left screenplay s story of man who loses his sense of identity was derived from actor gunnar hansen s origination of leatherface character in january 2013 it was revealed that due to success of texas chainsaw 3d millennium films began planning a sequel film to be called texas chainsaw 4 which was expected to begin filming later in 2013 in state of louisiana millennium films chairman avi lerner stated that project was brought to him by christa campbell and lati grobman and that millennium had signed on to produce with lionsgate distributing finished product executive producer mark burg who developed sequel s script with john luessenhop and carl mazzocone clarified that it was prematurely announced and had not been authorised rights are controlled by mazzocone and main line pictures no matter what millennium says maybe they re looking for something to sell at berlin but they have no right to announce this sequel idea for a prequel came when hollywood screenwriter and producer seth m sherwood was given chance to pitch film to studio dissatisfied with inconsistencies of franchise s continuity he opted to make a chainsaw film that wasn t just another sequel to original my pitch was always about doing it completely out of left field and making it different luckily that s direction they were interested in going as well script was approached as a story of identity based on statements given by tobe hooper and gunnar hansen on how character leatherface is entirely devoid of personality beyond masks he wears and what his family commands him to do sherwood chose not to have leatherface be born as mentally disabled finding story of a functional person that has their mental capabilities reduced to be more fascinating producer les whedon stated that key motives for accepting pitch were to reinvent franchise while also showing how leatherface came to be despite film s explanatory premise co director julien maury found it important to maintain some of lead character s mystique approaching it as moments from his young years rather than a breakdown of his entire past pre production on august 13 2014 it was announced that sherwood would write film under title leatherface on october 31 2014 julien maury and alexandre bustillo were hired to direct film who admired how different it was from previous installments when we first received script it s not everyday that you have opportunity to see leatherface on front page and we were very surprised in a good way that script was taking a different path producer whedon elucidated that directors were chosen because of their perfect vision and their edge to their storytelling upon signing on to project maury and bustillo requested rewrites in which sherwood gave his support general plot structure remained same though directors wanted screenplay to match their vision nearly every death sequence was altered and ending originally a mass murder involving leatherface killing at least thirty people with his chainsaw was changed because they found it to be too over top and out of character in march and april 2015 sam strike james bloor stephen dorff and jessica madsen joined cast on may 5 2015 lili taylor was publicised to replace angela bettis who dropped out due to a scheduling conflict following day vanessa grasse joined cast to play lizzy filming principal photography began on may 18 2015 shooting on locations in bulgaria bulgaria location was used for budgetary reasons as millennium films had a studio in area to accommodate 1960s era in which film is set cars modeled after time period were sent to filming areas sites were also chosen for an aesthetic of wild open fields and scrubs that resemble texas landscape sherwood likened film s visual style to that of an art film comparing it to badlands with gore in addition to brutal murders in screenplay additional kills were inserted by directors bustillo and maury during filming with one resulting in leatherface s flesh mask cited by sherwood as his personal favourite practical effects were primarily used to bring killings corpses and gore to life much of budget was spent on building a lifelike cow carcass intended to seem realistic crew utilised computer generated imagery as necessary albeit to a much lesser extent two chainsaws were created for filming a rubber chainsaw and an electric chainsaw rubber chainsaw was a variant used for safety of actors with intention of only using computer generated effects when needed as such a lifelike dummy of doctor lang s bloodied corpse was also used in scenes taking place after his death leatherface was made intentionally graphic in response to fan criticisms of texas chainsaw 3d lacking sufficient violence lati said on matter gore is not always point in horror movies although there will be plenty it needs to be psychologically challenging and twisted while five of seven tcm films have been shot in texas one in california and one in louisiana bulgarian filming marks first time one has been shot outside united states filming continued through june 2015 lasting a sum of twenty seven days thumb right 1974 texas chain saw massacre house located in kingsland texas was replicated as a prominent location for leatherface a previous duplicate was created for 2013 sequel texas chainsaw 3d sherwood wrote some of film s locations into script as homage to leatherface texas chainsaw massacre iii fictional sawyer farm is a key location in leatherface which was rebuilt to accurately resemble its appearance in first texas chain saw massacre farm was originally going to be used sparingly until sherwood discussed matter with directors maury and bustillo who felt that if iconic location was going to be built it should be used to a larger extent third act largely set at farmhouse was consequently rearranged from its placement in script sawyer homestead was adduced by cinematographer antoine as being particularly rousing to shoot because it was a real location that he felt was always partially dark or hidden in previous films fictional continuity serving as a direct prequel to texas chain saw massacre leatherface was written by sherwood to also act as a prelude to series as a whole he intentionally distanced film from texas chainsaw massacre remake and its prequel texas chainsaw massacre beginning while respecting fictional events of original film and its various sequels certain character names such as drayton nubbins and sawyer surname were pulled from texas chainsaw massacre 2 creation of deranged lawman hal hartman was inspired by lefty enright a texas ranger that appeared in second film hal hartman is father of burt hartman a vigilante character that first appeared in texas chainsaw 3d character verna sawyer lili taylor was played by marilyn burns in texas chainsaw 3d sherwood confirmed that texas chainsaw film canon made by lionsgate pictures and millennium films consists of chronologically leatherface texas chain saw massacre and texas chainsaw 3d he intended leatherface to be accessible to viewers who had never seen previous films so that they could watch series in order of timeline without being confused release leatherface was originally slated for a 2016 release which it did not meet despite having reached completion it was temporarily shelved by lionsgate films sherwood speculated that studio might have been afraid that they wouldn t make back their investment after another film underperformed but admitted that he had no concrete explanation for delay in a strange way i started to romanticize idea it became some legendary lost film it would be coveted something spoken about something people would try to contrive some way of seeing something that would show up on a tired unused media at a convention in 50 years a film titled leatherface received a direct to video release from lightning pictures in united kingdom in january 2017 featuring a masked chainsaw brandishing figure on home video cover however this film was not texas chain saw massacre prequel but rather a re packaging of unrelated playing with dolls bloodlust home media release was criticised by press as an attempt to mislead consumers into believing it was tcm prequel with william bibbiani on blumhouse com that it s not uncommon for horror movies to pick up new titles to capitalize on various trends but it goes beyond which try to trick you into thinking it s real deal and simply takes title of an anticipated horror movie playing with dolls director rene perez apologised for title change stating that it was distributor s decision to use leatherface title in may 2017 producer christa campbell stated that prequel would be released in october 2017 it premiered at frightfest 2017 on august 25 followed by an exclusive release through directv satellite service on september 21 and wide distribution via video on demand and a limited theatrical run coinciding on october 20 making a reported total of 958 650 at worldwide box office it was also selected as programming for 2017 screamfest horror film festival which ran from october 10 to october 19 2017 at tcl chinese theatre as well as nightmares film festival on october 19 motion picture was published on home video platforms specifically blu ray dvd and digital media on december 19 2017 additional blu ray features included deleted scenes a making of featurette and an alternate ending critical response on review aggregator website rotten tomatoes leatherface received an approval rating of 30 based on 43 reviews and an average rating of 4 02 10 its consensus reads leatherface may wear skin of a texas chainsaw massacre prequel but it proves gutless as an origin story and finds little invention in horror tropes it s cannibalizing on metacritic which assigns a normalized rating to reviews film has a weighted average score of 40 out of 100 based on 12 critics indicating mixed or average reviews stephen dalton of hollywood reporter referred to film as a respectful origin story for long running texas chainsaw massacre horror franchise and also complemented performances of stephen dorff and lili taylor benedict seal of variety called leatherface a mixed bag but also felt that in being driven more by story than gore it was a well made attempt to course correct tcm franchise he believed that nothing can truly live up to original film bloody disgusting gave it a 3 5 5 score saying that bustillo and maury have made best tcm film in quite some while site suggested that film s evasion of slasher movie tropes may have resulted in it not receiving a wide release but still found it to be sufficiently entertaining rating film 4 5 stars jennie kermode of eye for film found leatherface to be less gory than previous installments which she said may disappoint some tcm fans but also felt that story driven horror made up for it dread central s staci wilson was put off by graphic content and plot holes in film but praised acting and cinematography giving a final verdict of 3 5 stars anton of scifinow appraised that despite its excessive violence it didn t come close to meeting quality of horror of first texas chain saw massacre but added if nobody messes with our family is ultimate message maury and bustillo certainly maintain a respectful continuity to reunite old clan for being what he called most entertaining film since original comingsoon net writer jerry smith gave prequel a positive review he assessed that do we really need yet another horror icon origin story and if so would explanation be anything we haven t seen before answers to these questions are quite refreshing he went on to contrast origin story given to that of texas chainsaw massacre beginning as having been able to acknowledge previous films without it feeling forced v o d zilla matthew turner assigned a 6 2 rating opining that leatherface lacked fear factor of original but was sustained by its gore visual style and acting in a negative review flickering myth critiqued that some stories just don t need telling and leatherface is one of them he stated that while it wasn t a needless origin story or a retcon of what came before film felt empty and forgettable screen international opined that it was made more for profit than passion but still thought it was above average in quality for a tcm film heyuguys theorised that it alienated potential viewers by delivering something that fans didn t want and by being too gory for general audiences william bibbiani of ign ranked it as worst texas chainsaw massacre film for being too predictable and adding nothing to series it honestly looks as though filmmakers who made leatherface didn t watch original films but watched all of films that ripped off texas chain saw massacre instead film critic rob gonsalves reviewed that it was respectful to previous films but was consequently akin to a glorified fan film that couldn t deviate from what came before heather of daily dead went into leatherface wanting to love it but thought final product couldn t decide what type of movie it wanted to be she questioned why it was reluctant to be a straight tcm film and slammed third act though citing cinematography practical effects and lili taylor s acting as redeeming qualities future prior to release of leatherface producers had rights to make six further texas chainsaw massacre films in april 2015 producer christa campbell stated that fate of remaining films would largely depend on financial reception and perceived fan reactions to 2017 prequel campbell later clarified in december 2017 that lionsgate and millennium films had lost rights due to time it took to release it on august 24 2018 legendary pictures was reported to be in running to buy rights to franchise with an interest in film and television in 2019 they began developing a new tcm film with chris thomas devlin and fede alvarez serving as writer and producer respectively it is intended to be a direct sequel to 1974 film unconnected to texas chainsaw 3d and leatherface see also list of horror films of 2017 list of prequels leatherface disambiguation notes references external links
