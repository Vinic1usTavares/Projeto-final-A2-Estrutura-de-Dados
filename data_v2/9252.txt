centennial association took hint and mcwane notified moore of keck s hiring on july 1 he also advised moore that his commission had decided senator glass should appear on obverse glass protested at

over removal of confederate monuments in united states question of whether to displace that statue dedicated in 1900 has been raised but as of 2017 it remains in place art historian cornelius vermeule in his volume on u s commemorative coins and medals deemed keck s half dollar a successful but not startling combination of conservative elements he described figure of liberty on reverse as a greco roman actually greek imperial frontal liberty placed before local landmarks vermeule suggested that tall thin lettering on reverse indicates that keck was less influenced by augustus saint gaudens under whom he studied than by chief engraver of united states mint charles e barber served 1880 1917 and his successor george t morgan 1917 1925 further vermeule tied keck s liberty to coins and medals designed by two chief engravers including their work on medals for assay commission he concluded that keck s style as manifest in lynchburg sesquicentennial half dollar was a recollection of fashions perpetuated by barber and morgan production distribution and collecting in september 1936 philadelphia mint struck 20 000 lynchburg half dollars plus 13 extra that would be held for
