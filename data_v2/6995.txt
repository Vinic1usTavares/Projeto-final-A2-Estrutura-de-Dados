seen at club would have had potential to play international football howat p 17 foot pp 74 75 hammond p 17 making an impression conscious of need to improve after his uncertain start to first class cricket hammond scored his maiden first class century in first match of 1923 season making 110 and 92 opening batting against surrey he did not reach three figures again that season but his

runs at an average of 34 30 and 68 wickets at an average of just under 30 more than doubling his career aggregate of wickets his bowling performances led critics to describe him as a potentially good all rounder howat p 25 hammond was not satisfied with his batting form in 1925 hammond p 23 but against lancashire at old trafford he scored 250 not out repeatedly hooking short pitched bowling of australian test bowler ted mcdonald cardus described it as one of finest innings that can ever have been accomplished by a boy of his age howat p 24 foot p 87 over these two seasons hammond increasingly batted in middle order where he remained for most of his career this can be ascertained by perusing scorecards available at cricketarchive serious illness hammond s performances earned him selection for m c c winter tour of west indies in 1925 26 season at that time such tours were popular with amateur cricketers who were often chosen for social rather than cricketing reasons touring party contained only eight professionals who were expected to do most of bowling and provide cricketing quality foot pp 26 27 west indies team did not have test status so no official internationals were scheduled but a series of representative matches against a west indian team were played rain disrupted much of cricket but hammond enjoyed experience foot p 32 hammond p 28 in

illness remained a mystery to those treating him howat p 27 a visit from warner encouraged hammond to believe recovery was possible and he began a slow return to health about a month after his return to england by july he could watch gloucestershire playing in bristol though he missed entire 1926 season foot pp 42 43 no official announcement about hammond s illness was made other than to say he was in a nursing home foot pp 36 40 although cause of illness was never made clear david foot has argued that it was syphilis or a related sexually transmitted disease he has also suggested that its treatment which in days before antibiotics probably involved mercury adversely affected hammond s subsequent character and personality leading to moody and depressive behaviour foot pp 21 22 36 56 rumours of this nature circulated among his contemporaries for many years before foot published his theory murphy p 98 that winter hammond coached in south africa where it was felt climate might aid his recovery howat p 29 hammond p 30 test cricketer test debut on his return to first class cricket in 1927 season hammond made an immediate impact becoming only second man after w g grace to score 1

of being named one of wisden cricketers of year while on tour in south africa in 1927 28 hammond did not dominate as expected still recovering from his illness he was worn out from strain of a long season he showed good batting form but once george geary was injured a strong but not fully representative side found itself short of bowling forcing hammond to play as an all rounder howat p 33 foot p 109 in all first class matches on tour he scored 908 runs at an average of 47 78 and took 27 wickets at an average of 23 85 his test debut came in first match of series as he scored a quick 51 in his only innings and took five wickets for 36 runs in south african second innings at one point he took three wickets for no runs and his bowling was described by wisden as a key factor in an england victory his best innings came in third test as he reached 90 he had some good bowling spells and in fourth test he removed both south african openers an innings of 66 in fifth and final test left him with 321 runs at an average of 40 12 in his debut series while his 15 wickets cost 26 60 runs each all of hammond s batting appearances were at number four in order of his 140 career test innings 118

113 12 in series a record passed only by don bradman since in all first class matches he scored 1 553 runs average 91 35 however except for one inspired spell in final test in which he bowled first three batsmen wisden described his bowling as disappointing he began tour with a century and a double century before test series howat p 36 he scored 251 in a seven hour innings in second test this was his maiden test century and second highest test score between england and australia in next test hammond scored 200 against an accurate attack again taking around seven hours in fourth test he scored 119 not out and then 177 in what wisden judged his best innings of tour due to his mastery of bowlers and difficult match situation when he came in to bat hammond had altered his usual batting style playing more carefully and avoiding risk as runs were certain to come in easy australian batting conditions if a batsman did not get out he eliminated hook shot entirely from his repertoire and rarely played cut shot unless bowler bowled a bad ball he limited his scoring between extra cover and midwicket as australians unsuccessfully tried to block his shots in that area wisden stated that even with his more cautious play his batting on tour had shown skill and beauty hammond married dorothy lister almost immediately after returning home just before 1929 season began gloucestershire s inspirational new captain bev lyon led another gloucestershire challenge for county championship he used hammond s bowling less due to emergence of tom goddard but hammond was less dominant with bat than was expected howat pp 40 41 in first class cricket he scored 2 456 runs at an average of 64 63 he played in four of five tests against south africa missing fourth due to injury he also suffered an injury in second test which required him to use a runner howat p 41 adopting tactics similar to those with which he had success in australia he scored two centuries an unbeaten 138 in first test and a match saving 101 not out in final test which gave england a 2 0 series victory his only other innings over fifty was played in third test he ended series with 352 runs at an average of 58 66 at

113 in third test on a difficult pitch and with little support he made a hard hitting 60 in final test in a losing cause visitors took series 2 1 and newspapers unfavourably compared hammond s scoring with bradman s foot p 145 later in season hammond scored 89 for gloucestershire in a tied match against australians which he described as most exciting of his career one player said that he had never seen hammond as excited as he was at conclusion of game howat pp 42 44 in all first class cricket that season he scored 2 032 runs average 53 47 and for gloucestershire he came top of batting averages

in all first class cricket he scored 1 045 runs average 61 47 in five test series which south africa won 1 0 he scored 517 runs average 64 62 passing fifty five times in nine innings a very cautious approach batting at number three saw hammond score 49 and 63 in first test opening batting in second test he scored two fifties to save game he also kept wicket for a time following an injury to regular wicketkeeper hammond continued to open in third test playing more aggressively for 136 not out before returning to number three and making 75 in fourth test in final test he opened both batting and bowling in 1931 hammond increased his first class wicket total to 47 and scored 1 781 runs at an average of 42 40 although he remained a key batsman for gloucestershire both his aggregate and average fell at least partly due to wet weather that often led to difficult batting conditions hammond p 80 in three tests against new zealand their first in england he made an attacking century in second test england s only victory he did not pass fifty in rest of series ending victorious campaign with 169 runs at an average of 56 33 in 1932 hammond was appointed vice captain of

scored 2 528 runs average 56 17 including his then highest score of 264 and his first hundred for players against gentlemen he also took 53 wickets bodyline tour hammond was selected for m c c tour of australia in 1932 33 known as bodyline series it became notorious for controversial english tactic of bowling short on line of leg stump making ball rise towards batsman s body to create deflections that could be caught by leg side fielders hammond one of first players selected was part of selection committee on tour frith pp 52 56 and m c c captain douglas jardine may have discussed tactics with him on outward journey frith p 66 hammond disapproved of bodyline bowling believing it to be dangerous although he understood some of reasons for its use howat p 48 he kept his feelings hidden during

bowling against bradman who scored an unbeaten century produced a personal duel that struck observers as particularly tense frith p 160 hammond took three for 23 in second innings but achieved little with bat as england lost match in third test he appeared uncomfortable facing tim wall s fast short bowling and was heard to say if that s what bloody game s coming to i ve had enough of it frith p 173 he scored 85 in second innings before being bowled by a full toss from bradman to his annoyance frith p 206 hammond did not pass 20 runs in england s ashes securing victory in fourth test attracting criticism from wisden and others for overcautious batting he returned to form in final test at sydney a ground on which he was often successful scoring 101 and 75 not out wisden praised his style and brilliant play and he ended match with a six securing england s third successive victory and a 4 1 series win a short tour of new zealand followed hammond scored 621 runs in three first class innings in first test he scored 227 and in second and final test he broke world record for a test innings on 1 april by scoring 336 not out his record innings began cautiously but against a weak bowling side he increased his scoring rate after making his century and again after reaching 200 as he passed bradman s record of 334 he shouted yes he hit ten sixes then a test record including three from consecutive balls however weakness of bowling compared to that faced by bradman and importance of ashes matches meant that hammond s record was not as prestigious as australian s when len hutton broke record in 1938 he considered bradman s 334 score to beat frith p 341 loss of test form bodyline controversy continued into 1933 season bodyline tactics were used in several matches including by

five tests against australia but his top score was 43 he scored 162 runs at an average of 20 25 and took five wickets at an average of 72 80 although press and selectors supported him there were some

23 47 over 14 tests hammond made two more fifties in last two tests although they were insufficient to prevent england from losing 1 0 their third successive series defeat he finished series with 389

career and instrumental in his appointment to england captaincy as 1936 season began hammond remained weak from recent removal of his tonsils returning to cricket too soon he was in poor form he took

throughout he was praised by wisden for his control hammond continued to score heavily in third test making 217 after being dropped twice early on his highest score came in last county match of season at gloucestershire which was tom goddard s benefit match a difficult pitch meant that wickets tumbled on first day prompting fears of an early finish which would possibly lose money for goddard

hundreds against state teams but wisden reported that he never recaptured this form during remainder of tour owing to bowling of bill o reilly hammond could not overcome o reilly s use of slow leg theory in later tests which restricted scoring england won first two tests although hammond did not contribute in first making a first ball duck in second he scored an unbeaten 231 then took three for 29 with ball in australia s second innings during a period when other bowlers lost control from this point his contributions fell away although he believed that best innings of his life on one of most

match test series 3 0 according to wisden hammond s inability to make large scores was one of reasons for failure nor was he a success as captain he was criticised for his field placement and people at home wondered if he had lost control of team while he suffered some ill luck wisden said that he was not same inspiring leader as at home against australia in 1938 other journalists noted that he did not consult his players one of whom later commented that he showed little imagination in his use of bowlers howat p 116 hammond approached tour as an exercise in goodwill promising his men an enjoyable time it was noted that bradman australian captain took a more competitive attitude towards series howat pp 111 12 team spirit was good on outward journey but hammond s forthcoming divorce

reporting details of dissolution of his marriage foot p 217 as tour progressed he lost his dynamism as a leader gave poor advice to batsmen and made poor selections for team howat p 119 as a batsman hammond started tour well scoring 208 in an early game but lost form once tests began one of turning points of series was a disputed catch in first test bradman who looked in poor form and uncertain to continue his cricket career for much longer had reached 28 when english team believed he had edged ball to jack ikin at slip bradman as was his entitlement waited for umpire s decision instead of leaving field fielders were certain that he was out but umpire said he was not believing ball had bounced before it was caught opinion among other participants and spectators was divided however hammond was extremely angry saying loudly either to bradman or umpires a fine fucking way to start a series foot pp 217 18 gibson pp 173 74 afterwards relations between hammond and bradman deteriorated and there was a coldness between them bradman went on to score 187 and australia won match and ultimately series in that first test hammond played two good innings on a very difficult

scored 50 551 runs at an average of 56 10 with 167 centuries he remains seventh on list of highest run scorers in first class cricket and has third highest number of centuries as of 2015 style and technique wisden s obituary described hammond as one of top four batsmen who had ever played calling him a most exciting cricketer instant he walked out of a pavilion white spotted blue handkerchief showing from his right pocket bat tucked underarm cap at a hint of an angle he was identifiable as a thoroughbred throughout 1930s public and critics regarded hammond as england s best batsman succeeding jack hobbs and next to bradman best in world although george headley also had a claim among english batsmen only herbert sutcliffe with a higher test average was similarly successful according to alan gibson however although sutcliffe was dependable in a crisis his batting never gave quite same sense of majesty and excitement that hammond s did gibson p 172 more recently hammond was one of inaugural inductees into icc cricket hall of fame launched in january 2009 and was selected by a jury of cricket journalists as a member of england s all time xi in august 2009 balanced and still at crease hammond was known for power and beauty of his driving through off side although he could play any shot a very attacking player early in his career he later became more defensive playing more frequently off back foot and abandoning hook shot as too risky foot pp 87 88 he was particularly effective on difficult wickets scoring runs where others struggled to survive foot pp 125 26 murphy p 101 many of his contemporaries believed that he was finest off side player in history of cricket foot p 123 in words of patrick murphy fellow players considered him on a different plane majestic assured poised a devastating amalgam of physical and mental attributes that make up a great batsman murphy p 96 county bowlers who played against him considered it an achievement merely to prevent him scoring runs however australian bowlers such as o reilly and grimmett troubled him by bowling at his leg stump restricting his scoring as he had fewer effective leg side shots swanton p 112 foot p 127 occasionally he displayed discomfort against fastest bowlers his teammate charlie barnett said that he did not relish fast bowling although he was capable of playing it well in initial stages of his career other colleagues such as les ames bob wyatt and reg sinfield believed that he did not like to face new ball and he was occasionally happy for other batsmen to face difficult bowling murphy p 103 his bowling was smooth and effortless with a classical action he could bowl fast but more often bowled at fast medium pace he could make ball swing in humid weather and deliver off spin when conditions were suitable foot pp 130 31 however hammond was reluctant to bowl particularly for gloucestershire bill bowes believed that he was a very good bowler who would not take it seriously foot p 131 in his obituary wisden said that at slip he had no superior he stood all but motionless moved late but with uncanny speed never needing to stretch or strain but plucking ball from air like an apple from a tree he was also able to field further away from batsmen than was norm particularly in his younger days as he could chase ball quickly and had a very good throwing arm personal life personality hammond struck his contemporaries as a sad figure a loner with few friends in cricket he rarely encouraged young players or gave out praise foot p 4 he liked to mix with middle class people spending money he did not really have leading to accusations of snobbery teammates regarded him as moody private and uncommunicative often silent in company of others he could be arrogant and unfriendly foot pp 7 50 51 gibson p 171 charlie barnett and charles dacre two of his gloucestershire teammates came almost to hate him dacre often played in a reckless way of which hammond disapproved hammond in turn may have been jealous of him hammond once tried hard to injure dacre by bowling fast at him while he was wicketkeeper foot pp 10 153 54 barnett began as a close friend but fell out over hammond s treatment of his first wife and later his refusal to play in barnett s benefit match foot pp 162 64 other players who were involved in disputes with hammond included denis compton whose cavalier approach hammond disliked foot pp 157 58 and learie constantine who believed hammond insulted him in west indies in 1925 although two later made peace foot pp 158 60 hammond s ultimate rivalry was with bradman who overshadowed him throughout his career and with whom he developed an increasing obsession it was not enough for hammond to be second best batsman in world and he disliked constant comparisons made between them in bradman s favour he felt not only that he had to do well but also that he had to score more than bradman foot pp 143 46 marriage david foot quotes an unnamed cricketer saying that two ruling passions of hammond s life were his cricket bat and his genitals foot p 171 his strong desire for women was noticed by teammates from early in his career foot p 172 foot believes that hammond had sexual relationships with many women sometimes several contemporaneously before and during his first marriage some of which led to marriage

seeing his future second wife sybil ness harvey a former beauty queen whom he had met while on tour foot pp 189 92 howat p 88 during war hammond spent much of his leave with ness harvey in south africa in 1945 she followed him back to england but did not like it when hammond left to tour australia in 1946 47 ness harvey remained behind with his mother with whom she did not get along foot pp 197 98 this was one of factors which led to hammond s problems on tour his divorce went through and on his return he and sybil married at kingston register office she had already changed her name to hammond by deed poll their first child roger was born in 1948 foot pp 198 99 carolyn was born in p 129 and valerie was born in 1952 howat p 130 business hammond was involved with several businesses in
