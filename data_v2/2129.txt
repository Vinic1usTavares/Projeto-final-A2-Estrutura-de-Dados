fairy queen 1692 purcell catalogue number z 629 is a masque or semi opera by henry purcell a restoration spectacular milhouse pp 50 61 libretto is an anonymous adaptation of william shakespeare s comedy a midsummer night s dream it has nothing to do with edmund spenser s poem faerie queene first performed in 1692 fairy queen was composed three years before purcell s death at age of 35 following his death score was lost and only rediscovered early in twentieth century purcell did not set any of shakespeare s text to music instead he composed music for short masques in every act but first play itself was also slightly modernised in keeping with seventeenth century dramatic conventions but in main spoken text is as shakespeare wrote it masques are related to play metaphorically rather than literally many critics have stated that they bear no relationship to play recent scholarship has shown that opera which ends with a masque featuring hymen god of marriage was composed for fifteenth wedding anniversary of william iii and mary ii growing interest in baroque music and rise of countertenor contributed to work s re entry into repertoire opera received several full length recordings in latter part of 20th century and several of its arias including plaint o let me weep have become popular recital pieces in july 2009 in celebration of 350th anniversary of purcell s birth fairy queen was performed by glyndebourne festival opera using a new edition of score prepared for purcell society by bruce wood and andrew pinnock original production fairy queen was first performed on 2 may 1692 at queen s theatre dorset garden in london by united company author or at least co author of libretto was presumably thomas betterton manager of dorset garden theatre with whom purcell worked regularly this belief is based on an analysis of betterton s stage directions muller 2005 pp 667 681 a collaboration between several playwrights is also feasible savage 2000 choreography for various dances was provided by josias priest who also worked on dioclesian and king arthur and who was associated with dido and aeneas a letter describing original performance shows that parts of titania and oberon were played by children of eight or nine burden 2003 pp 596 607 presumably other fairies were also played by children this affects our perspective on staging context and analysis following huge success of his operas dioclesian 1690 and king arthur 1691 purcell composed fairy queen in 1692 purcell s first and second music were played while audience were taking their seats act tunes are played between acts as curtain was normally raised at beginning of a performance and not lowered until end after act 1 each act commences with a short symphony 3 5 minutes english tradition of semi opera to which fairy queen belongs demanded that most of music within play be introduced through agency of supernatural beings exception being pastoral or drunken characters all masques in fairy queen are presented by titania or oberon originally act 1 contained no music but due to work s enormous success it was revived in 1693 when purcell added scene of drunken poet and two further songs later on in work ye gentle spirits of air and plaint price 2006 as noted above each masque is subtly related to action in play during that particular act in a metaphorical way in this manner we have night and sleep in act 2 which is apt as that act of play consists of oberon s plans to use power of love in idleness flower to confuse various loves and it is therefore appropriate for allegorical figures of secrecy mystery et al to usher in a night of enchantment masque for bottom in act 3 includes metamorphoses songs of both real and feigned love and beings who are not what they seem reconciliation masque between oberon and titania at end of act 4 prefigures final masque scene changes to a garden of fountains denoting king william s hobby just after oberon says bless these lovers nuptial day four seasons tell us that marriage here celebrated is a good one all year round and all salute rising sun birthday of king oberon kings of england were traditionally likened to sun oberon william significantly william and mary were married on his birthday 4 november chinese scene in final masque is in homage to queen mary s famous collection of china garden shown above it and exotic animals bring king william back into picture and hymen s song in praise of their marriage plus stage direction bringing mary s china vases containing william s orange trees to front of stage complete symbolism music written as he approached end of his brief career fairy queen contains some of purcell s finest theatre music as musicologists have agreed for generations in particular constant lambert was a great admirer from it he arranged a suite and in collaboration with edward dent arranged work to form then new covent garden opera company s first postwar production ashman 7 may 2005 it shows to excellent effect purcell s complete mastery of pungent english style of baroque counterpoint as well as displaying his absorption of italian influences several arias such as plaint thrice happy lovers and hark echoing air have entered repertory of many singers outside their original context orchestra for fairy queen consists of two recorders two oboes two trumpets timpani string instruments and harpsichord continuo performance history thumb 200px right queen s theatre dorset garden where fairy queen was first performed following purcell s premature death his opera dioclesian remained popular until well into eighteenth century milhouse 1984 p 57 but score of fairy queen was lost and only rediscovered early in twentieth century westrup harrison p 199 other works like it fell into obscurity changing tastes were not only reason for this voices employed had also become difficult to find list of singers below shows frequent employment of male alto or countertenor in semi opera a voice which after purcell essentially vanished from stage probably due to rise of italian opera and attendant castrati after that romantic opera emerged with attendant predominance of tenor until early music revival male alto survived mainly in ecclesiastical tradition of all male church choirs and twentieth century american vocal quartets however purcell s music and with it fairy queen was resuscitated by two related movements a growing interest in baroque music and rise of countertenor led by pioneers such as alfred deller and russell oberlin former movement led to performances of long neglected composers such as purcell john dowland john blow and even george frideric handel while latter complemented it by providing a way of making such performances as authentic as possible as regards original music and composer s intentions less true for handel where countertenors appear as castrati replacements steane this has led to fairy queen s increased popularity and numerous recordings have been made often using period instruments format of work presents problems to modern directors who must decide whether or not to present purcell s music as part of original play which uncut is rather lengthy savage calculated a length of four hours savage 1973 pp 201 222 decision to curtail play is usually taken together with resolution to modernise to such an extent that cohesion between music text and action sketched above is entirely lost a criticism levelled at english national opera s 1995 production directed by david pountney white 29 october 1995 for a contrasting view see kimberley 21 october 1995 production was released on video same year and revived by company in 2002 a bold approach was taken at brazilian opera company s 2000 staging by luiz with libretto becoming unstuck in time in july 2009 two months before 350th anniversary of purcell s birth fairy queen was performed in a new edition prepared for purcell society by bruce wood and andrew pinnock which restored entire theatrical entertainment as well as original pitch used by purcell performance by glyndebourne festival opera with orchestra of age of enlightenment conducted by william christie was repeated later that month at royal albert hall as part of bbc proms breen 2009 in june of 2016 opera was performed by hungarian state opera in a new neo noir production directed by andras almasi toth roles role of mopsa was originally performed by a soprano however a later revision by purcell stated that it was to be performed by mr pate in woman s habit presumably to have a grotesque effect and highlight refrain no no no no no no kissing at all in dialogue between corydon and mopsa also it is not entirely clear what word countertenor means in this context record is ambivalent as to whether purcell himself a countertenor used a tenor with a particularly high range though lighter at top and tessitura known sometimes as a haute contre descendants of of medieval polyphony or a falsettist it seems that throughout his career he used both steane see also demarco 2002 pp 174 185 however purely for reasons of dramatic verisimilitude it is more likely than not that travesty role of mopsa was taken by a falsettist and presence of a duet for two male altos let fifes and clarions makes it seem more probable that for this work were employed for a list of non singing
