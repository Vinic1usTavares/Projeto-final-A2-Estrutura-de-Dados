55 cancri d abbreviated 55 cnc d formally named lipperhey is an extrasolar planet in a long period orbit around sun like star 55 cancri a located at a similar distance from its star as jupiter is from our sun it is fifth and outermost known planet in its planetary system 55 cancri d was discovered on june 13 2002 name in july 2014 international astronomical union launched a process for giving proper names to certain exoplanets and their host stars nameexoworlds an iau worldwide contest to name exoplanets and their host stars iau org 9 july 2014 process involved public nomination and voting for new names nameexoworlds process in december 2015 iau announced winning name was lippershey for this planet final results of nameexoworlds public vote released international astronomical union 15 december 2015 winning name was submitted by royal netherlands association for meteorology and astronomy of netherlands it honors spectacle maker and telescope pioneer hans lippershey nameexoworlds approved names in january 2016 in recognition that his actual name was lipperhey with lippershey an error introduced in 19th century exoplanet name was corrected to lipperhey by iau and that name was submitted to official sites that keep track of astronomical information discovery like majority of known extrasolar planets found at time 55 cancri d was detected by observing changes in its star s radial velocity this was achieved by making sensitive measurements of doppler shift of star s spectrum at time of discovery 55 cancri a was already known to possess one planet 55 cancri b however there was still a drift in radial velocity measurements which was unaccounted for in 2002 further measurements revealed presence of a long period planet in an orbit at around 5 au from star same measurements also indicated presence of another inner planet designated 55 cancri c orbit and mass 200px thumb left 55 cnc d s orbit would be outside of jupiter s orbit at 5 when 55 cancri d was discovered it was thought to be on a fairly low eccentricity orbit similar to jupiter in solar system though orbital elements were not well determined as more data were collected best fit solution for this planet turned out to be highly eccentric more so than any of planets in solar system in 2008 after a complete orbit of this planet had been observed true orbit was revealed indicating that as had been originally suspected planet s 14 year orbit was in fact near circular located about 5 77 au from star a limitation of radial velocity method used to discover 55 cancri d is that only a lower limit on planet s mass can be obtained in case of 55 cancri d this lower limit was around 3 835 times mass of jupiter in 2004 astrometric measurements with fine guidance sensors on hubble space telescope suggest that planet s orbit is inclined by around 53deg with respect to plane of sky if this measurement is confirmed it implies that planet s true mass is 25 greater than lower limit at around 4 8 jupiter masses and that 55 cancri d is not coplanar with innermost planets e and b both at about 85deg this measurement is dependent on planet s accurate orbital period estimates for which have changed since 2004 characteristics given planet s high mass planet is a gas giant with no solid surface since planet has only been detected indirectly parameters such as its radius composition and temperature are unknown assuming a composition similar to that of jupiter and that planet s atmosphere is close to chemical equilibrium it is predicted that 55 cancri d is covered in a layer of water clouds planet s internal heat probably keeps it too warm to form ammonia based clouds that are typical of jupiter its surface gravity is likely to be about 4 to 5 times stronger than jupiter or about 10 to 15 times that of earth which is because radius of planet is unlikely to be much more than jupiter s and is probably slightly smaller than jupiter due to high metal content in parent star see also references external links div div category 55 cancri category cancer constellation category exoplanets discovered in 2002 category exoplanets category giant planets category exoplanets detected by radial velocity category exoplanets with proper names
