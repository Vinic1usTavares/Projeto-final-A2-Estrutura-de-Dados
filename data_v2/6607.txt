right thumb amedeo avogadro avogadro number sometimes denoted n or n0 is number of constituent particles usually molecules atoms or ions that are contained in one mole international si unit of amount of substance by definition exactly and it is dimensionless it is named after scientist amedeo avogadro 1776 1856 avogadro constant usually denoted by na or l is factor that multiplied by amount of substance in a sample measured in moles gives number of constituent particles in that sample its numerical value is defined as being avogadro number and its unit is reciprocal of mole that is value of avogadro constant was chosen so that mass of one mole of a chemical compound in grams is numerically equal for all practical purposes to average mass of one molecule of compound in daltons universal atomic mass units one dalton being of mass of one carbon 12 atom which is approximately mass of one nucleon proton or neutron for example average mass of one molecule of water is about 18 0153 daltons and one mole of water n molecules is about 18 0153 grams thus avogadro constant na is proportionality factor that relates molar mass of a substance to average mass of one molecule and avogadro number is also approximate number of nucleons in one gram of ordinary matter avogadro constant also relates molar volume of a substance to average volume nominally occupied by one of its particle when both are expressed in same units of volume for example since molar volume of water in ordinary conditions is about 18 ml mol volume occupied by one molecule of water is about ml or about 30 a3 cubic angstroms for a substance it similarly relates its molar volume in ml mol volume of repeating unit cell of crystals in ml and number of molecules in that cell avogadro number or constant has been defined in many different ways through its long history its approximate value was first determined indirectly by josef loschmidt in 1865 avogadro s number is closely related to loschmidt constant and two concepts are sometimes confused it was initially defined by jean perrin as number of atoms in 16 grams of oxygen it was later redefined in 14th conference of international bureau of weights and measures bipm as number of atoms in 12 grams of isotope carbon 12 12c in each case mole was defined as quantity of a substance that contained same number of atoms as those reference samples in particular when carbon 12 was reference one mole of carbon 12 was exactly 12 grams of element these definitions meant that value of avogadro number depended on experimentally determined value of mass in grams of one atom of those elements and therefore it was known only to a limited number of decimal digits however in its 26th conference bipm adopted a different approach effective 20 may 2019 it defined avogadro number as exact integer and redefined mole as n constituent particles of substance in consideration under new definition mass of one mole of any substance including hydrogen carbon 12 and oxygen 16 is n times average mass of one of its constituent particles a physical quantity whose precise value has to be determined experimentally for each substance history origin of concept right thumb jean perrin in 1926 avogadro constant is named after italian scientist amedeo avogadro who in 1811 first proposed that volume of a gas at a given pressure and temperature is proportional to number of atoms or molecules regardless of nature of gas name avogadro s number was coined in 1909 by physicist jean perrin who defined it as number of molecules in exactly 32 grams of oxygen goal of this definition was to make mass of a mole of a substance in grams be numerically equal to mass of one molecule relative to mass of hydrogen atom which because of law of definite proportions was natural unit of atomic mass and was assumed to be 1 16 of atomic mass of oxygen first measurements right thumb josef loschmidt value of avogadro s number still not known by that name was first obtained indirectly by josef loschmidt in 1865 by estimating number of particles in a given volume of gas this value number density n0 of particles in an ideal gas is now called loschmidt constant in his honor and is related to avogadro constant na by where p0 is pressure r is gas constant and t0 is absolute temperature because of this work symbol l is sometimes used for avogadro constant and in german literature that name may be used for both constants distinguished only by units of measurement however na should not to be confused with entirely different loschmidt constant in english language literature perrin himself determined avogadro s number by several different experimental methods he was awarded 1926 nobel prize in physics largely for this work electric charge per mole of electrons is a constant called faraday constant and had been known since 1834 when michael faraday published his works on electrolysis in 1910 robert millikan obtained first measurement of charge on an electron dividing charge on a mole of electrons by charge on a single electron provided a more accurate estimate of avogadro number si definition of 1971 in 1971 international bureau of weights and measures ibpm decided to regard amount of substance as an independent dimension of measurement with mole as its base unit in international system of units si specifically mole was defined as an amount of a substance that contains as many elementary entities as there are atoms in 0 012 kilogram of carbon 12 by this definition common rule of thumb one gram of matter contains n0 nucleons was exact for carbon 12 but slightly inexact for other elements and isotopes on other hand one mole of any substance contained exactly as many molecules as one mole of any other substance as a consequence of this definition in si system avogadro constant na had dimensionality of reciprocal of amount of substance rather than of a pure number and had approximate value with units of mol 1 by this definition value of na inherently had to be determined experimentally ibpm also named na avogadro constant but term avogadro number continued to be used especially in introductory works si redefinition of 2019 in 2017 ibpm decided to change definitions of mole and amount of substance mole was redefined as being amount of substance containing exactly elementary entities one consequence of this change is that mass of a mole of 12c atoms is no longer exactly 0 012 kg on other hand dalton universal atomic mass unit remains unchanged as 1 12 of mass of 12c thus molar mass constant is no longer exactly 1 g mol although difference in relative terms as of march 2019 is insignificant for practical purposes avogadro constant in other unit systems in other measurement systems where unit of amount of substance is not si mole avogadro constant na is taken to mean number of particles in said unit and will have a different value for example if quantities of a substance are measured in pound mole lb mol then avogadro constant na is lb mol 1 if ounce mole oz mol is used instead na is oz mol 1 however these units are hardly used nowadays connection to other constants avogadro constant na is related to other physical constants and properties it relates molar gas constant r and boltzmann constant kb which in si since 20 may 2019 is defined to be exactly it relates faraday constant f and elementary charge e which in si since 20 may 2019 is defined as exactly it relates molar mass constant mu and atomic mass constant mu currently see also mole day codata 2018 references extract in english translation by
