very modern warm and melodic and cleanly intricate in his review for bbc music paul sullivan wrote that album successfully displayed sia s vocal capabilities and versatility however he noted minimal audience participation and felt that this prevented album from capturing a live experience for sullivan highlights included don t bring me down destiny and lentil which he believed were executed with an appealing mixture of frankness and fluidity mark of gigwise com awarded album four out of five stars and opined that album portrays an artist who s star is in ascendant whose voice is unrivaled in style and expression an artist on brink of deserved and assured greater recognition selby times review called collection mesmerising and a good indicator of sia s future work one reviewer for wers called album breathtaking and wrote positively of sia s vocals and instrumentation like sullivan reviewer warned that listeners expecting a traditional live album with raw cuts and heavy improvisation might be disappointed roque strew of pitchfork media found sia s adelaide accent to be a liability specifically noting difference in pronunciation between studio versions of destiny and distractions and live performances strew complimented pictures and lentil latter of which shined through fog of elongated syllables and cut consonants popmatters mike schiller felt instrumentation was robotic and found sia s vocal manipulation and bending of vowels infuriating even unintelligible at times schiller did however favor her vocal tone and found power of her voice occasionally transcendent stuart mccaighy of this is fake diy appreciated pictures but also criticized sia s performance for lacking diversity and for incomprehensible vocals due to her slurring of words mccaighy concluded that like other live albums lady croissant was redundant but would be appreciated by fans australian publication dna published a mixed review of album in 2010 following release of we are born complimenting sia s vocals but suggesting that pictures sounded like a b side and that album s release smells like a cash in on her recent success track listing thumb right sia and zero 7 performing in 2006 henry binns
