people and left at least 4 000 more injured storm weakened to tropical storm intensity as it moved ashore baja california sur although rain was generally beneficial there succumbing to cooler waters and high wind shear greg ultimately dissipated over pacific on september 9 its remnants led to thunderstorms across northern california with only minor impacts meteorological history in mid august a tropical wave emerged off western coast of africa northern portion of wave led to formation of tropical storm emily in atlantic while southern portion of wave continued westward it crossed central america on august 31 and september 1 characterized by a large area of convection and a mid level circulation disturbance traversed southern mexico before emerging offshore where it began to interact with a broad area of low pressure that existed in eastern pacific for several days prior shower and thunderstorm activity became concentrated about a well defined center leading to formation of a tropical depression near manzanillo mexico by 12 00 utc on september 5 a portion of tropical wave also combined with monsoonal like flow across bay of campeche to form tropical depression seven in atlantic steered northwest by an anticyclone over northern mexico and a developing upper level low west of southern california nascent cyclone steadily organized over warm waters a ship about 105 mi 165 km from center reported sustained winds of 48 mph 77 km h supporting an upgrade to tropical storm greg by 18 00 utc on september 5 in spite of dissipating banding features a large mass of extremely deep convection developed near center that night radar out of los cabos indicated that an eye was in process of forming by early on september 6 and greg was upgraded to a category 1 hurricane in conjunction with satellite intensity estimates by 18 00 utc that day six hours later storm attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 75 mph 120 km h and a minimum barometric pressure of 986 mbar hpa 29 12 inhg greg maintained its status for many more hours even though outflow became restricted to northeast and low level cloud lines near storm s eye became exposed a band of convection formed northeast of greg early on september 7 inducing moderate to strong northeasterly wind shear on cyclone combined with land interaction storm weakened to tropical storm intensity by 18 00 utc that day and greg made landfall near cabo san lucas three hours later with winds of 60 mph 95 km h after turning west northwest and then west cyclone moved over progressively cooler waters and continued to lose strength although a small area of deep convection persisted greg weakened to a tropical depression by 18 00 utc on september 8 before succumbing to unfavorable environment and dissipating a day later west of baja california sur preparations impact and aftermath right thumb rainfall map following greg s formation a tropical storm warning was
