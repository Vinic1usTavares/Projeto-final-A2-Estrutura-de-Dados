mount ararat and ararat is a snow capped and dormant compound volcano in extreme east of turkey it consists of two major volcanic cones greater ararat and little ararat greater ararat is highest peak in turkey and armenian highland with an elevation of little ararat s elevation is ararat massif is about wide at ground base first efforts to reach ararat s summit were made in middle ages and friedrich parrot khachatur abovian and four others made first recorded ascent in 1829 mountain has been called by name ararat since middle ages as it began to be identified with mountains of ararat described in bible as resting place of noah s ark despite contention that does not refer specifically to a mt ararat it is principal national symbol of armenia and has been considered a sacred mountain by armenians it is featured prominently in armenian literature and art and is an icon for armenian irredentism it is depicted on coat of arms of armenia along with noah s ark political borders mount ararat forms a near quadripoint between turkey armenia azerbaijan and iran its summit is located some west of both iranian border and border of nakhchivan exclave of azerbaijan and south of armenian border turkish armenian azerbaijani and turkish iranian azerbaijani are some 8 km apart separated by a narrow strip of turkish territory containing road which enters nakhchivan at from 16th century until 1828 range was part of ottoman persian border great ararat s summit and northern slopes along with eastern slopes of little ararat were controlled by persia following 1826 28 russo persian war and treaty of turkmenchay persian controlled territory was ceded to russian empire little ararat became point where turkish persian and russian imperial frontiers converged current international boundaries were formed throughout 20th century mountain came under turkish control during 1920 turkish armenian war it formally became part of turkey according to 1921 treaty of moscow and treaty of kars in late 1920s turkey crossed iranian border and occupied eastern flank of lesser ararat as part of its effort to quash kurdish ararat rebellion during which kurdish rebels used area as a safe haven against turkish state iran eventually agreed to cede area to turkey in a territorial exchange iran turkey boundary skirts east of lesser ararat lower peak of ararat massif mountain is open to climbers only with military permission procedure to obtain permission involves submitting a formal request to a turkish embassy for a special ararat visa and it is mandatory to hire an official guide from turkish federation for alpinism access is still limited even for climbers who obtain necessary permission and those who venture off approved path may be fired upon without warning

of hebrew spelling view online of name urartu a kingdom that existed in armenian highlands in 9th 6th centuries bc german orientalist and bible critic wilhelm speculated that word ararat came from sanskrit word meaning holy ground some armenian historians such as ashot link origin of word ararat to root of endonym of indigenous peoples of armenian highland ar including armenians mountain is known as ararat in european languages however none of native peoples have traditionally referred to mountain by that name in classical antiquity particularly in strabo s geographica peaks of ararat were known in ancient greek as abos abos and nibaros nibaros this mountain was not called by name ararat until middle ages early armenian historians has considered ararat to be in area of traditional armenian name is masis masis sometimes massis however nowadays terms masis and ararat are both widely often interchangeably used in armenian folk etymology expressed in movses khorenatsi s history of armenia derives name from king great grandson of legendary armenian patriarch hayk who is said to have called mountain masis after himself according to russian orientalist anatoly word masis derives from middle persian largest according to armenian historian sargis petrosyan mas root in masis means mountain cf proto indo european mns according to archaeologist armen petrosyan it originates from masu mashu mountain mentioned in epic of gilgamesh which sounded masu in assyrian turkish name is agri dagi dag i e mountain of agri agri literally translates to pain or sorrow this name has been known since late middle ages greater and lesser ararat are known as agri and kucuk agri respectively traditional persian name is literally mountain of noah kurdish name of mountain is which translates to fiery mountain geography mount ararat is located in eastern anatolia region of turkey between provinces of agri and igdir near border with iran armenia and nakhchivan exclave of azerbaijan between aras and murat rivers agri mount ararat republic of turkey ministry of culture and tourism kultur gov tr 2005 its summit is located some west of turkey iran border and south of turco armenian border ararat plain runs along its northwest to western side elevation ararat is third most prominent mountain in west asia an elevation of for mount ararat is given by some encyclopedias and reference works such as merriam webster s geographical dictionary and encyclopedia of world geography however a number of sources such as united states geological survey and numerous topographic maps indicate that alternatively widespread figure of is probably more accurate current elevation may be as low as due to melting of its snow covered ice cap according to petter e head of informatics department at university of bergen norway 300px thumb right mount ararat 3d summit ice cap ice cap on summit of mount ararat has been shrinking since at least 1957 in late 1950s blumenthal observed that there existed 11 outlet glaciers emerging from a summit snow mass that covered about at that time it was found that present glaciers on summit of ararat extend as low as an elevation of on north facing slope and an elevation of on its south facing slope using pre existing aerial imagery and remote sensing data and others studied extent of ice cap on mount ararat between 1976 and 2011 they discovered that this ice cap had shrunk to by 1976 and to by 2011 they calculated that between 1976 and 2011 ice cap on top of mount ararat had lost 29 of its total area at an average rate of ice loss of per year over 35 years this rate is consistent with general rates of retreat of other turkish summit glaciers and ice caps that have been documented by other studies blumenthal estimated that snow line had been as low as in elevation during late pleistocene such a snow line would have created an ice cap of in extent however he observed a lack of any clear evidence of prehistoric moraines other than those which were close to 1958 glacier tongues blumenthal explained absence of such moraines by lack of confining ridges to control glaciers insufficient debris load in ice to form moraines and their burial by later eruptions years later observed on south facing slopes a possible moraine that extends at least in altitude below base of 1958 ice cap at an elevation of he also found two deposits that were created by a mount ararat valley glacier of pleistocene possibly wisconsinan last glacial maximum age downvalley from lake balik higher moraine lies at an altitude of about and lower moraine lies at an altitude of about lower moraine occurs about downstream from lake balik both moraines are about high it is suspected that lake balik occupies a glacial basin geology mount ararat is a polygenic compound stratovolcano covering an area of it is largest volcanic edifice within region along its northwest southeast trending long axis mount ararat is about long and is about long along its short axis it consists of about of dacitic and rhyolitic pyroclastic debris and dacitic rhyolitic and basaltic lavas mount ararat consists of two distinct volcanic cones greater ararat and lesser ararat little ararat western volcanic cone greater ararat is a steep sided volcanic cone that is larger and higher than eastern volcanic cone greater ararat is about wide at base and rises about above adjacent floors of igdir and dogubeyazit basins eastern volcanic cone lesser ararat is high and across these volcanic cones which lie apart are separated by a wide north south trending crack this crack is surface expression of an extensional fault numerous parasitic cones and lava domes have been built by flank eruptions along this fault and on flanks of both of main volcanic cones mount ararat lies within a complex sinistral pull apart basin that originally was a single continuous depression growth of mount ararat partitioned this depression into two smaller basins igdir and dogubeyazit basins this pull apart basin is result of strike slip movement along two en echelon fault segments dogubeyazit and igdir faults of a sinistral strike slip fault system tension between these faults not only formed original pull apart basin but created a system of faults exhibiting a horsetail splay pattern that control position of principal volcanic eruption centers of mount ararat and associated linear belt of parasitic volcanic cones strike slip fault system within which mount ararat is located is result of north south convergence and tectonic compression between arabian platform and laurasia that continued after tethys ocean closed during eocene epoch along bitlis zagros suture geological history thumb right paleogeography of early oligocene thumb right tectonic map of mediterranean and surrounding mountain ranges during early eocene and early miocene collision of arabian platform with laurasia closed and eliminated tethys ocean from area of what is now anatolia closure of these masses of continental crust collapsed this ocean basin by middle eocene and resulted in a progressive of remnant seas until end of early miocene post collisional tectonic convergence within collision zone resulted in total elimination of remaining seas from east anatolia at end of early miocene crustal shortening and thickening across collision zone and uplift of east anatolian iranian plateau accompanying this uplift was extensive deformation by faulting and folding which resulted in creation of numerous local basins north south compressional deformation continues today as evidenced by ongoing faulting volcanism and seismicity within anatolia regional volcanism started in middle late miocene during late miocene pliocene period widespread volcanism blanketed entire east anatolian iranian plateau under thick volcanic rocks this volcanic activity has continued uninterrupted until historical times apparently it reached a climax during latest miocene pliocene 6 to 3 ma during quaternary volcanism became restricted to a few local volcanoes such as mount ararat these volcanoes are typically associated with north south tensional fractures formed by continuing north south shortening deformation of anatolia in their detailed study and summary of quaternary volcanism of anatolia et al recognized four phases to construction of mount ararat from volcanic rocks exposed in glacial valleys deeply carved into its flanks first they recognized a fissure eruption phase of plinian subplinian fissure eruptions that deposited more than of pyroclastic rocks and a few basaltic lava flows these volcanic rocks were erupted from approximately north northwest south southeast trending extensional faults and fissures prior to development of mount ararat second a cone building phase began when volcanic activity became localized at a point along a fissure during this phase eruption of successive flows of lava up to thick and pyroclastic flows of andesite and dacite composition and later eruption of basaltic lava flows formed greater ararat cone with a low conical profile third during a climatic phase copious flows of andesitic and basaltic lavas were erupted during this phase current cones of greater and lesser ararat were formed as eruptions along subsidiary fissures and cracks and flank occurred finally volcanic eruptions at mount ararat transitioned into a flank eruption phase during which a major north south trending fault offset two cones that developed along with a number of subsidiary fissures and cracks on volcano s flanks along this fault and subsidiary fissures and cracks a number of parasitic cones and domes were built by minor eruptions one subsidiary cone erupted voluminous basalt and andesite lava flows they flowed across dogubeyazit plain and along southerly flowing river these lava flows formed black a a and pahoehoe lava flows that contain well preserved lava tubes radiometric dating of these lava flows yielded radiometric ages of 0 4 0 48 and 0 81 ma overall radiometric ages obtained from volcanic rocks erupted by mount ararat range from 1 5 to 0 02 ma recent volcanic and seismic activity chronology of holocene volcanic activity associated with mount ararat is documented by either archaeological excavations oral history historical records or a combination of these data which provide evidence that volcanic eruptions of mount ararat occurred in 2500 2400 bc 550 bc possibly in 1450 ad and 1783 ad and definitely in 1840 ad archaeological evidence demonstrates that explosive eruptions and pyroclastic flows from northwest flank of mount ararat destroyed and buried at least one kura araxes culture settlement and caused numerous fatalities in 2500 2400 bc oral histories indicated that a significant eruption of uncertain magnitude occurred in 550 bc and minor eruptions of uncertain nature might have occurred in 1450 ad and 1783 ad according to interpretation of historical and archaeological data strong earthquakes not associated with volcanic eruptions also occurred area of mount ararat in 139 368 851 893 and 1319 ad during 139 ad earthquake a large landslide that caused many casualties and was similar to 1840 ad landslide originated from summit of mount ararat 1840 eruption a phreatic eruption occurred on mount ararat on july 2 1840 and pyroclastic flow from radial fissures on upper north flank of mountain and a possibly associated earthquake of magnitude 7 4 that caused severe damage and numerous casualties up to 10 000 people in region died in earthquake including 1 900 villagers in village of akhuri armenian akori modern who were killed by a gigantic landslide and subsequent debris flow in addition this combination of landslide and debris flow destroyed armenian monastery of st jacob near akori town of several villages and russian military barracks it also temporarily dammed metsamor river ascents 13th century missionary william of rubruck wrote that many have tried to climb it but none has been able armenian attitudes armenian apostolic church was historically opposed to ascents of ararat on religious grounds thomas stackhouse an 18th century english theologian noted that all armenians are firmly persuaded that noah s ark exists to present day on summit of mount ararat and that in order to preserve it no person is permitted to approach it in response to its first ascent by parrot and abovian one high ranking armenian apostolic church clergyman commented that to climb sacred mountain was to tie womb of mother of all mankind in a mode by contrast in 21st century to climb ararat is most highly valued goal of some of patriotic pilgrimages that are organized in growing number from armenia and armenian diaspora first ascent first recorded ascent of mountain in modern times took place on baltic german naturalist friedrich parrot of university of dorpat arrived at etchmiadzin in mid september 1829 almost two years after russian capture of erivan for sole purpose of exploring ararat prominent armenian writer khachatur abovian then a deacon and translator at etchmiadzin was assigned by catholicos head of armenian church as interpreter and guide parrot and abovian crossed aras river into district of and headed to armenian village of akhuri on northern slope of ararat above sea level they set up a base camp at armenian monastery of st hakob some higher at an elevation of after two failed attempts they reached summit on their third attempt at 3 15 p m on october 9 1829 group included parrot abovian two russian soldiers aleksei and matvei and two armenian akhuri villagers hovhannes aivazian and murad parrot measured elevation at using a mercury barometer this was not only first recorded ascent of ararat but also second highest elevation climbed by man up to that date outside of mount licancabur in chilean andes abovian dug a hole in ice and erected a wooden cross facing north abovian also picked up a chunk of ice from summit and carried it down with him in a bottle considering water holy on parrot and abovian together with akhuri hunter s brother acting as a guide climbed up lesser ararat later notable ascents other early notable climbers of ararat included russian climatologist and meteorologist spassky august 1834 karl behrens 1835 german mineralogist and geologist otto wilhelm hermann von 29 july 1845 and british politician henry danby seymour 1848 later in 19th century two british politicians and scholars james bryce 1876 and h f b lynch 1893 climbed mountain first winter climb was by turkish alpinist former president of turkish mountaineering federation who climbed peak on 21 february 1970 resting place of noah s ark thumb topography of paradise by german jesuit scholar athanasius kircher from his 1675 book arca noe in northeast in mountains above armenia stands mount ararat shown with a rectangular shaped ark on summit origin of tradition noah s ark landed on mountains of ararat biblical hare ararat according to many historians and bible scholars agree that ararat is hebrew name of urartu geographical predecessor of armenia they argue that word referred to wider region at time and not specifically to mt ararat phrase is translated as mountains of armenia montes in vulgate fourth century latin translation of bible nevertheless mount ararat is traditionally considered resting place of noah s ark it is called a biblical mountain mount ararat has been associated with genesis account since 11th century and armenians began to identify it as ark s landing place during that time f c conybeare wrote that mountain was a center and focus of pagan myths and cults and it was only in eleventh century after these had vanished from popular mind that armenian theologians ventured to locate on its eternal snows resting place of noah s ark franciscan missionary william of rubruck is usually considered earliest reference for tradition of mount ararat as landing place of ark in european literature english traveler john mandeville is another early author who mentioned mount ararat where noah s ship rested and it is still there prevalence of tradition thumb descent of noah from ararat by ivan aivazovsky 1889 national gallery of armenia depicts noah with his family and a procession of animals crossing ararat plain following their descent from mount ararat which is seen in background most christians identify mount ararat with biblical mountains of ararat largely because it would have been first peak to emerge from receding flood waters and it is where most of western christianity place landing of noah s ark a 1722 biblical dictionary by austin calmet and 1871 jamieson brown bible commentary both point to mount ararat as place where ark rested original title dictionnaire historique critique geographique et literal de la bible english translation view genesis 8 4 commentary online american missionary h g o dwight wrote in 1856 that it is general opinion of learned in europe that ark landed on mt ararat james bryce wrote that ark rested upon a mountain in district which hebrews knew as ararat or armenia in an 1878 article for royal geographical society and he added that biblical writer must have had mt ararat in mind because it is so very much higher more conspicuous and more majestic than any other summit in armenia pope john paul ii declared in his homily in yerevan s st gregory illuminator cathedral we are close to mount ararat where tradition says that ark of noah came to rest patriarch kirill of moscow head of russian orthodox church also mentioned mount ararat as resting place of noah s ark in his speech at etchmiadzin cathedral during his visit to armenia in 2010 those critical of this view point out that ararat was name of country at time when genesis was written not specifically mountain arnold wrote in his 2008 genesis commentary location on mountains of ararat indicates not a specific mountain by that name but rather mountainous region of land of ararat searches ararat has traditionally been main focus of searches for noah s ark augustin calmet wrote in his 1722 biblical dictionary it is affirmed but without proof that there are still remains of noah s ark on top of this mountain but m de tournefort who visited this spot has assured us there was nothing like it that top of mount ararat is inaccessible both by reason of its great height and of snow which perpetually covers it archaeological expeditions sometimes supported by evangelical and millenarian churches have been conducted since 19th century in search of ark according to a 1974 book around 200 people from more than 20 countries claimed to have seen ark on ararat since 1856 a fragment from ark supposedly found on ararat is on display at museum of etchmiadzin cathedral center of armenian church despite numerous reports of ark sightings e g ararat anomaly and rumors no scientific evidence of ark has emerged searches for noah s ark are considered by scholars an example of kenneth feder writes as flood story itself is unsupported by any archaeological evidence it is not surprising that there is no archaeological evidence for existence of an impossibly large boat dating to 5 000 years ago significance for armenians symbolism thumb ararat located some south of city dominates skyline of armenia s capital yerevan thumb hayk legendary founding father of armenian people as depicted by 1779 1846 ararat is pictured in background despite lying outside borders of modern armenia ararat has historically been associated with armenia it is widely considered country s principal national symbol and brand image of ararat usually framed within a nationalizing discourse is ubiquitous in everyday material culture in armenia according to ethnographer armenians have a sense of possession of ararat in sense of symbolic cultural property ararat is known as holy mountain of armenian people on russian wikisource it was principal to pre christian armenian mythology where it was home of gods with rise of christianity mythology associated with pagan worship of mountain was lost ararat was geographical center of ancient armenian kingdoms one scholar defined historic greater armenia armenia major as area about 200 miles 320 km in every direction from mount ararat in 19th century era of romantic nationalism when an armenian state did not exist mt ararat symbolized historical armenian nation state in 1861 armenian poet mikael nalbandian witnessing italian unification wrote to in a letter from naples etna and vesuvius are still smoking is there no fire left in old volcano of ararat myth of origin genesis flood narrative was linked to armenian myth of origin by early medieval historian movses khorenatsi in his history of armenia he wrote that noah and his family first settled in armenia and later moved to babylon hayk a descendant of a son of noah revolted against bel biblical nimrod and returned to area around mount ararat where he established roots of armenian nation he is thus considered legendary founding father and name giver of armenian people according to panossian this legend makes armenia cradle of all civilisation since noah s ark landed on armenian mountain of ararat it connects armenians to biblical narrative of human development it makes mount ararat national symbol of all armenians and territory around it armenian homeland from time immemorial coat of arms of armenia mount ararat has been depicted on coat of arms of armenia consistently since 1918 first republic s coat of arms was designed by architect alexander and painter hakob kojoyan this coat of arms was readopted by legislature of republic of armenia on april 19 1992 after armenia regained independence ararat is depicted along with ark on its peak on shield on an orange background emblem of armenian soviet socialist republic soviet armenia was created by painters martiros saryan and hakob kojoyan in 1921 mount ararat is depicted in center and makes up a large portion of it symbol of genocide and territorial claims in aftermath of armenian genocide of 1915 ararat came to represent destruction of native armenian population of eastern turkey western armenia in national consciousness of armenians ari l goldman noted in 1988 in most armenian homes in modern diaspora there are pictures of mount ararat a bittersweet reminder of homeland and national aspirations ararat has become a symbol of armenian efforts to reclaim its lost lands i e areas west of ararat that are now part of turkey that had significant armenian population before genocide noted that ararat is featured as a sanctified territory for armenians in everyday banal irredentism stephanie platz wrote omnipresent vision of ararat rising above yerevan and its outskirts constantly reminds armenians of their putative ethnogenesis and of their exile from eastern anatolia after armenian genocide of 1915 thumb lebanese armenians protesting turkish prime minister erdogan s visit to beirut in november 2010 poster reads ararat is and remains armenian turkish political scientist bayram argues that regular references to armenian genocide and mount ararat clearly indicate that border with turkey is contested in armenia since independence from soviet union in 1991 armenian government has not made official claims to any turkish territory however armenian government has avoided an explicit and formal recognition of existing turkish armenian border in a 2010 interview with der spiegel armenian president serzh sargsyan was asked whether armenia wants mount ararat back sargsyan in response said that no one can take mount ararat from us we keep it in our hearts wherever armenians live in world today you will find a picture of mount ararat in their homes and i feel certain that a time will come when mount ararat is no longer a symbol of separation between our peoples but an emblem of understanding but let me make this clear never has a representative of armenia made territorial demands turkey alleges this perhaps out of its own bad conscience most prominent party to lay claims to eastern turkey is nationalist armenian revolutionary federation dashnaktsutyun which claims it as part of what it considers united armenia in various settings several notable individuals such as german historian tessa hofmann slovak conservative politician frantisek lithuanian political scientist and soviet dissident have spoken in support of armenian claims over mt ararat
