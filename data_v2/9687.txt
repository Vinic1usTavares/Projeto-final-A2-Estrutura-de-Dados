history of australian capital territory act as a separate administrative division began in 1911 when it was transferred from new south wales to australian federal government territory contains australia s capital city canberra and various smaller settlements until 1989 it also administered jervis bay territory a small coastal region indigenous australians have lived in present day act for at least 20 000 years area formed traditional lands of ngambri people and several other linguistic groups it was incorporated into colony of new south wales with british settlement in 1788 but no white person reached area until joseph wild in 1820 in 1824 joshua moore built a homestead named canberry whose name was derived from a local aboriginal language its meaning is disputed further homesteads and stations were established over course of 19th century these were initially large properties used for sheep and cattle grazing but they were later broken up and subdivided into smaller farms and urban settlements oldest gazetted settlement in act is tharwa which was proclaimed in 1862 constitution of australia which took effect on 1 january 1901 provided that a new national capital should be built at a site determined by federal parliament it had to be within state of new south wales but at least away from sydney seat of government act 1908 fixed canberra as site of new capital and surrounding region was formally ceded to federal government on 1 january 1911 it was originally known as federal capital territory adopting its current name in 1938 american architect walter burley griffin won competition to design new city and was appointed to oversee its construction he was dogged by disputes with government and onset of world war i and was fired in 1921 multiple planning bodies were established but achieved little in part due to great depression parliament moved to canberra in 1927 although government offices were slow to follow growth of canberra and act was slow with potential residents discouraged by cold climate and lack of facilities development accelerated after world war ii championed by prime minister robert menzies who regarded state of capital as an embarrassment national capital development commission was created in 1957 with more power than its predecessors it ended four decades of disputes over shape and design of lake burley griffin centrepiece of canberra with construction completed in 1964 this prompted development of parliamentary triangle a core part of griffin s design and followed various buildings of national importance were constructed on lakefront on average population of canberra increased by more than 50 every five years between 1955 and 1975 more residential land was released through creation of new town centres in 1960s and 1970s an elective advisory council was created for act in 1930 it was replaced by a house of assembly in 1974 full self government was granted in 1988 with legislative assembly electing chief minister of australian capital territory to serve as territory s head of government assembly has most of powers and responsibilities of state governments but its actions are subject to a federal

sites are known across territory including shelters rock art sites stone artefact scatters scarred trees and chert quarries tidbinbilla mountain is believed to have long been used for aboriginal initiation ceremonies 19th century exploration following european settlement growth of new colony of new south wales led to an increasing demand for arable land governor lachlan macquarie supported expeditions to open up new lands to south of capital sydney including one to find an overland route to jervis bay an area which would later be incorporated into act as its only coastal possession in 1818 charles throsby hamilton hume james meehan and william kearns set out to find route a task accomplished that same year by throsby and kearns 1820s saw further exploration in canberra area associated with construction of a road from sydney to goulburn plains supervised by throsby and his overseer joseph wild while working on project throsby learned of a nearby lake and river from local aborigines and he accordingly sent wild to lead a small party to investigate site on 1820 wild ventured off from his two companions and later that day arrived at north shore of what is now known as lake george in governor macquarie visited site and while he was in attendance throsby decided to push on to reach river of which he had been informed accompanied by wild and james vaughan he journeyed south in search of murrumbidgee search was unsuccessful but they did discover yass river and it is surmised that they would have set foot on part of future act a second expedition was mounted shortly thereafter and throsby s nephew charles throsby smith wild and vaughan further explored molonglo ngambri and queanbeyan rivers becoming first europeans to camp at site however they failed to find murrumbidgee and smith declared that river did not exist issue of murrumbidgee was solved in 1821 when charles throsby mounted a third expedition and successfully reached watercourse on way providing first detailed account of land where canberra now resides next significant expedition to region came in 1823 when wild was employed by brigade major john ovens and captain mark currie to guide them to murrumbidgee they travelled south along river and named area now known as tuggeranong isabella s plain after isabella maria brisbane 1821 1849 two year old daughter of thomas brisbane then governor of

aboriginal people and he was driven back out of mountains rush of prospectors into kiandra area through brindabellas and mountains to west of act as a result of kiandra led to conflict with aboriginal people by time franklin returned to brindabellas in 1863 indigenous population had been significantly reduced over succeeding years ngunnawal and other local indigenous people effectively ceased to exist as cohesive and independent communities adhering to their traditional ways of life those who had not succumbed to disease and other predations either dispersed to local settlements or were relocated to more distant aboriginal reserves set up by new south wales government in latter part of 19th century children of mixed european aboriginal families were generally expected to assimilate

capital began with debates over federation during 19th century prior to 1840 sydney was administrative centre for colony and thus it could be presupposed that any potential federal government would be seated there however this started to change when buoyed by victorian gold rush melbourne grew rapidly and by 1860 its population had overtaken that of sydney discovery of gold also helped to increase melbourne s financial base to point where at one stage nearly 5 of all british imperial government revenue passed through melbourne s port thus melbourne soon possessed both size and economic clout to rival sydney and to command additional administrative powers thumb left alt three middle aged men with short beards in formal suits and hats standing in open hilly field with single tree nearby

ground nominating town of albury as a location albury was located in new south wales yet its position on murray river placed it on border between new south wales and victoria in 1898 a referendum on a proposed constitution was held in four of colonies new south wales victoria south australia and tasmania although referendum achieved a majority in all four colonies new south wales referendum failed to gain minimum number of votes needed for bill to pass following this result a meeting of four premiers in 1898 heard from george reid premier of new south wales who argued that locating future capital in new south wales would be sufficient to ensure passage of bill this was accepted by other three premiers and proposed australian constitution was modified so that section 125 specified that national capital must be within state of new south wales however they also added condition that it must be situated no less than from sydney in addition if bill passed melbourne would be interim seat of government but not referred to as capital until a location for new capital had been determined 1899 referendum on this revised bill was successful passing with sufficient numbers thumb 400px alt australian capital territory is approximately 250 kilometres southwest of sydney surrounded by new south wales jervis bay territory is about 125 kilometres east of act on coast location of act and

bombala orange and yass were soon added nsw premier john see offered to provide any of three recommended sites as a future capital territory edmund barton first prime minister of new federal government added another four sites to this list albury tamworth armidale and tumut and members of new government toured various sites in 1902 tour proved inconclusive and upon their return members decided to refer problem to a royal commission with minister for home affairs william lyne pushing for tumut or albury as he preferred a site in his electorate subsequently commission presented its report to parliament in 1903 recommending sites of albury tumut and orange in that order however there continued to be problems as house of representatives backed tumut option while senate preferred town of bombala as a result of this disagreement bill lapsed and it was left to second parliament to choose a location for capital new parliament met in 1904 and reached a compromise choosing dalgety which like bombala was located in monaro region thus with passage of seat of government act 1904 it appeared that matter had been settled however while federal parliament supported dalgety new south

sufficient land but on condition that it was in yass canberra region this site being closer to sydney following a tour of region by several senators and members of commonwealth parliament in 1908 a new ballot was called in federal parliament with eleven sites nominated initially dalgety remained at forefront but by eighth round yass canberra had emerged as a new leader and site was confirmed in ninth round of voting thus was passed new seat of government act 1908 which repealed 1904 act and specified a capital in yass canberra region government surveyor charles scrivener was deployed to

landowners and residents of queanbeyan looked favourably on possibility of having territory located nearby such a result it was hoped would bring improvements to local infrastructure increase demand for local goods and services and raise land values it was assumed that existing freehold arrangements would remain and that those whose land was not required for city itself would be in a position to capitalise on new circumstances such was not case legislation restricted land holdings in new territory to leasehold rather than freehold this was intended to avoid land speculation and give national government as lessor greater control over development landowners were concerned that legislation had a number of shortcomings land valuations were fixed to date when act passed 1908 there was no compensation for improvements made to land and owners were not given first right of refusal when their old land was offered for lease along with loss of their land local residents discovered that they had been disenfranchised now a part of act they had lost their vote in new south wales government and their numbers were too small to warrant a seat in new federal parliament as a result they had no representation in parliament through which to argue against provisions of legislation in response residents formed vigilance association with intent of protecting their interests during establishment of new capital territory legal challenges to resumption of land were unsuccessful but vigilance association did win some concessions government agreed to pay for improvements to land and did so at

held which was won by chicago architect walter burley griffin in 1912 griffin s proposal rendered by his architect wife marion mahony griffin had an abundance of geometric patterns incorporated concentric hexagonal and octagonal streets emanating from several centres it had as its centrepiece an elaborate lake composed of smaller bodies of water with extensive natural vegetation around it

their orientation was related to various natural topographical landmarks lake burley griffin canberra policy plan p 3 it was further intended that buildings of national significance and natural landmarks would align with these geometric axes later scrivener as part of a government committee was responsible for modifying griffin s winning design he recommended a less elaborate and geometric shape which griffin opposed saying that geometry was one of raison d etre of ornamental waters but he was overruled new design was widely criticised as being ugly official naming of canberra occurred on 1913 and construction began immediately after official indecision over plan revisions and their implementation griffin was invited to canberra to discuss matter he arrived in and was appointed federal capital director of design and construction for three years bureaucratic wrangling delayed griffin s work a royal commission in 1916 ruled his authority for executing plan had been usurped by certain officials griffin had a strained working relationship with australian authorities and a lack of federal government funding meant that by time he left in 1920 little significant work had been

were constructed during this period of ncpdc responsibility such as australian war memorial which opened in 1941 with onset of great depression followed by world war ii development of new capital was slow and in decade after end of war canberra was criticised for resembling a village and its disorganised collection of buildings was deemed ugly canberra was often derisively described as several suburbs in search of a city prime minister robert menzies regarded state of national capital as an embarrassment over time his attitude changed from one of contempt to that of championing its development he fired two ministers charged with development of city feeling that their performance lacked intensity menzies ruled for over a decade and in that time development of capital sped up

as significant step towards self government but whitlam government under whose auspices assembly was formed tended to override or ignore its wishes similarly subsequent 1975 fraser government seemed uninterested in assembly however in february 1975 tony staley accepted post of minister for capital territory staley had been a supporter of self government for act and he proposed a model whereby canberrans would rapidly gain control of much of territory s administration model found opposition though in part because it failed to adequately address funding arrangements although staley s plan did not eventuate next person to run ministry robert ellicott chose to hold a referendum on issue referendum on 27 november 1978 provided residents of territory with three options that self government be granted to territory by delegating functions to a locally elected legislative body that a locally elected legislative body be established in territory with local government type legislative and executive functions that present arrangements for governing territory should continue for time being a clear majority voted for continuing with status quo 63 75 as opposed to 5 72 in favour of local government model and 30 54 supporting state style self government approach overall identified a number of reasons why residents opposed self government along with previously mentioned fear of increases in taxation or decreases in services he argued that those living in act would have felt that they already had a voice in governance of territory through federal electoral representation canberra also had a high proportion of public servants who felt that they were already a part of government and knew how to work with system in spite of result referendum failed to end debate there were a number of pressures that continued to push act towards self government including national consistency of governance in 1978 northern territory achieved self government act was only other mainland territory with a population greater than that of northern territory that was growing faster so it was suggested that if self government was appropriate for northern territory then it must also be appropriate for act re enfranchisement of community two inquiries had recommended that act needed to provide community with same sort of representative institutions that have been established in other parts of australia financial pressures act had enjoyed high quality services through federal government funding to extent that federal grants commission report that australia was subsidising residents to tune of over 200 for every man woman and child in territory self government would allow act to be placed on same financial footing as that of other states and northern territory this was identified by bill harris head of act administration just prior to self government as fundamental reason for eventual realisation of self government in territory in 1988 new minister for act gary punch received a report recommending abolition of ncdc and formation of a locally elected government punch recommended that hawke government accept report s recommendations and subsequently clyde holding introduced legislation to grant self government to territory in october 1988 self government enactment on 6 december 1988 of australian capital territory self government act 1988 established
