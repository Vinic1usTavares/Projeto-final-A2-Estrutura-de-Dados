second half but did not like beginning school library journal s lori henderson reviewed an ideal world positively she praised wizard of oz feel ending and message that a you controls his life and he has power to change it henderson called characters great and world fantastic also noting that cartoonish and exaggerated artwork worked with story however she remarked that beginning of an ideal world was slow and plodding and could leave you wondering if it s ever going to go anywhere another school library journal critic joanna felt that lessons and themes were unimaginative which made artwork a waste of visual whimsy sam kusek of shock also reviewed an ideal world positively grading it as a b kusek applauded artwork saying that colors really jump out and set mood of scene well while keeping backgrounds alive and that character designs enhance mystical and magical elements of story kusek liked plot but felt it was predictable however he noted that main element and focus was philosophy of life and that overall an ideal world flows really well writing for comics worth reading ed sizemore gave book a mixed review sizemore wrote that he wished message was conveyed more subtly and criticized beginning of book as toughest to get through but felt pace and readability improve afterwards he praised art as gorgeous with lots of eye candy for those who enjoy fantasy artwork overall sizemore thought an ideal world was wasted potential with too much emphasis placed on message detracting from storytelling publishers weekly praised an ideal world for its message and art but criticized how book gets bogged down in talky heavy handedness as if someone put nice fantasy illustrations into a business self help book r bezard a french critic for bd gest rated first volume of
