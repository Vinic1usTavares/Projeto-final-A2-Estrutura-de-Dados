1934 serving as chief of staff of wehrkreiskommando iii on 1 july 1935 he was appointed head of operations branch of army general staff generalstab des heeres part of army high command oberkommando des heeres okh during his tenure there manstein was one of people responsible for development of fall rot case red a defensive plan to protect germany from attack by france during this period manstein came into contact with heinz guderian and oswald lutz who advocated drastic changes in warfare emphasising role of panzer however officers like ludwig beck chief of army general staff were against such drastic changes and therefore manstein proposed an alternative development of stug self propelled assault guns that would provide heavy direct fire support to infantry in world war ii resulting stug vehicles proved to be among most successful and cost effective german weapons he was promoted to generalmajor in october 1936 becoming deputy chief of staff i to general beck on 4 february 1938 manstein was transferred to command of 18th infantry division in liegnitz silesia with rank of generalleutnant transfer meant that manstein did not receive beck s post as chief of army general staff that august beck had resigned in spite of manstein s urgings not to do so as he felt hitler s intended invasion of czechoslovakia that october would be premature position was given to general franz halder who had taken manstein s former post as deputy chief of staff incident created a lasting hatred between two men on 20 april 1939 manstein delivered a speech at celebration of hitler s 50th birthday in which he praised hitler as a leader sent by god to save germany he warned hostile world that if it kept erecting ramparts around germany to block way of german people towards their future then he would be quite happy to see world plunged into another world war israeli historian omer bartov notes that rise of officers such as manstein was part of a tendency for technocratic officers usually ardent national socialists to come to fore his opinion is that wehrmacht was fully integrated into third reich not a separate apolitical organisation independent of nazi regime second world war invasion of poland on 18 august 1939 in preparation for fall weiss case white german invasion of poland manstein was appointed chief of staff to gerd von rundstedt s army group south here he worked along with rundstedt s chief of operations colonel gunther blumentritt to develop operational plan rundstedt accepted manstein s plan calling for concentration of majority of army group s armoured units into walther von reichenau s 10th army with objective of a decisive breakthrough which would lead to encirclement of polish forces west of river vistula in manstein s plan two other armies comprising army group south wilhelm list s 14th army and johannes blaskowitz s 8th army would provide flank support for reichenau s armoured thrust towards warsaw polish capital privately manstein was lukewarm about polish campaign thinking that it would be better to keep poland as a buffer between germany and soviet union he also worried about an allied attack from west once polish campaign was underway which would draw germany into a two front war manstein took part in a conference on 22 august 1939 where hitler underlined to his commanders need for physical destruction of poland as a nation after war he would state in his memoirs that he did not recognise at time of this meeting that hitler was going to pursue a policy of extermination against poles he did become aware of policy later on as he and other wehrmacht generals received reports on activities of einsatzgruppen schutzstaffel ss death squads tasked with following army into poland to kill intellectuals and other civilians these squads were also assigned to round up jews and others for relocation to ghettos and nazi concentration camps manstein later faced three charges of war crimes relating to jewish and civilian deaths in sectors under his control and mistreatment and deaths of prisoners of war launched on 1 september 1939 invasion began successfully in army group south s area of responsibility under rundstedt 8th 10th and 14th armies pursued retreating poles initial plan was for 8th army northernmost of three to advance towards lodz 10th army with its motorised divisions was to move quickly towards vistula and 14th army was to advance and attempt to encircle polish troops in krakow area these actions led to encirclement and defeat of polish forces in radom area on 8 14 september by six german corps meanwhile german eighth army was under attack from north so elements of fourth eighth and tenth armies were quickly redeployed with air support in an improvised attempt to cut off any polish break out back towards warsaw flexibility and agility of german forces led to defeat of nine polish infantry divisions and other units in resulting battle of bzura 8 19 september largest engagement of war thus far conquest of poland was quickly over with last polish military units surrendering on 6 october offensive in west thumb evolution of german plans for fall gelb invasion of low countries series begins at left upper corner fall gelb case yellow initial plan for invasion of france was prepared by commander in chief of army colonel general generaloberst walther von brauchitsch halder and other members of okh in early october 1939 like schlieffen plan of world war i it called for an encirclement attack through netherlands and belgium hitler was not satisfied so revisions of plan continued throughout october manstein was not satisfied with plan either as it focused heavily on northern wing he felt an attack from this direction would lack element of surprise and would expose german forces to counterattacks from south terrain in belgium was not well suited as a base of operations for further attacks on france so manstein felt operation would fail to wipe out enemy as it did in first world war leading to only partial success and trench warfare by end of october manstein had prepared outline of a different plan and submitted it to okh via his superior rundstedt for whom he was now serving as chief of staff of army group a manstein s plan developed with informal co operation of heinz guderian suggested that panzer divisions attack through wooded hills of ardennes where no one would expect them then establish bridgeheads on river meuse and rapidly drive to english channel wehrmacht would thus cut off french and allied armies in belgium and flanders this part of plan later became known as sichelschnitt sickle cut manstein s proposal also included a second thrust outflanking maginot line which would allow wehrmacht to force any future defensive line much further south okh originally rejected proposal halder in particular said plan was entirely without merit however on 11 november hitler ordered reallocation of forces needed to make a surprise thrust in sedan thus pushing plan in direction that manstein had suggested when documents outlining details of fall gelb fell into hands of belgians on 10 january 1940 hitler became even more receptive to change but manstein s superiors generals halder and brauchitsch resented manstein s repeated insistence that his plan be implemented in place of theirs halder had manstein removed from rundstedt s headquarters and sent to stettin to command xxxviii army corps on 27 january hitler still looking for a more aggressive plan approved a modified version of manstein s ideas today known as manstein plan after meeting with him on 17 february manstein and his corps played a minor role during operations in france serving under gunther von kluge s 4th army his corps helped achieve first breakthrough east of amiens during fall rot case red second phase of invasion plan and was first to reach and cross river seine invasion of france was an outstanding military success manstein was promoted to full general and awarded knight s cross of iron cross battle of britain manstein was a proponent of prospective german invasion of great britain named operation seelowe he considered operation risky but necessary early studies by various staff officers determined that air superiority was a prerequisite to planned invasion his corps was to be shipped across english channel from boulogne to bexhill as one of four units assigned to first wave but as luftwaffe failed to overcome royal air force during battle of britain operation seelowe was postponed indefinitely on 12 october for rest of year manstein with little to do spent time in paris and at home invasion of soviet union thumb manstein with general der panzertruppe erich brandenberger one of his divisional commanders in june 1941 in july 1940 german high command commenced planning operation barbarossa invasion of soviet union on 15 march 1941 manstein was appointed commander of lvi panzer corps he was one of 250 commanders to be briefed for upcoming major offensive first seeing detailed plans of offensive in may his corps was part of fourth panzer group under command of general erich hoepner in wilhelm ritter von s army group north army group was tasked with thrusting through baltic states and then advancing on leningrad manstein arrived at front only six days prior to launch of offensive operation barbarossa commenced on 22 june 1941 with a massive german attack along whole front line manstein s corps was to advance with georg hans reinhardt s xli panzer corps to dvina river to secure bridges near town of soviet forces mounted a number of counterattacks but those were aimed against reinhardt s corps leading to battle of raseiniai manstein s corps advanced rapidly reaching dvina river distant in just 100 hours overextended and well ahead of rest of army group he fended off a number of determined soviet counterattacks after reinhardt s corps closed in two corps were tasked with encircling soviet formations around luga in a pincer movement thumb left progress of army group north june to december having penetrated deep into soviet lines with unprotected flanks his corps was target of a soviet counteroffensive from 15 july at by soviet 11th army commanded by nikolai vatutin manstein s 8th panzer division was cut off although it was able to fight its way free it was badly mauled and red army succeeded in halting manstein s advance at luga corps regrouped at dno 8th panzers were sent on anti partisan duties and manstein was given 4th ss polizei division attack on luga was repeatedly delayed assault on luga was still underway when manstein received orders on 10 august that his next task would be to begin advance toward leningrad no sooner had he moved to his new headquarters at lake than he was told to send his men towards staraya russa to relieve x corps which was in danger of being encircled on 12 august red army had launched an offensive with 11th and 34th armies against army group north cutting off three divisions frustrated with loss of 8th panzer and missed opportunity to advance on leningrad manstein returned to dno his counteroffensive led to a major soviet defeat when his unit encircled five soviet divisions receiving air support for first time on that front they captured 12 000 prisoners and 141 tanks his opponent general kuzma m of 34th army was subsequently court martialed and executed for defeat manstein tried to obtain rest days for his men who had been constantly fighting in poor terrain and increasingly poor weather since start of campaign but to no avail they were ordered to advance to east on demyansk on 12 september when he was near city he was informed that he would take over 11th army of army group south in ukraine crimea and battle of sevastopol thumb manstein with generaloberst hermann hoth commander of 4th panzer army june 1942 in september 1941 manstein was appointed commander of 11th army after its previous commander colonel general eugen ritter von perished when his plane landed in a soviet minefield 11th army was tasked with invading crimean peninsula capturing sevastopol and pursuing enemy forces on flank of army group south during its advance into soviet union hitler aimed to prevent red army from using airbases in crimea and to cut off soviet supply of oil from caucasus manstein s forces mostly infantry achieved a rapid breakthrough during first days against heavy soviet resistance after most of neck of perekop isthmus had been taken his forces were substantially reduced leaving six german divisions and romanian third army rest of perekop isthmus was captured slowly and with some difficulty manstein complained of a lack of air support to contest soviet air superiority in region he next formed a mobile reconnaissance unit to press down peninsula cutting road between simferopol and sevastopol on 31 october axis forces captured simferopol next day 11th army had captured all of crimean peninsula except for sevastopol by 16 november meanwhile red army had evacuated 300 000 personnel out of city by sea thumb manstein at kerch front may 1942 manstein s first attack on sevastopol in november failed and with insufficient forces left for an immediate assault he ordered an investment of heavily fortified city by 17 december he launched another offensive which also failed on 26 december soviet troops landed on kerch straits to retake kerch and its peninsula and on 30 december executed another landing near feodosiya only a hurried withdrawal from kerch peninsula in contravention of manstein s orders by 46th infantry division under general hans graf von prevented an axis collapse in eastern part of crimea division lost most of its heavy equipment manstein cancelled a planned resumption of attack and sent most of his forces east to destroy soviet bridgehead soviet forces were in a superior position regarding men and materiel as they were able to re supply by sea accordingly stalin pushed them to conduct further offensives however soviet troops were unable to capture critical rail and road access points which would have cut german lines of supply thumb left map shows progress as of 5 may 1942 for battle of kerch peninsula launched on 8 may 1942 hitler finally assigned manstein major air support 11th army was outnumbered on ground so manstein had them feint an attack in north while bulk of force attacked to south soviet troops soon fled manstein recorded in his memoirs capture of 170 000 prisoners 1 133 guns and 258 tanks kerch was captured on 16 may wehrmacht lost only 8 000 men after a month s delay manstein turned his attention once more to capture of sevastopol a battle in which germany used some of largest guns ever built along with large numbers of regular artillery pieces super heavy karl gerat mortars and dora railway gun were brought in for assault a furious barrage began on morning of 2 june 1942 all of resources of luftwaffes luftflotte 4 commanded by wolfram von richthofen were committed barrage continued for five days before ground assault began thumb manstein observing ruins of sevastopol july 1942 11th army gained ground during mid june focusing their attention on northern approaches to city casualties were high on both sides as month dragged on aware of need to act before german summer offensive of 1942 reduced availability of reinforcements and supplies manstein ordered a surprise attack across using amphibious landings on 29 june operation was a success soviet resistance crumbled on 1 july german forces entered city while soviet forces conducted a disorganised evacuation and hitler promoted manstein to generalfeldmarschall same day entire city was in german hands by 4 july during crimean campaign manstein was indirectly involved in atrocities against soviet population especially those committed by einsatzgruppe d one of several schutzstaffel ss groups that had been tasked with elimination of jews of europe einsatzgruppe d travelled in wake of manstein s 11th army and were provided by manstein s command with vehicles fuel and drivers military police cordoned off areas where einsatzgruppe planned to shoot jews to prevent anyone from escaping captain ulrich gunzert shocked to have witnessed einsatzgruppe d massacre a group of jewish women and children went to manstein to ask him to do something to stop killings gunzert states that manstein told him to forget what he had seen and to concentrate on fighting red army eleven of seventeen charges against manstein at his later war crimes trial related to nazi maltreatment and killing of jews and prisoners of war in crimea siege of leningrad after capture of sevastopol hitler felt manstein was right man to command forces at leningrad which had been under siege since september 1941 with elements of 11th army manstein was transferred to leningrad front arriving on 27 august 1942 manstein again lacked proper forces to storm city so he planned operation nordlicht a bold plan for a thrust to cut off leningrad s supply line at lake ladoga however on day of his arrival red army launched offensive originally planned as spoiling attack against georg lindemann s 18th army in narrow german salient west of lake ladoga offensive appeared able to break through german lines lifting siege hitler bypassing usual chain of command telephoned manstein directly and ordered him to take offensive action in area after a series of heavy battles he launched a counterattack on 21 september that cut off two soviet armies in salient fighting continued throughout october although soviet offensive was fended off resulting attrition meant that wehrmacht could no longer execute a decisive assault on leningrad and nordlicht was put on hold siege was finally lifted by soviet forces in january 1944 battle of stalingrad thumb upright soviet counterattack at stalingrad in an attempt to resolve their persistent shortage of oil wehrmacht had launched fall blau case blue a massive offensive aimed against caucasian oilfields in summer of 1942 after german air attacks 6th army led by friedrich paulus was tasked with capturing stalingrad a key city on river volga his troops supported by 4th panzer army entered city on 12 september hand to hand combat and street fighting ensued red army launched a huge counteroffensive on 19 november codenamed operation uranus which was designed to encircle german armies and trap them in city this goal was accomplished on 23 november hitler aware that if stalingrad were lost it would likely never be retaken appointed manstein as commander of newly created army group don heeresgruppe don tasked with mounting a relief operation named unternehmen operation winter storm to reinforce german hold on city manstein s initial assessment on 24 november was that 6th army given adequate air support would be able to hold on in october 1942 his son gero was killed in battle he later described this as worst thing that happened to me personally during war launched on 12 december winter storm achieved some initial success manstein s three panzer divisions comprising 23rd 6th and 17th panzer divisions and supporting units of lvii panzer corps advanced to within of stalingrad by 20 december at river where they came under assault by soviet tanks in blizzard conditions manstein made a request to hitler on 18 december that 6th army should attempt to break out hitler was against it and both manstein and paulus were reluctant to openly disobey his orders conditions deteriorated inside city men suffered from lice cold weather and inadequate supplies of food and ammunition of aviation hermann goring had assured hitler that trapped 6th army could be adequately supplied by air but due to poor weather a lack of aircraft and mechanical difficulties this turned out not to be case on 24 january manstein urged hitler to allow paulus to surrender but he refused in spite of hitler s wishes paulus surrendered with his remaining 91 000 soldiers on 31 january 1943 some 200 000 german and romanian soldiers died of those who surrendered only 6 000 survivors returned to germany after end of war manstein believed he had done his best for 6th army encircled men saw it differently american historians williamson murray and allan millett wrote that manstein s message to hitler on 24 november advising him that 6th army should not break out along with goring s statements that luftwaffe could supply stalingrad sealed fate of sixth army historians including gerhard weinberg have pointed out that manstein s version of events at stalingrad in his memoir is distorted and several events described there were probably made up because of sensitivity of stalingrad question in post war germany manstein worked as hard to distort record on this matter as on his massive involvement in murder of jews wrote weinberg meanwhile red army launched an offensive of their own operation saturn was intended to capture rostov and thus cut off german army group a however after launch of winter storm soviet army had to reallocate forces to prevent relief of stalingrad so operation was scaled down and redubbed little saturn offensive forced manstein to divert forces to avoid collapse of entire front attack also prevented xlviii panzer corps comprising 336th infantry division 3rd luftwaffe field division and 11th panzer division under command of general otto von from joining up with lvii panzer corps as planned to aid relief effort instead xlviii panzer corps held a line along chir river beating off successive soviet attacks general hermann balck used 11th panzer division to counterattack soviet salients on verge of collapse german units were able to hold line but italian 8th army on flanks was overwhelmed and subsequently destroyed spurred on by this success red army planned a series of follow up offensives in january and february 1943 intended to decisively beat german forces in southern russia after destruction of remaining hungarian and italian forces during offensive operation star and operation gallop were launched to recapture kharkov and kursk and to cut off all german forces east of donetsk those operations succeeded in breaking through german lines and threatened whole southern part of german front to deal with this threat army group don army group b and parts of army group a were united as army group south heeresgruppe sud under manstein s command in early february kharkov counter offensive thumb on 10 march 1943 under heavy security hitler flew to army group south s headquarters at ye ukraine only from front lines to review military situation manstein greets hitler upon his arrival at local airfield on right are hans baur and luftwaffe generalfeldmarschall wolfram von richthofen during their offensives in february 1943 red army broke through german lines retaking kursk on 9 february as army groups b and don were in danger of being surrounded manstein repeatedly called for reinforcements although hitler called on 13 february for kharkov to be held at all costs ss oberst gruppenfuhrer paul hausser commander of ii ss panzer corps ordered city evacuated on 15 february hitler arrived at front in person on 17 february and over course of three days of exhausting meetings manstein convinced him that offensive action was needed in area to regain initiative and prevent encirclement troops were reorganised and reinforcements were pulled into zone from neighbouring armies manstein immediately began planning a counteroffensive launched on 20 february that later became known as backhand blow vatutin and soviet forces believing that manstein would retreat were taken completely by surprise by 2 march wehrmacht had captured 615 tanks and had killed some 23 000 soviet soldiers to reinforce point that recapture of kharkov was important politically hitler travelled again to front lines in ukraine on 10 march 1943 where he met with manstein to review situation manstein carefully assembled his available forces along a wide front to prevent their encirclement and germans recaptured kharkov on 14 march after bloody street fighting in third battle of kharkov for this accomplishment he received oak leaves for knight s cross hausser s ii ss panzer corps captured belgorod on 18 march manstein s counteroffensive had not only prevented disintegration of entire front it had regained substantial territory and resulted in destruction of three soviet armies and retreat of three others soviet casualties for preceding month in that sector had been 46 000 dead and 14 000 taken prisoner captured or destroyed were 600 tanks and 1 200 pieces of artillery spring thaw began by 23 march ending operations in area for time being planning was then undertaken to eliminate enemy salient at kursk operation citadel manstein favoured an immediate pincer attack on kursk salient after battle at kharkov but hitler was concerned that such a plan would draw forces away from industrial region in donets basin in any event ground was still too muddy to move tanks into position in lieu of an immediate attack okh prepared operation citadel launching of which would be delayed while more troops were gathered in area and mud solidified meanwhile red army well aware of danger of encirclement also moved in large numbers of reinforcements and their intelligence reports revealed expected locations and timing of german thrusts thumb battle of kursk southern pincer citadel was last german strategic offensive on eastern front and one of largest battles in history involving more than four million men by time wehrmacht launched their initial assault on 5 july 1943 soviet forces outnumbered them by nearly three to one walter model was in command of northern pincer with ninth army while manstein s army group south formed southern pincer both armies were slowed as tanks were blown up in minefields and caught up in combat on a series of prepared soviet defensive lines after five days of fighting model s advance was stopped with ninth panzers suffering 25 000 casualties by 13 july model s forces were being drawn away towards orel where soviet army had launched operation kutuzov manstein s forces were able to penetrate soviet lines causing heavy casualties he reached but did not enter or capture prokhorovka his first major objective on 11 july inflicting serious soviet losses in resulting battle of prokhorovka however on 13 july hitler called off failed kursk offensive allies had landed in sicily so he issued order for a withdrawal manstein protested he felt that soviet forces had exhausted all their reserves in area and he did not want to stop until all his own reserves had been committed hitler however insisted on calling off operation although soviet casualties were indeed heavy modern historians discount possibility of a successful german continuation of offensive retreat to dnieper manstein regarded battle of kursk as something of a german victory as he believed that he had destroyed much of red army s offensive capacity for rest of 1943 this assessment turned out to be incorrect as red army was able to recover much faster than manstein expected manstein moved his panzer reserves to river and lower dnieper not realising soviet activities there were a diversion a soviet offensive that began on 3 august put army group south under heavy pressure after two days of heavy fighting soviet troops broke through german lines and retook belgorod punching a wide hole between fourth panzer army and army detachment kempf tasked with holding kharkov in response to manstein s demands for reinforcements hitler sent grossdeutschland 7th panzer ss 2nd das reich and ss 3rd totenkopf divisions thumb left manstein right with generalmajor hans speidel on dnieper september 1943 construction began of defensive positions along dnieper but hitler refused requests to pull back insisting that kharkov be held with reinforcements trickling in manstein waged a series of counterattacks and armoured battles near and between 13 and 17 august which resulted in heavy casualties as they ran into prepared soviet lines on 20 august he informed okh that his forces in donets river area were holding a too wide front with insufficient numbers and that he needed to either withdraw to dnieper river or receive reinforcements continuous pressure from soviet forces had separated army group centre from army group south and severely threatened manstein s northern flank when red army threw their main reserves behind a drive to retake kharkov on 21 22 august manstein took advantage of this to close gap between 4th panzer and 8th armies and reestablish a defensive line hitler finally allowed manstein to withdraw back across dnieper on 15 september during withdrawal manstein ordered scorched earth actions to be taken in a zone from river and later faced charges at his war crimes trial for issuing this order soviet losses in july and august included over 1 6 million casualties 10 000 tanks and self propelled artillery pieces and 4 200 aircraft german losses while only one tenth that of soviet losses were much more difficult to sustain as there were no further reserves of men and materiel to draw on in a series of four meetings that september manstein tried unsuccessfully to convince hitler to reorganise high command and let his generals make more of military decisions battle of dnieper in september 1943 manstein withdrew to west bank of dnieper in an operation that for most part was well ordered but at times degenerated into a disorganised rout as his exhausted soldiers became unglued hundreds of thousands of soviet civilians travelled west with them many bringing livestock and personal property manstein correctly deduced that next soviet attack would be towards kiev but as had been case throughout campaign red army used deception to disguise timing and exact location of their intended offensive historians williamson murray and allan reed millett wrote that many german generals fanatical belief in nazi racial theories made idea that slavs could manipulate german intelligence with such consistency utterly inconceivable 1st ukrainian front led by nikolai fyodorovich vatutin met outnumbered fourth panzer army near kiev vatutin first made a thrust near liutezh just north of kiev and then attacked near bukrin to south on 1 november german troops thinking bukrin would be location of main attack were taken completely by surprise when vatutin captured bridgehead at liutezh and gained a foothold on west bank of dnieper kiev was liberated on 6 november 17th army was cut off and isolated in crimea by attacking 4th ukrainian front on 28 october thumb operations along dnieper july to december 1943 under guidance of general hermann balck cities of and were retaken in mid november but after receiving reinforcements vatutin resumed offensive on 24 december 1943 and red army continued its successful advance manstein s repeated requests to hitler for more reinforcements were turned down on 4 january 1944 manstein met with hitler to tell him that dnieper line was untenable and that he needed to retreat in order to save his forces hitler refused and manstein again requested changes in highest levels of military leadership but was turned down as hitler believed that he alone was capable of managing wider strategy in january manstein was forced to retreat further west by soviet offensive without waiting for permission from hitler he ordered german xi and corps consisting of 56 000 men in six divisions of army group south to break out of korsun pocket during night of 16 17 february 1944 by beginning of march soviet forces had driven wehrmacht well back of river because of hitler s directive of 19 march that from that point forward all positions were to be defended to last man manstein s 1st panzer army became encircled on 21 march when permission to break out was not received from hitler in time manstein flew to hitler s headquarters in lvov to try to convince him to change his mind hitler eventually relented but relieved manstein of his command on 30 march 1944 manstein appeared on cover of 10 january 1944 issue of time magazine above caption retreat may be masterly but victory is in opposite direction dismissal manstein received swords of knight s cross on 30 march 1944 and handed over control of army group south to model on 2 april during a meeting at hitler s mountain retreat berghof model s adjutant gunther reichhelm later described scene and manstein s response while on medical leave after surgery to remove a cataract in his right eye manstein recovered at home in liegnitz and in a medical facility in dresden he suffered from an infection and for a time was in danger of losing his sight on day of failed 20 july plot an assassination attempt on hitler s life that was part of a planned military coup d etat manstein was at a seaside resort on baltic although he had met at various times with three of main conspirators claus von stauffenberg henning von and rudolf christoph freiherr von gersdorff manstein was not involved in conspiracy he later said preussische nicht prussian field marshals do not mutiny still gestapo placed manstein s house under surveillance when it became obvious that hitler would not be appointing him to a new post manstein bought an estate in east pomerania in october 1944 but was soon forced to abandon it as soviet forces overran area his home at liegnitz had to be evacuated on 22 january 1945 and he and his family took refuge temporarily with friends in berlin while there manstein tried to get an audience with hitler in fuhrerbunker but was turned away he and his family continued to move further west into germany until war in europe ended with a german defeat in may 1945 manstein suffered further complications in his right eye and was receiving treatment in a hospital in when he was arrested by british and transferred to a prisoner of war camp near luneburg on 26 august postwar trial manstein was moved to nuremberg in october 1945 he was held at palace of justice location of nuremberg trials of major nazi war criminals and organisations while there manstein helped prepare a 132 page document for defence of general staff and okw on trial at nuremberg in august 1946 myth that wehrmacht was clean not culpable for events of holocaust arose partly as a result of this document written largely by manstein along with general of cavalry siegfried westphal he also gave oral testimony about einsatzgruppen treatment of prisoners of war and concept of military obedience especially as related to commissar order an order issued by hitler in 1941 requiring all soviet political commissars to be shot without trial manstein admitted that he received order but said he did not carry it out documents from 1941 presented at nuremberg and at manstein s own later trial contradict this claim he actually received regular reports throughout that summer regarding execution of hundreds of political commissars he denied any knowledge of activities of einsatzgruppen and testified that soldiers under his command were not involved in murder of jewish civilians otto ohlendorf commander of einsatzgruppe d contradicted this during his testimony saying that not only was manstein aware of what was happening but that eleventh army was involved in september 1946 general staff and okw were declared to not be a criminal organisation their decision was that a collection of military officers was not a group or organisation as defined by article 9 of their charter after his testimony at nuremberg manstein was interned by british as a prisoner of war at island farm also known as special camp 11 in bridgend wales where he awaited decision as to whether or not he would face a war crimes trial he mostly kept apart from other inmates taking solitary walks tending a small garden and beginning work on drafts of two books british author b h liddell hart was in correspondence with manstein and others at island farm and visited inmates of several camps around britain while preparing his best selling 1947 book on other side of hill liddell hart was an admirer of german generals he described manstein as an operational genius two remained in contact and liddell hart later helped manstein arrange publication of english edition of his memoir verlorene siege lost victories in 1958 british cabinet under pressure from soviet union finally decided in july 1948 to prosecute manstein for war crimes he and three other senior officers walther von brauchitsch gerd von rundstedt and adolf strauss were transferred to to await trial brauchitsch died that october and rundstedt and strauss were released on medical grounds in march 1949 manstein s trial was held in hamburg from 23 august to 19 december 1949 manstein faced seventeen charges at trial three of which pertained to events in poland and fourteen regarding events in soviet union charges included maltreatment of prisoners of war co operation with einsatzgruppe d in killing jewish residents of crimea and disregarding welfare of civilians by using scorched earth tactics while retreating from soviet union prosecution led by senior counsel arthur comyns carr used an order manstein had signed on 20 november 1941 based on severity order that had been issued by field marshal walther von reichenau to build their case that manstein had known about and was complicit with genocide order called for elimination of jewish bolshevik system and harsh punishment of jewry manstein claimed that he remembered asking for a draft of such an order but had no recollection of signing it american historians ronald smelser and edward j davies wrote in 2008 that manstein agreed with hitler s idea that war against soviet union was a war to exterminate judeo bolshevism and that he committed perjury when he claimed not to remember signing his version of severity order manstein s defence led by prominent lawyer reginald thomas paget argued that order was justified because many partisans were jews and therefore manstein s order calling for all jews to be executed was justified by his desire to protect his men from partisan attacks he argued that manstein was not compelled to disobey orders given by his sovereign government even if such orders were illegal manstein speaking in his defence stated that he found nazi racial policy to be repugnant sixteen other witnesses testified that manstein had no knowledge of or involvement in genocide paget called soviets savages arguing that manstein showed restraint as a decent german soldier in upholding laws of war when fighting against soviets who displayed appalling savagery whether or not manstein was responsible for activities of einsatzgruppe d a unit not under his direct control but operating in his zone of command became one of key points of trial prosecution claimed it was manstein s duty to know about activities of this unit and also his duty to put a stop to their genocidal operations recent scholars including ronald smelser and benoit lemay are of opinion that he almost certainly perjured himself at his trial and at nuremberg manstein was found guilty on nine of charges and was sentenced to eighteen years in prison charges for which he was found guilty included shooting soviet war prisoners carrying out commissar order and allowing subordinates to shoot civilians manstein s supporters in britain and in germany protested liddell hart lobbied in british press and in germany sentence was seen as a political decision sentence was reduced to 12 years in february 1950 paget published a best selling book in 1951 about manstein s career and trial which portrayed manstein as an honourable soldier fighting heroically despite overwhelming odds on eastern front and who had been convicted of crimes that he did not commit book helped to contribute to growing cult surrounding manstein s name his release on 7 may 1953 was partly a result of a recurrence of his eye problems but also result of pressure by winston churchill konrad adenauer liddell hart paget and others also british wanted germany to take part in defence of western europe and adenauer made germany s re armament contingent on release of their war criminals antisemitism manstein believed that bolshevism and jews were inextricably linked that there was a global conspiracy led by jews and that in order to stop spread of communism it was necessary to remove jews from european society his order of 20 november 1941 based on severity order of reichenau reads in part manstein did nothing to prevent killing of jews and other civilians in areas where his units were operating and in which his eleventh army actively participated that manstein was well aware of einsatzgruppen massacres is demonstrated by a 1941 letter he sent to otto ohlendorf in which manstein demands ohlendorf hand over wristwatches of murdered jews manstein felt his men deserved watches since they were doing so much to help ohlendorf s men with their work smelser and davies note that this letter was only time that manstein ever complained about activities of einsatzgruppen manstein later stated that he felt number of jews killed in holocaust was exaggerated antisemitism was common in germany and throughout europe during this period and manstein s attitude towards jews had its roots in his exposure to and assimilation of these views his actions were a reflection of his loyalty toward hitler and nazi regime and of his grounding in a sense of duty based on traditional prussian military values his criticism of hitler was based solely on their disagreements over conduct of war not about regime s racial policies some historians including antony beevor and benoit lemay are of opinion that manstein had some jewish ancestry manstein was only reichswehr officer who opposed introduction of aryan paragraph in 1934 he sent a letter of protest to general beck commenting that anyone who had volunteered to serve in armed forces had already proven their worth lemay speculated that manstein may have been interested in protecting his two mischlinge who were already serving in reichswehr he may have also been concerned about possibility that he had distant jewish ancestry ss carried out an investigation into manstein s ancestry but report was not completed and results remain unknown postwar life and memoirs along with ten other former senior officers manstein was called on in 1955 by amt blank to formulate plans for re founding of german army on 20 june 1953 he spoke to bundestag giving his analysis of strategic power considerations and country s defence and spoke about whether country should have a professional army or a conscripted army his opinion was that length of service for bundeswehr conscripts should be at least 18 months preferably 24 months his idea to form a reserve force was later implemented manstein s war memoir verlorene siege lost victories was published in west germany in 1955 and was later translated into several other languages book was a highly acclaimed best seller critical of hitler and his leadership style historians such as liddell hart saw manstein s emphasis on purely military aspects of war while ignoring political and moral aspects as a way for him to absolve himself and high command of any responsibility for events of holocaust his favourable portrayal of himself influenced popular opinion he became centre of a military cult which cast him not only as one of germany s greatest generals but also one of greatest in history he has been described as a kult und military cult figure and leading personality a general of legendary almost mythical ability much honoured by both public and historians biographers including benoit lemay feel that his narrow focus on military matters to exclusion of moral issues cannot be considered ethical manstein and his wife moved several times after his release from prison living in essen and bonn for a time before settling into a house near munich in 1958 second volume of his memoirs aus einem soldatenleben a soldier s life covering period from 1887 to 1939 was published in 1958 his wife jutta sibylle von manstein died in 1966 on manstein s 80th birthday he received congratulations from supreme high commander general

full military honours his funeral being attended by hundreds of soldiers of all ranks in manstein s obituary spiegel magazine said he assisted in march to catastrophe misled by a blind sense of duty
