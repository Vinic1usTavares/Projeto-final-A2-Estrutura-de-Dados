featuring bob sheppard on tenor sax and vocals by cheryl bentyne reception john fordham of guardian called album a return to a funk repertoire reminiscent of clarke s roots in chick corea electric bands he goes on to call it more than just a box ticking piece of jazz funk commercialism but laments clarke could probably play a lot of this kind of thing in his sleep william r wood wrote in kalamazoo gazette that clarke s complex bass work is invigorating as he blends jazz rock and funk thom jurek of allmusic wrote that album feels more like a band record than anything clarke has done in decades he praises clarke s choice in bandmates calling them prodigies in their own right but does not praise whole album he called larry has traveled 11 miles and waited a lifetime for return of vishnu s report a clumsy failed attempt at summing up music s history to date and that bass folk song no 6 does not work as well as some of other tracks but these are minor complaints on an otherwise fine recording jeff of all about jazz commented that there are no radical departures on this album and it sounds as if clarke is taking a victory lap here revisiting past triumphs but that he still pull s sounds out of his assortment of electric acoustic and alembic basses like nobody else and is still slapping plucking and thumbing his way through contemporary fusion jazz rock funk and whatever else he puts his mind to awards album won 2011 grammy award for best contemporary jazz album and track no mystery was nominated for best pop instrumental performance clarke accepted his grammy with
