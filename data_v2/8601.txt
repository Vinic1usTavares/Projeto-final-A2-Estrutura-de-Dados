however city soon experienced its most dire fiscal crisis yet due to stagnant economy of early 1970s combined with massive outflow of city residents to suburbs and in september 1975 construction on line stopped and tunnels were sealed over next few decades mta regularly inspected and maintained tunnel segments spending 20 000 a year by early 1990s to maintain structural integrity of streets

approximately 49 feet 15 m below ground making station shallowest of three phase 1 stations platform for 96th street station like other second avenue subway stations is wide station has air cooling systems to make it at least cooler than other subway stations during summer this requires station to have large ventilation and ancillary buildings rather than traditional subway grates station is

northernmost entrance locations of station entrances are all south of 96th street in 2009 there was a debate over placement of location of street entrances because 96th street divides neighborhoods of upper east side to south and east harlem to north some residents of east harlem stated that their neighborhood was not served by second avenue subway effects surrounding area s real estate prices had been in decline construction made prices of real estate decrease temporarily to more affordable levels however value of real estate in area has risen since 2013 with new construction charging a subway premium some businesses near station s construction site lost profits but with opening of new station business owners hope to see an increase in patronage a writer for new yorker called station area a partially gentrified traditional dividing line between east harlem and upper east side unlike for other two phase 1 stations rents for buildings in station area had not reached their maximum to illustrate area s transitional condition writer stated that 96th street station was situated within a few blocks of a high crime housing development on first avenue an old ice skating rink frequented
