doxorubicin sold under trade names adriamycin among others is a chemotherapy medication used to treat cancer this includes breast cancer bladder cancer kaposi s sarcoma lymphoma and acute lymphocytic leukemia it is often used together with other chemotherapy agents doxorubicin is given by injection into a vein common side effects include hair loss bone marrow suppression vomiting rash and inflammation of mouth other serious side effects may include allergic reactions such as anaphylaxis heart damage tissue damage at site of injection radiation recall and treatment related leukemia people often experience red discoloration of urine for a few days doxorubicin is in anthracycline and antitumor antibiotic family of medications it works in part by interfering with function of dna doxorubicin was approved for medical use in united states in 1974 it is on world health organization s list of essential medicines most effective and safe medicines needed in a health system wholesale cost in developing world is about us 3 88 32 79 per 50 mg vial in united kingdom this amount costs nhs about ps100 12 versions that are pegylated and in liposomes are also available however are more expensive doxorubicin was originally made from bacteria streptomyces peucetius medical use doxorubicin is commonly used to treat some leukemias and hodgkin s lymphoma as well as cancers of bladder breast stomach lung ovaries thyroid soft tissue sarcoma multiple myeloma and others commonly used doxorubicin containing regimens are ac adriamycin cyclophosphamide tac ac adriamycin bleomycin chop cyclophosphamide hydroxydaunorubicin prednisone and fac 5 adriamycin cyclophosphamide doxil see below is used primarily for treatment of ovarian cancer where disease has progressed or recurred after platinum based chemotherapy or for treatment of aids related kaposi s sarcoma doxil product information ortho biotech products l p retrieved on april 19 2007 liposomal form there is a pegylated polyethylene glycol coated liposome encapsulated form of doxorubicin sold as doxil it was developed to treat kaposi s sarcoma an aids related cancer that causes lesions to grow under skin in lining of mouth nose and throat or in other organs polyethylene glycol coating results in preferential concentration of doxorubicin in skin however this also results in a side effect called palmar plantar ppe more commonly known as hand foot syndrome following administration of this form of doxorubicin small amounts of drug can leak from capillaries in palms of hands and soles of feet result of this leakage is redness tenderness and peeling of skin that can be uncomfortable and even painful in clinical testing at 50 mg m2 dosing every 4 weeks half of people developed hand foot syndrome rate of this side effect limits dose of this formulation that can be given as compared with plain doxorubicin in same treatment regimen thereby limiting potential substitution substitution would be desirable because liposome encapsulated doxorubicin is less cardiotoxic than doxorubicin this form is also approved by fda for treatment of ovarian cancer and multiple myeloma a non pegylated liposomal doxorubicin called myocet is approved in europe and canada for treatment of metastatic breast cancer in combination with cyclophosphamide but has not been approved by fda for use in united states unlike doxil myocet liposome does not have a polyethylene glycol coating and therefore does not result in same rate of hand foot syndrome minimization of this side effect may allow for one for one 1 1 substitution with doxorubicin in same treatment regimen thereby improving safety with no loss of efficacy like doxil liposomal encapsulation of doxorubicin limits cardiotoxicity in theory by limiting cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin through liposomal encapsulation it can be used safely in concurrent combination with other cardiotoxic chemotherapy drugs such as trastuzumab there is an fda black box warning that trastuzumab cannot be used in concurrent combination with doxorubicin only in sequential combination though concurrent combination of trastuzumab and doxorubicin in clinical studies found superior tumor response combination resulted in unacceptable cardiotoxicity including risk of cardiac failure manifesting as congestive heart failure chf published phase ii study results have shown that myocet trastuzumab and can safely be used concurrently without cardiac risk as measured by reduction in function while still achieving superior tumor response this finding is basis for ongoing phase iii trial for fda approval side effects cardiotoxicity most dangerous side effect of doxorubicin is dilated cardiomyopathy leading to congestive heart failure rate of cardiomyopathy is dependent on its cumulative dose with an incidence about 4 when dose of doxorubicin is 500 550 mg m2 18 when dose is 551 600 mg m2 and 36 when dose exceeds 600 mg m2 there are several ways in which doxorubicin is believed to cause cardiomyopathy including oxidative stress downregulation of genes for contractile proteins and p53 mediated apoptosis doxorubicin induced cardiomyopathy typically results in dilated cardiomyopathy with all four cardiac chambers being enlarged this results in both systolic and diastolic dysfunction eventually heart failure can result which carries a 50 mortality rate there is no effective treatment against established cardiomyopathy caused by drug as of 2010 drug may be used to decrease risk of doxorubicin s cardiotoxicity in certain cases other another common and potentially fatal complication of doxorubicin is an acute life threatening infection of bowel additionally some people may develop ppe characterized by skin eruptions on palms of hand or soles of feet swelling pain and erythema due to these side effects and its red color doxorubicin has earned nickname red devil https voice ons org news and views outpatient oncology drug series doxorubicin is infamous red devil or red death chemotherapy can cause reactivation of hepatitis b and doxorubicin containing regimens are no exception doxorubicin and several chemotherapeutic drugs including cyclophosphamide cause other groups of drugs that cause this problem include amiodarone heavy metals but not iron tetracyclines and antipsychotics biosynthesis doxorubicin dxr is a 14 version of daunorubicin immediate precursor of dxr in its biosynthetic pathway daunorubicin is more abundantly found as a natural product because it is produced by a number of different wild type strains of streptomyces in contrast only one known non wild type species streptomyces peucetius subspecies atcc was initially found to be capable of producing more widely used doxorubicin this strain was created by et al in 1969 by mutating a strain producing daunorubicin but not dxr at least in detectable quantities subsequently hutchinson s group showed that under special environmental conditions or by introduction of genetic modifications other strains of streptomyces can produce doxorubicin his group has also cloned many of genes required for dxr production although not all of them have been fully characterized in 1996 s group discovered isolated and characterized dox a gene encoding enzyme that converts daunorubicin into dxr by 1999 they produced recombinant dox a a cytochrome p450 oxidase and found that it catalyzes multiple steps in dxr biosynthesis including steps leading to daunorubicin this was significant because it became clear that all daunorubicin producing strains have necessary genes to produce dxr much more therapeutically important of two hutchinson s group went on to develop methods to improve yield of dxr from fermentation process used in its commercial production not only by introducing dox a encoding plasmids but also by introducing mutations to deactivate enzymes that shunt dxr precursors to less useful products for example like glycosides some triple mutants that also over expressed dox a were able to double yield of dxr this is of more than academic interest because at that time dxr cost about 1 37 million per kg and current production in 1999 was 225 kg per annum more efficient production techniques have brought price down to 1 1 million per kg for formulation although dxr can be produced semi synthetically from daunorubicin process involves electrophilic bromination and multiple steps and yield is poor since daunorubicin is produced by fermentation it would be ideal if bacteria could complete dxr synthesis more effectively mechanism of action thumb diagram of two doxorubicin molecules intercalating dna from doxorubicin interacts with dna by intercalation and inhibition of macromolecular biosynthesis this inhibits progression of topoisomerase ii an enzyme which relaxes in dna for transcription doxorubicin stabilizes topoisomerase ii complex after it has broken dna chain for replication preventing dna double helix from being resealed and thereby stopping process of replication it may also increase quinone type free radical production hence contributing to its cytotoxicity planar aromatic portion of molecule intercalates between two base pairs of dna while six membered sugar sits in minor groove and interacts with flanking base pairs immediately adjacent to intercalation site as evidenced by several crystal structures crystal structure is available for download as a pdb file by intercalation doxorubicin can also induce histone eviction from transcriptionally active chromatin as a result dna damage response and transcriptome are deregulated in doxorubicin exposed cells history in 1950s an italian research company farmitalia research laboratories began an organized effort to find anticancer compounds from soil based microbes a soil sample was isolated from area surrounding castel del monte a 13th century castle a new strain of streptomyces peucetius which produced a red pigment was isolated and an antibiotic from this bacterium was effective against tumors in mice since a group of french researchers discovered same compound at about same time two teams named compound daunorubicin combining name a pre roman tribe that occupied area of italy where compound was isolated with french word for ruby describing color per prior citation first publication b g 1960 della ii in italian chim ital 90 1802 1815 clinical trials began in 1960s and drug was successful in treating acute leukemia and lymphoma however by 1967 it was recognized that daunorubicin could lead to fatal cardiac toxicity researchers at farmitalia soon discovered that changes in biological activity could be made by minor changes in structure of compound a strain of streptomyces was mutated using n nitroso n methyl urethane and this new strain produced a different red colored antibiotic they named this new compound adriamycin after adriatic sea and name was later changed to doxorubicin to conform to established naming convention doxorubicin showed better activity than daunorubicin against mouse tumors and especially solid tumors it also showed a higher therapeutic index yet cardiotoxicity remained doxorubicin and daunorubicin together can be thought of as prototype compounds for anthracyclines subsequent research has led to many other anthracycline antibiotics or analogs and there are now over 2 000 known analogs of doxorubicin by 1991 553 of them had been evaluated in screening program at national cancer institute nci in 2016 gpx 150 was granted orphan drug designation by us fda investigational sarcoma drug gpx 150 gets orphan drug designation 2016 society and culture names it is also known as hydroxydaunorubicin and it is sold under a number of different brand names including adriamycin pfs adriamycin rdf or formulations doxorubicin is photosensitive and containers are often covered by an aluminum bag and or brown wax paper to prevent light from affecting it doxorubicin is also available in liposome encapsulated forms as doxil pegylated form myocet form and although these forms must also be given by intravenous injection shortage between 2011 and march 2014 doxil was in limited supply in 2011 doxil became available only in very limited supply due to production problems with third party manufacturer johnson johnson through its subsidiary janssen products lp had been receiving its doxil supply from contract manufacturer ben venue laboratories located in bedford ohio a unit of gmbh of germany problems began when ben venue temporarily shut down their manufacturing facility due to quality control issues in february 2012 to address doxil shortage us food and drug administration fda allowed for temporary importation of lipodox which contains same active ingredient as doxil and is made by sun pharma global fze sun a subsidiary of india s sun pharmaceutical industries ltd agency said it intends to continue allowing importation of lipodox until sun has made enough generic doxil to meet demand fda approved first generic version of doxil made by sun in february 2013 it will be available in 20 milligram and 50 milligram vials research combination therapy experiments with rapamycin and doxorubicin have shown promise in treating akt positive lymphomas in mice recent animal research coupling a murine monoclonal antibody with doxorubicin has created an immunoconjugate that was able to eliminate hiv 1 infection in mice current treatment with antiretroviral therapy art still leaves pockets of hiv within host immunoconjugate could potentially provide a complementary treatment to art to eradicate antigen expressing t cells antimalarial activity there is some evidence for antimalarial activity for doxorubicin and similar compounds in 2009 a compound similar in structure to doxorubicin was found to inhibit ii an enzyme unique to malarial parasite plasmodium falciparum pharmaceutical company glaxosmithkline gsk later identified doxorubicin in a set of compounds that inhibit parasite growth fluorescence doxorubicin is also known to be fluorescent this has often been used to characterize doxorubicin concentrations and has opened possibility of using molecule as a agent however there are significant limitations as doxorubicin s fluorescence spectrum is known to depend on a variety of factors including ph of environment solvent dielectric constant and others doxorubicin fluorescence is quenched by binding to dna and shielded by encapsulation it is also known to self quench at high concentrations in contrast histone binding amplifies
