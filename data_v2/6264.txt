right thumb high court of justice which along with charity commission has jurisdiction over disputes in charitable trusts charitable trusts in english law are a form of express trust dedicated to charitable goals there are a variety of advantages to charitable trust status including exception from most forms of tax and freedom for trustees not found in other types of english trust to be a valid charitable trust organisation must demonstrate both a charitable purpose and a public benefit applicable charitable purposes are normally divided into categories for public benefit including relief of poverty promotion of education advancement of health and saving of lives promotion of religion and all other types of trust recognised by law there is also a requirement that trust s purposes benefit public or some section of public and not simply a group of private individuals such trusts will be invalid in several circumstances charitable trusts are not allowed to be run for profit nor can they have purposes that are not charitable unless these are ancillary to charitable purpose in addition it is considered unacceptable for charitable trusts to campaign for political or legal change although discussing political issues in a neutral manner is acceptable charitable trusts as with other trusts are administered by trustees but there is no relationship between trustees and beneficiaries this results in two things firstly trustees of a charitable trust are far freer to act than other trustees and secondly beneficiaries cannot bring a court case against trustees rather beneficiaries are represented by attorney general for england and wales as a parens patriae who appears on part of crown jurisdiction over charitable disputes is shared equally between high court of justice and charity commission commission first port of call is tasked with regulating and promoting charitable trusts as well as providing advice and opinions to trustees on administrative matters where commission feels there has been mismanagement or maladministration it can sanction trustees removing them appointing new ones or temporarily taking trust property itself to prevent harm being done where there are flaws with a charity high court can administer schemes directing function of charity or even under cy pres doctrine change purpose of charity or gift altogether creation as a form of express trust charitable trusts are subject to certain formalities as well as requirements of three certainties when being created these vary depending on whether gift that creates trust is given in life given after death or includes land if gift is given after death through a will will must comply with section 9 of wills act 1837 which requires that will be in writing and signed by testator or somebody else present at testator s instruction it is clear that testator intended to give effect to will and signature is made or noted by two or more witnesses if these are all carried out will is a valid document and gift made as part of it can create a charitable trust if gift is of land and made during donor s lifetime it must comply with section 53 1 b of law of property act 1925 which requires that agreement be a written document signed by person giving it hudson 2009 p 212 if gift is of personal property and made inter vivos there are no formal requirements it is enough that an oral declaration is made creating trust once constituted properly a charitable trust like all express trusts cannot be undone unless there is something allowing that within trust instrument hudson 2009 p 213 advantages of charity status there are a variety of advantages to charity status within english trusts law a standard express trust has a relationship between trustees and beneficiaries this does not apply to charitable trusts partially because of special definition of trustee used and partially because there are no individual beneficiaries identified in a charitable trust instead attorney general of england and wales sues on behalf of beneficiaries to enforce a charitable trust because of this lack of a relationship trustees powers are far wider ranging only being regulated by charity commission and actions brought by attorney general beneficiaries have no direct control hudson 2009 p 1004 charitable trusts are also exempt from many formalities when being created including rule against trustees are also not required to act unanimously only with a majority hudson 2009 p 1005 tax law also makes special exemptions for charitable trusts they are free from income tax paid by individuals and companies and also corporation tax paid by incorporated and unincorporated associations there is no requirement for charitable trusts to pay capital gains tax or council tax although they are obliged to pay vat hudson 2009 p 1006 this freedom from tax liability applies not just to charitable trusts but also to people who donate to them individuals who donate via gift aid are free from paying tax on that amount while companies who give gifts to charity can claim tax on amount back from hm revenue customs hudson 2009 p 1007 definitions definitions of a trustee and a trust within charitable trusts differ significantly from norm in particular according to charities act 1993 section 37 there is no statutory definition of what a charity is it is instead dealt with in a roundabout way charities act 2006 states in section 1 1 that charitable purpose right thumb lord macnaghten who set out standard categorisation of charitable trusts in irc v pemsel first definition of a charitable purpose was found in preamble to charitable uses act 1601 standard categorisation since all previous attempts to put it on statute books were unduly cumbersome was set out by lord macnaghten in irc v pemsel 1891 ac 531 where he said that charity in its legal sense comprises four principal divisions trusts for relief of poverty trusts for advancement of education trusts for advancement of religion and trusts for other purposes beneficial to community this charitable purpose was expanded on in section 2 2 of charities act 2006 but macnaghten categories are still widely used edwards 2007 p 206 trusts must also be for public benefit which was considered at length in oppenheim v tobacco securities trust 1951 ac 297 a fund was created to benefit children of employees and former employees of british american tobacco which was a large number total number of employees was over 110 000 house of lords found that size was not issue group did not count as a section of public because of personal nexus or common relationship between british american tobacco and beneficiaries nature of charitable trusts means that definition of public benefit varies between macnaghten s four categories edwards 2007 p 211 poverty 1601 act stated that charities for benefit of aged impotent and poor people had an appropriate purpose it is accepted that these may appear individually a charity does not have to be for benefit of people who are both poor impotent and aged to be valid only one of them edwards 2007 p 212 poverty is a subjective term and in re 1951 ch 661 sir raymond indicated that it should be treated as such poverty of course does not mean destitution it means persons who have to go short due regard being had to their status in life and so forth this appears to indicate that a millionaire who loses half of his income may be considered poor in that he is unable to have lifestyle he is accustomed to some limits were set to this provision by lord simonds in irc v baddeley 1955 1 all er 525 where he wrote that gift that creates charitable trust whatever definition of poverty accepted by courts must be for poor and nobody else in re 1930 1 ch 255 money was left to provide short trousers to children in farnham while this was a necessity under standard definition of poverty gift was not limited to poor and instead went to every child in area as a result trust failed poverty category is a major exception to rule on personal relationships laid down in oppenheim v tobacco securities trust in dingle v turner 1972 1 all er 878 a charitable trust was established to help poor employees of dingle co while beneficiaries were all linked by a personal relationship their employer courts ruled that poverty is an exception to oppenheim rule academics richard edwards and nigel stockwell argue that this is because allowing such trusts to exist relieves rest of society for having to provide for poor people as a result there is public benefit in a wider way general public benefit rule in poverty category is that gifts for relief of poverty among poor people of a particular description is charitable gifts to particular persons relief of poverty being motive of gift are not edwards 2007 p 214 education left thumb lord hailsham who set out extent of education of young used in charitable trust cases in irc v mcmullen as with poverty this category is also found in 1601 act s preamble which refers to charities established for maintenance of schools of learning free schools and scholars at universities common law over years has recognised a wide area covered by education this includes education of young a particularly wide category described by lord hailsham in irc v mcmullen 1980 1 all er 884 as a balanced and systematic process of instruction training and practice containing both spiritual moral mental and physical elements although wide this excludes things that courts feel are harmful in re shaw 1957 1 all er 748 harman j excluded schools for pickpockets or prostitutes education also includes research as long as subject is useful and gift makes some requirement that information be made available to others and disseminated in re hopkins 1964 3 all er 46 a gift was given to francis bacon society to find proof that william shakespeare s plays were written by bacon wilberforce j held that it was a valid gift as discovery would be of highest value to history and to literature he also gave definition of research required for a gift to be valid this definition was expanded on by slade j in mcgovern v attorney general where he said that for artistic pursuits it is not enough to promote such things generally as it is too vague a body for specific artistic purposes may be charitable as in royal choral society v irc 1943 2 all er 101 as is promotion of a particular composer seen in re delius 1957 1 all er 854 for a gift to be charitable courts must be convinced that subject of advancement be of artistic merit this includes famous composers as seen above and social graces as in re shaw s wills trust 1952 1 all er 49 when there is doubt courts ignore opinions of beneficiary and instead rely on experts as in re pinion 1964 1 all er 890 this area is covered by charities act 2006 which lists advancement of citizenship or community development and advancement of arts culture heritage or science as valid types of charitable trust edwards 2007 p 217 religion for purposes of this category religion was seen to mean a faith in a higher power and does not include ethical principles or rationalism as in bowman v secular society 1917 ac 406 2006 act expanded this noting that religion includes a religion which does not involve belief in a god this extends to support of religious buildings and sick or old members of clergy as in re forster 1938 3 all er 767 this category also covers groups with small followings as in re watson 1973 3 all er 678 and with doubtful theology as in thornton v howe 1862 54 er 1042 curiously and individually to religious charities public benefit requirement is justified by assumption that according to cross j in neville estates v madden 1961 3 all er 769 some benefit accrues to public from attendance at places of worship of persons who live in this world and mix with their fellow citizens notably this excludes gifts to groups which do not associate with public as in gilmour v coats 1949 1 all er 2007 p 219 other purposes macnaghten s fourth category contains not only individual categories of its own but also general principles that are applied when a body seeks to be recognised as a charitable trust first of these sub categories contains trusts for benefit of sick and old preamble to 1601 act gave aged impotent and poor people as acceptable beneficiaries for a charity these acceptable beneficiaries are to be read individually there is no requirement to aid aged and impotent as well as poor and one can even exclude poor such as in re resch s will trusts 1969 1 ac 514 which dealt with a hospital that charged fees edwards 2007 p 220 second sub category is for charitable trusts relating to animals as with religious charities benefit is derived not from comfort afforded to animals but from indirect moral benefit to mankind again this excludes trusts which isolate beneficiaries from public as in re grove grady 1929 1 ch 557 where trust sought to provide a refuge for animals so that they shall be safe from molestation and destruction by man charities for purpose of creating animal sanctuaries usually pass public benefit test despite this because they do not completely exclude public and often have educational value edwards 2007 p 221 third sub category covers charitable trusts for benefit of localities a trust for benefit of a locality has long been held only to apply to that area if its purpose within that area is charitable it is valid if money is to be spent on non charitable purposes trust fails regardless of fact that it applies to a particular area this class of charities can be held valid even when it only impacts on a class within a locality as in goodman v saltash corporation 1882 7 app cas 633 this can apply even when class fluctuates such as in re christchurch inclosure act 1888 38 ch d 520 where a gift was for benefit of inhabitants of a group of cottages whoever those inhabitants might be edwards 2007 p 222 charitable trusts have historically been invalid if they include purely recreational pastimes as in irc v city of glasgow police athletic association 1953 1 all er 747 even though purpose of charity was to improve efficiency of police force fact that this included a recreational element invalidated trust in response to this case and irc v 1955 ac 572 recreational charities act 1958 was passed which provides that it shall be and be deemed always to have been charitable to provide or assist in provision of facilities for recreation or other leisure time occupation if facilities are provided in interest of social welfare section 1 1 of act however preserves need to provide a public benefit act also lays out what kinds of activities are in interest of social welfare stating in section 1 2 that it is where facilities are provided with object of improving conditions of life for persons for whom facilities are primarily provided and in section 1 2 a those persons have need of such facilities as aforesaid by reason of their youth age infirmity or disablement poverty or social and economic circumstances or where in section 1 2 b facilities are available to members of public at large edwards 2007 p 223 this definition and acceptance of need for a public benefit allows courts to reject charitable trusts for recreational activities such as if they felt that activities are harmful act also excludes private clubs unless members fall under section 1 2 a courts are willing to accept charitable trusts for recreational activities if they benefit people as a whole and not just people covered by section 1 2 a as in guild v irc 1992 2 all er 10 where lord keith stated fact is that persons from all walks of life and all kinds of social circumstances may have their conditions of life improved by provision of recreational facilities of a suitable nature edwards 2007 p 224 invalid purposes political activism charitable trusts can t be used to promote political changes and charities attempting such have been consistently rebuffed by courts there are two justifications for this first is that even when a campaign for political change is stated to be for benefit of community it is not within court s competence to decide whether or not change would be beneficial second laid out in national anti vivisection society v irc 1940 ac 31 is that courts must assume law to be correct and as such could not support any charity which is trying to alter that law academic alastair hudson describes this argument as a little thin given that judges contentedly take it upon themselves to interpret limit and extend statutes as well as occasionally recommending creation of new statutes to shore up common law it is peculiar to see judges so coy in face of an argument being advanced that legislation might be changed hudson 2009 p 1010 leading case anti vivisection society sets out a strict rule that charities cannot campaign politically an illustration of its strictness is bowman v secular society where it was held that even when attempted changes to law were ancillary to main goals it was still unacceptable hudson 2009 p 1011 there is a dividing line charitable trusts discussing political issues can be valid as discussed by hoffmann j obiter dicta in attorney general v ross 1985 3 all er 334 this line is considered by charity commission in their official guidelines which allow commission to look at wider purpose of organisation when deciding if it constitutes a valid charity profit making no organisation run for profit can be a charity a fee paying school may be a charitable body despite fees paid but not if they are directly run to make a profit as in re girls public day school trust 1951 ch 400 this also excludes benefit societies where benefits are limited to those who have funded it as in re holborn air raid distress fund 1946 ch 194 exclusivity a charitable trust created from a gift must be exclusively charitable if there are any purposes which would not be charitable on their own trust fails trust instruments should ideally identify that money is to be used for charitable purposes use of other words such as beneficial or benevolent causes trust to fail at creation as words are not synonymous with charity an example is privy council decision in attorney general of cayman islands v hansen 2000 3 all er 642 where council held that gifts to organisations or institutions operating for public good and acting for good or for benefit of mankind failed because definition given was not exclusively charitable edwards 2007 p 229 there are two exceptions to rule of exclusivity ancillary purposes and severance where non charitable purpose is a necessary ancillary to charitable one trust will not fail this is a matter of degrees and was discussed by slade j in mcgovern v attorney general 1982 ch 321 when he said that severance refers to separation of charitable and non charitable purposes dividing funds between them this allows charitable element to take effect this is only possible when trust instrument indicates that donor intended for fund to be divided and cannot work where donor gives a list of purposes a single fund is to be used for standard rule for dividing funds is based on equitable rule that equity is equality money should be divided equally there are exceptions where it is not practicable as in re coxon 1948 ch 747 where of a ps200 000 gift to city of london for charitable purposes a ps100 dinner and other small gifts to board of trustees was funded edwards 2007 p 231 administration of charitable trusts administration of charitable trusts is covered primarily by charities act 1993 and charities act 2006 and is widely divided between four groups attorney general for england and wales trustees charity commission and official custodian for charities edwards 2007 p 233 attorney general and trustees thumb jeremy wright current attorney general who represents beneficiaries on behalf of crown as mentioned attorney general represents beneficiaries as a parens patriae appearing on part of crown any case involving charities has him joined as a party he may act against trustees in disputes and take actions to recover property from third parties his role was discussed in brooks v richardson 1986 1 al er 952 where court quoted practitioner s text tudor on charity next significant role is played by charity trustees defined in section 97 of 1993 act as those persons having general control and management of administration of charities as mentioned charitable trustees have significantly more freedom to act than normal trustees but 1993 act has put restrictions on who may be a charitable trustee section 72 excludes people convicted of a crime involving dishonesty bankrupts people previously removed from charity trusteeship and people struck off as directors of companies those trustees appointed have many duties when administering trust including informing commission of changes to charity or its dissolution registering charity and keeping proper accounts and records to be submitted annually to commission edwards 2007 p 234 charity commission charity commission originated as charity commissioners created by charitable trusts act 1853 to provide advice to charitable trusts currently governed by and exercising its functions under charities act 2011 it has five core objectives along with these objectives it has six functions under 2011 act charity commission has power to issue an inquiry into a charity under section 46 of 2011 act and if they are satisfied there has been mismanagement they are allowed to suspend trustees or officers appoint additional trustees vest charity property in official custodian for charities or order debtors or people holding charity property not to transfer it without their permission they can also remove trustees on grounds of bankruptcy mental incapacity failure to act or trustee s absence from country commission is also authorised to appoint new trustees to replace removed ones or even to increase number of trustees edwards 2007 p 236 jurisdiction of charity commission is concurrent with that of high court of justice high court possesses all powers of commission who only exercise theirs on application of charity or attorney general or trustees beneficiaries and interested people when charity has an income of less than ps500 commission under section 29 of 2011 act also keeps register of charities edwards 2007 p 237 under section 110 of act commission is tasked with giving advice or opinions to trustees relating to performance or administration of their charity commission also acts as official custodian for charities who acts as a trustee for charities at direction of commission edwards 2007 p 238 schemes both high court and charities commission are authorised to establish schemes administering charities these can come about when money has been left for a charitable purpose which is not specified or with no suggestion as to how it should be administered scheme may be used to appoint new trustees except when trustee s identity is crucial to intentions of testator as in re lysaght 1965 2 all er 888 schemes may also be used to fix administrative difficulties caused by uncertainty as in re gott 1944 1 all er 293 or even to completely defeat gift schemes can also be used on application of trustees to extend powers of investment or consolidate funds trustees may apply to change core purpose of trust which while enacted through a scheme follows doctrine of cy pres edwards 2007 p 239 cy pres doctrine doctrine of cy pres is a form of variation of trusts it allows original purpose of trust to be altered doctrine originated in ecclesiastical law name coming as a contraction of norman french cy pres comme possible as close as possible hopkins 2007 p 187 and is typically used where original purpose of charity has failed and results in trust purpose being altered to nearest realistic alternative edwards 2007 p 240 prior to charities act 1960 this failed purpose situation was only time when cy pres could be applied it required original purpose to be impossible or impractical with 1960 act relevant provisions of which are now included in 1993 act cy pres can be applied where original purposes have this definition was amended by charities act 2006 to replace spirit of gift with appropriate considerations which are defined as on one hand spirit of gift concerned and on other social and economic circumstances prevailing at time of proposed alteration of original purposes edwards 2007 p 242 failures that lead to an application for cy pres are of two sorts subsequent failure where trust constituted properly failed after a period of action and initial failure where trust fails at creation subsequent failure cases are designed to have charity s funds applied to more effective purposes and as such money already donated to charity cannot be returned to next of kin of original money in re wright 1954 2 all er 98 it was said that once money has been effectually dedicated to charity testator s next of kin or residuary legatees are for ever excluded edwards 2007 p 243 schemes for initial failure on other hand ask court to decide whether gifts should be returned to testator s estate and next of kin or be applied to a new purpose under cy pres when deciding if a gift has failed there is a distinction made between gifts to unincorporated bodies and incorporated bodies as laid down in re vernon s will trust 1971 3 all er 1061 this is because gifts to an unincorporated body must be treated as gifts to that body s purpose not to body itself since unincorporated bodies cannot hold property as such gift does not revert to next of kin because even if body is dissolved gift s purpose is presumably still valid edwards 2007 p 245 see also references bibliography category
