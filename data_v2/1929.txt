thumb right two geostationary satellites in same orbit thumb right a 5deg x 6deg view of a part of geostationary belt showing several geostationary satellites those with inclination 0deg form a diagonal belt across image a few objects with small inclinations to equator are visible above this line satellites are pinpoint while stars have created small trails due to earth s rotation a geostationary orbit also referred to as a geosynchronous equatorial orbit and geosynchronous equatorial orbit are used somewhat interchangeably in sources geo is a circular geosynchronous orbit above earth s equator and following direction of earth s rotation an object in such an orbit has an orbital period equal to earth s rotational period one sidereal day and so to ground observers it appears motionless in a fixed position in sky concept of a geostationary orbit was popularised by arthur c clarke in 1940s as a way to revolutionise telecommunications and first satellite to be placed in this kind of orbit was launched in 1963 communications satellites are often placed in a geostationary orbit so that earth based satellite antennas located on earth do not have to rotate to track them but can be pointed permanently at position in sky where satellites are located weather satellites are also placed in this orbit for real time monitoring and data collection and navigation satellites to provide a known calibration point and enhance gps accuracy geostationary satellites are launched via a temporary orbit and placed in a slot above a particular point on earth s surface orbit requires some stationkeeping to keep its position and modern retired satellites are placed in a higher graveyard orbit to avoid collisions history thumb syncom 2 first geosynchronous satellite first appearance of a geostationary orbit in popular literature was in october 1942 in first venus equilateral story by george o smith s message is sent to a small squat building at outskirts of northern landing it was hurled at sky it arrived at relay station tired and worn when it reached a space station only five hundred miles above city of north landing but smith did not go into details british science fiction author arthur c clarke popularised and expanded concept in a 1945 paper entitled extra terrestrial relays can rocket stations give worldwide radio coverage published in wireless world magazine clarke acknowledged connection in his introduction to complete venus equilateral it is therefore quite possible that these stories influenced me subconsciously when i worked out principles of synchronous communications satellites orbit which clarke first described as useful for broadcast and relay communications satellites is sometimes called clarke orbit similarly collection of artificial satellites in this orbit is known as clarke belt in technical terminology orbit is referred to as either a geostationary or geosynchronous equatorial orbit with terms used somewhat interchangeably first geostationary satellite was designed by harold rosen while he was working at hughes aircraft in 1959 inspired by sputnik 1 he wanted to use a geostationary satellite to communications telecommunications between us and europe was then possible between just 136 people at a time and reliant on high frequency radios and an undersea cable conventional wisdom at time was that it would require too much rocket power to place a satellite in a geostationary orbit and it would not survive long enough to justify expense so early efforts were put towards constellations of satellites in low or medium earth orbit first of these were passive echo balloon satellites in 1960 followed by telstar 1 in 1962 although these projects had difficulties with signal strength and tracking that could be solved through geostationary satellites concept was seen as impractical so hughes often withheld funds and support by 1961 rosen and his team had produced a cylindrical prototype with a diameter of height of weighing light and small enough to be placed into orbit it was spin stabilised with a dipole antenna producing a pancake shaped waveform in august 1961 they were contracted to begin building real satellite they lost syncom 1 to electronics failure but syncom 2 was successfully placed into a geosynchronous orbit in 1963 although its inclined orbit still required moving antennas it was able to relay tv transmissions and allowed for us president john f kennedy to phone nigerian prime minister abubakar tafawa balewa from a ship on august 23 1963 first satellite placed in a geostationary orbit was syncom 3 which was launched by a delta d rocket in 1963 with its increased bandwidth this satellite was able to transmit live coverage of summer olympics from japan to america geostationary orbits have been in common use ever since in particular for satellite television today there are hundreds of geostationary satellites providing remote sensing and communications although most populated land locations on planet now have terrestrial communications facilities microwave fiber optic with telephone access covering 96 of population and internet access 90 some rural and remote areas in developed countries are still reliant on satellite communications uses most commercial communications satellites broadcast satellites and sbas satellites operate in geostationary orbits communications geostationary communication satellites are useful because they are visible from a large area of earth s surface extending 81deg away in both latitude and longitude they appear stationary in sky which eliminates need for ground stations to have movable antennas this means that earth based observers can erect small cheap and stationary antennas that are always directed at desired satellite however latency becomes significant as it takes about for a signal to pass from a ground based transmitter on equator to satellite and back again this delay presents problems for latency sensitive applications such as voice communication so geostationary communication satellites are primarily used for unidirectional entertainment and applications where low latency alternatives are not available geostationary satellites are directly overhead at equator and appear lower in sky to an observer nearer poles as observer s latitude increases communication becomes more difficult due to factors such as atmospheric refraction earth s thermal emission line of sight obstructions and signal reflections from ground or nearby structures at latitudes above about 81deg geostationary satellites are below horizon and cannot be seen at all because of this some russian communication satellites have used elliptical molniya and tundra orbits which have excellent visibility at high latitudes meteorology a worldwide network of operational geostationary meteorological satellites is used to provide visible and infrared images of earth s surface and atmosphere for weather observation oceanography and atmospheric tracking as of 2019 there are 19 satellites in either operation or stand by these satellite systems include united states goes series operated by noaa meteosat series launched by european space agency and operated by european weather satellite organization republic of korea coms 1 and gk 2a multi mission satellites russian elektro l satellites japanese himawari series chinese series india s insat series these satellites typically captures images in visual and infrared spectrum with a spatial resolution between 0 5 and 4 square kilometres coverage is typically 70deg and in some cases less geostationary satellite imagery has been used for tracking volcanic ash measuring cloud top temperatures and water vapour oceanography land temperature and vegetation coverage facilitating cyclone path prediction and providing real time cloud coverage and other tracking data some information has been incorporated into meteorological prediction models but due to their wide field of view full time monitoring and lower resolution geostationary weather satellite images are primarily used for short term and real time forecasting navigation thumb 300px right service areas of satellite based augmentation systems sbas geostationary satellites can be used to augment gnss systems by relaying clock ephemeris and ionospheric error corrections calculated from ground stations of a known position and providing an additional reference signal this improves position accuracy from approximately 5m to 1m or less past and current navigation systems that use geostationary satellites include wide area augmentation system waas operated by united states federal aviation administration faa european geostationary navigation overlay service operated by on

navigation gagan system being operated by india commercial starfire navigation system operated by john deere and c nav positioning solutions oceaneering commercial system and system operated by implementation launch geostationary satellites are launched to east into a prograde orbit that matches rotation rate of equator smallest inclination that a satellite can be launched into is that of launch site s latitude so launching satellite from close to equator limits amount of inclination change needed later additionally launching from close to equator allows speed of earth s rotation to give satellite a boost a launch site should have water or deserts to east so any failed rockets do not fall on a populated area most launch vehicles place geostationary satellites directly into a geostationary transfer orbit gto an elliptical orbit with an apogee at geo height and a low perigee on board satellite propulsion is then used to raise perigee and reach geo orbit allocation satellites in geostationary orbit must all occupy a single ring above equator requirement to space these satellites apart to avoid harmful radio frequency interference during operations means that there are a limited number of orbital slots available and thus only a limited number of satellites can be operated in geostationary orbit this has led to conflict between different countries wishing access to same orbital slots countries near same longitude but differing latitudes and radio frequencies these disputes are addressed through international telecommunication union s allocation mechanism in 1976 bogota declaration eight countries located on earth s equator claimed sovereignty over geostationary orbits above their territory but claims gained no international recognition statite proposal a statite is a hypothetical satellite that uses radiation pressure from sun against a solar sail to modify its orbit it would hold its location over dark side of earth at a latitude of approximately 30 degrees a statite is stationary relative to earth and sun system rather than compared to surface of earth and could ease congestion in geostationary ring retired satellites geostationary satellites require some station keeping to keep their position and once they run out of thruster fuel they are generally retired transponders and other onboard systems often outlive thruster fuel and by allowing satellite to move naturally into an inclined geosynchronous orbit some satellites can remain in use or else be elevated to a graveyard orbit this process is becoming increasingly regulated and satellites must have a 90 chance of moving over 200 km above geostationary belt at end of life space debris thumb alt earth from space surrounded by small white dots a computer generated image of space debris two debris fields are shown around geostationary space and low earth orbit space debris at geostationary orbits typically has a lower collision speed than at leo since all geo satellites orbit in same plane altitude and speed however presence of satellites in eccentric orbits allows for collisions at up to 4 km s although a collision is comparatively unlikely geo satellites have a limited ability to avoid any debris debris less than 10 cm in diameter cannot be seen from earth making it difficult to assess their prevalence despite efforts to reduce risk spacecraft collisions have occurred european space agency telecom satellite olympus 1 was struck by a meteoroid on august 11 1993 and eventually moved to a graveyard orbit olympus failure esa press release august 26 1993 and in 2006 russian express am11 communications satellite was struck by an unknown object and rendered inoperable notification for express am11 satellite users in connection with spacecraft failure russian satellite communications company april 19 2006 although its engineers had enough contact time with satellite to send it into a graveyard orbit in 2017 both amc 9 and 1 broke apart from an unknown cause properties a typical geostationary orbit has following properties inclination 0deg period 1436 minutes one sidereal day eccentricity 0 argument of perigee undefined semi major axis 42 164 km inclination an inclination of zero ensures that orbit remains over equator at all times making it stationary with respect to latitude from point of view of a ground observer and in reference frame period orbital period is equal to exactly one sidereal day this means that satellite will return to same point above earth s surface every sidereal day regardless of other orbital properties for a geostationary orbit in particular it ensures that it holds same longitude over time this orbital period t is directly related to semi major axis of orbit through formula where is length of orbit s semi major axis is standard gravitational parameter of central body eccentricity eccentricity is zero which produces a circular orbit this ensures that satellite does not move closer or further away from earth which would cause it to track backwards and forwards across sky orbital stability a geostationary orbit can be achieved only at an altitude very close to and directly above equator this equates to an orbital speed of and an orbital period of 1 436 minutes one sidereal day this ensures that satellite will match earth s rotational period and has a stationary footprint on ground all geostationary satellites have to be located on this ring a combination of lunar gravity solar gravity and flattening of earth at its poles causes a precession motion of orbital plane of any geostationary object with an orbital period of about 53 years and an initial inclination gradient of about 0 85deg per year achieving a maximal inclination of 15deg after 26 5 years to correct for this perturbation regular orbital stationkeeping maneuvers are necessary amounting to a delta v of approximately 50 m s per year a second effect to be taken into account is longitudinal drift caused by asymmetry of earth equator is slightly elliptical there are two stable points at 75 3dege and and two corresponding unstable points at 165 3dege and 14 any geostationary object placed between equilibrium points would without any action be slowly accelerated towards stable equilibrium position causing a periodic longitude variation correction of this effect requires station keeping maneuvers with a maximal delta v of about 2 m s per year depending on desired longitude solar wind and radiation pressure also exert small forces on satellites over time these cause them to slowly drift away from their prescribed orbits in absence of servicing missions from earth or a renewable propulsion method consumption of thruster propellant for station keeping places a limitation on lifetime of satellite hall effect thrusters which are currently in use have potential to prolong service life of a satellite by providing high efficiency electric propulsion derivation of
