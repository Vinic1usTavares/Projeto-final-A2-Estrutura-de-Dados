two men who were alleged to have murdered martinez perez silva who had already been arrested confessed to murder according to silva s confession reporter knew dominguez and therefore allowed both of them into her house on night of her murder after some conversation dominguez grew angry and started beating martinez perez with intention of forcing her to reveal where she hid her money and other valuable possessions silva then joined his accomplice in beating until they killed her investigators said that attackers had plunged journalist s head into a toilet bowl hit her on head several times with brass knuckles and threw her against a tub where she cracked her skull martinez perez unsuccessfully tried to defend herself by grabbing a kitchen knife and stabbing one of attackers in forearm

before leaving crime scene investigation when silva was arrested in october 2012 he confessed to murder of martinez perez investigators and authorities in veracruz concluded that journalist was killed during a robbery when placed before a judge silva retracted his confession and stated that he had been tortured held hostage for over a week and threatened by veracruz authorities in order to make him confess to assassination silva said that officials had threatened to kill his mother his last remaining family member during a press conference veracruz authorities relied solely on confession of silva as evidence against him none of them made references to dna fingerprint or blood samples from murder scene sources close to committee to protect journalists stated that samples collected at crime scene do not match those of any of criminals listed on national database this should rule out both silva and dominguez who is still at large from murder because both of them have extensive criminal records proceso news magazine immediately took a critical stance toward investigation and said that they did not believe that veracruz authorities were capable of completing a clean investigation committee to protect journalists believes that murder case was possibly fabricated and that silva was likely used as a scapegoat by authorities just a few items were stolen from martinez perez s house while valuable goods were left behind so they allege that theft was not real motive behind her murder according to mexican law proceso was allowed to participate in investigation so they appointed a top journalist to cover every detail of it proceso has complained that veracruz authorities have lied to them regarding possible developments in investigation six months after martinez perez s slaying veracruz authorities stated that her murder was also a crime of passion according to reports dominguez was alleged boyfriend of journalist on april 2013 proceso stated that it had received classified information that its senior editor who was covering investigation jorge carrasco was a possible target by corrupt veracruz officials reportedly members of administration of governor javier duarte de ochoa were allowed to carry out hostile actions against reporter in response to his most recent publication on regina martinez case sources close to news magazine alleged that officials were plotting to kill reporter while he was in nation s capital mexico city veracruz authorities responded by stating that accusations were false and asked proceso to provide evidence for its claims governor promised that he would investigate threats and journalist went into hiding with several armed bodyguards that same month silva was sentenced to 38 years and 2 months in prison for murder judge also ordered murderer to pay roughly 8 000 usd in reparations for her death and stolen possessions proceso however expressed its doubt on murder case and trial once again stating that they did not believe court was sentencing right man many journalists continue to dispute facts in case believing that murder was retribution for reports by martinez perez on drug trafficking and political corruption they have questioned investigation by state of veracruz proceso magazine s reporter said investigators never explored possibility that her journalism may have been motive behind her murder press freedom organizations across world have complained that case was designed to cover up crime instead of clarifying what actually happened we don t believe them authorities said proceso reporter jorge carrasco on behalf of whole newspaper magazine context background veracruz is most dangerous place in mexico for journalists at least nine journalists have been killed since governor javier duarte de ochoa took office in 2010 many of them by los zetas drug cartel most of these reporters were killed under unclear circumstances and few arrests have been made in their respective investigations given high levels of corruption criminal impunity and drug related attacks against press all across veracruz many local journalists have decided to leave state and relocate in other parts of mexico atmosphere in veracruz has also forced many media outlets to self censor and stop reporting on drug violence with traditional reporting being too dangerous and intimidating social media and blogs are often only outlets for reporting serious crimes state of veracruz used to be controlled by gulf cartel before business was handed over to los zetas their former allies when they went to war across northeastern mexico in early 2010 since 2011 much of drug related violence is a result of turf wars between los zetas and sinaloa cartel a drug trafficking organization based in western mexico and headed by joaquin el chapo guzman mexico s most wanted drug lord these criminal groups are fighting for veracruz because of its lucrative smuggling routes for contraband drug trafficking and illegal migrants heading to united states it has one of mexico s busiest ports and officials say that there is no way they can inspect all of containers that come in by ship corruption is also widespread in veracruz investigators have been slow and reluctant to link martinez perez murder to organized crime according to committee to protect journalists veracruz is by general consensus one of most politically corrupt states in mexico mexico was ruled by institutional revolutionary party pri for 71 years until it lost presidential seat to conservative national action party pan in 2000 pri has long been criticized for being corrupt and allowing drug trafficking organizations in country to operate freely if they maintained relative peace although pri lost national presidency in 2000 some states remained under rule of pri politicians democratic transition never quite reached veracruz a state of 8 million people pri governors in veracruz continued to rule with state with tactics largely abandoned by pri at a national level journalists assassinated martinez perez was fifth journalist killed in veracruz during of governor javier duarte de ochoa which started in 2010 first journalist assassinated was noel lopez olguin march 2011 followed by miguel angel lopez velasco and his son june 2011 then yolanda ordaz de la cruz was killed july 2011 followed by

september 2011 miguel morales estrada july 2012 and sergio landa rosales november 2012 nearly 100 journalists bloggers and writers have been kidnapped or killed in mexico since 2000 making country one of most dangerous places on planet in which to be a journalist most of these crimes too have remained unsolved and only a few perpetrators have been brought to justice on 22 june 2012 former president felipe calderon signed law for protection of human rights defenders and journalists spanish ley para la proteccion de personas de derechos y periodistas which makes attacks against journalists a federal crime and establishes a fund for investigating these crimes law also establishes several preventative measures to protect journalists such as providing them bodyguards armored vehicles bullet proof vests security cameras wireless equipment and satellite cellphones to communicate in case of any danger and temporary relocation if deemed necessary congress passed a law on 7 june 2012 that allowed federal government to investigate attacks against journalists crimes which used to be under jurisdiction of state and municipal forces reactions irina who is director general of unesco said news of murders of gabriel huge and guillermo luna varela tortured and killed less than one week after murder of regina martinez perez is deeply disturbing and reflects an alarming state of affairs in state of veracruz that these gruesome crimes have been committed on eve of world press freedom day a day on which we honour vital role played by journalists in upholding democratic values protecting citizens rights to be informed and calling those in power to account makes situation all more intolerable i condemn these three murders in strongest possible terms and urge mexican authorities to act quickly and decisively to find those responsible impunity is not an option proceso magazine wrote in reaction to its colleague s murder murder of journalist regina martinez perez on saturday april 28
