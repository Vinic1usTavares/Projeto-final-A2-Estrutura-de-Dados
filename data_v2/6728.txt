though depression was able to strengthen to become tropical storm bertha about five hours after it formed outflow became much better organized as bertha became a tropical storm and well defined banding features persisted to north of storm though convection waned forecasters predicted friction between land and warm atmosphere to redevelop more deep convection potentially resulting in further strengthening however storm failed to intensify and bertha made landfall near boothville louisiana as a minimal tropical storm early on august 5 it slowly weakened over swampy portions of southeastern louisiana and degenerated to a tropical depression later on 5th after crossing lake initially it was expected that a ridge of high pressure to its north would keep bertha moving to west and result in

environment was not unfavorable its proximity to land prevented re strengthening to tropical storm status though system showed periods of increased organization as it moved southwestward bertha
