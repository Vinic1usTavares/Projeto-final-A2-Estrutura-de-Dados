provincial czechoslovakia and her attempts at forging a romantic relationship forman based his story on a real world incident from his past and filmmakers focused much of their attention on trying to create a real life look and feel by filming on location in a small czech town with a shoe factory of its own utilizing a largely non professional cast relying on a considerable amount of dialogue improvisation and employing documentary style cinematographic techniques upon its release loves of a blonde was a popular success in its home country and was shown at some major film festivals where it was well received garnering a number of nominations and awards critical response was largely positive although some reviewers were less enthusiastic than others film is now considered one of most significant examples of czech new wave a movement which took advantage of a temporary relaxation of totalitarian control over creative artists to use cinema as a means to explore new narrative strategies while making pointed critiques of social and political conditions behind iron curtain loves of a blonde was nominated for 1966 academy award for best foreign language film plot andula is a working class young woman living in a fading czech factory town where due to an oversight in central state planning women outnumber men 16 1 film opens with an intimate scene between andula and her fellow shoe factory worker friend as they lie in bed in their dormitory discussing ring given to andula by her boyfriend tonda and gossiping about her mildly flirtatious encounter with a forest ranger which is shown in flashback factory supervisor belatedly realizes that gender disparity is impairing morale and productivity so he arranges for an army officer to organize military maneuvers near town in order for factory to sponsor a big dance at which workers can find male companionship among soldiery they need what we needed when we were young he explains to a sympathetic officer anticipation runs high on both sides with girls expecting to meet young men of their dreams while recruits many of whom are actually middle aged reservists out of shape and already married look forward to a night of revelry and seduction night of party is a disappointment for some members of both groups andula and her friends are repulsed by unappealing soldiers whom they call old buffers and a trio of reservists are so nonplussed by situation that they commit a series of comic faux pas like sending a bottle of wine to wrong table and dropping a wedding ring that one of them is trying to hide only to watch it roll across floor and land at feet of young women who are objects of their lust for these people mixer is a huge flop with girls retiring to lavatory to devise a way to escape their pursuers and aging reservists arguing with each other over expenses one points out that you can only get it sex free at home and speculating on necessity of going to woods in order to consummate their romantic plans imagine in this weather for others however dance is a success factory supervisor looks on in smug satisfaction as couples throng crowded dance floor one girl holds her hands together in a gesture showing her delight and gratitude when she is asked to dance while an obese balding soldier capers with a mismatched tall thin brunette both clearly having time of their lives andula strikes up a flirtation with milda big city pianist of band providing music he reads her palm and instructs her in how to rebuff unwanted advances with a kick in shins after party she goes to bed with milda although comic frustrations continue with milda fighting a battle with a window shade that won t close before he feels secure in making love afterward as they lie in bed together andula asks what milda meant when he said she was angular he replies that a woman is shaped like a guitar and you you look like a guitar too he tells her but one painted by picasso before they part he invites her to come to prague and pay him a visit sometime although she hears nothing from milda after their night together she still expects to reunite with her dream man shortly so she breaks off with tonda who storms dormitory demanding his ring back after listening to a speech by on virtues of fidelity and commitment she packs up her suitcase and arrives on milda s doorstep in big city ready to resume their romance milda is not home and she meets his parents who have never heard of her and don t know what they should do with her milda comes home very late and after an evening of comically painful tension and uncertainty his parents decide it s only decent to put girl up for night on sofa requiring milda to climb into bed with them in order to avoid any appearance of impropriety forman has described this famous scene it s a tight fit old man wants to sleep son would like to get thrown out so he can join girl on couch but mother runs show and won t tolerate any such filthy ideas under her roof forman 148 9 andula kneeling outside door of their bedroom overhears family squabbling and when it becomes clear to her that she is not valued in least she breaks down in tears and next morning returns to her home she tells her friends about her wonderful trip to capital and how nice milda s parents were to her especially his father and then she returns to work at factory cast thumb

tonda production background thumb left milos forman milos forman s first feature film cerny petr black peter was released in 1964 and was not viewed favorably by czech governmental authorities until it was selected for competition at that year s locarno film festival where it won top prize thereby gaining approval of czechoslovakia s communist bureaucracy and making it possible for forman to pursue further projects with relative freedom unsure of what next project should be forman recalled an experience he d had driving around prague late one evening when he d encountered a young woman struggling to cross a bridge while carrying a heavy suitcase he gave her a lift and learned her story she had come to big city from varnsdorf where she had been seduced by a young engineer who had given her a phony address in zizkov and promised to take her away from her dreary life after confirming that she had been duped forman interviewed girl for much of rest of night before putting her on a train back to her home town commentators have noted that forman was particularly sensitized to such situations because when he was 10 his mother had been taken away by gestapo never to be seen again which led to years of forman traveling around searching for security with nothing but a suitcase in forman s words i guess i ll always be moved by sight of a young person with a suitcase seeking a connection in a strange city forman 147 forman recounted this memory to fellow film enthusiasts and colleagues ivan passer and jaroslav papousek and asked them if it might be basis for a good film maybe replied passer but it still needs one more thing a billiards table trio had a passion for billiards and felt that they could make a success of even weakest idea if they had ready access to a table having found a good one at castle three along with vaclav wrote a screenplay that fleshed out forman s encounter with young woman from varnsdorf forman 148 when finished script was submitted to bor production team it was approved at first only to have chief of script department pronounce it dullest thing he d read in years and urge forman not to proceed with project since it would spoil good reputation director had established with black peter in forman s words it wasn t arty enough but on other hand it didn t have enough commercial appeal either it would offend and irritate public he told me because it made fun of common man who would be disgusted by it liehm p 62 despite this objection vlastimil head of studio approved proceeding with film in part because due to political and cultural thaw in czechoslovakia at time decision makers were anxious to avoid appearance of overt administrative interference in creative process liehm pp 61 2 casting thumb memorial plaque for vladimir mensik one of few professional actors to appear in loves of a blonde forman and his colleagues were committed to strategy of casting non professionals and utilizing dialogue improvisation whenever possible most of actors were chosen from among relatives friends and acquaintances of forman and his crew to point where forman was later to liken atmosphere to making a home movie for title role forman selected his 18 year old ex sister in law hana brejchova because he had known her a long time trusted her and had great respect for her natural talents she had an amazing ability of free expression but with risk that she didn t recognize extent however vlada pucholt who played milda held her firmly in rhythm of scene in a professional position character of milda s father was played by uncle of forman s cameraman and milda s mother was played by a factory lathe operator whom passer and papousek had met on a streetcar and who struck them as someone who seemed so interested in things around her no matter how silly liehm pp 62 3 factory supervisor was played by actual public relations manager of factory at zruc nad sazavou where location shooting took place liehm 64 5 for main trio of reservists forman wanted to use non professionals including writer josef skvorecky but found that while three men did well improvising together whenever they appeared in pairs they lost their rhythm when all three were included in same shot liehm 64 so forman went to skvorecky and told writer that he looked too intelligent to play his role and replaced him with professional actor vladimir mensik in skvorecky s words to tell someone that he is too intelligent to be an actor is a very nice way of letting him know that he should stay with screen play writing milos is a very considerate person fact that he so gently threw me out made possible greatest scene of loves of a blonde forman was later to justify his decision to add a professional while nonactors keep actors honest and real actors give scene rhythm and shape that nonactors don t feel a inhabits situation so completely that he or she isn t able to view it from outside to perceive it as a rhythmic whole with its punctuation and its larger dramatic purpose nonactors are perfectly content to repeat themselves and ramble on so an actor can pull them through dramatic arch of scene and draw out emotional contours of situation forman 150 ironically least self confident performer in film was one of few professional actors vladimir pucholt who played pianist according to forman this great actor who had tremendous artistic intuition completely mistrusted his talent i think this was because he had a very rationalist disposition and could never see much less measure result of his acting was it good mr forman he asked me after every perfect shot it was excellent really really he never believed me and all of us loved him filming left thumb zruc nad sazavou was location for much of filming of loves of a blonde according to forman i remember those few months in zruc upon sazava as some of my sunniest days in movie business we had all time we needed we played billiards we choked on laughter watching pucholt fight his parents in narrow double bed since he was working with a largely non professional cast forman s operating procedure was never to share script with any of performers because if he had given them screenplay they ll take it home to read and their wives will end up directing your movie instead he chose to explain each scene in great detail just before starting to shoot takes reciting dialog from memory only one time so that when camera was rolling actors had to try to remember as much as they could of what he had told them and then improvise to best of their ability what they had forgotten or only half understood his cameraman was later to say that as a result all performers were playing milos forman playing their roles cinematographer for loves of a blonde was miroslav ondricek like forman a graduate of famu ondricek and forman had met at czechoslovakia s barrandov studios in early 1960s when ondricek was just learning to shoot feature films and forman was struggling to create his own early projects ondricek was in full accord with forman s reliance on non professional actors adopting a cinema verite style compatible with orthodox socialist realism ondricek was schooled in documentary filmmaking and as a result he insisted on performing all photographic tasks like focus lighting and composing personally while refusing access to set by all film editors saying editor can only edit what i am filming he can t use a master shot if he doesn t have it he can t make a close up if he doesn t have it this is our his and forman s job critics have often admired ondricek s success in sustaining low contrast lighting throughout film rendering a sweetly mysterious softness as if a principle of compassion existed in world alongside its cruelty big dance was film s most sustained and elaborate sequence so two cameras were used with frequent recourse to hand holding and telephoto zooming in order both to sustain documentary style look and feel and to take pressure off performers who were not always sure whether they were being included in shots during filming set was visited by british director lindsay anderson whose film this sporting life was greatly admired by forman liehm 66 anderson was so impressed by ondricek s work that he brought cameraman to england to film white bus and if announcing that he had found a person with a new sensibility a new pair of eyes ironically storyline of film was replayed in real life one of nonprofessional actresses a blonde factory worker had a torrid affair with a technician who was part of film crew although man neglected to tell her that he was married with a child he promised to send for her when he got back to prague and set her up in an apartment in capital city after waiting for a long time to hear from him and telling all her friends that she would shortly be summoned to her love nest she packed up her belongings and traveled to prague only to be spurned in no uncertain terms consequence of this situation was grimmer than denouement of film girl was embarrassed to return home became a prostitute went to jail attempted suicide and finally emigrated to australia where there was a shortage of women especially among czech emigrants forman 150 3 editing once principal photography was finished forman found himself with miles of raw material so he and his editor miroslav hajek spent many long hours organizing footage into a series of situations like big dance situation and meeting parents situation in turn each of these situations are constructed out of sequences of gags in which characters improvise in words of commentator constantin parvulescu like various instruments of a band many of these situations can be broken down into gags there are several such gags reminiscent of early comedy in loves of a blonde soldiers getting off train gag wine bottle gag wedding ring gag palm reading gag roll up blinds gag and three guys in two beds gag interspersed with these gags are extended character improvisations such as milda s discussion of picasso his mother s rants at dining table and factory supervisor s appeal for army s support additional scenes once film had been released in czechoslovakia forman sought an international distributor who informed him that film was too short for american audiences and that it didn t have enough nudity in it so forman was coerced into shooting some additional scenes that were never shown for domestic consumption liehm 68 9 one of these scenes which was included in us version involved a slapstick sequence in which milda pianist tries to pick up a buxom girl on streets of prague only to have her trick him into entering wrong bedroom of four story building in which she lives disturbing sleeping residents themes film scholar peter hames has summarized three themes of loves of a blonde that have been discussed repeatedly in critical writings on film themes that have been something of a constant throughout forman s career impermanence of young love confusion and despair of middle age and gulf between generations hames 118 another theme that is often identified involves awkwardness and confusion surrounding sex in a repressed society most critics have also commented on confluence of comedy and sadness in film s depiction of everyday life in a totalitarian state although while some consider loves of a blonde forman s most pointed critique of czech society under communism hames 119 others point out that grim conditions are not solely due to misguided public policy but that individuals create their own isolation as well slater 40 reception when loves of a blonde was first released there was a sense of betrayal on part of zruc nad sazavou shoe factory that had hosted filmmakers on location and considerable consternation among authorities at ministry of light industry with both organizations feeling that comically unlovely depiction of social conditions in czech factory towns would make it even harder to recruit workers than it already was to everyone s surprise though movie functioned as a great big classified ad in that hundreds of czech boys traveled to zruc nad sazavou and camped out in woods in hopes of hooking up with female factory workers who responded appropriately by sneaking out of their dorms at night for assignations with campers liehm 67 8 loves of a blonde sold out in theaters throughout czechoslovakia film was recipient of order of klement gottwald an award that recognized exemplary works for building of socialist homeland forman was later to say award from first communist president of land and a legendary boozer was more of an embarrassment than anything else only good thing about it was fat envelope that came with ribbon it contained 20 000 800 eur nearly a year s salary loves of a blonde was submitted to a number of major film festivals of day it was opening film of 1966 new york film festival was an invited entry in that year s london film festival and was nominated for highest prize at venice film festival shortly after it was completed it was purchased by a czech distribution company called only to be re sold as part of a multi picture package to a firm called which proceeded to air it on television through a number of 24 hour movie channels liehm 68 film was nominated for golden globe for best foreign film and academy award for best foreign language film in 1967 it was ranked no 89 in empire magazine s 100 best films of world cinema in 2010 critical response critical reaction within czechoslovakia tended to focus on film s perceived negativity with regard to social and political conditions in country and for that reason it was not distributed at all within soviet union hames 119 on whole international critics of time praised loves of a blonde slater 41 with positive reviews published by saturday review new yorker america sight and sound harper s and new york times one of film s most influential champions was jean collet writing in cahiers du cinema that by capturing momentary indiscretions of his characters on screen forman forces audience into a voyeuristic situation that induces embarrassment and laughter there were dissenting voices however phillip j hartung writing in commonweal compared film unfavorably with ivan passer s contemporaneous intimate lighting while robert hatch in nation felt that loves of a blonde was an endearing but artless film with its long central section of big dance having little to do with main plot in a lengthy article in film comment kirk bond compared ordinariness of loves of a blonde unfavorably with other czech films of period that he believed displayed greater mastery of narrative technique more recent retrospective reviews of film have been equally mixed with some critics like dennis schwartz writing that its simple but meaningful story has captured emotions of its subject in a timeless and real fashion while others like david nusair find fault presumably film s supposed to be a quirky and revealing slice of life but since central character is never developed beyond superficial it s impossible to care about her it holds a 93 rating on review aggregator website rotten tomatoes from 15 reviewers who on average scored it 8 1 on a scale of 10 legacy loves of a blonde has often been identified as one of most significant and ambitious productions of czech new wave a movement in which a group of young filmmakers many of whom were educated by national film academy in prague including forman jan kadar vera and jiri menzel among others took significant political risks by using cinema to protest hypocrisy and absurdity of communist state this movement has been attributed to a period of cultural and political reform starting in 1962 during which filmmakers were given state support but were also allowed a certain amount of relative artistic freedom enabling them to create movies with stated objective of making czech people collectively aware that they were participants in a system of oppression and incompetence which had brutalized them all in particular forman ivan passer and jaroslav papousek have collectively become known as forman school of filmmaking which combines an interest in documentary realism including consistent focus on quotidian with a surrealistic tendency to uncover hidden side of reality its comical or monstrous quality which lies just beneath everyday mishaps stutters and diane has noted that once forman came to america and created his high profile hollywood productions such as one flew over cuckoo s nest hair and amadeus he was able to introduce into commercial cinema same qualities that characterized his early films like loves of a blonde an acute observation of ironic details of mundane life an intimate understanding of emotions both projected and silenced a keen sensitivity to moment when solemnity melts into farce english director ken loach has stated that mixture of professional and non professional actors in loves of a blonde had a significant influence on him and other international filmmakers by creating an atmosphere in which non professionals who live in milieu depicted by film bring an expertise and authenticity which serves as a touchstone for everyone else in film while professionals bring knowledge of film craft which can be helpful to their inexperienced colleagues although some performers who at time were not professional later became so one of professional actors vladimir pucholt who played a major role milda pianist soon gave up acting relocated to canada and became a pediatrician in april 2019 a restored version of film was selected to be shown in cannes classics section at 2019 cannes film festival home media loves of a blonde was released in vhs video
