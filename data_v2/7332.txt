gregory s chronicle chronicle of london or ms edgerton 1995 is name given to a fifteenth century english chronicle it takes its name from its supposed author william gregory who started as a skinner in london and went on to become a london alderman sheriff from 1436 to 1437 and eventually mayor from 1450 to 1451 name gregory for manuscript is however merely a convenience as its actual authorship is unknown indeed since chronicle spans period 1189 to 1470 and william gregory died in 1467 it is impossible for him to have composed it in its entirety other fifteenth century authors have been proposed ranging from a contemporary poet to an ecclesiast but since even exact dates of its composition are also debated it has been impossible for historians to definitively attribute authorship to any known individual william gregory supposed author of chronicle william gregory was born in mildenhall suffolk he married three times and had two daughters in london he trained as a skinner and sold luxury furs to household of king henry vi he lived in parish of st mary and was alderman of cordwainer ward from 1435 for twenty six years he became sheriff and mayor in this period he left bequests to skinner s company in his will contents manuscript is a quarto volume written on paper in 223 leaves since it also contains random items not connected to chronicle itself for example poems and health advice it was clearly a commonplace book mclaren still majority of content makes up what has become known as chronicle of london and ranges from accession of richard i to deposition of edward iv it is predominantly london centric particularly pertaining to major political events such as rebellion of jack cade in 1450 and resultant harvest of heads on london bridge gate as chronicle calls it it has been suggested in fact that level of detail with which it describes revolt indicates that author witnessed it first hand chronicler likewise discusses murder of james i of scotland in 1437 amidst a discussion of london business and on occasion demonstrates humour if a politically motivated form of it occasionally author reveals a mildly sardonic view of then king henry vi although generally chronicler does not seem to care at all about king unlike say author of bale s chronicle chronicle tends towards a broader view of affairs in next decade where for example it discusses king edward iv s debasement of currency in 1464 on matters of smaller more localised concern some differences in various surviving manuscripts exist for instance in members of civic lists question of authorship gregory s chronicle is an example of contemporary trend for such works to be produced by individuals as well as institutions its authorship was originally attributed to william gregory by james gairdner in 1876 in introduction to gairdner s edition of edgerton manuscript gairdner reports thusly in a modern note written on a fly leaf at end of book it is said that author of chronicle was one gregory skinner meaning william gregory of skinners company who was mayor of london in 1451 thirtieth year of henry vi and when we turn to chronicle itself fact seems to be pretty well borne out by what author himself says in record of that year gairdner based his conclusion on a 1452 3 entry in chronicle in which author namechecks gregory as mayor manuscript tells us that that year came a legate from pope of rome with great pardon for that pardon was greatest pardon that ever come to england from conquest unto this time of my year being mayor of london and colophon at end of paragraph saying that gregory skinner mayor of london anno xxx thus it has been suggested he drew attention to himself on other hand it has been pointed out that very mention of gregory s mayoralty which gave this chronicle its name has also been of specific interest to other contemporary writers mclaren 33 n 69 only part of gregory s chronicle could actually have been written by gregory as it continues to 1470 three years after gregory s own death kingsford recognised this dilemma himself in 1876 but a balance of probabilities tended to confirm him in his original it has also been surmised that he wrote portion covering 1440s with remainder being work of an anonymous author writing in 1470s even so out of numerous medieval chronicles of this period it is one which has caused most debate among historians about its authorship this is generally because although it continues after gregory s death it also appears to have been written in same neat hand throughout albeit with last three years being stylistically different from preceding ones indeed a late victorian antiquarian kriehn posited that william gregory was in fact never chronicle s original composer kriehn s suggestion was rejected by c s l kingsford and gregory s authorship of first part of chronicle has been generally accepted ever since kingsford suggested a continuator and identified a break in compositional style at 1454 point and that therefore it was there that another author took over kingsford s contemporary james gairdner believed gregory could have stopped writing at points in his career as distant as year of his mayoralty in 1451 to his death in 1467 more recently it has been proposed that true author was henry a poet whom gregory would have known well since they are both mentioned in will of a prominent london merchant in july 1434 j a f thomson has suggested that actually chronicler was a churchman due among other things to quantity of latin aphorisms later text contains compared with pre 1467 section either way thomson agrees that whoever it was must have been a man with london connections and a pride in city one of most recent biographers gregory has noted how in fact a single reference to a papal indulgence issued in 1455 associates gregory personally with this chronicle but extent of his authorship is uncertain for instance michael hicks goes no further than to suggest tentatively that of all london chroniclers at least one was a mayor whilst jeremy catto believes that that we can identify no particular individual writer mary rose mclaren summed up problem facing historians wishing to establish authorship of edgerton ms when she pointed out that comparing gregory s chronicle with others of period there is more than one mayor named in it and that in any case it is not only one to name gregory as mayor of london during that time mclaren pp 29 31 n 47 references category 1467 deaths category medieval books category medieval london category medieval manuscripts
