rock springs massacre also known as rock springs riot occurred on september 2 1885 in present day united states city of rock springs in sweetwater county wyoming riot and resulting massacre of immigrant chinese miners by white immigrant miners was result of racial prejudice toward chinese miners who were perceived to be taking jobs from white miners union pacific coal department found it economically beneficial to give preference in hiring to chinese miners who were willing to work for lower wages than their white counterparts angering white miners when rioting ended at least 28 chinese miners were dead and 15 were injured rioters burned 78 chinese homes resulting in approximately us 150 000 in property damage in present day terms tension between whites and chinese immigrants in late 19th century american west was particularly high especially in decade preceding violence massacre in rock springs was one among several instances of violence culminating from years of anti chinese sentiment in united states 1882 chinese exclusion act suspended chinese immigration for ten years but not before thousands of immigrants came to american west most chinese immigrants to wyoming territory took jobs with railroad at first but many ended up employed in coal mines owned by union pacific railroad as chinese immigration increased so did anti chinese sentiment on part of whites knights of labor one of foremost voices against chinese immigrant labor formed a chapter in rock springs in 1883 and most rioters were members of that organization however no direct connection was ever established linking riot to national knights of labor organization in immediate aftermath of riot federal troops were deployed in rock springs they escorted surviving chinese miners most of whom had fled to evanston wyoming back to rock springs a week after riot reaction came swiftly from era s publications in rock springs local newspaper endorsed outcome of riot while in other wyoming newspapers support for riot was limited to sympathy for causes of white miners massacre in rock springs touched off a wave of anti chinese violence especially in puget sound area of washington

workers chinese workers soon became an asset to union pacific and worked along up lines and in up coal mines from laramie to evanston most chinese workers in wyoming ended up working in sweetwater county but a large number settled in carbon and uinta counties most chinese people in area were men working in mine 1870 census showed that in uinta and sweetwater counties which at time ran from utah colorado border to montana territory border 96 chinese laborers living there were miners there were no other occupations listed for chinese nor were there any chinese females racism against chinese immigrants was widespread and largely uncontroversial at time tucker in aforementioned 1884 article referred to asian immigrants as asiatic race alien in blood habits and civilization he also noted chinese are chief element in this asiatic population thumb left a typical 19th century chinese american mining camp in 1874 75 after labor unrest disrupted coal production union pacific coal department hired chinese laborers to work in their coal mines throughout southern wyoming even so chinese population rose slowly at first however where there were chinese immigrants they were generally concentrated in one area at red desert a remote section camp in sweetwater county there were 20 inhabitants of whom 12 were chinese all 12 were laborers who worked under an american foreman to east of red desert was another remote section camp washakie an american section foreman lived there amongst 23 others including 13 chinese laborers and an irish crew foreman in various section

populace denby s predictions caused bayard to seek a congressionally appropriated indemnity at bayard s urging u s congress provided us 147 748 74 as an indemnity compensation was made as a monetary

418 p 2 among events of anti chinese violence in american west rock springs massacre is considered most widely publicized today nearly all historians hold view that prime factor which contributed to riot was race prejudice daniels incident at bitter creek pp 144 45 however a 1990 work on rock springs massacre written by journalist craig storti marginalized racial factor and put a stronger emphasis on economic factors which contributed to violence his book incident at bitter creek rock springs massacre was widely criticized in reviews chan incident at bitter creek armentrout ma incident at bitter creek hardaway incident at bitter creek though storti stated he represented historical record as it stood roger daniels a scholar of chinese immigration in his own right criticized storti s work daniels asserted that storti believed massacre was failure of chinese to become integrated into american culture see hane asian america storti responded to review in a letter stating in part mr daniels numerous inaccurate statements rival those he claims to have found in my text see storti and daniels communication letter from storti there were labor considerations that contributed to violence in rock springs though they are generally seen as less significant use of chinese workers by railroad during an 1875 strike created widespread resentment among white miners which continued to build until rock springs massacre storti s book described anti chinese racism as pervasive even while downplaying its significance to riot view that chinese refused to assimilate into american culture was held historically and still carries some weight in present day interpretations of historical record present day rock springs has a population pushing 20 000 former settlement is a full fledged
