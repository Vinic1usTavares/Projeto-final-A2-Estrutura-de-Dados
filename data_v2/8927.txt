to their autumn records label they discovered beau brummels performing at morocco room a club in nearby san mateo and signed band shortly thereafter donahue and mitchell were eager to capitalize on beatlemania a phenomenon surrounding beatles that originated several years before in germany and was spreading across u s by this time beau brummels had taken their name a british term for a term for an excessively well dressed person suggested to them which lead singer valentino maintained they didn t even know how to spell in a 2008 interview with goldmine magazine valentine explained we just needed a name and that sounded good we didn t even know how to spell it even harmonies of laugh laugh were reminiscent of popular british acts of time such as beatles and zombies however songwriter guitarist ron elliott said song was directly influenced not by uk bands but by u s pop group four seasons elliott grew up writing music inspired by theatrical composers such as george gershwin and jerome kern as well as country music artist lefty frizzell after forming beau brummels with lead vocalist sal valentino elliott wanted to create simplified music that had mainstream appeal he noted that laugh laugh had a very complex chord structure but instead of using major seventh chords and passing chords that i prefer i wrote song in flat major and minor keys using a simplified tonal structure elliott said he liked using minor keys as he believed they added an element of mystery to music similar to that of james bond films lyrically laugh laugh describes a rejected lover who takes pleasure in revenge when someone rejects one who had rejected him song features a harmonica played by declan mulligan throughout tune single version of laugh laugh universally heard in 1965 when it was a hit fades out during second iteration of line lonely oh so lonely full version does not fade out but rather ends cold on an e chord as most oldies radio stations today play songs provided by a

edited out of single release song was produced by autumn house producer sylvester stewart who later gained fame as sly stone of sly family stone valentino recalled band s recording sessions with stone he was only about nineteen or twenty when we worked with him it was before all of his reputation came to be that everybody knows him for now valentino added he was a cheerleader he could play everything if we needed him to he was great he was guy in san francisco who knew how to make a record in studio there was nobody before him elliott agreed saying stone was a positive influence on band because of his talent intelligence and experience release and reception laugh laugh was released in december 1964 seven months after band s formation in january 1965 song entered billboard hot 100 at
