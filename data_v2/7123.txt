battle of long island also known as battle of brooklyn and battle of brooklyn heights was a military action of american revolutionary war fought on august 27 1776 at western edge of long island in present day borough of brooklyn new york british defeated americans and gained control of strategically important port of new york which they held for rest of war it was first major battle to take place after united states declared its independence on july 4 1776 and in troop deployment and combat it was largest battle of entire war after defeating british in siege of boston on march 17 1776 commander in chief george washington relocated continental army to defend port city of new york located at southern end of manhattan island washington understood that city s harbor would provide an excellent base for royal navy so he established defenses there and waited for british to attack in july british under command of general william howe landed a few miles across harbor on sparsely populated staten island where they were reinforced by a fleet of ships in lower new york bay during next month and a half bringing their total force to 32 000 troops washington knew difficulty in holding city with british fleet in control of entrance to harbor at narrows and accordingly moved bulk of his forces to manhattan believing that it would be first target on august 22 british landed on shores of gravesend bay in southwest kings county across narrows from staten island and more than a dozen miles south from established east river crossings to manhattan after five days of waiting british attacked u s defenses on guan heights unknown to americans however howe had brought his main army around their rear and attacked their flank soon after americans panicked resulting in twenty percent losses through casualties and capture although a stand by 400 maryland and delaware troops prevented a more substantial portion of army from being lost remainder of army retreated to main defenses on brooklyn heights british dug in for a siege but on night of august 29 30 washington evacuated entire army to manhattan without loss of supplies or a single life continental army was driven out of new york entirely after several more defeats and forced to retreat through new jersey and into pennsylvania prelude to battle in first stage of war british army was trapped in peninsular city of boston and were forced to abandon it on march 17 sailing to halifax nova scotia to await reinforcements washington then began to transfer regiments to new york city which he believed british would attack next because of port s strategic importance washington left boston on april 4 arrived at new york on april 13 and established headquarters at former home of archibald kennedy on broadway facing bowling green washington had sent his second in command charles lee ahead to new york previous february to establish city s defenses lee remained in new york city until march when continental congress sent him to south carolina construction of city s defenses was left to general william alexander lord stirling troops were in limited supply so washington found defenses incomplete but lee had concluded that in any case it would be impossible to hold city with british commanding sea he reasoned that defenses should be located with ability to inflict heavy casualties upon british if any move was made to take and hold ground barricades and redoubts were established in and around city and bastion of fort stirling was built across east river in brooklyn heights facing city lee also saw that immediate area was cleared of loyalists strategy thumb american strategy called for first line of defense to be based on heights of guan a series of hills which stretched northeast across king s county main defensive works were a series of forts and entrenchments located in northwest of county in and around brooklyn road to narrows is gowanus road no 5 is old stone house map by bernard based on his 1766 1767 survey washington began moving troops to brooklyn in early may and there were several thousand of them there in a short time three more forts were under construction on eastern side of east river to support fort stirling which stood to west of hamlet of brooklyn heights these new fortifications were fort putnam fort greene and fort box named for major daniel box they lay from north to south with fort putnam farthest to north greene slightly to southwest and box slightly farther southwest each of these defensive structures was surrounded by a large ditch all connected by a line of entrenchments and a total of 36 cannons fort defiance was also being constructed at this time located farther southwest past fort box near present day red hook in addition to these new forts a mounted battery was established on governors island cannons were placed at fort george facing bowling green and more cannons were placed at whitehall dock which sat on east river hulks were sunk at strategic locations to deter british from entering east river and other waterways mccullough 2006 washington had been authorized by congress to recruit an army of up to 28 501 troops but he had only 19 000 when he reached new york military discipline was inadequate routine orders were not carried out muskets were fired in camp flints were ruined bayonets were used as knives to cut food and firearm readiness was lax petty internal conflict was common under strain of a large number of people from different environments and temperaments living in relative proximity commander of artillery henry knox persuaded washington to transfer 400 to 500 soldiers who lacked muskets or guns to crew artillery in early june knox and general nathanael greene inspected land at north end of manhattan and decided to establish fort washington fort constitution later renamed fort lee was planned opposite fort washington on hudson river forts were intended to discourage british ships from sailing up hudson river british arrival left thumb british fleet in lower bay harpers magazine 1876 depicts british fleet amassing off shores of staten island in summer of 1776 on june 28 washington learned that british fleet had set sail from halifax on june 9 and were heading toward new york on june 29 signals were sent from men stationed on staten island indicating that british fleet had appeared within a few hours 45 british ships dropped anchor in lower new york bay less than a week later there were 130 ships off staten island under command of richard howe brother of general howe population of new york went into panic at sight of british ships alarms went off and troops immediately rushed to their posts on july 2 british troops began to land on staten island continental regulars on island took a few shots at them before fleeing and citizens militia switched over to british side on july 6 news reached new york that congress had voted for independence four days earlier on tuesday july 9 at 18 00 washington had several brigades march onto commons of city to hear declaration of independence read after end of reading a mob ran down to bowling green with ropes and bars where they tore down gilded lead equestrian statue of george iii of great britain in their fury crowd cut off statue s head severed nose and mounted what remained of head on a spike outside a tavern and rest of statue was dragged to connecticut and melted down into musket balls on july 12 british ships phoenix and rose sailed up harbor toward mouth of hudson american batteries opened fire at fort george red hook and governors island and british returned fire into city ships sailed along new jersey shore and continued up hudson sailing past fort washington and arriving by nightfall at tarrytown widest part of hudson goals of british ships were to cut off american supplies from new england and north and to encourage loyalist support only casualties of day were six americans who were killed when their own cannon blew up next day july 13 howe attempted to open negotiations with americans he sent a letter to washington delivered by lieutenant philip brown who arrived under a flag of truce letter was addressed george washington esq brown was met by joseph reed who had hurried to waterfront on washington s orders accompanied by henry knox and samuel webb washington asked his officers whether it should be received or not as it did not recognize his rank as general and they unanimously said no reed told brown that there was no one in army with that address on july 16 howe tried again this time with address george washington esq etc etc but it was again declined next day howe sent captain nisbet balfour to ask if washington would meet with howe s adjutant face to face and a meeting was scheduled for july 20 howe s adjutant was colonel james patterson patterson told washington that howe had come with powers to grant pardons but washington said those who have committed no fault want no pardon patterson departed soon after washington s performance during meeting was praised in parts of colonies thumb british troops in type of flat bottomed boat used for invasion of long island hessians in their blue uniforms are in two boats that are only partly visible meanwhile british ships continued to arrive on august 1 45 ships arrived with generals henry clinton and charles cornwallis along with 3 000 troops by august 12 3 000 more british troops and another 8 000 hessians had arrived at this point british fleet numbered over 400 ships including 73 war ships and 32 000 troops were camped on staten island faced with this large force washington was unsure as to where british would attack both greene and reed thought that british would attack long island but washington felt that a british attack on long island might be a diversion for main attack on manhattan he broke his army in half stationing half of it on manhattan and other half on long island army on long island was commanded by greene on august 20 greene became ill and was forced to move to a house in manhattan where he rested to recover john sullivan was placed in command until greene was well enough to resume command thumb left denyse s ferry first place at which hessians and british landed on long island august 22 1776 by a brown this high point overlooking narrows was an american artillery position and was bombarded by british before invasion but actual landing took place farther east at gravesend bay around to left from perspective of this illustration where conditions were more favorable for small british boats carrying troops invasion of long island at 05 10 on august 22 an advance guard of 4 000 british troops left staten island under command of clinton and cornwallis to land on long island at 08 00 all 4 000 troops landed unopposed on shore of gravesend bay colonel edward hand s pennsylvanian riflemen had been stationed on shore but they did not oppose landings and fell back killing cattle and burning farmhouses on way by noon 15 000 troops had landed on shore along with 40 pieces of artillery as hundreds of loyalists came to greet british troops cornwallis pushed on with advance guard advancing six miles onto island and establishing a camp at village of flatbush he was given orders to advance no further thumb british military map from 1776 showing marching routes and battle sites during battle of long island washington received word of landings same day but was informed that number was 8 000 to 9 000 troops this convinced him that it was feint which he had predicted and therefore he only sent 1 500 more troops to brooklyn bringing total number of troops on long island to 6 000 on august 24 washington replaced sullivan with israel putnam who commanded troops on long island putnam arrived on long island next day along with six battalions also that day british troops on long island received 5 000 hessian reinforcements bringing their total to 20 000 there was little fighting on days immediately after landing although some small skirmishes did take place with american marksmen armed with rifles picking off british troops from time to time american plan was for putnam to direct defenses from brooklyn heights while sullivan and stirling and their troops would be stationed on guan heights guan hills were up to 150 feet high and blocked most direct route to brooklyn heights washington believed that by stationing men on heights heavy casualties could be inflicted on british before troops fell back to main defenses at brooklyn heights there were three main passes through heights gowanus road farthest to west flatbush road slightly farther to east in center of american line where it was expected that british would attack and bedford road farthest to east stirling was responsible for defending gowanus road with 500 men and sullivan was to defend flatbush and bedford roads where there were 1 000 and 800 men respectively six thousand troops were to remain behind at brooklyn heights there was one lesser known pass through heights farther to east called jamaica pass which was defended by just five militia officers on horses on british side general clinton learned of almost undefended jamaica pass from local loyalists he drew up a plan and gave it to william erskine to propose to howe clinton s plan had main army making a night march and going through jamaica pass to turn american flank while other troops would keep americans busy in front on august 26 clinton received word from howe that plan would be used and that clinton was to command advance guard of main army of 10 000 men on march through jamaica pass while they made night march general james grant s british troops along with some hessians a total of 4 000 men were to attack americans in front to distract them from main army coming on their flank howe told clinton to be ready to move out that night august 26 battle night march thumb left upright 1 2 howard s tavern as it appeared in 1776 it was demolished in 1880 tavern was located near present day intersection of fulton street and jamaica avenue at 21 00 british moved out no one except commanders knew of plan clinton led a crack brigade of light infantry with fixed bayonets in front followed by cornwallis who had eight battalions and 14 artillery pieces cornwallis was followed by howe and hugh percy with six battalions more artillery and baggage column consisted of 10 000 men who stretched out over two miles three loyalist farmers led column toward jamaica pass british had left their campfires burning to deceive americans into thinking that nothing was happening column headed northeast until it reached what later became village of new lots when it headed directly north toward heights column had yet to run into any american troops when they reached howard s tavern also known as howard s half way house just a few hundred yards from jamaica pass tavern keeper william howard and his son william jr were forced to act as guides to show british way to rockaway foot path an old indian trail that skirted jamaica pass to west located today in cemetery of evergreens five minutes after leaving tavern five american militia officers stationed at pass were captured without a shot fired as they thought that british were americans clinton interrogated men and they informed him that they were only troops guarding pass by dawn british were through pass and stopped so that troops could rest at 09 00 they fired two heavy cannons to signal hessian troops below battle pass to begin their frontal assault against sullivan s men deployed on two hills flanking pass while clinton s troops simultaneously flanked american positions from east william howard jr describes meeting howe it was about two in morning of august 27 that i was awakened by seeing a soldier at side of my bed i got up and dressed and went down to barroom where i saw my father standing in one corner with three british soldiers before him with muskets and bayonets fixed army was then lying in field in front of house general howe and another officer were in barroom general howe wore a cloak over his regimentals after asking for a glass of liquor from bar which was given him he entered into familiar conversation with my father and among other things said i must have some one of you to show me over rockaway path around pass my father replied we belong to other side general and can t serve you against our duty general howe replied that is alright stick to your country or stick to your principles but howard you are my prisoner and must guide my men over hill my father made some further objection but was silenced by general who said you have no alternative if you refuse i shall shoot you through head thumb upright 1 4 right a view from battle hill highest point in king s county looking west toward upper new york harbor and new jersey beyond here on lord stirling s left flank about 300 americans under colonel atlee and general parsons repulsed successive attacks by british after taking hill and inflicted highest casualties against british during battle of long island grant s diversionary attack at about 23 00 on august 26 first shots were fired in battle of long island near red lion inn near present day 39th street and 4th avenue american pickets from samuel john atlee s pennsylvania regiment fired upon two british soldiers who were foraging in a watermelon patch near inn around 01 00 on august 27 british approached vicinity of red lion with 200 300 troops american troops fired upon british after approximately two fusillades they fled up gowanus road toward vechte cortelyou house major edward burd had been in command but he was captured along with a lieutenant and 15 privates john j gallagher battle of brooklyn 1776 p 33 this first engagement was fought in vicinity of 38th and 39th streets between 2nd and 3rd avenues near a swamp located adjacent to gowanus road brigadier general samuel holden parsons and colonel atlee were stationed farther north on gowanus road parsons was a lawyer from connecticut who had recently secured a commission in continental army atlee was a veteran of french and indian war in command of first regiment of pennsylvania musketry putnam had been awakened by a guard at 03 00 and told that british were attacking through gowanus pass he lit signals to washington who was on manhattan and then rode south to warn stirling of attack stirling led two units of colonel john haslet s 1st delaware regiment under immediate command of major thomas macdonough and colonel william smallwood s 1st maryland infantry under immediate command of major mordecai gist both haslet and smallwood were on courts martial duty in manhattan following close behind was parson s connecticut regiment with 251 men stirling led this combined force to reinforce parsons and atlee and stop british advance stirling had a total of 1 600 troops at his command stirling placed atlee s men in an apple orchard owned by bennett on south side of gowanus road near present day 3rd avenue and 18th street upon approach of british americans took possession of a hill about two miles from camp and detached colonel atlee to meet them further on road in about sixty rods he drew up and received enemy s fire and gave them a well directed fire from his regiment which did great execution and then retreated to hill general parsons stirling took up positions with delaware and maryland regiments just to north of atlee s men on slopes of a rise of land between 18th and 20th streets some of maryland troops were positioned on a small hill near 23rd street which local dutch called blokje berg dutch for cube or block hill at base of this hill gowanus road crossed a small bridge over a ditch which drained a marshy area when british advanced up gowanus road american troops fired upon them from positions on north side of ditch to left was colonel peter s pennsylvania regiment just to southeast of blokje berg were a few hills amongst them was a hill which is highest point in king s county at 220 feet which came to be known as battle hill in what is today greenwood cemetery by cemetery s boundary of 23rd street and 7th avenue british attempted to outflank american positions by taking this hill americans tried to prevent british move sending troops under parsons and atlee to take hill british got there first but americans were able to dislodge them in fierce fighting battle hill was site of especially brutal fighting with americans inflicting highest number of casualties against british troops during entire battle of long island among those killed was british colonel james grant which led americans to believe that they had killed general james grant he was alleged to have been shot by a pennsylvanian rifleman who had been sniping at british from up in a tree among american dead was pennsylvania colonel caleb parry who was killed while rallying his troops americans were still unaware that this was not main british attack in part due to ferocity of fighting and number of british troops engaged battle pass thumb battle pass also known as flatbush pass is located in modern day prospect park here general sullivan and his troops were outflanked by british who attacked from rear while hessians attacked up battle pass lithograph c 1866 hessians in center under command of general von heister began to bombard american lines stationed at battle pass under command of general john sullivan hessian brigades did not attack as they were waiting for pre arranged signal from british who were in process of outflanking american lines at that time americans were still under assumption that grant s attack up gowanus road was main thrust and sullivan sent four hundred of his men to reinforce stirling howe fired his signal guns at 09 00 and hessians began to attack up battle pass while main army came at sullivan from rear sullivan left his advance guard to hold off hessians while he turned rest of his force around to fight british heavy casualties mounted between americans and british and men on both sides fled out of fear sullivan attempted to calm his men and tried to lead a retreat by this point hessians had overrun advance guard on heights and american left had completely collapsed hand to hand fighting followed with americans swinging their muskets and rifles like clubs to save their own lives it was later claimed americans who surrendered were bayoneted by hessians sullivan despite chaos managed to evacuate most of his men to brooklyn heights though he himself was captured vechte cortelyou house at 09 00 washington arrived from manhattan he realized that he had been wrong about a feint on long island and he ordered more troops to brooklyn from manhattan his location on battlefield is not known because accounts differ but most likely he was at brooklyn heights where he could view battle stirling still held line against grant on american right to west he held on for four hours still unaware of british flanking maneuver and some of his own troops thought that they were winning day because british had been unable to take their position however grant was reinforced by 2 000 marines and he hit stirling s center by 11 00 and stirling was attacked on his left by hessians stirling pulled back but british troops were coming at him from rear south down gowanus road only escape route left was across a brouwer s on gowanus creek which was 80 yards wide on other side of brooklyn heights maryland 400 stirling ordered all of his troops to cross creek except a contingent of maryland troops under command of gist this group became known to history as maryland 400 although they numbered about 260 270 men stirling and gist led troops in a rear guard action against overwhelming numbers of british troops which surpassed 2 000 supported by two cannons stirling and gist led marylanders in two attacks against british who were in fixed positions in and in front of vechte cortelyou house known today as old stone house after last assault remaining troops retreated across gowanus creek some of men who tried to cross marsh were bogged down in mud and under musket fire and others who could not swim were captured stirling was surrounded and unwilling to surrender broke through british lines to von heister s hessians and surrendered to them two hundred fifty six maryland troops were killed in assaults in front of old stone house and fewer than a dozen made it back to american lines washington watched from a redoubt on nearby cobble hill intersection of today s court street and atlantic avenue and reportedly said good god what brave fellows i must this day lose disengagement american troops who were not killed or captured escaped behind fortified american positions centered on brooklyn heights howe then ordered all of his troops to halt attack despite protests of many officers in his command who believed that they should push on to brooklyn heights in a move denounced by analysts as a bad mistake howe had decided against a direct frontal assault on entrenched american positions choosing instead to begin a siege and setting up lines of circumvallation around american positions he believed americans to be essentially trapped with his troops blocking escape by land and royal navy in control of east river which they would have to cross to reach manhattan island howe s failure to press attack and reasons for it have been disputed he may have wished to avoid casualties that his army suffered when attacking continentals under similar circumstances at battle of bunker hill he may also have been giving washington an opportunity to conclude that his position was hopeless and surrender in european gentleman officer tradition howe told parliament in 1779 that his essential duty was to avoid excessive british casualties for insufficient purpose and capturing brooklyn heights would likely not have meant capturing entire american army most essential duty i had to observe was not wantonly to commit his majesty s troops where object was inadequate i knew well that any considerable loss sustained by army could not speedily nor easily be repaired loss of 1 000 or perhaps 1 500 british troops in carrying those lines would have been but ill repaid by double that number of enemy could it have been supposed they would have suffered in that proportion p 5 aftermath left thumb u s army artillery retreat from long

surrounded on brooklyn heights with east river to their backs as day went on british began to dig trenches slowly coming closer to american defenses by doing this british would not have to cross over open ground to assault american defenses as they did in boston year before despite this perilous situation washington ordered 1 200 more men from manhattan to brooklyn on august 28 men that came over were two pennsylvania regiments and colonel john glover s regiment from marblehead massachusetts in command of pennsylvanian troops was thomas mifflin who after arriving volunteered to inspect outer defenses and report back to washington in these outer defenses small skirmishes were still taking place on afternoon of august 28 it began to rain and washington had his cannons bombard british well into night as rain continued george washington sent a letter instructing general william heath who was at kings bridge between manhattan and what is now bronx to send every flat bottomed boat and sloop without delay in case battalions of infantry from new jersey came to reinforce their position at 16 00 on august 29 washington held a meeting with his generals mifflin advised washington to retreat to manhattan while mifflin and his pennsylvania regiments made up rear guard holding line until rest of army had withdrawn generals agreed unanimously with mifflin that retreat was best option and washington had orders go out by evening troops were told that they were to gather up all their ammunition and baggage and prepare for a night attack by 21 00 sick and wounded began to move to brooklyn ferry in preparation for evacuation at 23 00 glover and his massachusetts men who were sailors and fishermen began to evacuate troops as more troops were evacuated more were ordered to withdraw from lines and march to ferry landing wagon wheels were muffled and men were forbidden to talk mifflin s rear guard was tending campfires to deceive british at 04 00 on august 30 mifflin was informed that it was his unit s turn to evacuate mifflin told man who had been sent to order him to leave major alexander scammell that he must be mistaken but scammell insisted that he was not and mifflin ordered his troops to move out when mifflin s troops were within a half mile of ferry landing washington rode up and demanded to know why they were not at their defenses edward hand who was leading troops tried to explain what had happened but mifflin arrived shortly washington exclaimed good god general mifflin i am afraid you have ruined us mifflin explained that he had been told that it was his turn to evacuate by scammell washington told him it had been a mistake mifflin then led his troops back to outer defenses artillery supplies and troops were all being evacuated across river at this time but it was not going as fast as washington had anticipated and daybreak soon came a fog settled in and concealed evacuation from british british patrols noticed that there did not seem to be any american pickets and thus began to search area while they were doing this washington last man left stepped onto last boat at 07 00 last american troops landed in manhattan all 9 000 troops had been evacuated with no loss of life conclusion of campaign thumb right british fleet in new york harbor just after battle british were stunned to find that washington and army had escaped later in day
