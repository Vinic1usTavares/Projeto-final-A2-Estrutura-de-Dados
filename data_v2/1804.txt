scharnhorst class was last traditional class of armored cruisers built by kaiserliche marine class comprised two ships and they were larger than s that preceded them extra size was used primarily to increase main armament of 21 cm 8 2 inch guns from four to eight ships were first german cruiser to reach equality with their british counterparts ships were named after 19th century prussian army reformers gerhard von scharnhorst and august von gneisenau built for overseas service scharnhorst and gneisenau were assigned to east asia squadron in 1909 and 1910 respectively scharnhorst relieved old armored cruiser as squadron flagship which had been on station since 1900 both ships had short careers shortly before outbreak of world war i ships departed german colony at tsingtao on 1 november 1914 ships destroyed a british force at battle of coronel and inflicted upon royal navy its first defeat since battle of plattsburgh in 1814 east asia squadron including both scharnhorst class ships was subsequently annihilated at battle of falkland islands on 8 december design thumb left of preceding basis for scharnhorst design second naval law in germany passed in 1900 envisioned a force of fourteen armored cruisers for both service overseas in germany s colonial empire and as scouts for main battle fleet in german waters naval expansion program was primarily directed against british royal navy then world s preeminent naval force germany s armored cruiser force followed a series of iterative developments based on cruiser and scharnhorst class represented culmination of that evolutionary development during design process for class general department issued a request that new cruisers be capable of fighting in line of battle in event that german battleships were damaged and unable to continue fighting up to this point this had not been a consideration in german armored cruiser construction and so a significant increase in both firepower and armor protection would be required to accommodate it this in turn required much larger ships and scharnhorsts were accordingly about heavier than preceding s weight increase secured a doubling of main battery a 50 increase in belt armor and an increase in top speed by more than a knot over roon class speed increase was achieved by addition of two boilers that provided more power for propulsion system as a result of these improvements scharnhorst class was first german armored cruiser design that compared favorably to its foreign counterparts several other minor changes were introduced including a strengthening of tertiary battery of guns to level used in contemporary battleships like design staff considered adding a pair of these guns to conning tower roof abreast of bridge but experience with same arrangement on s demonstrated excessive blast effect interfered with control of ships and so those guns were suppressed in scharnhorst design general characteristics and machinery thumb left line drawing of scharnhorst class ships of class were long overall and long at waterline they had a beam of a draft of and displaced standard and at full load ships hulls were constructed of transverse and longitudinal steel frames over which outer hull plating was riveted vessels had 15 watertight compartments and a double bottom that ran for 50 of length of hull ships had a standard crew of 38 officers and 726 enlisted men scharnhorst as squadron flagship had a larger crew including an additional 14 officers and 62 men gneisenau when serving as squadron second command flagship had an extra staff of 3 officers and 25 men ships carried a number of smaller vessels including two picket boats two launches one pinnace two cutters three yawls and one dinghy scharnhorst class ships used same powerplant as in preceding three 3 cylinder triple expansion engines each engine drove a single propeller center shaft on scharnhorst was in diameter while outer two were wide gneisenaus screws were slightly smaller at wide on center shaft and on outer pair triple expansion engines were supplied with steam by 18 coal fired marine type boilers with 36 fire boxes engines were designed to provide though on trials they achieved higher figures 28 782 ihp for scharnhorst and 30 396 ihp for gneisenau ships were rated at a top speed of though on trials scharnhorst steamed at a maximum of while gneisenau ran at vessels carried of coal normally though they were capable of storing up to of coal this provided a maximum range of at a cruising speed of ships had a single rudder vessels electrical plant consisted of four turbo generators that delivered 260 kilowatts at 110 volts armament thumb forward gun turret on scharnhorst alt a large turret with two guns on a warship ships main battery armament consisted of eight sk l 40 guns four in twin gun turrets one fore and one aft of main superstructure on centerline and remaining four were mounted in single wing turrets located amidships centerline turrets were drl c 01 type turrets which were hydraulically operated and mounts provided a range of elevation from 5 to 30 degrees wing turrets used electric motors to train guns but elevation was hand operated these guns fired a armor piercing shell at a muzzle velocity of centerline turrets had a maximum range of while wing turrets could only engage targets out to guns were supplied with a total of 700 rounds secondary armament included six sk l 40 guns in individual casemates these guns fired a shell at a muzzle velocity of they could be elevated to 30 degrees which provided a maximum range of for close range defense against torpedo boats ships carried a tertiary battery of eighteen 8 8 cm sk l 35 guns which were mounted in individual casemates and pivot mounts in superstructure 8 8 cm guns fired a shell at a muzzle velocity of these guns had a maximum elevation of 25 degrees and a range of as was customary for warships of period scharnhorst class ships were equipped with four submerged torpedo tubes one was mounted in bow one on each broadside and fourth was placed in stern ships were supplied with a total of 11 torpedoes c 03 torpedo carried a warhead and had a range of when set at a speed of and at armor as was standard for german warships ships of scharnhorst class were protected by krupp armor they had an armor belt that was thick in central portion of ship extending from abreast forward conning tower to just aft of rear tower where propulsion machinery areas were located this was a significant increase in thickness over earlier german armored cruisers tests at navy s firing range at meppen had revealed that belt used in all preceding designs was too thin to stop medium caliber shells that cruisers would likely face in combat belt decreased to on either end of central citadel this extended all way to bow and almost completely to stern extreme end of which was not armored entire belt was backed with teak planking main armored deck ranged in thickness from over critical areas and down to elsewhere deck sloped down to connect to belt at its lower edge this portion was between thick forward conning tower had thick sides and a thick roof rear conning tower was less well armored with sides that were only thick and a roof that was thick main battery gun turrets had thick sides and thick roofs while amidships guns were protected with thick gun shields and thick roofs barbettes that supported turrets were thick 15 cm battery was protected by a strake of armor that was thick while guns themselves were protected with thick shields ships name builder namesake laid down launched commissioned blohm voss gerhard von january june october weser august graf neidhardt von december june 19066 march 1908 service history upon commissioning both ships of class were assigned to german east asia squadron with scharnhorst serving as admiral maximilian von spee s flagship scharnhorst and gneisenau were regarded as well trained vessels both ships won awards for their excellence at gunnery at start of world war i two ships were in caroline islands on a routine cruise rest of von spee s squadron was dispersed around pacific declaration of war by japan on germany convinced von spee to consolidate his force with cruisers and from american station and head for chile to refuel flotilla would then attempt to return to germany via atlantic ocean admiral von spee also intended to attack three british cruisers under command of admiral christopher cradock and any british shipping encountered on 22 september scharnhorst and gneisenau approached island of papeete in french polynesia with intention of seizing coal stockpiled in harbor ships conducted a short bombardment that resulted in sinking of old gunboat however von spee feared that harbor had been mined and decided to avoid risk french had also set fire to coal stocks to prevent germans from using coal battle of coronel thumb german squadron background leaving valparaiso on 3 november after battle scharnhorst and gneisenau in lead and nurnberg following in middle distance are several vessels of chilean fleet alt a group of large warships steaming slowly off a city at approximately 17 00 on 1 november 1914 east asia squadron encountered cradock s ships off coronel because german ships had an advantage in speed von spee was able to keep distance to 18 kilometers before closing to to engage british flotilla at 19 00 scharnhorst hit some 34 times at least one of shells penetrated good hopes ammunition magazines which resulted in a tremendous explosion that destroyed ship light cruiser closed to point blank range to attack after a severe pummeling monmouth sank as well british light cruiser and auxiliary cruiser both escaped under cover of darkness first sea lord jackie fisher remarked that it was saddest naval action of war defeat was first to be inflicted on royal navy since 1814 battle of plattsburgh after news of battle reached kaiser wilhelm ii in berlin he ordered 300 iron crosses to be awarded to men of von spee s squadron after refueling in valparaiso east asia squadron departed for falkland islands in order to destroy

bottom another large warship is seen in distance afire and shooting its guns some six hours after news of battle reached england admiral fisher ordered admiral john jellicoe commander of grand fleet to detach battlecruisers and to hunt down german ships vice admiral doveton sturdee was placed in command of flotilla which also included armored cruisers and and light cruisers and glasgow which had survived coronel sturdee s ships reached falklands by morning of 8 december shortly before von spee s squadron arrived british spotted east asia squadron at 09 40 von spee was unaware that british had sent two battlecruisers and when he observed them he ordered his ships to withdraw despite head start fast battlecruisers quickly caught up with worn out german ships which had just completed a 16 000 mile voyage without repairs at approximately 13 20 battlecruisers opened fire at a range of after a two hour long battle scharnhorst was dead in water and listing heavily ship was sunk shortly thereafter gneisenau had been hit more than 50 times at close range crew gave three cheers for kaiser before vessel sank nurnberg and leipzig were also sunk though dresden managed to escape temporarily before she too was destroyed off juan fernandez island some 2 200 men were killed among them admiral von spee notes footnotes citations references category cruiser classes category world
