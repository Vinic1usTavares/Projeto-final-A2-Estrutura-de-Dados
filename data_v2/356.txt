north norfolk coast site of special scientific interest sssi is an area of european importance for wildlife in norfolk england it comprises 7 700 ha 19 027 acres of county s north coast from just west of holme next sea to kelling and is additionally protected through natura 2000 special protection area spa listings it is also part of norfolk coast area of outstanding natural beauty aonb north norfolk coast is also designated as a wetland of international importance on ramsar list and most of it is a biosphere reserve habitats within sssi include reed beds salt marshes freshwater lagoons and sand or shingle beaches wetlands are important for wildlife including some scarce breeding birds such as pied avocets western marsh harriers eurasian bitterns and bearded reedlings location also attracts migrating birds including vagrant rarities ducks and geese winter along this coast in considerable numbers and several nature reserves provide suitable conditions for water voles natterjack toads and several scarce plants and invertebrates area is archaeologically significant with artefacts dating back to upper paleolithic mound of an iron age fort is visible at holkham and site of a 23 ha 57 acres roman naval port with a fort built on castrum pattern is just outside brancaster site of medieval chapel probably a domestic dwelling at blakeney is no longer accessible remains of military use from both world wars include an armoured fighting vehicle gunnery range a hospital and bombing ranges as well as passive defences such as pillboxes barbed wire and tank traps sssi is economically important to area because of tourists it attracts for birdwatching and other outdoor activities although sensitive wildlife sites are managed to avoid damage from large numbers of visitors another threat is encroachment of sea on this soft coast environment agency considers that managed retreat is likely to be long term solution and is working with norfolk wildlife trust to create new reserves inland to compensate for loss of scarce habitats at coast description sssi is a long narrow strip of coast that starts at eastern boundary of wash between old hunstanton and holme next sea and runs east for about 43 km 27 mi to kelling southern boundary runs roughly west to east except where it detours around towns and villages and never crosses a149 coast road sssi has a wide variety of habitats with bare mud sand and shingle characterising intertidal zone along whole of coast although higher areas may have algae or eelgrass that are grazed by ducks and geese in winter salt marshes which form on sheltered coasts in lee of islands or behind spits are described in sssi notification document as among best in europe due to their exceptionally diverse flora sand dunes occur at several places along coast but best examples are at holme dunes holkham blakeney point and scolt head island latter two sites are also important for geomorphology research purposes as structures consisting mainly of shingle ridges reed beds are fairly localised but substantial areas occur at titchwell marsh brancaster and cley marshes grassland is represented by grazing pasture reclaimed from former salt marsh with wetter areas at cley and salthouse marshes woodland is limited in sssi although a belt of corsican pine planted at holkham has provided shelter for other trees and shrubs to become established history to 1000 ad mound of holkham fort is visible at end of raised track formerly its only access thumb norfolk has a long history of human occupation dating back to palaeolithic and including significant archaeology both modern and neanderthal people were present in area between 100 000 and 10 000 years ago before last glaciation and humans returned as ice retreated northwards archaeological record is poor until about 20 000 years ago partly because of then prevailing very cold conditions but also because coastline was much further north than at present as ice retreated during mesolithic 10 000 5 000 bce sea level rose filling what is now north sea this brought norfolk coastline much closer to its present line so that many ancient sites are under sea robertson et al 2005 pp 9 22 early mesolithic flint tools with characteristic long blades up to murphy 2009 p 14 long found on present day coast at titchwell date from a time when it was from sea other flint tools have been found dating from upper paleolithic 50 000 10 000 bce to neolithic 5 000 2 500 bce by 11 000 bc makers of long blades had gone two timber platforms have been identified within peat at titchwell and may possibly be rare bronze age 2 500 800 bce survivals robertson 2005 p 149 is another early bronze age site found on coast at holme in 1998 it consists of a ring of 55 oak posts and was built in 2049 bc a similar nearby structure holme ii may be almost two centuries older a large iron age fort at holkham enclosed 2 5 ha 6 1 acres at end of a sandy spit in what was then salt marsh and remained in use until defeat of iceni in 47 ad roman period settlements have been discovered all along norfolk coast notably complex at which covered at least 23 ha 57 acres near brancaster this site included a fort built on castrum pattern enclosing 2 6 ha 6 3 acres within its walls 2 9 m 10 ft wide fort had internal turrets at corners and was backed by an earth rampart fields 2006 p 25 edward derek a green christopher j s saxon shore fort and settlement at brancaster pp 21 28 in johnson 1977 early saxon sites are scarce close to norfolk coast but a gold bracteate found near blakeney chapel was a rare and significant 6th century find and there is a somewhat later saxon cemetery at thornham danelaw left few tangible traces within sssi but place names such as holkham ship town reflect viking influence saxon building foundations were described as ruins of cley chapel on a 1797 map although it is more likely that they belonged to a barn medieval to nineteenth century thumb blakeney haven in 1586 an eye is an area of higher ground in marshes dry enough to support buildings cley eye had been farmed since earliest human habitation and was 28 ha 70 acres in extent in 1651 but is much reduced by coastal erosion brooks 2011 p 21 bishop 1983 pp 130 133 eye and its saxon barn were accessed by an ancient causeway passable at low tide a 1588 map showed black joy forte in same area which may have been intended as a defence against spanish armada but was never completed on other side of glaven blakeney eye had a ditched enclosure during 11th and 12th centuries and a building known as blakeney chapel which was occupied from 14th century to around 1600 and again in late 17th century despite its name it is unlikely that it had a religious function nearly a third of mostly 14th to 16th century pottery found within larger and earlier of two rooms was imported from continent birks 2003 pp 1 28 reflecting glaven ports importance in international trade at this time sheltered waters of blakeney haven had brought prosperity to internationally important glaven ports of cley wiveton and blakeney blakeney gained its market charter in 1222 and three ports along with salthouse were jointly required to provide three ships for edward ii in 1322 lambert craig 2012 contributions of cinque ports to wars of edward ii and edward iii p 65 in gorski 2012 having previously contributed to his father s navy in 1301 by early 15th century blakeney was one of few ports permitted to trade in horses gold and silver through merchants sworn by oath to king which contributed to town s growing wealth robinson 2006 pp 3 5 in 1640 land reclamation schemes especially those by henry calthorpe just to west of cley led to silting up of shipping channel and relocation of wharf pevsner wilson 2002 p 435 and further reclamation east of glaven meant that all glaven ports declined labrum 1993 pp 113 114 cley and wiveton silted up in 17th century but blakeney had packet ships until 1840 pevsner wilson 2002 pp 394 397 similar marsh reclamation schemes took place elsewhere often with same consequence for local harbours as for example at holkham only wells next sea had significant trade into late 20th century twentieth century coastal defences thumb ruined world war ii pillbox at cley artillery may have been installed at gun hill on coast near burnham overy during napoleonic wars but there were no modern fortifications in north norfolk at start of world war i following german naval attack on great yarmouth in november 1914 defences such as trenches concrete pillboxes and gun batteries were constructed along much of norfolk coast main bases were outside sssi boundaries but thornham marsh was used between 1914 and 1918 by royal flying corps as a bombing range a world war i concrete building on titchwell s west bank was let as holiday accommodation until british army returned in 1942 some brickwork on titchwell marsh is all that remains of a military hospital dating from that period titchwell marsh before rspb rspb information sheet there were no new fortifications along this coast at start of world war ii after fall of france in 1940 threat of invasion led to creation of new defences in addition to installation of anti tank and other passive obstacles fourteen coastal batteries each of two guns were constructed some of these emplacements and other military bases fell within sssi area four spigot mortar base plates found at holme dunes may not have originated at that site since there is no record of such armament there birks 2003 p 60 marsh at titchwell was reflooded and pillboxes built into beach bank between 1942 and 1945 marsh was used by royal tank regiment an armoured fighting vehicle gunnery range was established and banks were constructed for firing practice with targets set at intervals some of still extant islands were built to hold pop up targets operated by cables from winches in a building whose foundations now lie below a bird hide remains of triangular concrete track used by tanks also survive military activities continued in area after war and royal air force returned to thornham marsh between 1950 and 1959 bombing practice was supervised from a control tower which was demolished in 1962 leaving only a concrete structure opposite end of titchwell s west bank remains of two world war ii covenanter tanks probably used as targets are sometimes exposed at low tide ss vina an 1894 cargo steamer was anchored offshore in 1944 for use as an raf target but a gale dragged her to sands off titchwell where wreck can still be seen at low tide brancaster beach had a base including three pillboxes nissen huts and two gun emplacements and another possible base comprising about fifty different structures was located in a salt marsh north east of burnham overy staithe a wreck at west end of scolt head island was used as a bombing target and remains of a blenheim bomber were found at north of island in 2004 royal artillery military fortifications were established at cley beach including two 6 inch 15 24 cm guns five buildings two pillboxes a minefield and concrete anti tank blocks a spigot mortar emplacement and an allan williams turret machine gun emplacement were sited closer to village one of pillboxes and remains of beach gun emplacements were still surviving as of 2012 military camp accommodated 160 men and was later used to hold prisoners of war near end of war camp was used to house east european refugees and was finally pulled down in 1948 many of wartime buildings were destroyed by royal engineers in 1955 but generator house was taken over by coastguard service as an observation post it was acquired by nwt in 1983 and upper part was used as a look out while larger lower section became a beach cafe brooks 2011 p 26 building was overwhelmed by shingle in a storm in 2008 and subsequently demolished conservation seals at blakeney point first protected area of coast thumb first step towards protection of this coast by a national conservation body was purchase of blakeney point from calthorpe family by banker charles rothschild in 1912 rothschild gave property to national trust in 1912 which has managed it since in 1926 another early protected area was created when norfolk birdwatcher dr sydney long bought land which makes up cley marshes reserve for sum of ps5 100 to be held in perpetuity as a bird breeding sanctuary long then went on to establish norfolk wildlife trust nwt current sssi was created in 1986 from pre existing sssis at

beetle yellow and even here it is localised and hard to find plants thumb marram grass binds dunes on exposed parts of coast muds and sands are scoured by tides and have no vegetation except possibly algae or eelgrass where shoreline is more protected internationally important salt marshes can form with several uncommon species salt marshes contains glassworts and common cord grass in most exposed regions with a succession of plants following on as marsh becomes more established first sea aster then mainly sea lavender with sea purslane in creeks and smaller areas of sea plantain and other common marsh plants uncommon spiral and long sedge are other lower salt marsh specialists scrubby sea blite and matted sea lavender are characteristic plants of drier upper salt marsh although they are uncommon in uk away from this coast they may occur alongside scarce species including lesser centaury curved hard grass and sea pearlwort with soft in dykes grasses such as sea couch grass and sea poa grass are important in driest areas of marshes and on coastal dunes where marram grass sand couch grass lyme grass and red fescue help to bind sand sea holly and sand sedge are other specialists

there is also a car park further east on beach road wells next sea cley marshes visitor centre and car park are to south of a149 opposite main reserve centre and four of five bird hides are accessible to people with limited mobility their proximity to main coast road means that reserves can be accessed by bus as well as car peddars way national trail runs length of sssi and only short sections of this part of long distance footpath venture south of sssi boundary recreation thumb birdwatching visitors help to support local economy a 2005 survey at six north norfolk coastal sites titchwell holkham morston quay blakeney and cley found that 39 per cent of visitors gave birdwatching as main purpose of their visit 7 7 million day visitors and 5 5 million who made overnight stays in area in 1999 are estimated to have spent ps122 million and created equivalent of 2 325 full time jobs titchwell marsh rspb cley marshes nwt and holkham nnr each attract 100 000 or more visitors annually liley

sometimes has negative effects wildlife may be disturbed a frequent difficulty for species that breed in exposed areas such as ringed plovers little terns and common seals but also wintering geese plants can be trampled which is a particular problem in sensitive habitats such as sand dunes and vegetated shingle liley 2008 pp 10 14 damage is reduced by measures such as breeding colonies using fences boardwalks and signs to control access and appropriate positioning of car parks liley 2008 pp 19 20 norfolk coast partnership a grouping of conservation and environmental bodies divide coast into zones for tourism development purposes holme dunes holkham dunes and blakeney point sensitive habitats suffering from visitor pressure were designated as red zone areas with no development or parking improvements to be recommended orange locations had fragile habitats but were under less tourism pressure or as with large nature reserves were equipped to cope with many visitors most robust sites mainly outside sssi were placed in green zone scott wilson ltd 2006 pp 5 6 threats underlying geology of north norfolk coast is cretaceous chalk exposed at hunstanton cliffs just to west of sssi but for entire length of sssi coast chalk is buried by soft quaternary glacial debris robertson et al 2005 p 46 unlike rapidly eroding soft cliffs further east coast of sssi has shown a less consistent pattern with a net accretion of beach material between 1880 and 1950 this coastline is threatened by climate change with sea level rising an estimated at 1 2 mm per year for last 100 years increasing risk of flooding and coastal erosion east anglia coastal group 2010 p 32 shingle ridge at cley is moving southwards through marshes thumb one of most vulnerable stretches is that between blakeney point and weybourne which included cley and salthouse marsh reserves east anglia coastal group 2010 p 27 coast here is protected by a shingle ridge but sea attacks ridge and spit through tidal and storm action with a single storm sometimes moving a spectacular amount of shingle blakeney point spit has sometimes been breached becoming an island for a time and this may happen again may v j 2003 north norfolk coast in may 2003 pp 1 19 northernmost part of nearby blakeney was lost to sea in early middle ages probably due to a storm muir 2008 p 103 spit is moving towards mainland at about 1 m 1 yd per year gray 2004 pp 363 365 and for last two hundred years maps have been accurate enough for encroachment of sea to be quantified blakeney chapel was 400 m 440 yd from sea in 1817 but this had reduced to 195 m 215 yd by end of 20th century landward movement of shingle means that channel of river glaven becomes blocked increasingly often leading to flooding of reserve and cley village environment agency considered several remedial options to protect these vulnerable areas and a new route for river to south of its original line was completed in 2007 at a cost of about ps1 5 million environment agency s long term policy is to hold line only to protect communities and infrastructure east anglia coastal group 2010 p 62 with managed retreat as solution to rising sea levels elsewhere even at sites like cley where financial benefits from recreational value of reserve outweigh cost of maintaining sea defences turner et al 2001 pp 128 139 a scheme to allow tidal flooding of part of reserve has already been implemented at titchwell marsh another strategy is to create new reserves inland to compensate for inevitable loss of important reedbeds at cley environment agency and norfolk wildlife trust have been working since 2010 to make a new wetland near hilgay hilgay wetland creation project is converting former farmland into a variety of wetland habitats by using banks ditches and a lake to manage water levels trust sees this as first stage of a long term plan to create a roughly living landscape references cited texts automatic download external links category
