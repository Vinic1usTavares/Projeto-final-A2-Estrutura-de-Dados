succumbed to colonialism and forces of globalism dances that one sees today are often part of general movements to preserve and rejuvenate tribal or local traditions some of these movements are quite

provided by strung rattles worn on anklets of dancers and clashing together of wooden implements of war which today are either sticks or mock weapons dance is unusual for tonga in that it lacks recited poetry as accompaniment which fact is taken to mean that it was imported to tonga from elsewhere north and central america so called war dances of indigenous north american tribes may also be classified as weapon dances recent interest in preserving native american traditions has led to such groups as warriors of a cherokee dance group who recreate cherokee dances including war dance do research and offer dance workshops for their community a dance such as comanche sun dance of 1870s was an invocation of invulnerability to white man s bullets dance was a preliminary ritual to battle and would be a war dance and hence a weapon dance also moresca or morisca above exists in some areas in americas that used to be spanish colonies mexico for example in region of mexico there exists perhaps most colorful version of that kind of dance dance it represents a battle between moors led by pilate and christians led by james apostle sixteen male dancers take part and dancer who plays part of james appears as a horse rider and wears a costume that incorporates a white horse dancers wear ostrich feathers on their heads a peacock feather at front white cotton square over their shoulders velvet trousers decorated with gold brocade over white cotton pants and carry a machete in addition leader has a hat with a small mirror and a white feather headdress two men at front carry two red flags and two white flags red symbolizing blood spilt by james soldiers and white symbolizing peace that reigned after christian victory sounds of drums and flutes accompany dance these dances that pit christian against moor are almost certainly christianized versions of earlier pre cortez dances that ritualized battle between tiger and eagle though sources generally say tiger in context of these dances reference is not to felis tigris asian tiger but to felis american big cat generally known by its native name jaguar from tupi language similar to moor christian confrontation of morisca whether in spain or in transplanted versions in central america there are also elaborate ritual dances in mexico such as danza de la pluma that exploit trauma of spanish conquest of indigenous america weapons employed may be swords and shields whips even firearms these representations take place over a large area of mesoamerica and in part are an obvious adaptation of spanish tradition but in mexico will pit native aztec against spanish invader most interesting aspect of these dances is that depending on where one sees them and under what conditions it is plausible to read into dances an outcome other than historical spanish victory that is indigenous performers may take inspiration from fact that natives of spain drove out moorish invaders thus natives of mesoamerica too shall one day drive out invaders some dances that abound at carnival and corpus christi fiestas go back to pre conquest ritual combat dances of aztecs for example during 15th month of aztec calendar god of sun and war was honored by real duels between slave victims and mimed battles among masked boy votaries also among nahuatl speaking people in pacific ocean region of michoacan there is dance dance performance of this dance represents a battle between aztecs and spaniards and dancers perform with rattles made of thin metal plates and wooden cudgels south america thumb left capoeira or dance of war by johann moritz 1825 published 1835 landscape of all dance in a large country such as brazil is rich and complex due to mixing of three separate traditions indian native black african and portuguese in brazil african influence on brazilian is considerable for example capoeira a dance like fighting style and maculele fighting dance are strongly reminiscent of african dances capoeira is of particular interest in 19th century capoeira was played mostly by african slaves who had been brought from west central africa making them original and making art a complex form of social interaction expressing participants physical skills and spiritual essence involving gods and spirits of ancestral fathers participants played during festivals and holidays jumping and leaping in front of musical bands military troops and religious processions this dance game was considered dangerous to public order and was eventually criminalized in late 19th century today capoeira has staged somewhat of a comeback and is even studied in dance academies as part of a general movement to rejuvenate folk traditions capoeira may be played unarmed or with blades held in hands or feet sticks used as mock weapons in some of these dances also serve as percussion instruments in southern state of rio grande do sul machete a tool used to cut jungle brush is used in a dance called dos dance of machetes in this dance historically performed only by men although this trend changes as dance spreads dancers knock their machetes while dancing simulating a battle machete are sometimes used in place of sticks in maculele weapon dance as art since dance is already an art form weapon dance as art may seem redundant yet art is used here to mean re creation say of a folk weapon dance in a more professional staged venue such as a ballet or when an australian native american or african troupe of professional musicians and dancers present a reenactment on stage of a weapon dance or when use of weapons is introduced in stylized dance enactments of fighting for example recent ballets such as new york city ballet s version of romeo and juliet to music of sergei prokofiev employ highly choreographed sword fight dance sequences additionally there is overlap between weapon dance and stylized forms of stage combat i e choreographed enactments of real fights from bar room brawls to sword fighting to large scale battle scenes stage combat uses services of professionals called fight directors weapon choreographers etc an early example of this kind of staged combat in europe was in italy in late 19th century where term tramagnini came to be used generically in sense of extra or stunt man for those who fought on stage in enactments of battle scenes in grand opera for example tramagnini was originally a family name in florence and referred to members of family who started a gymnastics club and soon wound up appearing on stage in enactments of fighting both bare handed and with weapons elsewhere kabuki theater tradition in japan employs ritualized representations of violence on stage while kabuki is technically theater and not dance movements for example of sword fighting termed in kabuki are gymnastic to point even of employing somersaults and elaborate fight scenes are so deliberate and stylized that they provide at least an area of overlap between theater and dance also communist revolution in china produced view that art including dance must support armed struggle of proletariat by 1970s weapons commonly appeared in such works as red detachment of women a ballet about a women s revolutionary armed force in 1930s in china interesting perhaps in use of weapons in these recent revolutionary works is that they are generally speaking not reenactments of traditional folk dances introduction of weaponry into chinese ballet regardless of revolutionary message was itself a revolution see also four scottish dances long sword dance stick
