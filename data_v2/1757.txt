moved to sydney in late 1955 to train with frank guthrie in an attempt to qualify for 1956 summer olympics in melbourne australia he boarded with a host family and worked in a wool store to pay his expenses but his initiation into guthrie s training program was difficult after seeing o halloran s freestyle technique for first time guthrie asked him can you swim any other stroke if you are going to swim for me you ll have to learn all over again o halloran refined his style and increased his workload to around 10 km a day something that was normal for competitive swimmers in eastern states

second fastest among all of swimmers in heats with four of five fastest individual swimmers in calendar year for event gordon p 211 australia was heavily favoured to win relay sports illustrated predicted a world record and a victory margin of around 14 metres o halloran s inclusion at expense of chapman was subject of controversy because chapman had won bronze in 100 m event and was national

australia in lead with an olympic record time of 2 min 6 8 s opening a gap of 0 7 s over soviet union and 1 2 s over united states fourth placed italians were already a full three seconds in arrears

race soviet anchor swimmer was only non australian to swim faster and only by 0 1 s despite having benefit of a flying start this resulted in australia winning gold in a world record time of 8 min 23
