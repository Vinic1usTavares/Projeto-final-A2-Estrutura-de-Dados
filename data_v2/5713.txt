september 2010 chiranjeevi invited krishna vamsi to discuss making a movie with ram charan as lead after a story narration session they agreed to move ahead in august 2013 after a three year gap it was announced that ram charan daggubati venkatesh and krishna would act in a film directed by vamsi and produced by bandla ganesh under banner parameswara art productions banner at that point however script was not yet complete and so project was still put on hold in december 2013 bandla ganesh tweeted a photo featuring himself krishna vamsi and director of photography sameer reddy at sri lakshmi narasimha swamy temple in with finished script film was initially titled after 1985 telugu film which featured chiranjeevi and in lead roles in march 2014 supposed story of film was leaked onto internet story was that ram charan played role of an nri who visits his joint family to bridge a gap between his father and his father s younger brother on 27 march 2014 when film poster was released title was confirmed as govindudu andarivadele in mid april 2014 yuvan shankar raja was signed up as film s composer after s thaman opted out because of conflicting projects sources reported that talks were also held with g v prakash kumar it was first time that krishna vamsi had collaborated with yuvan shankar raja with director later informing that he had waited five years to work with composer reports regarding rajkiran being replaced by prakash raj because of chiranjeevi and altering of original script and that prakash raj was included to strengthen telugu cultural identity of film were dismissed as rumours film s shoot was put on hold due to climate at shooting spot being unsuitable for children acting in film rather than because of chiranjeevi ram charan in an interview with hindu said that rajkiran was replaced with prakash raj as sections involving former ended up looking more like a tamil film casting vamsi wanted to cast a popular actor as protagonist to widen film s appeal and approached ram charan because of his relationship with him since charan s childhood venkatesh and krishna were initially set to play lead roles along with charan with venkatesh playing role of charan s paternal uncle in september 2013 kajal aggarwal was signed to play opposite charan actor babu turned down role of charan s father as he wanted to concentrate on antagonistic character roles in november 2013 tamil actor rajkiran was chosen to play role of charan s grandfather previously earmarked for krishna producers also began searching for a new actress in lead role in december 2013 venkatesh left project and was subsequently replaced by telugu actor srikanth saying that role did not suit his image rather than any other dissatisfaction choudary was rumoured to have been signed up as female lead but this proved not to be case tamannaah was approached as well but she had prior commitments in aagadu and baahubali kajal was finalised by end of 2013 as charan s heroine in this film marking her return to telugu cinema after a brief hiatus kamalini mukherjee was chosen by krishna vamsi in late january 2014 by krishna vamsi mainly because of her appearance and her acting talent a

twice through his twitter account in end of may 2014 prakash raj replaced rajkiran as ram charan s grandfather vamsi said raj kiran was cast initially and i had doubts about this casting after shooting a few scenes i went to chiranjeevi and he suggested you can think of taking someone who can carry telugu nativity he just made that suggestion but that was when i replaced raj kiran with prakash raj he added that chiranjeevi did not interfere in this decision however chiranjeevi helped vamsi and raj reconcile their differences jayasudha and rahman were signed for key roles m s
