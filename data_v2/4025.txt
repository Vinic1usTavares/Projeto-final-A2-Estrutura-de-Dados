game gear games with its muddy colours and shaky animation some such as writers from usgamer and nwr complained character graphics were too big for game gear s small screen jeuxvideo com found character animations poor and said they caused gameplay limitations although they were mostly critical of graphics reviewers did acknowledge visuals were impressive when considering limitations of game gear pocket gamer noted that prior to game s release capabilities of game gear had seemingly been fully explored writing while they offered some compromises visuals made sonic blast stand out gameplay was also criticized nwr wrote that characters abilities were difficult to use properly since screen was zoomed so close to them and particularly disliked water based levels calling them nearly unplayable due to sluggish controls nintendo life held considerable grievances against inconsistent and random level designs while jeuxvideo com lamented game lacked speed previous sonic games offered and said playable characters abilities as well as losing only ten rings when hit made an already easy game easier they shared nintendo life s concerns about level designs and argued boss fights lacked difficulty digitally downloaded said game lacked polish were you to convert sonic blast into engine of one of other game gear games its shortcomings would still be prevalent however pocket gamer praised game s take on traditional sonic formula calling it a strong choice for anyone who s enjoyed any other 2d sonic game digitally downloaded although overall critical praised game for its elements of exploration sonic blast has been called one of worst games in sonic series nwr exclaimed game should be avoided at all costs and retro gamer said its title screen was only redeeming quality usgamer wrote it was an unpleasant end to game gear and attributed its shortcomings to system s discontinuation complex declared it worst handheld sonic game ever and said thank god
