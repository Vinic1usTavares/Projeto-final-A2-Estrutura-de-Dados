astral weeks is second studio album by northern irish singer songwriter van morrison it was recorded at century sound studios in new york during september and october 1968 and released in november of same year by warner bros records album s music blends folk blues jazz and classical styles signalling a radical departure from sound of morrison s previous pop hits such as brown eyed girl 1967 lyrics and cover art portray symbolism equating earthly love and heaven that would often feature in singer s subsequent records his lyrics have been described as impressionistic hypnotic and modernist while record has been referred to as a song cycle or concept album astral weeks did not originally receive promotion from morrison s record label and was not an immediate success with consumers or critics its standing eventually improved greatly with praise given to morrison s arrangements and songwriting and album has been viewed as one of rock music s greatest and most important records a reputation singer himself has dismissed it was placed on numerous widely circulated lists of best albums of all time and had an enduring effect on both listeners and musicians forty years after album s release morrison performed all eight of its songs live for first time at two hollywood bowl concerts in november 2008 this performance was later released as astral weeks live at hollywood bowl background at beginning of 1968 van morrison became involved in a contract dispute with bang records that kept him away from any recording activity this occurred after sudden death of label s founder bert berns born with a congenital heart defect berns had a fatal heart attack and was discovered dead in a new york hotel room on 30 december 1967 heylin 2003 p 164 prior to berns s death he and morrison had experienced some creative difficulties berns had been pushing morrison in a more pop oriented direction while morrison wanted to explore newer musical terrain heylin 2003 pp 158 164 berns s widow ilene berns held morrison and this conflict responsible for her husband s death years later she would downplay this scenario but morrison s then girlfriend janet planet rigsbee has since gone on record describing ilene berns s subsequent vindictiveness towards morrison heylin 2003 p 167 following bert berns s death ilene berns inherited contracts of bang records heylin 2003 p 165 morrison s annual option on his recording contract was also due less than a week after berns s funeral heylin 2003 p 166 legally bound to bang records morrison was not only kept out of studio but also found himself unable to find performing work in new york as most clubs refrained from booking him fearing reprisals ilene berns then discovered that her late husband had previously been remiss in filing appropriate paperwork to keep morrison still a british citizen in new york and contacted immigration and naturalization service in an attempt to have morrison deported however morrison managed to stay in u s when janet rigsbee agreed to marry him heylin 2003 pp 166 168 once married morrison and rigsbee moved to cambridge massachusetts where he found work performing in local clubs morrison began performing with a small electric combo doing blues numbers songs from blowin your mind and from morrison s them band days two of musicians soon left but morrison retained bassist tom kielbania a student at berklee school of music heylin 2003 pp 169 172 morrison decided to try an acoustic sound and he and kielbania began performing shows in coffee houses in boston area as an acoustic duo with morrison playing guitar and kielbania on upright bass before this morrison had primarily recorded and performed with electric musicians acoustic medium would provide him greater vocal improvisation and a freer feel hage 2009 p 40 later kielbania heard jazz trained flautist john payne for first time while sitting in on a jam session he invited payne to club where he played with morrison hoping morrison would invite him to join them after allowing payne to sit in on one performance morrison extended an invitation which payne accepted heylin 2003 pp 172 173 trio of payne kielbania and morrison continued performing for four months in weeks they played at catacombs they began to develop template for astral weeks heylin 2003 p 173 it was around this time that warner bros records approached morrison hoping to sign him heylin 2003 p 176 presumably their interest focused on his prior success with brown eyed girl not on morrison s current acoustic work regardless their interest allowed morrison to return to recording studio heylin 2003 p 177 at time warner bros had a deal with inherit productions production arm of schwaid merenstein which was founded by manager bob schwaid who worked for warners publishing and producer lewis merenstein merenstein received a call from warner bros to see morrison in boston and related how eight or nine producers had gone to hear morrison thinking they were going to hear brown eyed girl only to find that it was another person with same voice https www ie essays van youth merenstein first heard morrison play at ace recording studio and recalled that when morrison played song astral weeks for him i started crying it just vibrated in my soul and i knew that i wanted to work with that sound while merenstein was visiting morrison schwaid set to work on resolving morrison s contractual troubles heylin 2003 pp 177 181 still legally bound to bang records morrison would yet have more issues with them in future for time being schwaid managed to free him from those obligations under several conditions first morrison had to write and submit to web iv music bert berns s publishing company three original compositions per month over course of one year morrison fulfilled that obligation by recording thirty six nonsense songs in a single session such action risked legal reprisals but ultimately none transpired morrison then had to assign web iv half of copyright to any musical composition written and recorded by morrison and released as a single within one year from 12 september 1968 that demand became a moot point when warner bros refrained from releasing any singles during that time as no single was released from astral weeks finally morrison had to include two original compositions controlled by web iv on his next album morrison fulfilled that demand with two of his own compositions madame george and beside you although versions subsequently released were vastly different musically from original versions recorded with bang heylin 2003 pp 178 181 recording sessions with his legal matters resolved morrison now had freedom to proceed with recording his warner bros debut album with recording sessions taking place at century sound studios in new york on 25 september 1 and 15 october 1968 live tracks for sessions were performed by morrison on vocals and acoustic guitar in a separate vocal 2003 p 191 with other musicians playing together on upright bass lead acoustic guitar vibes flute and drums strings and horns constituted only instruments added subsequently to initial recording sessions rogan 2006 p 227 morrison said later they ruined it they added strings i didn t want strings and they sent it to me it was all changed that s not astral weeks producer lewis merenstein had a background in jazz and according to merenstein morrison was not an aficionado of jazz when i met him r b and soul yes but jazz no heylin 2003 p 189 for astral weeks recording sessions merenstein first contacted veteran bassist richard davis perhaps best known for his work with eric dolphy davis essentially served as session leader and it was through davis that merenstein recruited guitarist jay berliner percussionist warren smith jr and drummer connie kay all of these musicians had strong backgrounds in jazz berliner had worked closely with charles mingus and kay was part of modern jazz quartet heylin 2003 p 190 morrison was still working with kielbania and payne but for these sessions they were essentially replaced according to kielbania i got to show all bass lines to richard davis he embellished a lot of them but i gave him feeling davis proved perhaps to be most pivotal instrumentalist during these sessions if you listen to album every tune is led by richard and everybody followed richard and van s voice says merenstein i knew if i brought richard in he would put bottom on to support what van wanted to do vocally or acoustically then you get jay playing those beautiful counter lines to van davis was not impressed by morrison but not out of disdain or any preconceived notions but rather because morrison s professional comportment generally did not meet davis s expectations no prep no meeting recalls davis he was remote from us cause he came in and went into a booth and that s where he stayed isolated in a booth i don t think he ever introduced himself to us nor we to him and he seemed very shy drummer connie kay later told rolling stone that he approached morrison and asked what he wanted me to play and he said to play whatever i felt like playing we more or less sat there and jammed heylin 2003 p 192 morrison s impression of sessions was songs came together very well in studio some of tracks were first takes but musicians were really together those type of guys play what you re gonna do before you do it that s how good they are he told ritchie yorke that only two tracks recorded during sessions did not make it to album one was about jesse james and other about trains they were both just basic blues numbers that s why they didn t fit in with album yorke 1975 p 52 for astral weeks sessions apparently they did not employ any lead sheets or at least none were distributed to musicians what stood out in my mind was fact that he allowed us to stretch out recalls berliner we were used to playing to charts but van just played us songs on his guitar and then told us to go ahead and play exactly what we felt berliner actually had great appreciation for freedom given to him and band something few if any of them were used to i played a lot of classical guitar on those sessions and it was very unusual to play classical guitar in that context says berliner heylin 2003 p 194 first session held in evening on 25 september 1968 produced four recordings that made it to album only three had initially been intended for inclusion cyprus avenue madame george and beside you turner 1993 pp 86 89 although not scheduled to play payne still attended first session and listened as another flautist played his parts to this day nobody recalls name of this flautist nor has he been identified on any of surviving documentation he does play flute on released takes of beside you and cyprus avenue but is not included in album credits when morrison tried to squeeze in one last tune during end of that first session payne spoke up and pleaded to merenstein to permit him to participate payne was then allowed to play on what became title track of album astral weeks fourth song produced from this initial session for remainder of sessions john payne played on every song next session according to john payne occurred early in morning but it did not work and nothing from this session worked for final album it just didn t happen says payne it was wrong time of day for jazz musicians to create i think that by end of that session we all knew that nothing was going to be used they just said let s forget it turner 1993 p 90 jay berliner was not available so barry kornfeld was recruited to play lead guitar in his place according to merenstein there was tension at this second session and it was stopped after about three hours rogan 2006 p 226 morrison was quoted by ritchie yorke as saying album was recorded in two eight hour sessions plus two overdub sessions that was whole album yorke 1975 p 51 in his biography clinton heylin gives date for second session as 1 october and states that only as young lovers do from this session would make album contending that this is reason for different lounge jazz sound on this track heylin 2003 p 195 other biographers have primarily noted that early morning first of october session was abandoned without producing any of songs on album hinton 1997 p 1996 p 31 third and final session in evening on 15 october produced four more recordings that completed album way young lovers do sweet thing ballerina and slim slow slider davis expressed to rolling stone that there was a certain feel about a seven to ten o clock session and that ambience of that time of day was all through everything we played both sweet thing and ballerina were originally scheduled for session but search for a closer consumed a considerable amount of time they attempted and rejected a number of songs until morrison suggested slim slow slider i don t think we d ever done it live recalls payne morrison had a book full of songs i don t know why he decided to do it and we were first doing it with drums with richard davis and connie kay and guitar player and vibe player and me and van all of us were playing then i started playing soprano sax on thing and lew said ok i wanna try it again start again and i want just bass soprano sax and van it was a successful take but it also came with a very long coda prompting merenstein to make a large cut during editing process many of tracks on astral weeks would be subjected to edits mainly to tighten performances but one on slim slow slider was easily most substantial i would estimate three five minutes of instrumental stuff says payne we went through stages until we got to be avant garde kind of weird which is what you hear after splice all that weird stuff we re playing but there was a whole progression to that according to merenstein before he cut it coda was a long long ending that went nowhere that just carried on from minute to minute if it had some relativity to tune itself i would have left it there heylin 2003 pp 195 197 recording engineer for album brooks arthur remembered sessions in 2009 a cloud came along and it was called van morrison sessions we all hopped upon that cloud and cloud took us away and we made this album and we landed when it was done marcus 2010 p 53 in a rolling stone interview in 1972 morrison told john jr i was really pretty happy with album only complaint i had was that it was rather rushed but i thought it was closer to type of music i wanted to put out and still is actually music and lyrics astral weeks has poetic stream of consciousness lyrics that evoke emotions and images instead of coherent intellectual ideas and narratives according to guy raz from npr it is a folk rock album perhaps seminal album of folk rock genre while rock and roll hall of fame online biography of morrison said its music is trance like folk jazz set to impressionistic free flowing lyrics allmusic s william ruhlmann on other hand viewed music as an amalgam of folk blues jazz and classical music that is unlike rock although usually described as a song cycle rather than a concept album songs do when considered in their totality seem to link together as one long song forming an intangible narrative of unreachable worlds and delivered with what one writer calls a masterpiece of virtuoso singing according to charlie gillett album has meditative songs that combine themes of nostalgia drama and morrison s personal mysticism and are performed in a blue eyed soul style gillett et al 2008 p 261 album embraces a form of symbolism that would eventually become a staple of morrison s songs equating earthly love and heaven or as close as a living being can approach it morrison and davis s upright bass can be interpreted as earth opposing kay s percussion and string arrangement representing heaven and with berliner s lead acoustic guitar residing on a plane in between van morrison told ritchie yorke one of his biographers he wrote both of songs madame george and cyprus avenue in stream of consciousness madame george just came right out song is just a stream of consciousness thing as is cyprus avenue i didn t even think about what i was writing yorke 1975 p 61 in an interview with paste in 2009 morrison said songs on astral weeks were written prior to 1968 over a period of five years in an npr review he comments it s not about me it s totally fictional it s put together of composites of conversations i heard you know things i saw in movies newspapers books whatever it comes out as stories that s it there s no more songs side one in beginning astral weeks song astral weeks opens album with lines if i ventured in slipstream between viaducts of your dream where immobile steel rims crack and ditch in back roads stop which according to erik hage shows morrison had once and for all pulled neck and neck with dylan as a lyricist morrison described it as one of those songs where you can see light at end of tunnel i don t think i can elaborate on it any more than that heylin 2003 p 187 words in song talkin to huddie ledbetter pictures on wall appear to be based on morrison s real life custom of carrying around a poster of lead belly and hanging it on wall wherever he lived this was revealed in a rolling stone interview in 1978 beside you beside you second song on album has been described as expressionistic poetry and a scattershot collection of images and scenarios it begins with classical guitar of jay berliner and morrison s voice circling each other hage 2009 pp 42 43 morrison described it as kind of song that you d sing to a kid or somebody that you love it s basically a love song it s just a song about being spiritually beside somebody yorke 1975 p 56 it was originally recorded for bang records in december 1967 that first recording shows pop music intentions of bert berns which give it a different sound from astral weeks recording sweet thing sweet thing is only song on album to look forward instead of backward in words of allmusic over endlessly descending circular progression morrison sings positive lyrics about nature and a romantic partner seemingly beginning in middle of a thought and i will stroll merry way paul du noyer wrote sweet thing puts singer in a hazy pastoral paradise where he wanders in gardens wet with rain or counts stars in his lover s eyes and vows to never grow so old again or read between lines he pleads with his mind to keep quiet so his heart can hear itself think he yearns to obliterate experience and rediscover innocence it has been a more popular cover song than any of others on album and is only astral weeks song that has been included in any of morrison s compilation albums cyprus avenue thumb left 150px cyprus avenue street in belfast that inspired song song cyprus avenue is a three chord blues composition and served for many years as closing song for most of morrison s live shows along with madame george it is centerpiece of album and both songs are belfast related and highly impressionistic song is told from point of view of an outsider watching from inside an automobile and getting tongue tied as refined school girl he fantasizes about appears and he imagines her a fine lady with rainbow ribbons in her hair in a carriage drawn by six white horses and returning from a fair hage 2009 p 43 van morrison described cyprus avenue as a street in belfast a place where there s a lot of wealth it wasn t far from where i was brought up and it was a very different scene to me it was a very mystical place it was a whole avenue lined with trees and i found it a place where i could think hinton 2000 p 96 side two afterwards way young lovers do way young lovers do is described by clinton heylin as a lounge jazz sound that still sticks out like at a champagne buffet in his review for rolling stone greil marcus also spoke of song as a poor jazz flavored cut that is uncomfortably out of place on this record brian hinton describes it as there being a sinatra strut to van s voice a blues knowingness with stax brass and a string section which swirls where previously it drifted he describes it as about growing up an adolescent first kiss hinton 1996 p 97 madame george called other album masterpiece along with cyprus avenue madame george is almost ten minutes long and tells of mysterious madame in a corner playing dominoes in drag among other things it also has a setting of cyprus avenue in belfast with impressionistic lyrics that give stream of conscious details that are seemingly unrelated erik hage describes effect of sensory experience of lyrics instrumentation and morrison s impassioned vocals on listener and album as being like some kind of twilight state between sleeping and wakefulness engaging listener to project themselves into spell of song hage 2009 p 44 rolling stone s album reviewer wrote crowning touch is madame george a cryptic character study that may or may not be about an aging transvestite but that is certainly as heartbreaking a reverie as you will find in pop music morrison has denied that song is about a transvestite as others including lester bangs have believed bangs 1979 p 184 original title of song is madame joy and morrison later changed title although he actually sings words madame joy in song marcus 2010 pp 141 142 an earlier recording for bang records with slightly altered lyrics backing singers a much swifter tempo and a bizarrely inappropriate party atmosphere changes tone considerably from astral weeks recording rogan 2006 p 210 ballerina oldest composition on astral weeks is ballerina which morrison composed in 1966 while still a member of them around same time he first met his future wife janet inspired by a flash about an actress in an opera house appearing in a ballet according to morrison former them guitarist jim armstrong recalls band working on song between engagements morrison had all these words armstrong says we sort of formalized it cause there was no structure to it them performed song one night in hawaii but it was not recorded until astral weeks heylin 2003 p 127 on full length version of ballerina which first appeared on 2015 expanded edition left and right audio channels are opposite to those on originally released edited version slim slow slider slim slow slider is only song on album to not have string 2009 p 45 and according to john payne morrison had not played it live before like in song t b sheets singer tells of watching a young girl die but in slim slow slider girl seems bent on her own self destruction i know you re dying baby i know you know it too song ends abruptly with words every time i see you i just don t know what to do heylin 2003 pp 195 196 it has been said to be about a drug addict but morrison has only said that it s about someone who is caught up in a big city like london or maybe is on dope i m not sure hinton 2003 p 98 packaging according to steve turner one of van morrison s biographers irish painter cecil mccartney influenced titling of astral weeks morrison related how a friend of mine had drawings in his flat of astral projection i was at his house when i was working on a song which began if i venture down slipstream and that s why i called it astral weeks turner 1993 p 89 it was a painting mccartney corrects there were several paintings in studio at time van looked at painting and it suggested astral travelling to him rogan 2006 p 173 album cover photograph of van morrison was taken by joel brodsky best known for his young lions photoshoot with jim morrison squared circle in cover photo is described as portraying mystic symbol of union of opposites sacred marriage of heaven and earth contemporary weeks sold poorly when it was first released in 1968 album became a somewhat popular cult import in united states while in united kingdom it was largely overlooked by critics british magazine beat instrumental published a negative review of record finding morrison s songs monotonous and unoriginal rogan 2006 p 556 in nme nick logan regarded it as a pale imitation of guitarist jose feliciano s 1968 feliciano album which was one of year s best selling records with exception of astral weeks title track logan felt compositions were indistinguishable and suffer from being stuck in same groove throughout rogan 2006 pp 246 47 in american magazine stereo review editor peter reilly panned it as a free verse mind bender of an album plagued by nonsensical lyrics and incoherent singing from morrison especially on madame george in 1969 greil marcus reviewed album positively in rolling stone saying that morrison s lyrics were thoughtful and deeply intellectual in terms of myths and metaphors that exist within world of rock and roll he believed both music and lyrics captured spirit of bob dylan s 1967 album john wesley harding while calling astral weeks a unique and timeless record rolling stone later named it album of year yorke 1975 p 66 melody maker also called it one of year s best records featuring morrison s small harsh voice backed by an attractive musical combo that verges on genius during madame george when his third album moondance was released in 1970 warner bros ran full page advertisements remarking on unavailability of astral weeks in record stores calling it a damn shame that it ended up as what you might call a critically acclaimed but obscure album if you want it and can t find it yell at store s record buyer loud because you re customer and you re always right undo veils of potential obscurity heylin 2003 p 200 legacy and influence astral weeks critical standing improved greatly over time it became viewed as one of rock s greatest records and a culturally significant work a number of factors afforded record its canonical reputation in rock criticism its back story as a commercial underachiever and highly personal work for morrison its distinction from rest of his discography his artistic autonomy music s song cycle composition enigmatic lyrics and quality of seriousness and originality as perceived by mature rock audiences and writers jones 2008 pp 30 47 93 according to rob sheffield it was morrison s most beautiful and intense album foundation for his legend and a work that continues to captivate musicians and listeners lester bangs said its anguished feeling resonated with him on first listen calling it rock record with most significance in my life so far a record about people stunned by life completely overwhelmed stalled in their skins their ages and selves paralyzed by enormity of what in one moment of vision they can comprehend bangs 1979 pp 178 182 irish musician glen hansard said it made him think about life with a greater depth of feeling with a greater sense of fear and horror and desire than you ever imagined colin larkin credited morrison for fully realizing his ambition to create without pop s constraints on astral weeks while allmusic s william ruhlmann said its reputation among critics was justified because unlike any record before or since it encompasses passion and tenderness that have always mixed in best postwar popular music astral weeks influenced future releases of other musicians such as bono and bruce springsteen mike with huffington post wrote that astral weeks influenced springsteen s 1973 first album greetings from asbury park n j and two of songs from his second steven van zandt from springsteen s e street band has said astral weeks was like a religion to us rolling stone issue 1065 13 november 2008 according to writer steve turner album also became popular with travelers of hippie trail from europe through to kathmandu and there were even reports of vans painted in psychedelic colours being renamed van morrison turner 1993 p 92 in his 1975 book ritchie yorke wrote it was almost as if van morrison elusive at any time had deliberately created an album of music which would indefinitely withstand vulgarity of music industry image making later they might say that other albums were reminiscent of astral weeks but they could never claim that astral weeks was like anything else yorke 1975 p 49 according to greil marcus martin scorsese said that first fifteen minutes of his 1976 film taxi driver was based on astral weeks marcus 2010 p 59 critical recognition and renown of astral weeks came to overshadow morrison s subsequent work as well as morrison himself jones 2008 p 54 according to biographer johnny rogan his recording career was all too often crystallized in a single moment like beach boys pet sounds astral weeks was perceived as a one off whose critical standing allowed little discussion for other equally fascinating musical forays that followed morrison felt annoyed by retrospective acclaim and claims about record s significance in agreement with logan s original criticism he later said he should have changed arrangements because arrangements are too samey four or five other songs should have had a change of mood according to robert christgau in 1974 astral weeks is still considered unlistenable obscure by many astute observers merenstein on other hand still admires album to this day it gives me pain to hear it pain is wrong word i m so moved by it in 2001 album was certified gold by recording industry association of america having shipped 500 000 copies in us music historian andrew ford said album s commercial performance much like its musical aesthetic is similar to classical music neither instant nor evanescent astral weeks will sell as many copies this year as it did in 1968 and has every year in between ford 1997 pp 164 weeks has appeared in all time best album polls worldwide and according to acclaimed music it is 15th most ranked

and lasting universal poetic resonance album was also included in book 1001 albums you must hear before you die it was voted number 16 in colin larkin s all time top 1000 albums 3rd edition 2000 marcus referred to impact of album calling it a common language and related in a 2009 interview that i was so shocked when i was teaching a seminar at princeton just a couple years ago and out of 16 students four of them said their favorite album was astral weeks marcus goes on to say now how did it enter their lives we re talking about an album that was recorded well before they were born and yet it spoke to them they understood its language as soon as they heard it elvis costello described astral weeks as still most adventurous record made in rock medium and there hasn t been a record with that amount of daring made since hinton 1997 p 90 johnny depp in a rolling stone interview in 2008 recalled how when he was a preteen his older brother by ten years tiring of johnny s favourite music of time said try this and he put on van morrison s astral weeks and it stirred me i d never heard anything like it joan armatrading has said that astral weeks was first album she purchased as a teenager and that it opened her up musically in august 2010 director and choreographer jessica staged a production in portland oregon of a rock opera story ballet of astral weeks called find me beside you astral weeks revisited in november 2008 van morrison performed two concerts at hollywood bowl in los angeles california playing entire astral weeks album band featured jay berliner who played on

hollywood bowl performances and entitled astral weeks live at hollywood bowl concert film was released on 19 may 2009 when asked by rolling stone editor david wild why he was performing album again live after forty years morrison replied it received no promotion from warner bros that s why i never got to play songs live i had always wanted to play record live and fully orchestrated that is what this is all about i always like live recording and i like listening to live records too i m not too fond of being in a studio it s too contrived and too confining i like freedom of live in moment sound as for songs on original album morrison told los angeles times columnist randy lewis songs are poetic stories so meaning is same as always timeless and unchanging songs are works of fiction that will inherently have a different meaning for different people people take from it whatever their disposition to take from it is on 30 october 2015 album remastered was reissued by warner bros records
