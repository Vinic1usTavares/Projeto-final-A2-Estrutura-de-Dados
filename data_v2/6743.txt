in new media dutch language magazines for educated native youth such as jong java 1915 and jong bond 1917 advocated a modern national identity without traditional feudal system nationalist views were advocated through magazines for adults including pandji poestaka first published 1930 and first published 1932 these were short lived publications and only included literature as a supplement there were also unsuccessful attempts to found malay language literary publications such as malaya announced in 1921 founding sutan takdir alisjahbana editor of memadjoekan sastera advancing literature literary section of pandji poestaka since its creation in march 1932 met armijn pane when latter began submitting poems a vocal activist for literary renewal in a september 1932 letter alisjahbana called for new literary critics and asked armijn to invite poet amir hamzah to help them form a group after a long period of exchanging letters they decided to publish a magazine together magazine later given name poedjangga baroe was meant to advocate modernity and nationalism through literature which had never been done in indies founders all originating from sumatra also noted a lack of interaction between increasing number of poets and writers to avoid creative limitations of dutch east indies state owned publisher balai pustaka they agreed that magazine should be independent to gain support for poedjangga baroe in october 1932 hamzah was tasked with writing letters to solicit submissions a total of fifty letters were sent to noted writers including forty sent to contributors to memadjoekan sastera in january 1933 armijn went to meet alisjahbana and hamzah in batavia modern day jakarta three discussed armijn s proposed budget and stated goal of promoting a national language after meeting armijn sent follow up letters to previously contacted writers and reached an agreement with dutch publishing house kolff co in february 1933 group issued a prospectus that contained publication data and guaranteed that magazine would have no fewer than sixty four pages per issue other writers including armijn s elder brother sanusi pane and poet muhammad yamin were called to serve on editorial board worried that there would not be enough subscribers to support magazine and hoping to ensure a good reception from traditional groups founders sent letters to leaders of ten sultanates in archipelago asking that they subscribe to magazine however only muhammad sultan of pontianak agreed to subscribe publication in prospectus poedjangga baroe founders stated their intention to publish in may 1933 however initial publication was later delayed until july for two reasons firstly armijn intended to move to batavia to help with magazine and needed time to do so secondly a conflict arose between founders and kolff co about printing costs eventually leading founders to opt for self publication this first edition included a foreword by educators ki dewantara and eleven poems from solicited writers and two essays one by armijn and one by alisjahbana magazine continued to be primarily written in indonesian indeed magazine was first written mainly in indonesian and with exclusively indonesian editors nascent magazine under editorial control of armijn and alisjahbana was initially poorly received by political parties and actors they considered magazine which was generally non political liable to weaken nationalist movement by diverting it into less important areas to guarantee better support people who were not writers or literary critics were accepted onto editorial board first was accepted in 1935 other politicians involved during end of 1930s included amir sjarifuddin mohamad and during this period magazine began to have a wider scope closure poedjangga baroe was closed with fall of dutch east indies government after japanese invaded indies in february 1942 last issue published covered period of december 1941 to february 1942 editors wrote in that issue that they intended to continue publication as long as feasible this did not happen although later writers used a similar style until its closing original run of poedjangga baroe published about ninety issues after japanese surrender and towards end of indonesian national revolution a second series was published under same title by with new contributors including chairil anwar achdiat karta mihardja and asrul sani first edition of this new series dated march 1948 but released in may included a heated condemnation of indonesian leadership for perceived unwillingness to deal with suffering which occurred during occupation this new publication which jassin described as unoriginal ceased in 1954 it was later replaced by konfrontasi led by alisjahbana which published bi monthly from 1954 until 1962 poedjangga baroe paid subscribers were always fewer than 150 according to historian heather sutherland this low circulation was rooted in several cultural factors firstly native populace at time had limited literacy and education secondly native intellectuals mainly spoke dutch during formal discourse while others kept to local languages this led to comprehension issues for indonesian language poedjangga baroe throughout its publication poedjangga baroe had more than 125 employees or contributors most were of sumatran origin with a high school or greater education in westernized schools and a good command of dutch they were modernists and most were around age of twenty five when they first contributed according to armijn they were united by a view of life and not a shared literary style contents poedjangga baroe original stated mission to advocate a new style of literature and language that reflected indonesian national awakening lasted until april 1934 scope was slowly extended to culture art and social issues in 1935 after 1936 mission statement was that magazine was intended to be a guide to new dynamic enthusiasm to form a new culture indonesian culture according to sutherland however writers dealt mainly with needs and opinions of modernist pro westernization intellectuals discussions of socio political needs of masses were few according to 1933 press release from beginning poedjangga baroe was meant to include various types of literary works including fictional prose poetry in both modern and traditional forms non fiction literary reviews and critiques research and opinion pieces on language and literature original run of poedjangga baroe published more than 300 poems and in special editions several poetry anthologies although prose was less prominent poedjangga baroe published five dramas one novel and several short stories along with individual scholarly articles magazine also published special editions dedicated to collections of essays on indonesian emancipation figure kartini and bengali literary figure rabindranath tagore latter was published on occasion of tagore s death views politics writers for poedjangga baroe did not share a united political view and magazine ostensibly stayed politically neutral this stance was adopted to ensure magazine did not fall afoul of colonial government s censors and to protect contributors employed by government however writings falling under various parts political spectrum were published including works by cultural nationalists a sonnet dedicated to marxist theorist rosa luxemburg and notes on fascism culture although poedjangga baroe writers were united by nationalism they had different views on traditional culture some such as armijn and alisjahbana considered an understanding of western culture and history key to development others such sanusi emphasized need for eastern values though they accepted some aspects of western culture writers for poedjangga baroe did not share religious views main contributors including founders came from religious backgrounds ranging from near secularism to orthodox islam stemming from these conflicting cultural views between september 1935 and june 1939 numerous polemics were published in magazine discussing best course of action for indonesian cultural development language as opposed to balai pustaka which published works in regional languages and dutch poedjangga baroe was almost exclusively in indonesian and worked to promote language s growth indonesian declared to be language of unity in 1928 youth pledge was further extolled by armijn as having been long in development this was expanded by who wrote that language had seen greater growth and deviation from old malay since advent of dutch ethical policy and foundation of dutch schools for native indonesians entirety of november 1933 issue was dedicated to alisjahbana s writings on language poedjangga baroe held first seminar on indonesian language in surakarta in june 1938 seminar featured papers by sjarifuddin alisjahbana djamaluddin adinegoro and sanusi styles and themes contributors to poedjangga baroe were influenced by tachtigers a dutch literary movement from 1880s sutherland suggests that romantic theme prevalent in their works was adapted by authors to escape changing realities of indonesian society as opposed to earlier works published by balai pustaka such as marah rusli s sitti nurbaya 1922 which emphasized regional cultural values prose published in poedjangga baroe focused on national identity and writers included areas that they had never visited old themes such as forced marriage were abandoned according to sutherland most contributors to poedjangga baroe kept a sense of ambivalence towards dutch colonial government as well as traditional culture as a central theme in their works although they rejected dutch control of archipelago these nationalist writers embraced western culture sutherland writes that some of most staunchly nationalist writers were also most westernized keith an australian professor of indonesian literature and language writes that poems published in poedjangga baroe were structurally based in of traditional forms with an emphasis on aesthetic diction thematically he writes poems tended to deal with either lofty goals or a deep sense of loneliness in midst of natural beauty according to literary documentarian h b jassin poems though they adapted western forms and indonesian diction retained malay rhythms reception and legacy release of poedjangga baroe was well received by young writers and intellectuals who saw it as a way to express themselves and their nationalist ideas traditionalists however complained about poedjangga baroe modernization of malay marah sutan chairman of malay language teachers board stated that it betrayed purity of high malay and its traditional poetic forms traditionalists also decried introduction of loanwords to malay from regional and foreign languages to increase indonesian lexicon and deviation from traditional and other malay figures against publication included agus salim s m latif and sutan mohamad zain indonesian literature published between 1933 and 1942 is sometimes described as from poedjangga baroe generation a reference to publication s dominance translator and literary critic burton raffel described magazine as a midwife to a literary revolution noting that political revolution in 1940s was likely influenced by magazine however aesthetic qualities of works published in poedjangga baroe have received mixed reception in years after magazine stopped publication indonesian poet and literary critic muhammad balfas argued in 1976 that most poetry published in poedjangga baroe suffered from over sentimentality and flowery rhetoric which he blamed on writers being influenced by tachtigers many of works have since been forgotten leftist literary critic bakri siregar condemned poedjangga
