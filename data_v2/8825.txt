reviewer myles mcnutt praised jim pam storyline and daniels for using previous seasons of jim and pam s boring storylines to create greater drama for this episode and for season as a whole he also complimented change of dynamic episode caused saying that by allowing jim and pam to serve as point of dramatic interest rest of characters are loosened up to simply riff off of one another a dynamic that felt bogged down by andy s ascension to leadership position last season he rated episode a b new york writer michael tedder praised writers for going back to show s early style of ongoing plotlines and suspense in jim pam arc mark trammell of tv equals wrote that episode was not as good an episode as premiere but seeds were being sown for other payoffs down line in season bonnie stiernberg of paste was not so positive saying whole episode and season storyline was predictable and a wasted opportunity and that it ultimately did not live up to producers promise to shake things up in scranton stiernberg rated episode a 6 8 out of 10 episode s subplots however received mixed reviews mcnutt wrote that while tate had given a rather subtle and charming performance nellie dwight subplot felt like a leftover idea from previous season tedder on other hand liked dwight nellie subplot for its silliness concluding that ongoing plotlines are great but it s still little things on this show trammell felt that joke involving font was cute but he did not enjoy rest writing that resulting antics just weren t that funny mcnutt was not pleased with characterization of andy in episode calling him insufferable and plain unlikeable he also noted that clark and pete s prominence in subplot while enjoyable seemed weird for one part of show to be invested in exploring characters lives when another part of show is deploying newly introduced characters tedder complimented erin clark subplot for examining and introducing pete and clark further and called clark new ryan mark trammell enjoyed duke s acting writing few do nervous geek better than him these days well played sir stiernberg on other hand considered whole plot to be too icky and unfunny and that aftermath of pete and erin s dinner together was predictable references external links roy s wedding at nbc com category 2012 american television episodes category office american season 9 episodes category
