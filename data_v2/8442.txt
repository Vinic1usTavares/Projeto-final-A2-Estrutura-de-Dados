castleshaw roman fort was a castellum in roman province of britannia although there is no evidence to substantiate claim it has been suggested that castleshaw roman fort is site of rigodunum a brigantian settlement remains of fort are located on castle hill on eastern side of castleshaw valley at foot of standedge but overlooking valley redhead 1999 pp 74 81 hill is on edge of castleshaw in greater manchester fort was constructed in c ad 79 but fell out of use at some time during 90s it was replaced by a smaller fortlet built in c 105 around which a civilian settlement grew it may have served as a logistical and administrative centre although it was abandoned in 120s site has been subject of antiquarian and archaeological investigation since 18th century but civilian settlement lay undiscovered until 1990s fort fortlet and civilian settlement are all protected as a scheduled ancient monument recognising its importance as a nationally important archaeological site or historic building and protecting it against unauthorised change location thumb left view from castleshaw roman fort looking towards delph fort and fortlet at castleshaw are situated on a step of shale on eastern side of castleshaw valley below standedge part of pennine ridge in northern england walker 1989 p 5 from site there are clear views up and down valley although it is overshadowed by higher ground on all sides it is remote and exposed and lies along deva victrix chester to eboracum york roman road road crosses pennines at standedge where area dips and narrows creating a traversable pass which would have been guarded by castleshaw fort nearest forts are mamucium manchester to west and one at slack to east both on line of roman road walker 1989 p 15 there was also possibly a fortlet or signal station at between slack and castleshaw later fortlet is on same site as fort history roman fort at castleshaw constructed from turf and timber was built around 79 and guarded york to chester roman road due to site s protected status as a scheduled ancient monument it has not been possible to excavate fort however previous trenches have demonstrated that fort had two phases to its construction walker 1989 p 20 location of fort s granary stables principia headquarters praetorium commander s tent and six long narrow buildings which are possibly workshops or storerooms are all known fort was small would probably have been home to around 500 soldiers of an auxiliary cohort and fell out of use during mid ad 90s rather than allow defences to fall into potentially hostile hands or be used against rome fort was slighted fort was replaced by a fortlet also built using turf and timber in ad 105 although fortlet was built on same site as fort it did not use same foundation trenches there were two construction phases of fortlet second dating to c 120 featured gates an oven a well a granary a hypocaust a workshop barracks a commanders house a courtyard building and possibly a latrine walker 1989 p 21 barracks were built to accommodate 48 soldiers and even with administrative staff and officers garrison of fortlet would have numbered less than 100 redhead 1999 p 81 first phase was laid out along same lines as second phase fortlet defences as with most other fortlets were designed to withstand attacks from brigands or hold off an enemy until reinforcements from main army could arrive rather than withstand a determined attack walker 1989 p 25 a civilian settlement or vicus grew around fortlet in early 2nd century it probably would have been home to those who benefited from trade with garrison or hangers on of soldiers since it is unlikely that a garrison of under 100 could have supported a vicus it has been suggested that fortlet was a commissary fortlet one which was administrative and logistical centre of part of roman army walker 1989 p 79 with soldiers regularly arriving to collect pay and orders a vicus could have been supported fortlet fell out of use in mid 120s fort and fortlet of castleshaw were superseded by neighbouring forts at manchester and slack nevell and redhead 2005 p 59 vicus was abandoned around same time as fortlet fell out of use 2006 p 65 according to ptolemy there was a polis called rigodunum belonging to brigantes near position of castleshaw walker 1989 p 13 rigodunum means royal fort rivet 1980 p 18 although it has been suggested that castleshaw is location of brigantine settlement there is no evidence to support this stamps on two tegulae produced at roman at grimescar wood near huddersfield suggest fortlet was supplied by cohors iii from pannonia maybe even garrisoned by them at one stage walker 1989 p 78 similar stamps have been found in forts at manchester slack and ebchester indicating these forts were linked post roman thumb a plan of castleshaw drawn by thomas percival in 1752 showing fort and later fortlet after being abandoned by romans castleshaw was rediscovered by antiquarian thomas percival in 1752 remains were in good enough condition for him to draw a plan and he commented that he was pleased to find a double roman camp he also remarked that roman road from manchester running east to pennines was finest remain of a roman road in england that i ever saw site has suffered damage from ploughing in 18th and 19th centuries as it is situated in one of best draining areas of valley in 1897 a local antiquarian and poet ammon wrigley dug several trenches on site he did not record results of his digging and unrecorded digs continued on and off until 1907 walker 1989 pp 5 6 in 1907 site was bought for purpose of organised excavation and survey which continued from 1907 to 1908 under supervision of francis bruton who had recently been involved with excavation of mamucium walker 1989 p 6 spoil heaps from 1907 08 dig were never levelled leaving a series of misleading modern earthworks on interior of site walker 1989 p 7 under supervision of university of manchester further excavation was undertaken on site in 1957 61 and 1963 64 between 1984 and 1988 greater manchester archaeological unit undertook excavations and restoration of site a group led by professor barri jones an expert on roman britain was set up to co ordinate work walker 1989 p 2 north west water then owners of site ensured area would not be used for agriculture in an attempt to make site accessible to public outline of fort and fortlet was marked out in low mounds and an education centre was set up nearby area beyond fort was investigated for first time in 1995 96 archaeologists were searching for a civilian settlement or vicus associated with fort redhead 1999 p 75 surveys revealed a settlement triangular in shape and to south of fort vicus is listed as a scheduled ancient monument with fort and fortlet layout thumb left a plan of castleshaw drawn by francis bruton in 1908 showing fort and later fortlet in detail fort was rectangular in shape and had sides of and covering an area of approximately fortlet was built over south of fort making it difficult to discover what lay beneath it has been possible to however to ascertain that barrack buildings lay on east side of fort a granary on north and principia and praetorium to south west walker 1989 p 18 fortlet was rectangular with sides of by and covered it was originally thought to be surrounded by a single punic ditch but investigation revealed there to be two punic ditches separated by a wide berm walker 1989 pp 22 23 inner ditch was wide and deep while outer ditch was wide and deep walker 1989 p 23 a punic ditch is a defensive v shaped ditch with one side much steeper than other ditches surrounding fortlet had an outer face at 27 degrees and inner face at 69 degrees rampart behind ditches only survives to at its highest point it was built from turf on top of sandy clay with a rubble foundation fortlet ramparts to south lay on top of slighted fort ramparts walker 1989 p 27 whether corner towers were a feature of fortlet is unknown no evidence remains aside from a single posthole although only north and east corners survive in good condition walker 1989 p 28 there were two gateways one to north and one to south walker 1989 p 29 a civilian settlement is located to south of fortlet s defences redhead 1999 pp 76 77 extent of vicus is uncertain redhead 1999 p 80 however
