eleven he died shortly after turning eighteen very time most young people are beginning to explore life s wonderful possibilities my friend ryan was a very bright very brave and very normal young man who never wanted to be a symbol or a spokesperson for a deadly disease over years i ve shared many silly happy and painful moments with ryan and i was with him at end of his brief but eventful journey ryan is gone and just as anyone who has lost a loved one to aids i miss him deeply and constantly he is gone but i want his life to have meaning beyond his passing it is my hope president elect
