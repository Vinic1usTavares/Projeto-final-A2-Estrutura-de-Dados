meteorological history left thumb jtwc track of tropical storm vongfong after redevelopment on august 8 an area of convection or thunderstorms formed to west northwest of palau with a weak circulation connected to monsoon trough system had good outflow although it was initially within an area of increasing moderate wind shear which limited organization convection increased and although circulation was exposed shear later decreased enough for system to organize into a tropical depression on august 10 joint typhoon warning center jtwc labeled it as tropical depression 18w japan meteorological agency jma labeled it as an unnumbered depression and philippine atmospheric geophysical and astronomical services administration pagasa gave it name tropical depression milenyo upon developing depression was located in an area of weak steering currents still connected to monsoon rough and it moved slowly to west northwest thunderstorms continued to be sheared to west of circulation which limited strengthening on august 12 jtwc briefly upgraded system to a tropical storm after a temporary increase in thunderstorms although system soon weakened a ridge to north caused a general westward track toward philippines with a fully exposed circulation depression made landfall at 0800 utc on august 13 near infanta on philippine island of luzon it soon dissipated due to continued shear and land interaction remnants continued westward into south china sea and pagasa and jma both discontinued advisories early on august 14 however on august 15 a tropical depression re developed halfway between vietnam and philippines with a circulation exposed from convection due to moderate wind shear that day jtwc initiated advisories on tropical depression 20w after redevelopment wind shear continued to be a problem with convection located southwest of center early on august 17 a pulse in monsoon increased thunderstorms and allowed system to become better organized convection became more concentrated and circulation less exposed as a result jma upgraded depression to tropical storm vongfong early on august 18 still in central south china sea around that time storm began moving more quickly to northwest due to a developing ridge to its northeast although jma estimated peak 10 minute sustained winds of only 75 km h 45 mph jtwc assessed vongfong as continuing to intensify to peak 1 minute winds of 100 km h 65 mph early on august 19 by that time storm was near hainan and at 1240 utc that day vongfong made landfall in southern china near wuchuan guangdong it quickly weakened over
