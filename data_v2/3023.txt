which black swan odile tricks and seduces prince darren aronofsky first became interested in ballet when his sister studied dance at high school of performing arts in new york city basic idea for film started when he hired screenwriters to rework a screenplay called understudy which portrayed off broadway actors and explored notion of being haunted by a double aronofsky said screenplay had elements of all about eve roman polanski s tenant and fyodor dostoyevsky s novella double director had also seen numerous productions of swan lake and he connected duality of white swan and black swan to script when researching for production of black swan aronofsky found ballet to be a very insular world whose dancers were not impressed by movies regardless director found active and inactive dancers to share their experiences with him he also stood backstage to see bolshoi ballet perform at lincoln center for performing arts aronofsky called black swan a companion piece to his previous film wrestler recalling one of his early projects about a love affair between a wrestler and a ballerina he eventually separated wrestling and ballet worlds as too much for one movie he compared two films wrestling some consider lowest art if they would even call it art and ballet some people consider highest art but what was amazing to me was how similar performers in both of these worlds are they both make incredible use of their bodies to express themselves about psychological thriller nature of black swan actress natalie portman compared film s tone to polanski s 1968 film rosemary s baby while aronofsky said polanski s repulsion 1965 and tenant 1976 were big influences on final film actor vincent cassel also compared black swan to polanski s early works and additionally compared it to

possibility of a ballet film in 2000 and he found she was interested in playing a ballet dancer portman explained being part of black swan i m trying to find roles that demand more adulthood from me because you can get stuck in a very awful cute cycle as a woman in film especially being such a small person portman suggested to aronofsky that her good friend mila kunis would be perfect for role kunis contrasted lily with nina my character is very loose she s not as technically good as natalie s character but she has more passion naturally that s what nina lacks female characters are directed in swan lake production by thomas leroy played by cassel he compared his character to george balanchine who co founded new york city ballet and was a control freak a true artist using sexuality to direct his dancers portman and kunis started training six months before start of filming in order to attain a body type and muscle tone more similar to those of professional dancers portman worked out for five hours a day doing ballet cross training and swimming a few months closer to filming she began choreography training kunis engaged in cardio and pilates train ing seven days a week five hours for five six months total and was put on a very strict diet of 1 200 calories a day she lost 20 pounds from her normal weight of about 117 pounds and reported that portman became smaller than i did stated by kunis on jimmy kimmel live december 6 2010 kunis said i did ballet as a kid like every other kid does ballet you wear a tutu and you stand on stage and you look cute and twirl but this is very different because you can t fake it you can t just stay in there and like pretend you know what you re doing your whole body has to be structured differently georgina parkinson a ballet mistress

after release of requiem for a dream though script had not yet been written he told her about a love scene between competing ballet dancers and portman recalled i thought that was very interesting because this movie is in so many ways an exploration of an artist s ego and that narcissistic sort of attraction to yourself and also repulsion with yourself on decade s wait before production she said fact that i had spent so much time with idea allowed it to marinate a little before we shot screenplay understudy was written by andres heinz aronofsky first heard about it while editing his

mclaughlin rewrite understudy aronofsky said mclaughlin took my idea of swan lake and ballet and put story into ballet world and changed title to black swan when aronofsky proposed a detailed outline

aronofsky filmed black swan with a muted palette and a grainy style which he intended to be similar to wrestler aronofsky said controversies several critics noted striking similarities between satoshi kon s 1997 anime film perfect blue and aronofsky s black swan in response to comparisons between perfect blue and black swan aronofsky acknowledged similarities in 2010 but denied that black swan was inspired by perfect blue kon noted in his blog that he had met with aronofsky in 2001 costume design amy westcott is credited as costume designer and received several award nominations a publicized controversy arose regarding question of who had designed 40 ballet costumes for portman and dancers an article in british newspaper independent suggested those costumes had actually been created by rodarte s kate and laura westcott challenged that view and stated that in all only 7 costumes among them black and white swan had been created in a collaboration between rodarte westcott and aronofsky furthermore corps ballet s costumes were designed by zack brown for american ballet theatre and slightly adapted by westcott and her costume design department westcott said controversy is too complimentary a word for two people using their considerable self publicising resources to loudly complain about their credit once they realized how good film is dance double abt dancer sarah lane served as a dance double for portman in film in a march 3 blog entry for dance magazine editor in chief wendy perron asked do people really believe that it takes only one year to make a ballerina we know that natalie portman studied ballet as a kid and had a year of intensive training for film but that doesn t add up to being a ballerina however it seems that many people believe that portman did her own dancing in black swan this led to responses from benjamin millepied and aronofsky who both defended portman as well as a response from lane claiming that she has not been given due credit soundtrack non original music featured in black swan consists of music by tchaikovsky featuring performances on screen and in soundtrack by violinist tim fain and a track of electronica dance music by english production duo chemical brothers it marks fifth consecutive collaboration between aronofsky and english composer clint mansell who composed original score for film mansell attempted to score

swan is an instant guilty pleasure a gorgeously shot visually complex film whose badness is what s so good about it you might howl at sheer audacity of mixing mental illness with body fatiguing mind
