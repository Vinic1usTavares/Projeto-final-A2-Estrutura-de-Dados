lost at millennium stadium wenger used his post match news interview to praise goalscorer gilberto silva and asserted that brazilian would be a very strong player for team in incoming future he noted that dudek had kept liverpool in game for a long time and was critical of gerrard who he felt was fortunate not to have been sent off for a reckless and dangerous challenge on vieira wenger believed

want to beat you more we are quite used to that though as we have had some big fights in past four or five years houllier argued that his team paid arsenal too much respect in match and blamed his full backs xavier and traore for not providing width adding we need to have more flow in our game more safety in our passing construction gerrard was unrepentant for tackling vieira and stated he was trying to stamp his authority on match he accepted defeat and was optimistic liverpool had means to win premier league we d rather they beat us in this game and then we go on to pick up title that s what we re really looking at even though they got better of us yesterday it doesn t mean they ll do better than us over whole season diouf insisted he should have earned a penalty in second half given
