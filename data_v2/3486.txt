big inch and little big inch collectively known as inch pipelines are petroleum pipelines extending from texas to new jersey built between 1942 and 1944 as emergency war measures in u s before world war ii petroleum products were transported from oil fields of texas to north eastern states by sea by oil tankers after united states entered war on 1 january 1942 this vital link was attacked by german submarines in operation threatening both oil supplies to north east and its onward transshipment to great britain secretary of interior harold ickes championed pipeline project as a way of transporting petroleum by more secure interior route pipelines were government financed and owned but were built and operated by war emergency pipelines company a non profit corporation backed by a consortium of largest american oil companies it was longest biggest and heaviest project of its type then undertaken big and little big inch pipelines were long respectively with 35 pumping stations along their routes project required 16 000 people and of materials it was praised as an example of private public sector cooperation and featured extensively in us government propaganda after end of war there were extended arguments over how pipelines should be used in 1947 texas east transmission corporation purchased pipelines for 143 127 000 largest post war disposal of war surplus property corporation converted them to transport natural gas transforming energy market in north east little big inch was returned to carry oil in 1957 pipelines are owned by spectra energy partners and enterprise products and remain in use background thumb upright poster advertising importance of oil to united states war effort by time that united states entered world war ii in 1941 oil was a vital part of military operations around world united states produced 60 percent of world s crude oil with state of texas in south west leading this production producing more than twice as much crude as any other state industry comprised a handful of very large producers and more than 3 500 smaller operators north east coast of united states depended on these supplies of oil importing both crude and refined products across most of texas there had been little interest in building pipelines to transport oil and petroleum was typically moved from south west to north east coast using a mixture of sea freight and railroad transport in early 1941 70 000 barrels of oil were moved on railroads each day but this method was expensive and bulk of oil was moved using barges some with a capacity of up to 15 000 barrels operating up and down rivers and atlantic coast with outbreak of war eastern sea routes of country were attacked by german u boat submarines united states naval defence was very limited and largely obsolete between january and april 1942 among other naval losses 46 oil tankers were sunk and 16 damaged problem was made worse as 50 tankers had been sent to help uk earlier in 1941 insurers began to refuse to underwrite remaining vessels and volume of crude oil reaching north east from texas gulf dropped in response steps were taken to better protect tankers from attack but losses continued to mount until in april 1942 they were banned by navy from operating north east sea routes government and industry took steps to maximise use of railroads increasing amount of oil carried on them more than ten fold but there were shortages of rail tank cars and existing fleet of cars was in poor condition instead united states government began to examine options for use of pipelines to fulfil demand for petroleum in north east concept thumb 24 big inch pipes delivered by rail in february 1943 transporting petroleum by pipeline from south west to north east was a potentially attractive option for government as it would be safe from submarine attack and could operate efficiently regardless of weather pipelines had been in use in industry since 1862 but by 1930s they were usually only wide able to deliver 20 000 barrels of oil a day larger pipes could be built but due to structural weaknesses they could not operate at regular pressures technologies to build high pressure pipes at sizes larger than began to emerge during two decades before war but their adoption was not commercially viable concept of constructing such a pipeline was first proposed in 1940 by secretary of interior harold ickes who argued that building of a crude oil pipeline from texas to east might not be economically sound but that in event of an emergency it might be absolutely necessary a consortium led by standard oil put forward a bid to build one in spring 1941 but plan failed due to concerns over amount of steel that would be required for such a project in may 1941 ickes was appointed as petroleum coordinator for national defense and in december 1942 became administrator of petroleum administration for war new laws were passed to enable building of pipelines necessary for war effort including compulsory purchasing of land under right of eminent domain initial planning for inch pipelines began on may 15 1941 when a meeting of ickes and oil industry commissioned an aerial survey of possible route a preliminary design was ready that september and a consortium of major oil companies formed a new company national defense pipelines to build a pipeline along route government supply priorities and allocation board however refused to approve necessary steel and consortium s plan was dissolved shortly before outbreak of war after outbreak of fighting and consequent deterioration of sea routes for transporting oil industry representatives met in march 1942 to produce a new pipeline strategy called tulsa plan this included construction of inch pipelines backed by slogan longlines are lifelines for which steel was finally approved by war production board on june 10 once steel supplies had been agreed an initial tranche of 35 million in funding was provided by government reconstruction finance corporation which owned and manage operation of pipelines through its subsidiary organizations defense plants and defense supplies corporations in turn actual construction and operation of pipelines would be carried out by war emergency pipelines company wep a non profit corporation backed by a consortium of largest oil companies in united states atlantic refining cities service oil consolidated oil gulf oil pan american petroleum and transportation standard oil tidewater associated oil shell oil vacuum oil sun oil and texas pipe line company wep was led by burt hull and w alton jones both with extensive backgrounds in industry with oscar wolfe as its chief engineer company established its offices in little rock arkansas construction design and management thumb 220px first carload of seamless pipe for big inch inch pipelines comprised two systems big inch pipeline and little big inch pipeline big inch was a pipeline for crude oil it ran from east texas oil field at longview texas to norris city illinois and onto phoenixville pennsylvania from where it branched into segments one served new york and terminated at linden new jersey and other served philadelphia and terminated at chester junction pennsylvania little big inch a largely parallel line intended for refined products ran from beaumont texas to little rock arkansas where it joined path of big inch making use of same pumping stations from there it ran along same right of way as big inch to new jersey and pennsylvania pipeline project was longest biggest and heaviest of its kind in world in total big inch pipeline was long with of secondary distribution and feeder lines and had 28 pumping stations along route approximately every little big inch was long with of secondary lines and had seven unique pumping stations along its southern leg charles of dpc directed engineering project with much of work undertaken by oscar wolfe and on little inch pipeline f e richardson and l f scherer a meeting of all of contractors for build was held at start of july to kickstart project overall 82 different companies would take on pipeline work on a cost plus basis employing over 16 000 staff construction required government to acquire permission to build pipeline across 7 500 parcels of land of these right of eminent domain had to be exercised in 300 cases major a director in petroleum administration for war considered inch pipelines to be part of most amazing government industry cooperation ever achieved pipelines were soon given names big inch and little big inch by construction teams on account of their unprecedented diameters construction project was extensively advertised as part of us government s war time propaganda effort newsreels ran clips such as pipeline goes through and pipe dream comes true oil and short films were made about construction work including pipeline pipelines also appeared in rko pathe film oil is blood process thumb workers on big inch pipeline eating lunch 1942 big inch pipeline was made from sections of seamless diameter steel pipe up to long thick and in weight little big inch used both thick seamless steel and electric weld pipe and a small amount of thick seamless pipe in total 21 185 railcar loads of steel piping were laid during project big inch alone requiring of steel pipe was laid in trenches deep and wide dug out by a combination of ditching machines and manual labor pipes were then cleaned by pulling a workman through inside of them with cloths and welded together using both stovepiping method and roll weld or firing line methods stovepiping was an older method in which welder worked his way around two pipes which remained stationary newer roll weld approach instead rotated pipes allowing welder to remain in one position as he worked with up to seven pipes being welded together at same time where it was necessary for pipeline to curve to fit route steel pipes were bent using either a cold bending approach in which tractors would pull and push pipelines into position or a hot bending method with pipe heated up by blow torches and pulled into place using a jig a new specialized piece of equipment for bending pipes cummings bending jig was invented during big inch build and used on construction of little big inch pipeline to protect pipeline from corrosion its outside was then cleaned by machine and painted in first a layer of coal tar enamel and then hot coal tar coating before being wrapped in asbestos felt finally pipeline was lowered into position taking care not to damage ends of pipes larger pipes were so heavy that they required a d 8 caterpillar tractor equipped with counter weights to lift them trench was then back filled completing process big inch pipeline had to pass under 33 rivers and 200 creeks and lakes as well as under 289 railroad and 626 highway intersections specially lined tunnels were bored to lay pipe under roads and railroad lines and specialist trenches dug to lay pipelines across on riverbeds and lakes weighing down pipeline to stop it floating to surface around of underwater piping was laid in total in marshy areas soft ground was filled in to provide firm foundations for pipeline to rest on pumping stations for pipelines were built on parcels of land between and in size those with storage tanks were between and big plain utilitarian buildings were initially prefabricated steel constructs but as supplies grew scarce wood was used instead as much as of materials was needed for total project completion thumb ralph k davis george hull w alton jones and burt hull at official opening february 19 1943 work on inch pipelines began immediately after establishment of wep on june 26 1942 they were built in three phases first part to be constructed was big inch its initial leg running to an interim terminal at norris city where oil was to be off loaded to railroad network once this leg was complete it was extended to its terminus at phoenixville when big inch was complete work began on third phase of project little big inch first purchase order for of 24 inch diameter pipe was placed on july 2 1942 to meet a construction deadline of january 1 1943 laying of pipe began on august 3 1942 near little rock other pipeline crews began work immediately on segments elsewhere in arkansas and texas by september 10 all eight crews each consisting of between 300 and 400 men were in field working schedule called for of big inch pipeline to be laid each day but soon men were laying as much as a day in all roughly of material were excavated oil began flowing through big inch line between texas and illinois on new year s eve 1942 work on little big inch then began in 1943 first crude oil arrived at phoenixville via big inch on august 14 1943 and first refined product in little big inch arrived on march 2 1944 big inch carried up to 334 456 barrels of crude oil a day little big inch 239 844 barrels of gasoline lines were among largest industrial consumers of electricity in us requiring 3 89 million kilowatt hours a day to pump oil along pipes construction process recorded by john vachon post war sale thumb pumping station building near chambersburg pennsylvania in 2014 by end of war there was considerable debate over future of pipelines major oil companies such as standard oil campaigned for conversion of pipelines for transfer of natural gas engineers contracted to us surplus property administration proposed using lines for natural gas and tennessee gas and transmission company conducted a four month trial demand for natural gas was rising rapidly and it was produced in large quantities in texas oilfields but could not be got to market in north east and was otherwise burnt off uselessly into atmosphere railroad and coal companies who saw this as likely to introduce additional competition for coal and coal gas and therefore lower demand for their goods and services argued against this move smaller oil companies proposed continuing to use pipelines for oil in order to undermine transport monopolies of larger corporations a government inquiry was undertaken to determine future use of pipelines and took evidence from various stakeholders most of whom presented case that favored their companies or industry inquiry concluded that pipelines should be sold for continued use in transporting petroleum an auction for pipelines was announced in 1946 which was designed to give preference to bidders who intended to use them for moving petroleum 16 bids were received with highest cash bidders being companies hoping to use pipelines for natural gas assessing different bids proved difficult and discussions became enmeshed in national politics with companies seeking support from various washington politicians meanwhile a threatened national coal strike raised concerns over availability of natural gas strengthening arguments of natural gas lobby a fresh inquiry was declared in november voiding previous competition and inch lines were transferred to war assets administration on december 2 1946 for disposal pending any final decision on their sale lines were leased to tennessee gas company for use in shipping natural gas as far as ohio and appalachians but no further east and only for 12 months tennessee gas did not convert pipelines in any way for their new role and simply pumped gas through system under its own pressure moving of gas a day in this way a second auction was held with bids for natural gas given equal weight to those wishing to transfer crude oil although any natural gas bidder would be obliged to maintain oil pumping stations for use in a national emergency ten bids were received and on february 8 1947 texas east transmission corporation tetco was declared successful its bid of 143 127 000 would make disposal largest sale of war surplus property to private sector following world war ii conversion by tetco thumb 300px map of inch pipelines yellow big inch green little inch circles pumping stations rectangles storage tank farms tetco was brainchild of corporate lawyers charles francis and james elkins who convinced construction specialists george and herman brown and fuel engineer e holley poe that buying big and little inch pipelines could be a lucrative opportunity corporation was established specifically for purposes of bid and came to their bidding figure by estimating that likely competition would bid at 130 million their own figure exceeded this by 10 percent and added on 127 000 to avoid a suspiciously round number tetco believed it could afford to make this offer because it intended to reuse electric motors in oil pumping mechanisms for moving natural gas it also believed that price of gas would rise considerably in post war markets after winning bidding tetco raised money to pay government through a combination of bonds and share issues a further government enquiry was required before sale was allowed to go through which was complicated by reluctance of state of pennsylvania to allow pipelines to be used to pump gas east through its territory government of pennsylvania was influenced by coal industry who feared they would lose sales but it eventually relented and sale of pipelines to tetco was finally completed on november 1 value of company soared and original investors saw value of their holdings increase 63 fold tetco immediately began to convert pipelines for permanent use as natural gas transmission lines under direction of baxter goodrich their chief engineer 24 compressor stations were constructed along pipeline with centrifugal compressors increasing capacity of system to of gas a day and old oil pumps were retained for reuse in a future crisis steel valves replaced older less reliable cast iron designs demand continued to increase requiring additional compressor capability and by january 1949 pipelines were moving a day supply route undermined local markets for manufactured gas and major cities of north east rapidly converted to use of natural gas historian david waples describes how pipelines contributed to an extraordinary expansion of natural gas customers and gas company employees after world war ii inch pipelines encouraged development of further long distance pipelines in us through 1960s and 1970s later use thumb 1962 toy quonset hut sold as part of marx big inch pipeline construction set in 1957 operation of little big inch and its ownership south of ohio was transferred from tetco to subsidiary texas eastern petroleum products corporation teppco and converted back to use for petroleum products teppco was purchased by enterprise products in 2010 around 1961 there was discussion of converting big inch pipeline back to petroleum use but it continued in use as a gas pipeline in 1989 tetco was taken over by panhandle eastern corporation and in 1997 this company was merged with duke power to form duke energy corporation in 2007 oil pipelines were spun off from duke energy to form part of spectra energy partners inch pipelines are listed on national register of historic places along western parts of pipelines around 90 percent of pipes are original installation although in east large parts have since been replaced largely due to absence of anti corrosion protective coatings on original piping 62 of original buildings from 1942 and 1943 remain including pump houses offices employee houses and garages best surviving examples of original buildings are in pennsylvania a big inch pipeline construction playset was produced as a children s toy in 1962 by marx company list of pumping stations big inch and northern little big inch station
