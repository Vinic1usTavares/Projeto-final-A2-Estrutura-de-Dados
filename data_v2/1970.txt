convoy gp55 was a convoy of allied ships that travelled from sydney to brisbane in june 1943 during world war ii it comprised ten cargo ships three landing ships tank lsts and an escort of five corvettes japanese submarine i 174 attacked convoy on 16 june sinking united states army transport ship and damaging uss lst 469 two of corvettes counter attacked i 174 but only lightly damaged her australian military conducted an intensive search for i 174 in days after attack in mistaken belief that she had been significantly damaged this search was not successful and highlighted unsatisfactory communications between royal australian navy ran and royal australian air force raaf however another japanese submarine passing through area may have been sunk by raaf aircraft because of japan s deteriorating strategic situation i 174 was last imperial japanese navy ijn submarine to operate off australian east coast background during 1942 and 1943 japanese submarines periodically operated in waters surrounding australia a force of midget submarines raided sydney harbour on night of 31 may 1 june 1942 and attacks on merchant shipping travelling off east coast began several days later these attacks continued until august 1942 when japanese submarine force was redeployed stevens 2005 pp 194 95 201 03 i 174 made a 24 day patrol off australia in july and august 1942 but did not attack any ships stevens 2005 p 355 in response to japanese attacks australian naval authorities ordered that all ships with a displacement of more than 1 200 tons and a maximum speed of less than 12 knots travel in escorted convoys from 8 june stevens 2005 p 195 these convoys were successful in minimising losses and no escorted ships were sunk off australia during 1942 stevens 2005 p 205 thumb

in january 1943 i 21 made a highly successful patrol in january and february during which she sank five ships and two other submarines operated off sydney and brisbane in march stevens 2005 pp 218 20 223 24 a force of five boats from ijn s 3rd submarine squadron subsequently attacked shipping along full length of australian east coast during april and may in an attempt to disrupt allied supply line to new guinea this marked peak of japanese submarine offensive against australia and nine ships were sunk off east coast within a month stevens 2005 p 230 31 in contrast with 1942 several successful attacks were made against ships travelling in convoys gill 1968 pp 253 62 large number of japanese attacks in 1943 put great strain on allied forces responsible for protecting shipping off eastern australia australian naval authorities were forced in april to reduce number of convoys that sailed so their escort could be increased to at least four warships raaf also greatly increased number of aircraft allocated to escort convoys and ships sailing independently stevens 2005 pp 236 37 further ships and aircraft fitted for anti submarine warfare asw became available in may but were still not adequate to counter japanese attacks stevens 2005 p 239 sinking of hospital ship ahs centaur on 14 may 1943 with heavy loss of life led advisory war council to seek information from ran and raaf on actions being taken to protect shipping while ran acknowledged that bathurst class corvettes that made up most of its escort force were too slow it argued that losses suffered by escorted convoys were no worse than those in other parts of world despite navy s assurances australia s anti submarine forces were constrained by a shortage of training opportunities and poor coordination between ran raaf and united states navy australian military had also not kept pace with improvements to british and united states asw doctrine by fully implementing tactics that had proven most successful in other theatres of war stevens 2005 pp 239 242 attack i 174 departed from major japanese naval base at truk on 16 may 1943 under command of lieutenant nanbu and arrived off sandy cape queensland on 27 may she was only japanese boat operating off australia at time as all other available submarines were deployed to counter allied advances in solomon islands stevens 1993 p 36 she made an unsuccessful torpedo attack on american ship point san pedro on 1 june exchanged gunfire with u s army transport edward chambers three days later and on 5 june was driven off by convoy pg 53 s escorts on 7 june i 174 fired four torpedoes at american liberty ship john bartram all of which missed she sighted another convoy on 13 june too far away to attack during this period she was repeatedly attacked by allied aircraft and warships but did not sustain any damage hackett and kingsepp 2001 convoy gp55 was assembled in mid june 1943 as one of at least 69 convoys that sailed from sydney to brisbane during 1943 stevens 2005 p 363 it comprised ten cargo ships and three u s navy landing ships tank lst and was escorted by bathurst class corvettes which embarked convoy s senior officer and after departing sydney at 8 45 am on 15 june convoy maneuvered into five columns with three ships in each of centre columns and two in those at edges gill 1968 p 261 escorts surrounded convoy with four sailing ahead of it and deloraine to stern stevens 2005 p 234 raaf anson and beaufort aircraft also patrolled over convoy at all times stevens 2005 p 233 u s army transport portmar which had been badly damaged in bombing of darwin on 19 february 1942 had difficulty maintaining her position in convoy and at times straggled behind other ships i 174 sighted convoy gp55 about east of smoky cape at 4 37 pm on 16 june submarine immediately began preparations to attack allied ships and easily penetrated escort screen at this time portmar was trying to return to her station and was passing to port of uss lst 469 this made ships an ideal target for nanbu as they overlapped from viewpoint of his periscope accordingly he fired two torpedoes at them at 5 20 pm a single torpedo struck lst near her stern two minutes later resulting in severe damage and loss of 26 lives and 17 wounded portmar spotted second torpedo and attempted to evade it but was also struck on her starboard side transport s cargo of petrol and ammunition quickly caught fire and she sank within ten minutes one of her crew and a passenger were killed and 71 survivors including four who were injured were rescued by deloraine despite losing steerage lst 469 remained afloat and was taken under tow by corvette i 174 s attack on convoy gp55 was probably most successful made by a japanese submarine off australia while deloraine attended to torpedoed ships other four escorts attempted to locate japanese submarine i 174 had not been detected approaching convoy and after attack australian corvettes reversed their courses to conduct a sonar sweep of area from where she was presumed to have attacked this was in accordance with tactics that had recently been adopted by ran after they proved successful in battle of atlantic warrnambool detected submarine 23 minutes after attack and she and kalgoorlie subjected i 174 to four depth charge attacks over two hours until contact was lost an anson from no 71 squadron was escorting convoy at time two ships were torpedoed but was low on fuel and returned to base shortly after attack odgers 1968 p 151 while corvettes believed that they had sunk i 174 she was only lightly damaged and withdrew to east stevens 1993 p 40 australian failure to sink submarine was due to a lack of practice and too few ships being available to create an adequate search scheme after breaking off their attack warrnambool rejoined convoy while kalgoorlie assisted deloraine in protecting damaged lst deteriorating weather broke tow line between deloraine and lst 469 and instead corvette proceeded to nearby town of coffs harbour with portmar s survivors and lst s wounded personnel tugboat was dispatched from brisbane on 16 june to recover lst and towed her to sydney where they arrived on 20 june lst 469 had been carrying troops and supplies for operation chronicle an amphibious landing at woodlark and kiriwina islands on 30 june and this operation was hindered by her unavailability aftermath following attack australian chief of naval staff admiral sir guy royle judged that submarine had been damaged and ordered that special measures be taken to search for it raaf commenced air searches of an box south east of coffs harbour on night of 16 17 june while deloraine kalgoorlie and recently arrived destroyer patrolled area stevens 2005 p 235 on 17 june anson aircraft were assigned to patrol submarine s most likely escape routes in hope that this would force her to remain submerged during day and surface at night radar equipped beauforts relieved ansons after dusk and continued search wilson 2003 p 111 thumb left alt a world war ii era corvette at sea ship is not moving and ocean is flat hmas deloraine in early morning of 18 june two no 32 squadron beauforts attacked with bombs and gunfire what they took to be a submarine deloraine was less than from area of raaf attack but did not acknowledge repeated attempts by aircraft to communicate with her beauforts reported that they had damaged submarine and intensive efforts were made on 19 june to locate and sink her with twelve ansons continuously sweeping area while six vengeance dive bombers were held in readiness nearby no further sightings were made and it was assumed that submarine had been damaged by a no 32 squadron aircraft but escaped odgers 1968 p 152 naval historian david stevens has written that sighting made on 18 june was probably mistaken as i 174 was at least to east of where raaf attack took place and incident was not recorded in her war diary stevens 1993 p 41 however other historians believe that beauforts may have sunk i 178 which was patrolling off east coast of australia at time this submarine disappeared some time after 17 june 1943 and cause of her loss has never been confirmed crowhust 2012 pp 27 and kingsepp 2001a i 174 was ordered to depart from australian waters on 20 june and returned to truk on 1 july she did not make contact with any allied ships or aircraft after attacking gp55 seeming failure of raaf and ran to cooperate to finish off a damaged submarine led royle to order an inquiry into attack this found that a breakdown in communication between two services was main cause of failure with both aircraft and naval signal room in sydney making procedural errors rear admiral gerard muirhead gould naval officer in command of sydney region also noted that communications between ran and raaf were unsatisfactory at higher levels and that communication procedures to be used in anti submarine operations were not well known or understood in response he suggested that ran establish position of commander escort vessels group to organise and command escorts and coordinate their tactics attack on convoy gp55 was last attack made by a japanese submarine on east coast of australia gill 1968 p 262 two submarines were dispatched to operate off australia in july 1943 but were diverted to solomon islands shortly before reaching east coast following this japanese submarines were fully occupied responding to allied offensives and transporting supplies to isolated garrisons as threat to shipping declined ran ceased running convoys in waters south of newcastle on 7 december 1943 and sydney brisbane convoys ended on 10 february 1944 stevens 2005 pp 246 247 notes references category military attacks against
