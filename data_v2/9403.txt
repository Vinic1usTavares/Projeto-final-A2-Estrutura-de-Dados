martin at anime news network ann reviewed first episode as part of a fall 2008 anime preview guide brienza called series thoroughly enthralling when at its best and said that its imagery of death and destruction would be intriguing to viewers interested in apocalypse themed works she found opening and ending themes bright but boring and noted that they were at odds with story santos too disliked ending theme combined with takumi being an otaku with an imaginary girlfriend saying that despite being tongue in cheek it felt too overt and annoying he felt that takumi s growing paranoia music and art direction of graphically violent scenes worked well to set tone but that fluff involving takumi s imaginary girlfriend and his sister disrupted mood kimlinger also noted inconsistent tone and called female characters painfully artificial he was not opposed to combination of themes of otaku alienation and horror but called series horror mystery an uninteresting mix of higurashi when they cry and japanese psychological horror films martin called series a contender for weirdest anime of season and also compared tone to that of higurashi when they cry he liked visuals and music calling latter eerie and effective series reception reviewing series as a whole santos found it uneven with story elements ranging from being brilliant jaw droppers to feeling unfinished giving revelation of takumi s true nature as an example of former and conclusions to some character sub plots as examples of latter luke carroll at ann and john rose at fandom post were critical of story saying that while its ideas and question of what is and isn t real was interesting story felt rushed with game s narrative squeezed into too few episodes rose additionally was disappointed in how answers felt less innovative than mysteries originally seemed story was criticized by several reviewers as feeling confusing with bradley meek at t h e m anime reviews finding it confusing enough to quit watching after eighth episode and erin finnegan at ann calling it unwatchable due to how little it made sense to them despite a promising start chris homer and chris beveridge both at fandom post found story engaging however with latter calling climax solid santos said that series pseudoscience felt dubious but noted illusory di swords as well designed and a useful way to portray characters battling through use of their thoughts carroll also enjoyed use of di swords in action scenes but thought that it occurred too rarely beveridge similarly liked detailed visuals for special abilities some characters use santos and carroll both disliked character designs calling them bland and stereotypical beveridge however liked them and appreciated their solid feel santos carroll and meek disliked animation with former two citing off model characters frozen crowds static conversation scenes and a lack of fluidity and meek calling it a black mark on madhouse s usually stellar record rose however felt that animation was fairly strong carroll and santos enjoyed soundtrack with caroll calling it surprisingly well done santos particularly noted dissonance and silence used to portray unrest and turmoil inside takumi s mind and contrasting piano melodies used when takumi forms emotional connections to others as positives santos and carroll enjoyed haberkorn s performance as takumi but found remaining roles less well done santos said that most female characters were handled like plastic dating sim stereotypes finnegan however liked karbowski s performance as nanami and compared it
