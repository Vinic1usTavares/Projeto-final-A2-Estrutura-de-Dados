considered to have helped it find a wider audience including a significant female viewership scream was credited with revitalizing horror genre in 1990s which was considered to be almost dead following an influx of direct to video titles and numerous sequels to established horror franchises of 1970s and 1980s these sequels drew decreasing financial and critical success as they exploited

taken away by ambulance and gale makes an impromptu news report about night s events cast production writing scream was originally developed under title scary movie by kevin williamson an aspiring screenwriter influenced by a news story he was watching about a series of grisly murders by gainesville ripper williamson became concerned about intruders upon finding an open window in house where he was staying he was inspired to draft an 18 page script treatment about a young woman alone in a house who is taunted over phone and then attacked by a masked killer treatment remained as a short story while williamson worked on another script teaching mrs tingle a thriller that he would eventually sell but that would languish in development hell for many years struggling to pay his bills williamson secluded himself in palm springs and focused on development of his scary movie treatment hoping for a quick sale to meet his financial needs over course of three days williamson developed a full length script as well as two separate five page outlines for potential sequels scary movie 2 and scary movie 3 he hoped to entice buyers with potential for a franchise in an interview williamson said that one reason he focused on scary movie script was because it was a film he wanted to watch born of his childhood love of horror films such as halloween but nobody else was making it his appreciation for previous horror films became evident in script which was inspired by and references films such as halloween friday 13th a nightmare on elm street when a stranger calls and prom night williamson listened to soundtrack of halloween for inspiration while writing script excerpts from soundtrack appear in film by june 1995 williamson brought scary movie script to his agent rob paris to put out for sale paris warned him that level of violence and gore in his script would make it impossible to sell following script s purchase by miramax williamson was required to remove much of gorier content such as graphic depictions of internal organs of gutted murder victims rolling down their legs however once craven was secured as director he was able to bring much of excised content back williamson was going to remove a scene in school bathroom featuring sidney as he felt it was awkward and out of place in film craven insisted scene should remain as he felt it developed character and her relationship with her deceased mother williamson later confirmed that he was glad that craven proved him wrong about scene dimension films head bob weinstein realized while reviewing script that there were thirty pages approximately thirty on screen minutes without a murder so he instructed williamson to have another character killed williamson included death of character principal himbry winkler based on this input and in doing so inadvertently resolved a problem in script s finale williamson had struggled to find a reason for several extraneous characters to leave a party scene so that killer could attack finally determining that announcement of discovery of himbry s corpse would serve to remove non essential characters who are so upset that they leave party before and enabling start of murders concerning killers motives williamson felt it was essential for audience to learn why antagonists had become killers but he also felt it was potentially scarier if they had no motivation opinions at studio were split between those who believed a motive was needed for resolution and those who felt action was scarier without one as there were two killers williamson decided to do both billy loomis had motive of maternal abandonment while second killer stu macher jokingly suggests peer pressure as his motive when prompted development script for what was then known as scary movie went on sale on a friday in june 1995 but received no bids by following monday script had become subject of a significant bidding war among a host of established studios including paramount pictures universal pictures and morgan creek productions producer cathy konrad read script and felt it was exactly what weinstein brothers of fledgling dimension films then a part of miramax were looking for dimension had previously released several horror films and intended to focus on that genre konrad brought script to bob weinstein s assistant richard potter believing it had potential he brought it to weinstein s attention studios began to drop out of bidding as price of script increased and final two bidders were oliver stone who was at time working under pictures and weinsteins of dimension films williamson agreed to a bid of 400 000 from miramax plus a contract for two sequels and a possible fourth unrelated film williamson said he chose dimension because he believed they would produce scary movie immediately and without significantly censoring violence in script craven read script before he became involved in production and considered convincing a studio to buy it for him to direct however by time craven read script it had already been sold bob weinstein approached craven early in planning stages because he felt craven s previous work in genre that combined horror and comedy would make him perfect person to bring williamson s script to screen craven was already busy developing a remake of haunting and was considering distancing himself from horror genre he was growing weary of what he felt was an inherent misogyny and violence in it weinstein approached other directors including robert rodriguez danny boyle george a romero and sam raimi williamson said that they didn t get it he was concerned that having read script many of directors believed film to be purely a comedy craven was approached again but continued to pass in spite of repeated requests when production of haunting collapsed craven was freed from that commitment and found himself in need of a project meanwhile drew barrymore had signed on to film at her own request when he heard an established actress wanted to be involved craven reasoned that scary movie might be different from other films of genre he had previously undertaken and he contacted weinstein to accept job as film neared completion weinstein brothers changed film s title from scary movie to scream they were inspired by michael jackson song of same name bob weinstein considered scary movie to be an unsuitable title as in addition to horror and violence film contained elements of satire and comedy weinstein wished for that to be better conveyed by title change was effected so late into production that congratulatory gifts bore original name williamson and craven immediately disliked new title and considered it stupid both later remarked that change turned out to be positive and that weinstein had been wise to pick new title following a screening of film in front of a test audience and miramax executives craven was offered a two picture contract for sequels to scream sony pictures filed a lawsuit against dimension films and miramax claiming that title scream infringed on copyright of sony s own screamers 1995 released previous year after case was settled out of court details remain confidential scream 2 producer marianne maddalena considered that case was a result of other issues between two companies and did not truly pertain to film s moniker maddalena confirmed that studio was free to use scream brand for future films casting scream was a turning point in terms of casting for horror genre which normally involved relatively unknown actors genre was considered unsuitable for bigger names as films had lower budgets and often attained negative critical response drew barrymore read script and was interested in being involved she approached production team herself to request a role barrymore a member of barrymore family of actors and granddaughter of actor john barrymore had become a star in her own right following her appearance in e t extra terrestrial 1982 producers were quick to take advantage of her unexpected interest and signed her to play lead role of sidney prescott her involvement was believed to be instrumental in attracting other popular actors to film in spite of its smaller budget and in causing craven to reconsider his decision to direct film before filming began barrymore was faced with unexpected commitments that meant she would no longer be available to play demanding lead role she instead played smaller role of casey becker which allowed her to remain involved and still gave production advantage of her stature killing off one of their biggest stars early in film was considered a calculated risk but it was believed that it would be so shocking and unexpected that audience would then believe that any character could die actresses including alicia witt and brittany murphy auditioned for lead role of sidney producers also approached reese witherspoon though she never auditioned craven had seen neve campbell in tv show party of five and asked her to audition for part he believed she could portray a character who was innocent but who could also realistically handle herself while dealing with physical conflict and emotions required by role campbell was initially reluctant to perform in another horror film so soon after her supporting role in craft after a successful audition campbell accepted an offer to play lead character she accepted because scream would be her first leading role and because she adored character saying she s a fantastic character for any kind of movie thumb central young cast of scream from left to right ulrich campbell lillard mcgowan and kennedy for character of news reporter gale weathers studio wanted a recognizable actress they auditioned brooke shields and janeane garofalo courteney cox who was starring in sitcom friends at time approached production herself to pursue role she was interested in playing a bitch character to offset her nice friends image this image was main reason why producers initially refused to consider cox for part cox continued to lobby studio as she felt she could believably play character her efforts ultimately succeeded actresses melinda clarke and rebecca gayheart auditioned for role of tatum riley before rose mcgowan was cast casting director believed she best embodied spunky cynical but innocent nature of character studio felt strong female cast of campbell barrymore cox and mcgowan would help draw a significant female audience to film gayheart would later land a role in scream 2 kevin patrick walls and justin whalin were among final candidates for key role of sidney s boyfriend billy loomis whalin took part in auditions with campbell skeet ulrich ultimately secured role producers viewed him as perfect for part and noted his resemblance to a young johnny depp as he appeared in a nightmare on elm street one of many films scream references ulrich and campbell had worked together on craft shortly before scream they believed experience helped them be more comfortable with each other which allowed a more natural portrayal of relationship between their characters though he failed to win loomis role walls remained in film in minor role of steve orth boyfriend of barrymore s casey becker david arquette was also approached for role of billy loomis but he asked to read for part of dewey riley after reading script role described as hunky was considered ill fitting for arquette s lean slender appearance and approach but arquette was still allowed to audition for part craven appreciated his softer funnier approach to character and gave him role matthew lillard was cast as billy s equally sadistic friend stu macher by chance after accompanying his then girlfriend to an unrelated audition taking place elsewhere in same building casting director lisa beach saw lillard in hallway and asked him to audition for part he got into role with incredible ferocity role of randy meeks was contested between jamie kennedy and breckin meyer producers favored kennedy believing him to best embody role as he had no major roles prior to scream studio wanted a more prominent actor than kennedy to play character producers were adamant that he was best choice and successfully fought to keep him roger l jackson voice of character ghostface was picked at end of several weeks of local casting in santa rosa where parts of scream were filmed producers had originally intended to use his voice only as a placeholder dubbing over it during post production they decided that jackson s contribution was perfect and kept it craven described it as an intelligent and evil voice that would become irreplaceable to series to aid their performance jackson was never allowed to meet other actors preventing them from associating a face with menacing voice jackson was present on set and spoke to actors by phone to help aid their performance cast was rounded out by w earl brown who played gale weather s cameraman kenny joseph whipp who portrayed sheriff burke lawrence hecht as neil prescott sidney s father and c w morgan as hank loomis billy s father liev schreiber appeared in a minor role as cotton weary framed killer of sidney s mother and linda blair made a brief cameo as a tv reporter outside school henry winkler appeared as principal himbry an aggressive school principal he remained uncredited so as to not draw attention away from young main cast filming left thumb stu house location of 40 minute finale of film filming took place at house over 21 nights principal photography for scream took place over eight weeks between april 15 and june 8 1996 on a budget of 15 million weinsteins wanted to film in vancouver as it was estimated that they could save 1 million in costs compared to shooting in united states craven was adamant about filming in united states and making a film that looked truly american argument over where to film almost led to craven being removed from project but weinsteins eventually agreed to keep production in america location scouts looked at north carolina as a possibility but found that sites that seemed appropriate for film s requirements would have required extensive building repairs or modification which would have inflated costs attention was next turned towards california scouts discovered sonoma county and cities of santa rosa healdsburg and nearby tomales bay house of barrymore s character is situated southeast of santa rosa on sonoma mountain road directly facing house used in horror film 1983 home of sidney prescott is located near calistoga north of santa rosa tatum s home is situated on mcdonald avenue in santa rosa next to houses used in pollyanna 1960 and shadow of a doubt 1943 home of lillard s character which is location for entire third act is a house on tomales road east of tomales bay that had only recently become available after death of its owners woodsboro town square including fountain where many of cast sit in an early scene is represented by healdsburg town square for woodsboro high school craven desired a building that looked american and producers approached santa rosa high school school board insisted on seeing script and immediately objected to violence against teenage children and cynical dark dialogue including that of fictional school principal local newspapers criticized project and irate parents objected to such a film taking place at their children s school comparisons were made between film violence and kidnap and murder of polly klaas three years prior which had left area sensitized toward violence producers received support from school s students and some local residents who recognized that economic benefits would be generated by film s presence others argued for film s first amendment rights dispute resulted in a three hour debate scheduled for april 16 one day after filming was to begin unwilling to be delayed craven began filming as scheduled on 15th he started with opening scene of film which features barrymore scene took five days to complete result of santa rosa debate was that permission would be denied production was forced to find another location for school and ended up filming at sonoma community center southeast of santa rosa progress of filming was criticized early on bob weinstein disliked ghostface mask believing it was not scary upon reviewing dailies footage of opening scene studio was concerned that film was progressing in an unwanted direction they considered replacing craven to assuage their concerns craven and editor patrick lussier developed a rough workprint version of opening 13 minutes of film to demonstrate how completed film might turn out after viewing new footage studio was content to let craven continue as director weinstein having seen mask in action was satisfied that it could be scary third and final act of film over forty minutes long is set at a house party where ghostface strikes it was shot at a vacant property in tomales over 21 nights scene labelled scene 118 was considered most difficult to shoot as it took place entirely in one location yet featured individual stories and deaths of multiple characters actors spent weeks undertaking intense emotional and physical scenes while coated in fake blood and wounds as scene was set during evening production had no choice but to halt at dawn director of photography mark irwin was fired during filming of screams finale a week before principal photography was to be completed upon review of dailies craven found footage was out of focus and unusable irwin was initially ordered to fire his camera crew he retorted that if his crew were to be fired they would also have to fire him producers fired him and replaced him with peter deming who finished film special effects and design thumb barrymore s replica model and chair used to display steve orth s death note actor kneeling behind it to produce many grisly effects for film producers recruited knb effects team howard berger robert kurtzman and gregory nicotero one of their first tasks was production of a mask for film s killer in his script williamson had only described antagonist as a masked killer which gave craven no specific information on what type of mask to use or how to conceal body while location scouting maddalena discovered ghostface mask hanging from a post inside house previously used for film shadow of a doubt craven wanted to use it but mask design was owned by fun world a costume company he was told to create one that production could own knb developed multiple design sketches varying from deformed faces to monstrous riddled with fangs craven found nothing like ghostface design so he had knb develop a mask that was based on it with enough differences to avoid any claim of copyright team developed several molds based on ghostface design but craven found none were as suitable as mask he wanted to use desperate to use design craven finally convinced studio to approach fun world and gained permission to use mask while negotiations were in progress he had knb make a mask that was very similar to original mask but was appropriate for use in filming mask they produced made of a thin foam was used in two scenes of film opening scene with barrymore s character and murder of principal himbry craven disliked mask due to its slight differences from original and thus used fun world design for rest of filming knb effects created over 50 gallons of fake blood normally composed of corn syrup and food dye to create special effect of severe wounds for penetrating effect of knives production used collapsible blades to prevent injury an umbrella with a retractable tip is used as a stabbing weapon in finale ulrich wore a protective vest beneath his shirt to help prevent harm while a stuntwoman attacked him with it second thrust missed vest and stabbed ulrich on his chest impacting a wound from an open heart surgery operation ulrich s genuine pain was captured on film and used in release version of scream two of most complex special effects in film were corpses of barrymore s and walls characters casey becker and steve orth their deaths involved character being gutted from ribcage to pelvis essentially out torso of internal organs with guts rolling from wound to allow walls to continue to move and feign death while displaying wound knb designed a chair with no back actor would kneel behind it while his upper body head and arms were positioned within chair s seating area an anatomical model representing character s torso and legs was positioned in chair and disguised so that actor s upper body and model appeared to be one piece fake abdomen was filled with rubber latex and gelatin pieces smeared in fake blood internal organs which could then fall free other effect involved barrymore s character being gutted and hanged by neck from a tree team utilized a similar approach but replicated barrymore s entire body as it would be impossible to conceal her real body and display special effect of her character having been gutted post production after filming was completed in june 1996 craven spent two months editing final product he encountered repeated conflicts with motion picture association of america film rating system mpaa concerning content of scenes he was forced to tone down or obscure more intense scenes and overall violence to avoid an nc 17 rating which is considered box office suicide cinemas and retail chains often refused to stock nc 17 titles though dimension had previously released nc 17 rated films rating made those films difficult to market and attract an audience dimension was desperate for a less restrictive r rating but producers felt demanded cuts would remove key elements from film and reduce its quality opening scene featuring barrymore was one of most difficult parts to process through mpaa who required cuts based on its intensity craven lied to mpaa claiming he had only one take of scene and could not replace it with something less intense mpaa allowed scene craven sent eight different cuts of film to deal with complaints problematic scenes included gutting death of steve orth walls where he was required to remove any movement of character s internal organs throat cutting of kenny where he had to trim end of scene as mpaa felt actor s pained expression was too disturbing and they had to shorten length of time spent viewing crushed head of tatum riley mpaa still held issue with a scene from finale where killers ulrich and lillard stab each other creating large amounts of visible blood mpaa required that blood not be seen in motion falling to floor from body it seemed unlikely that film would be able to achieve an r rating without further significant cuts with film s release date drawing closer bob weinstein intervened and personally contacted mpaa he believed they misunderstood film and to which genre scream really belonged and were focusing too much on horror elements weinstein explained that although he agreed with their assessment that film was intense film also had comedic elements and satire it was not just a horror film glorifying violence mpaa reviewed their decision shortly thereafter film was granted an r rating music scream score was provided by fledgling composer marco beltrami his first time scoring a feature film craven s assistant julie had requested input on composers who were new fresh and wonderful and was given beltrami s name by several people beltrami was contacted for samples of his work craven impressed by what he heard requested beltrami come to set to view opening thirteen minutes of film containing introduction and death of barrymore s character beltrami was tasked with scoring a piece of music for this scene which would be reviewed by producers and weinstein brothers beltrami was hired to score entire film on basis of this sample beltrami had no prior experience scoring a work of horror craven and editor patrick lussier advised him on how to deliver music that would raise tension and how to use stings to punctuate more intense moments craven wanted music to intentionally raise tension during scenes where audience expectations were already raised by their experience of previous horror films volume would be raised to indicate that killer is hiding behind a door but nothing would be present upon its opening beltrami decided to intentionally disregard conventional horror score styles he approached film as a western taking influence from ennio morricone a prolific composer for many westerns when scoring a theme for character of dewey arquette beltrami approached him as a quirky wild west sheriff using a morricone style guitar accompaniment sidney prescott s theme titled sidney s lament features a female choral arrangement expressing sorrow concerning character s situation beltrami states that voice spoke for character lamenting loss of her mother christian clemmensen of filmtracks called haunting vocals of track voice of franchise song was used throughout film s sequels release scream held its premiere on december 18 1996 at amc avco theater in westwood los angeles california bob weinstein ordered that film be released on december 20 1996 a date others were critical of as it was christmas period where seasonal and family films were more prevalent weinstein argued this fact was in film s favor as it meant that horror fans and teenagers had nothing interesting to watch during december period when screams first weekend takings amounted to only 6 million it was considered that this release date gamble had failed but following week takings did not drop but increased and continued to increase in following weeks leading to a

generally favorable reviews peter stack of san francisco chronicle appreciated shift from teen slasher films of 1980s and their endless series of laborious half baked sequels kevin thomas of los angeles times called scream a bravura provocative of horror pictures and complimented film for being scary and gruesome while avoiding a sense of morbidity empire adam smith called it clever quick and bloody funny williamson s script was praised as containing a fiendishly clever complicated plot which deftly mixes irony self reference and wry social commentary with chills and blood spills time out london lauded film s intelligence and scares while praising casting saying at last a horror movie to shout about film4 cited craven s own wes craven s new nightmare 1994 and its cast of self aware characters as inspiration for scream but declared that while new nightmare was a noble failure pretty smart but crucially not very scary that scream was not merely clever it is from its breathtaking opening sequence with barrymore as woman in peril onwards simply terrifying roger ebert of chicago sun times gave film a positive review of 3 out of 4 stars appreciating in jokes and self aware characters but was confused over whether level of violence was defused by ironic way film uses it and comments on it new york times janet maslin was not as appreciative saying not much of scream is that gruesome she wrote that craven wants things both ways capitalizing on lurid material while undermining it with mocking humor not even horror fans who can answer all this film s knowing trivia questions may be fully comfortable with such an exploitative mix despite being critical of film itself calling it one experiment that needed more lab time variety complimented strong ensemble cast singling out performances of campbell and ulrich as charismatic bbc claimed that film had promise saying it appeared to be clever dangerous witty and fresh but went on to label it as derivative of films it satirized scream runs out of humour and in turn robs itself of chance to get audience to take thrills and gut spills it offers seriously awards scream received several awards and award nominations following its release including saturn award for best actress for campbell best writing for kevin williamson and best horror film it received saturn nominations for best director for wes
