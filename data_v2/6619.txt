commented when mr pinero is at his best we reckon ourselves as close upon high water mark of theatrical enjoyment this or that playwright may show more heart than mr pinero or a more delicate subtlety a third may easily outclass him in intellectual gymnastic but in his command of resources of stage for legitimate purposes of stage he is without a rival as it was said of euripides that he was most tragic of tragic writers as it might be said of moliere that he was most comic of comic writers so it may be said of mr pinero that of all our dramatists to day he is most dramatic art of drama is quintessentially art of story telling as sculptors say in round mr pinero is supreme as a story teller of that sort we are always keenly interested in what his people are doing at moment we always
