standard theatrical company was extremely good this was not by chance for many key persons at thanhouser company including edwin thanhouser himself had experience on stage edwin thanhouser knew stage represented a great pool of acting talent but many actors were regular citizenry yet anonymity was rule until towards 1912 and so on until star system would come to force around 1914 release and reception single reel drama approximately 1 000 feet long was released on march 3 1911 billboards reviewer gave a positive review and asserted any motion picture in which views of back on stage are shown possesses a certain degree of interest ever curious public is fascinated by alluring stories of stage world and any peep it is given into this realm is welcomed because of this stage struck derives interest it has as far as story is concerned there is no special recommendation for it theatre settings are about as faithful depictions of stage scenes as are found in motion pictures player portraying role of leading actor very much exaggerates in makeup photography is very good both morning telegraph and new york dramatic mirror thought conclusion was impossible turn of events telegraphs reviewer wrote an excellent opportunity was sadly missed for exposition of a strong lesson to uninitiated girl or boy who dreams of a career before footlights how any author or producer could permit such an impossible ending is a wonder can any sensible person imagine a new york manager offering an inexperienced amateur a leading part in a broadway production yet this is what occurs in this tale of a stage struck miss who joins a repertoire company is stranded gets home through generosity of a traveling salesman and then with no lapse of time or experience noted receives a letter with such an offer most of play was well put on and ably acted star of theatrical company wore an abominable wig which could be distinguished as false more care and thought would have made this an admirable offering mirror reviewer stated production leaves impression of being exceedingly well done but to average actor new york engagement after forsaking her barnstorming company of players seems somewhat of a dream it was also startling to see her playing ophelia after such a flat failure at previous rehearsal where another took her place according to synopsis it is likely that this new york production in which she foresees herself on stage as ophelia is a dream because it is prompted by two letters she received at home film is presumed lost because film is not known to be held in any
