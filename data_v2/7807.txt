accepted namely in case of sub zero once again appearing youthful rather than his depiction as a septuagenarian in deadly alliance sub zero sported a grandmaster armor set that was often likened to shredder from teenage mutant ninja turtles franchise scorpion was redesigned to resemble a more classical ninja look while characters like ermac received a considerable makeover from standard palette swap ninja fare offering up a more sorcerer like appearance development mortal kombat co creator ed boon wanted deception to be an unpredictable fighting game that gave players new features they could never imagine in order to do so midway staff listened to fans on bulletin boards to know what to work on for deception such as playable characters wanting to surprise fans and make game deeper they added puzzle and chess minigames chess minigame had first been considered for deadly alliance but developers lacked time to implement it ed boon on twitter young we actually had idea during deadly alliance but didn t have time to do it so we held on to it for deception boon and john supervised staff which was divided into teams to work on different areas of game one of their concerns was to maintain traditional feel of mk series as they wanted game s violence to make it a more realistic fighting game rather than a fighting simulator character appearances were improved to make their moves more responsive to player s input they also wanted to bring back several characters they felt were absent for too long including sindel nightwolf baraka and mileena and an arena with several weapons which players could use to fight however it was remade to become liu kang s tomb arena characters combos were redesigned to be distinctive so that they would be more important as boon noted they were necessary for any move player would use to inflict more damage on an opponent midway staff focused on designs and functions of backgrounds wanting to make them as influential to outcome of battle as fighting between characters because of popular demand and favorable reception of deadly alliance number of finishing moves known as fatalities increased to two per character fatalities were developed by a group of animators led by carlos pesina they comically described mileena s fatality in which she eats opponents neck as most disturbing due to how her sexy moves are modeled from pesina hara kiri moves were added to allow losers to perform a finishing move as well creating a race between both players death traps meant to be introduced in previous game were added to give combat more strategy as well as to give more chances to players to win a fight if they are at a disadvantage game was originally meant to have other new finishing moves such as tortures and falling cliffs similar to fatalities one of main features of deception was emphasis on online gameplay which had yet to become common for console fighting games a team of engineers took almost a full year to decide if feature was viable mk team focused their energies solely on platforms that had strong online functionality available to end consumer this led to a greater focus on playstation 2 and xbox versions because gamecube games require some re engineering compared to other platforms when porting it was decided to exclude gamecube from work of team until online hurdles were cleared some time after game s release boon commented that he was disappointed that gamecube version did not feature online gameplay as he regarded it as best in business details about game were first confirmed to general public in may 2003 issue of playstation official magazine in which game was called mortal kombat vi and an online mode was confirmed on february 6 2004 midway registered domain names com and com when midway

praised interaction with stages as one of best parts of game commenting that it adds more strategy to combat he praised return of classic characters commenting on their new designs and how different their attacks are jeremy dunham of ign wrote that it was best game of mortal kombat series he also stated that removal of special move buttons which caused too much damage to an opponent was one of developer s best decisions with special moves removed from fights and addition of breakers players are now able to stop any combo however he called character designs in deception robotic in comparison to other fighting games such as dead or alive series or virtua fighter 4 soundtrack was also criticized for having basic sound effects gamespot s greg kasavin commented that fights have been highly improved with addition of new fighting styles which is clearly inspired by kung fu movies although he stated fights were not perfect and noted they could end in a few seconds due to interaction with arenas he liked how painful and funny some moves looked teamxbox s dale nardozzi praised characters animations and movements adding that soundtrack sets tone perfectly for your basic decapitations and impalements konquest mode received mixed opinions dunham liked how konquest mode explains storyline from game conversely kasavin commented that konquest mode is weak point from game and described it as ugly lacking good voice acting and graphics however he noted that one of few nice touches in konquest was hitting anybody you want he added that mode had to be completed if he wanted to unlock characters bedigian complained that konquest is biggest flaw of game criticizing storyline trainings and voice acting however nardozzi found mini games to be very entertaining if played online in contrast to xbox and ps2 versions gamecube port received lower scores from publications it has been criticized for lack of an online mode and pixelated picture quality on unlockable videos cutscenes though 1up com still praised it although addition of goro and shao kahn was well received gamespot opined that other ports were better while also commenting on goro s appearance which looks anemic in his review gamespy s miguel lopez wrote gamecube version is far from best version of game and advised players to use another port to play mortal kombat unchained mortal kombat unchained is title of playstation portable version of mortal kombat deception developed by just games interactive game was released on november 13 2006 in north america november 24 2006 in europe and december 9 2006 in australia unchained includes all characters from gamecube version and four more characters blaze frost jax and kitana from mortal kombat deadly alliance that are exclusive to playstation portable version four characters have only one fatality and no hara kiri in contrast to other characters most likely because that was all they had in deadly alliance exclusive to unchained version is endurance mode where players can compete against a constant wave of opponents system s wireless ad hoc network functionality can be used for multiplayer games characters who remain hidden in other versions appear unlocked by default in unchained producer shaun explained that staff wanted to show players characters that were difficult to obtain in deception such as liu kang although midway did not
