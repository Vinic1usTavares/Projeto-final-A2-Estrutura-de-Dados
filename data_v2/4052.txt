progressive causes in which he believed after serving in union army in american civil war weaver returned to iowa and worked for election of republican candidates after several unsuccessful attempts at republican nominations to various offices and growing dissatisfied with conservative wing of party in 1877 weaver switched to greenback party which supported increasing money supply and regulating

successful and gained 8 5 percent of popular vote and won five states but still fell far short of victory populists merged with democrats by end of 19th century and weaver went with them promoting candidacy of william jennings bryan for president in 1896 1900 and 1908 after serving as mayor of his home town colfax iowa weaver retired from his pursuit of elective office he died in iowa in 1912 most of weaver s political goals remained unfulfilled at his death but many came to pass in following decades early years james baird weaver was born in dayton ohio on june 12 1833 fifth of thirteen children of abram weaver and susan imlay weaver weaver s father was a farmer also born in ohio and a descendant of revolutionary war veterans he married weaver s mother who was from new jersey in 1824

years later weaver interrupted his legal career to accompany another brother in law dr calvin phelps on a cattle drive overland from bloomfield to sacramento california weaver initially intended to stay and prospect for gold but instead booked passage on a ship for panama he crossed isthmus boarded another ship to new york and returned home to iowa upon his return weaver worked briefly as a store clerk before resuming study of law he enrolled at cincinnati law school in 1855 where he studied under bellamy storer while in cincinnati weaver began to question his support for institution of slavery a change biographers attribute to storer s influence after graduating in 1856 weaver returned to bloomfield and was admitted to iowa bar by 1857 he broke with democratic party of his father to join growing coalition that opposed expansion of slavery which became republican party weaver traveled around southern iowa in 1858 giving speeches on behalf of his new party s candidates that summer he married clara vinson a schoolteacher from nearby iowa whom he had courted since he returned from cincinnati marriage lasted until weaver s death in 1912 and couple had eight children after wedding weaver started a law firm with hosea horn and continued his involvement in republican politics he gave several speeches on behalf of samuel j kirkwood for governor in 1859 in a campaign that focused heavily on slavery debate although republicans lost weaver s davis county kirkwood narrowly won election next year weaver served as a delegate to state convention and although not a national delegate traveled with iowa delegation to 1860 republican national convention where abraham lincoln was nominated lincoln carried iowa and won election but southern states responded to republican victory by seceding from union by april 1861 american civil war had begun civil war left thumb lieutenant james b weaver after confederate attack on fort sumter lincoln called for 75 000 men to join union army weaver enlisted in what became company g of 2nd iowa volunteer infantry regiment and was elected company s first lieutenant 2nd iowa commanded by colonel samuel ryan curtis a former congressman was ordered to missouri in june 1861 to secure railroad lines in that border state weaver s unit spent that summer in northern missouri and did not see action in meantime clara gave birth to couple s second child and first son named james bellamy weaver after his father and bellamy storer weaver s first chance at action came in february 1862 when 2nd iowa joined brigadier general ulysses s grant s army outside confederate fort donelson in tennessee weaver s company was in thick of fight which he described as a holocaust to demon of battles and he took a minor wound in arm rebels surrendered next day most important union victory of war to date 2nd iowa next joined other units in area at pittsburg landing tennessee to mass for a major assault deeper into south confederate forces met them there in battle of shiloh weaver s regiment was in center of union lines in area later known as hornets nest and were forced to retreat amid fierce fighting next day union forces turned tide and forced rebels off field in what weaver called a perfect rout carnage at shiloh 20 000 killed and wounded was on a scale never before seen in american warfare and both sides learned that war would end neither quickly nor easily after shiloh weaver and 2nd iowa slowly advanced to corinth mississippi where he was promoted to major rebel forces attacked union armies there in second battle of corinth where weaver s courage in that union victory convinced his superiors to promote him to colonel after regiment s commanding officer was killed after corinth weaver s unit took up garrison duty in northern mississippi in summer of 1863 they were redeployed to tennessee alabama border again on occupation duty around pulaski tennessee they rejoined action at battle of resaca a part of atlanta campaign then continued with major general william tecumseh sherman s march through georgia to sea in 1864 weaver s enlistment ended in may 1864 and he returned to his family in iowa after war ended weaver received a promotion to brevet brigadier general backdated to march 13 1865 republican politics thumb left weaver s home built in 1867 in bloomfield soon after returning from war weaver became editor of a pro republican bloomfield newspaper weekly union guard at 1865 iowa republican state convention he placed second for nomination for lieutenant governor following year weaver was elected district attorney for second judicial district covering six counties in southern iowa in 1867 president andrew johnson appointed him assessor of internal revenue in first congressional district which extended across southeastern iowa job came with a 1500 salary plus a percentage of taxes collected over 100 000 weaver held that lucrative position until 1872 when congress abolished it he also became involved in methodist episcopal church serving as a delegate to a church convention in baltimore in 1876 membership in methodist church coincided with weaver s interest in growing movement for prohibition of sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages his income and prestige grew along with his family which included seven children by 1877 weaver s success allowed him to build a large new home for his family which still stands weaver s work for party led many to support his nomination to represent iowa s 6th congressional district in federal house of representatives in 1874 many party insiders however were wary of weaver s association with prohibition movement and preferred to remain uncommitted on divisive issue at convention weaver led on first ballot but ultimately lost nomination by one vote to ezekiel s sampson a local judge weaver s allies attributed his loss to meanest kind of wire pulling but weaver shrugged off defeat and aimed instead at gubernatorial nomination in 1875 he launched a vigorous effort courted delegates around state and explicitly endorsed prohibition and greater state control of railroad rates weaver attracted many delegates support but alienated those who were friendly to railroads and wished to avoid liquor issue opposition was scattered among several lesser known candidates mostly members of senator william b allison s conservative wing of party they united at convention when a delegate unexpectedly nominated former governor kirkwood nomination carried easily and after allison s associates persuaded him to accept it kirkwood was nominated and went on to win election in a further defeat delegates refused to endorse prohibition in party platform weaver had small consolation in a nomination to state senate but he lost to his democratic opponent in election that fall switch to greenback party thumb weaver as a candidate for congress 1878 after his defeats in 1875 weaver grew disenchanted with republican party not only because it had spurned him but also because of policy choices of dominant allison faction in may 1876 he traveled to indianapolis to attend national convention of newly formed greenback party new party had arisen mostly in west as a response to economic depression that followed panic of 1873 during civil war congress had authorized greenbacks a new form of fiat money that was redeemable not in gold but in government bonds greenbacks had helped to finance war when government s gold supply did not keep pace with expanding costs of maintaining armies when crisis had passed many in both parties especially in east wanted to place nation s currency on a gold standard as soon as possible specie payment resumption act passed in 1875 ordered that greenbacks be gradually withdrawn and replaced with gold backed currency beginning in 1879 at same time depression had made it more expensive for debtors to pay debts they had contracted when currency was less valuable beyond their support for a larger money supply greenbackers also favored an eight hour work day safety regulations in factories and an end to child labor as historian herbert clancy put it they anticipated by almost fifty years progressive legislation of first quarter of twentieth century in 1876 presidential campaign republicans nominated rutherford b hayes and democrats chose samuel j tilden both candidates opposed issuance of more greenbacks candidates who favored gold backed currency were called hard money supporters while greenbackers policy of encouraging inflation was known as soft money weaver was impressed with greenbackers and their candidate peter cooper but while he advocated some soft money policies he declined greenback nomination for congress and remained a republican he campaigned for hayes in election that year in 1877 weaver attended republican state convention and saw state party adopt a soft money platform that also favored prohibition gubernatorial nominee however was john h gear an opponent of prohibition who had worked to defeat weaver in his quest for governorship two years earlier after initially supporting gear weaver joined greenback party in august he gave speeches on behalf of his new party debated former allies across state and establishing himself as a prominent advocate for greenback cause congress thumb thomas nast depicts weaver as an ungainly donkey who is finally recognized by speaker samuel j randall in may 1878 weaver accepted greenback nomination for house of representatives in 6th district although weaver s political career up to then had been as a staunch republican democrats in 6th district thought that endorsing him was likely only way to defeat sampson incumbent republican since start of civil war democrats had been in minority across iowa electoral fusion with greenbackers represented their best chance to get their candidates into office hard money democrats objected to idea but some were reassured when henry h trimble a prominent bloomfield democrat assured them that if elected weaver would align with house democrats on all issues other than money question democrats declined to endorse any candidate at 6th district convention but soft money leaders in party circulated their own slate of candidates that included democrats and greenbackers greenback democrat ticket prevailed and weaver was elected with 16 366 votes to sampson s 14 307 weaver entered 46th congress in march 1879 one of thirteen greenbackers elected in 1878 although house was closely divided neither major party included greenbackers in their caucus leaving them few committee assignments and little input on legislation weaver gave his first speech in april 1879 criticizing use of army to police southern polling stations while also decrying violence against black southerners that made such protection necessary he then described greenback platform which he said would put an end to sectional and economic strife next month he spoke in favor of a bill calling for an increase in money supply by allowing unlimited coinage of silver but bill was easily defeated weaver s oratorical skill drew praise but he had no luck in advancing greenback policy ideas in 1880 weaver prepared a resolution stating that government not banks should issue currency and determine its volume and that federal debt should be repaid in whatever currency government chose not just gold as law then required proposed resolution would never be allowed to emerge from committees dominated by democrats and republicans so weaver planned to introduce it directly to whole house for debate as members were permitted to do every monday rather than debate a proposition that would expose monetary divide in democratic party speaker samuel j randall refused to recognize weaver when he rose to propose resolution weaver returned to floor each succeeding monday with same result and press took notice of randall s obstruction eventually republican james a garfield of ohio interceded with randall to recognize weaver which he reluctantly did on april 5 1880 republicans mostly united behind hard money largely voted against measure while many democrats joined greenbackers voting in favor despite support by soft money democrats resolution was defeated 84 117 with many members abstaining although he lost vote weaver had promoted monetary issue in national consciousness presidential election of 1880 thumb left an 1880 cartoon in frank leslie s illustrated newspaper ridicules greenback party as a collection of disparate radicals by 1879 greenback coalition had divided with faction most prominent in south and west led by marcus m brick pomeroy splitting from main party pomeroy s faction called union greenback labor party was more radical and emphasized its independence and suggested that eastern greenbackers were likely to sell out party at any time to democrats weaver remained with rump greenback party often called national greenback party and national reputation he had earned in congress made him one of party s leading presidential hopefuls union greenbackers held their convention first and nominated stephen d of new jersey for president and barzillai j chambers of texas for vice president but also sent a delegation to national greenback convention in chicago that june with an eye toward reuniting party two factions agreed to reunify and also to admit a delegation from socialist labor party thus united convention turned to nominations weaver led on first ballot and on second he secured a majority chambers won convention s vote for vice president in a departure from political traditions of day weaver himself campaigned making speeches across south in july and august as greenbackers had only ticket that included a southerner weaver and chambers hoped to make inroads in south as campaign progressed however weaver s message of racial inclusion drew violent protests in south as greenbackers faced same obstacles republicans did in face of increasing black disenfranchisement in autumn weaver campaigned in north but greenbackers lack of support was compounded by weaver s refusal to run a fusion ticket in states where democratic and greenbacker strength might have combined to outvote republicans weaver received 305 997 votes and no electoral votes compared to 4 446 158 for winner republican james a garfield and 4 444 260 for democrat winfield scott hancock party was strongest in west and south but in no state did weaver receive more than 12 percent of vote his best state was texas with 11 7 percent his nationwide total was just 3 percent that figure represented an improvement over greenback vote of 1876 but to weaver who expected twice as many votes as he received it was a disappointment office seeker and party promoter after election weaver returned to lame duck session of congress and proposed an unsuccessful constitutional amendment that would have provided for direct election of senators after his term expired in march he resumed his speaking tour promoting greenback party across nation he and edward h gillette another iowa greenback congressman bought iowa tribune in 1882 to help spread greenback message that same year weaver ran for his old 6th district seat in house against incumbent republican e cutts this time democrats and greenbackers ran separate candidates and weaver finished a distant second cutts died before taking office and republicans offered to let weaver run unopposed in special election if he rejoined their party he declined and john c cook a democrat won seat in 1883 weaver was greenback nominee for governor of iowa again democrats ran a separate candidate and incumbent republican buren r sherman was re elected with a plurality weaver was a delegate to 1884 greenback national convention in indianapolis and supported eventual nominee benjamin butler of massachusetts back in iowa weaver again ran for house this time with democrats support greenback fortunes declined nationally as butler received just over half as many votes for president as weaver had four years earlier weaver s house race bucked trend he defeated republican frank t campbell by just 67 votes return to congress unlike in his previous congressional term when weaver entered 49th united states congress he was only greenback member new president democrat grover cleveland was friendly to weaver and asked his advice on iowa patronage as it had been for years weaver s chief concern was with nation s money and finance and relationship between labor and capital in 1885 he proposed creation of a department of labor which he suggested would find a solution to disputes between labor and management labor tensions increased following year as knights of labor went on strike against jay gould s rail empire and a strike against mccormick harvesting machine company ended in bloody haymarket riot weaver believed nation s hard money policies were responsible for labor unrest calling it purely a question of money and nothing else and declaring if this congress will not protect labor it must protect itself he saw triumph of one plank of greenback platform when congress established interstate commerce commission to regulate railroads weaver thought bill should have given government more power including ability to set rates directly but he voted for final bill right thumb weaver supported white settlers right to homesteads in unassigned lands weaver also took up issue of white settlement in indian territory for several years white settlers had been claiming homesteads in unassigned lands in what is now oklahoma after civil war five civilized tribes had been forced to cede their unused western lands to federal government settlers known as boomers believed that federal ownership made lands open to settlement under homestead acts federal government disagreed as did cherokee nation which leased its neighboring cherokee outlet to kansas cattle ranchers and many easterners who believed boomers to be tools of railroad interests weaver saw issue as one between landless poor homesteaders and wealthy cattlemen and took side of former he introduced a bill in december 1885 to organize indian territory and neighboring neutral strip into a new oklahoma territory bill died in committee but weaver reintroduced it in february 1886 and gave a speech calling for indian reservations to be broken up into homesteads for individual natives and remaining land to be open to white settlement committee on territories again rejected weaver s bill but approved a compromise measure that opened unassigned lands cherokee outlet and neutral strip to settlement congress debated bill over several months while tribes announced their resistance to their lands becoming a territory according to an 1884 supreme court decision elk v wilkins native americans were not citizens and thus would have no voting rights in new territory when weaver returned to iowa to campaign for re election bill was still in limbo running again on a democratic greenback fusion ticket weaver was re elected to house in 1886 with a 618 vote majority in lame duck session of 1887 congress passed dawes act which allowed president to terminate tribal governments and broke up indian reservations into homesteads for individual natives although five civilized tribes were exempt from act spirit of law encouraged weaver and boomers to continue their own efforts to open western indian territory to white settlement weaver reintroduced his oklahoma bill in new congress following year but again it stalled in committee he returned to iowa for another re election campaign in september 1888 but greenback party had fallen apart replaced by a new left wing third party union labor party in iowa s 6th district new party agreed to fuse with democrats to nominate weaver but this time republicans were stronger their candidate john f lacey was elected with an 828 vote margin union laborites and their presidential candidate streeter fared poorly nationally as well and new party soon dissolved weaver returned to congress for lame duck session and once more pushed to organize oklahoma territory this time he prevailed as house voted 147 102 to open unassigned lands to homesteaders senate followed suit and president cleveland who was about to leave office signed bill into law farmers alliance and a new party thumb weaver in 1892 new president republican benjamin harrison set april 22 1889 as date when rush for unassigned lands would begin weaver arrived at a railroad station in territory in march with an eye toward relocating there would be homesteaders welcomed him with great acclaim although settlers were not allowed to stake claims before noon on april 22 many scouted out land ahead of time and even marked off informal claims weaver was among them after rush settlers who had waited challenged claims of sooners who had entered early weaver s identification with group harmed his popularity in territory his claim was ultimately denied and he returned to iowa in 1890 weaver and his wife moved their household in 1890 from bloomfield to colfax near des moines as former congressman took up more active management of iowa tribune greenback and union labor parties were defunct but he still proselytized for their ideals in august 1890 weaver addressed a convention in des moines where former greenbackers and laborites gathered although he declined their nomination for congress economic conditions that had created greenback party had not gone away many farmers and laborers believed their situation had gotten worse since long depression began in 1873 many farmers had joined farmers alliance which sought to promote soft money ideas on a non partisan basis rather than create a third party they endorsed major party candidates who supported their ideas and hired speakers to educate public alliance backed candidates did well in 1890 elections especially in south where democrats endorsed by alliance won 44 seats alliance members gathered that december in ocala florida and formulated a platform later called ocala demands that called for looser money government control of railroads a graduated income tax and direct election of senators weaver endorsed message in tribune and corresponded with group s leader leonidas l polk weaver attended group s convention in cincinnati in may 1891 where he and polk argued against forming a third party another delegate ignatius l donnelly argued forcefully for a break from two major parties and his argument carried day although weaver and polk kept many of donnelly s more radical proposals out of convention s statement of principles presidential election of 1892 thumb right 1892 people s party campaign poster following year weaver accepted decision to form a new party called people s party or populist party and published a book a call to action detailing party s principles and castigating few haughty millionaires who are gathering up riches of new world he attended their convention in omaha nebraska in july 1892 after polk s sudden death in june weaver was considered front runner for nomination he was nominated on first ballot easily besting his closest rival senator james h kyle of south dakota weaver accepted nomination and promised to visit every state in union and carry banner of people into enemy s camp vice presidential nomination went to james g field a confederate veteran and former attorney general of virginia platform adopted in omaha was ambitious for its time calling for a graduated income tax public ownership of railroads telegraph and telephone systems government issued currency and unlimited coinage of silver idea that united states would buy as much silver as miners could sell government and strike it into coins at a favorable 16 to 1 ratio with gold republicans nominated harrison for re election and democrats put forward ex president cleveland as in 1880 weaver was confident of a good showing for new party against their opponents harrison had shown some favor to free silver cause but his party largely supported hard money gold standard cleveland was solidly for gold but his running mate adlai stevenson of illinois was a silverite against these populist party stood alone as undisputed partisans of soft money which weaver hoped would lead to success in rural areas further as labor disturbances broke out in homestead pennsylvania and elsewhere weaver hoped urban laborers would rally to populist cause weaver embarked on a speaking tour across northern plains and pacific coast states in late august he turned south hoping to break democrats grip on those states as in 1880 issue of race hurt weaver among white southern voters as he sought to attract black voters by urging cooperation between white and black farmers and calling for an end to lynchings weaver drew good crowds in south but he and his wife were also subjected to abuse from hecklers southern democrats depicted weaver as a threat to conservative democrats in power there with increasing disenfranchisement of black voters this was to prove fatal to populists hopes in south on election day cleveland triumphed carrying entire south and many northern states weaver s performance was better than that of any third party candidate since civil war as he won over a million votes 8 5 percent of total cast nationwide in four states he won a plurality giving populists electoral votes of colorado idaho kansas and nevada along with two more votes from north dakota and oregon twenty two in total weaver believed performance a surprising success and thought it portended good results in future elections unaided by money he said afterward our grand young party has made an enviable record and achieved a surprising success at polls populist elder statesman weaver believed that populists embrace of free silver would be main issue to attract new members to party after election he attended a meeting of american bimetallic league a pro silver group and gave speeches advocating an monetary policy in meantime panic of 1893 caused bank failures factory closures and general economic upheaval as federal gold reserves dwindled president cleveland convinced congress to repeal sherman silver purchase act which ensured government would purchase less silver for coining and which further disconcerted free silver supporters while depletion of gold reserves slowed after repeal country s economy still floundered thumb upright left weaver supported democrat william jennings bryan for president in 1896 next year 1894 saw pay cuts and labor disturbances including a massive strike by workers at pullman company a group of unemployed workers known as s army marched on washington that spring weaver met with them in iowa and expressed sympathy with movement so long as they refrained from lawbreaking he then returned to campaign trail stumping for populist candidates in 1894 midterm elections election proved disastrous for democrats but most of gains went to republicans rather than to populists who gained a few seats in south but lost ground in west during election weaver became friendly with william jennings bryan a democratic congressman from nebraska and a charismatic supporter of free silver bryan had lost his bid for senate in election but his reputation as an exciting speaker made him a presidential possibility in 1896 weaver privately supported bryan s quest for democratic nomination in 1896 which their convention awarded him on fifth ballot when populist convention gathered next month in chicago they divided between endorsing silverite democrat and preserving their new party s independence weaver backed former course holding issues party stood for to be of more importance than party itself a majority of delegates agreed but without enthusiasm that had marked their convention of four years earlier at same time weaver joined with anti fusionists to keep populist platform from deviating from party s ideological principles against fusion candidate stood republican william mckinley of ohio a hard money conservative bryan succeeded in uniting south and west weaver s longtime dream but with more populous north solidly behind mckinley bryan lost election despite loss weaver still believed populist cause would triumph he agreed to be nominated one last time for his old 6th district house seat on a democratic populist fusion ticket as he had ten years earlier republican john lacey defeated weaver in 1900 weaver attended a convention of fusionist populists in sioux falls south dakota party having split on issue of cooperation with democrats fusionists backed bryan democratic nominee but he lost again to mckinley this time by a greater margin following year weaver was elected to office for last time as mayor of his hometown colfax iowa later years death and legacy thumb upright james and clara weaver in 1908 republican party s popularity after victory in spanish american war led weaver for first time to doubt that populist values would eventually prevail with demise of populist party weaver became a democrat and was a delegate to 1904 democratic national convention he was displeased at party s nominee alton b parker whom he thought but weaver supported his unsuccessful campaign nevertheless he gave serious consideration to running for house again that year but decided against it in 1908 he supported bryan s third campaign as democratic nominee for president but it too was unsuccessful that same year weaver and his wife clara celebrated their fiftieth wedding anniversary surrounded by six of their children iowa legislature honored him in 1909 and hung a portrait of him in iowa state historical building he wrote a history of jasper county iowa where he lived which was published in 1912 weaver planned to campaign on behalf of democratic candidates that year but did not have chance on february 6 while visiting his daughter in des moines he died after a funeral at first methodist church in des moines weaver was buried in that city s woodland cemetery many of iowa s leading statesmen including weaver s former adversaries praised him at his funeral and in years thereafter fusion with democrats had brought populist policy into mainstream and several of policies for which weaver fought became law after his death including direct election of senators a graduated income tax and a monetary policy not based on gold standard others such as public ownership of railroads and telephone companies were never enacted in a 2008 biography robert b mitchell wrote that weaver s legacy cannot be assessed using conventional measures as much of what he fought for did not come to pass until after his death even so mitchell credits weaver for beginning political effort that led to those changes weaver s most important legacy in national politics is not what he advocated or how subsequent reforms worked but his effect on america s continuing political conversation notes references sources books articles
