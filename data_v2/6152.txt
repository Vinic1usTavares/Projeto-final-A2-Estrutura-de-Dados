revocation was legal franklin county circuit court upheld chandler s call and invalidated laffoon s revocation and kentucky court of appeals then court of last resort in state upheld this decision by a 4 3 majority gipson pp 141 146 on february 13 kentucky house achieved a quorum and senate did so following day gipson p 148 having lost battle against special session laffoon proposed a primary with a run off if no candidate received a majority on first ballot some including chandler believed this action was aimed against former governor and senator j c w beckham who laffoon believed would challenge rhea for democratic nomination they believed that a double primary would be too much for aging beckham to endure klotter p 304 supporters of a single primary found they did not have votes in
