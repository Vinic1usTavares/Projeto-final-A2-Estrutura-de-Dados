monaco at game developers conference in 2010 idea for monaco was first prototyped when andy schatz was working for tko software a video game development company based in santa cruz california game was inspired by top down mini map used in hitman series that schatz described as being similar to jason rohrer s 2014 video game castle doctrine during monacos early stages of development his original plan was to develop and release monaco as an xbox live indie games title he described it as sims meets diablo meets hitman development at tko was done in three weeks while company solicited paid work schatz later left tko and founded his own independent company pocketwatch games after pocketwatch games experimented with simulation games such as with 2006 independent games festival finalist wildlife tycoon venture africa schatz developed an early version of monaco using microsoft xna to see if it worked on xbox 360 after fifteen weeks of development this won igf award for excellence in design shortly later valve approached schatz and offered to publish game on steam distribution platform thumb left andy schatz holding award for excellence in design andy schatz accepting award at 2010 independent games festival for excellence in design after fifteen weeks of development when andy schatz pitched game to microsoft game studios it was turned down schatz responded saying they were crazy and asked if he could game to which microsoft agreed he worked on it for another year to make it more marketable before it microsoft again rejected game after these events schatz thought game would not be released on xbox 360 disappointing him he felt platform and its marketplace were easy to work with and that it would have made an ideal platform for game schatz considered releasing game on playstation 3 but did not empty clip studios was hired to port game to engine so it could be released on playstation 3 but port was never finished to publish game on xbox live schatz partnered with video game publishing company majesco entertainment schatz met andy nguyen while looking for playtesters in 2011 he described nguyen as a man he clicked with who made an energizing work environment schatz hired nguyen to work in festival booths and to sell company s merchandise at events nguyen did not know how to program but eventually became a level designer and producer for monaco leaving his job at citibank to devote more time to game and to pocketwatch games soundtrack for monaco was composed by grammy nominated austin wintory who had previously composed scores for flow and journey original soundtrack and a remixed album called gentleman s private collection were released on april 24 2013 soundtrack incorporates pianos and drums into what christian donlan of eurogamer said was one of wintory s best works yet schatz originally used licensed music but asked wintory to replace some of it with original pieces wintory later persuaded schatz that a complete original soundtrack was warranted wintory was excited by request because it involved using humorous old timey piano saying when else am i ever going to be asked to write anything remotely like this gentleman s private collection contains remixes of original soundtrack by other composers including peter hollens tina guo who played violin in journey soundtrack and who composed soundtrack for super hexagon full soundtrack and gentleman s private collection were released onto wintory s microsite on bandcamp monaco was released for microsoft windows on april 24 2013 xbox 360 version was delayed until may 10 that year mac and linux versions were released on july 3 and october 21 2013 respectively since official release pocketwatch games has updated game to include more levels and mini games including two campaign entries titled origins and fin final chapter was released to allow developers room to focus on tooth and tail reception monaco was positively received by critics garnering generally favorable reviews for both desktop and xbox 360 releases despite praise xbox 360 release sold poorly and andy schatz believed this was because of weak demonstration version delayed release and bugs in multiplayer mode cooperative mode one of main selling points of game was lauded by reviewers marty sliva ign regarded it as being one of best co op experiences he had in a while stating that gameplay mechanics made it one of most unique and addictive games released in 2013 this sentiment was echoed by jeff grubb venturebeat who complimented game s ability to be both an arcade and a strategic game and james gamefront along with aaron riccio slant magazine and edge staff commended replayability riccio described it as a well oiled four player game as well as going on to compliment plot progression despite almost universal praise for cooperative mode reviewers did not express same admiration for single player mode grubb said game should be skipped if there were no plans on playing it cooperatively scott nichols digital spy agreed and remarked that while game contained lots of content to discover it is best done cooperatively danielle riendeau polygon considered single player mode unfinished and said it needed work roger hargreaves metro differed from many other reviewers and said that despite their preference for cooperative modes he called single player surprisingly compelling david sanchez gamezone called game bold and like hargreaves enjoyed both some reviewers criticised repetitiveness of levels francesco eurogamer italy criticised variation and complained it was not long until he saw similar levels because of game s simplicity while saying they were usually well made he opined that they were often made for certain characters which adds more gameplay because of time it takes to discover best strategies alex navarro giant bomb proposed a similar viewpoint stating some of later levels turned into tedious exercises in trial and error conversely anton bjurvald eurogamer sweden said he fell in love with simplicity of graphics however he took issue with artificial intelligence critiquing them as being too easy to fool reviewers compared monaco to other games and films most common of which was 1960 heist film ocean s 11 viewed in relation to monaco by nichols for its ensemble cast daring break ins and carefully laid plans bjurvald also made this connection hargreaves agreed additionally noting its similarity to metal gear solid and linking its mazelike levels to those of pac man monaco sold enough copies for andy schatz to have no complaints by march 2014 game had sold over 750 000 copies and by that september it had sold over a million awards in early 2010 fifteen weeks into development of monaco game won seumas mcnally grand
