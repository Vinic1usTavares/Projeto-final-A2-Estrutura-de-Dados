grima divine dragon naga voiced by mela lee chose ruler of halidom of ylisse known as first exalt and granted them power through two magical objects falchion a sword with power to slay dragons and fire emblem a magical shield using these exalt struck down grima sending it into a long slumber in intervening period continents of archanea and valentia became known as ylisse and valm by present time land of ylisse is divided between halidom of ylisse which continues to worship naga and is ruled by exalt emmeryn voiced by erin fitzgerald and defended by shepherds her brother chrom s voiced by matthew mercer militia force kingdom of plegia which worships grima and regna ferox a country whose rulers periodically compete for dominance fifteen years prior to awakening last exalt of ylisse emmeryn s father waged a religious war against plegia which greatly damaged both countries and left bitterness on both sides ylisse has slowly recovered from war thanks to emmeryn s peaceful actions plot after dreaming of killing chrom amnesiac avatar wakes up in a field and is found by chrom and members of his personal army shepherds avatar joins shepherds after exhibiting qualities of a tactician when they defend a nearby town from plegian bandits after gaining an alliance with regna ferox shepherds move to fight both plegia s forces and revenant monsters called risen they are helped by a masked man calling himself marth after a confrontation between plegia and shepherds emmeryn is almost killed by validar and his minions assassination plot is foiled with aid from marth who has prior knowledge of event and is also revealed to be a woman soon after plegian forces capture emmeryn as she goes to parley with king gangrel plegia s ruler and prevent another war gangrel demands fire emblem in exchange for emmeryn s life though chrom almost accepts gangrel s terms emmeryn stops him by throwing herself over a cliff becoming a martyr to both ylisse and plegia eventually

chrom leads shepherds again when emperor of valm threatens to invade ylisse during campaign marth returns and reveals that she is a lucina from an alternate timeline from more than 10 years in future where grima has been resurrected and used a time traveling spell devised by naga to return to past in order to prevent events leading to her future to combat grima chrom must perform awakening a ritual that grants him naga s power by combining fire emblem with five magical gems divided among nations during and after war in valm shepherds manage to retrieve four of gemstones they are then ambushed by validar new king of plegia and avatar s father after he offers them last gemstone validar takes control of avatar and steals fire emblem from chrom he also reveals that avatar was born as ideal vessel for grima lucina realizes that grima used avatar to kill chrom in her timeline and attempts to execute them chrom forces her to stand down remaining confident avatar can overcome grima s control alternatively if avatar is lucina s husband or mother lucina is unable to go through with it and stands down on her own shepherds manage to track down validar who uses avatar to attack chrom mirroring events of their nightmare however avatar uses their foreknowledge to prevent chrom s death allowing shepherds to kill validar and recover fire emblem at this point possessed avatar from lucina s future appears revealing that present timeline avatar s amnesia was caused by grima s unsuccessful attempt to possess them future avatar then uses power gathered for grima s resurrection to restore its dragon form in a race against time chrom performs awakening and summons naga although chrom now has power to stop grima naga reveals that she only has enough power to put grima to sleep for another thousand years naga explains that only way to truly destroy grima is to have him destroy himself through avatar which could come at cost of avatar s life naga tells them that avatar will only survive if their bonds with chrom and shepherds are strong enough in final battle shepherds manage to weaken grima chrom already set against sacrifice of avatar offers to deliver final blow to fell dragon depending on player s final choice game will reach one of two different endings if player lets chrom deal final blow grima is put back to sleep for another thousand years though avatar is left with regrets if player stops chrom from dealing final blow avatar will kill grima causing both to vanish chrom and shepherds refuse to believe that avatar is dead and vow to find them and bring them home in a post credits scene avatar wakes up in a field similar to beginning of game where chrom and lissa find them and welcome them home development original planning for fire emblem awakening began in 2010 when nintendo spd director genki yokota was finishing his work on xenoblade chronicles game was co developed by nintendo and regular fire emblem developer intelligent systems among staff members were veterans of fire emblem series including project manager masahiro higuchi who had first worked on fire emblem genealogy of holy war and intelligent systems producer kouhei maeda who first worked as a scenario writer for fire emblem binding blade first proposals were made after completion of fire emblem new mystery of emblem a remake for nintendo ds of third game development was very slow for first year during which time producer hitoshi yamagami organized game s development structure once this was completed he handed main production duties over to co director genki yokota art director was toshiyuki kusakihara character designs were done by kusakihara and yusuke kozaki kusakihara was brought on board to offer a fresh perspective on fire emblem series and new ideas for team while kozaki was brought in to help create a distinctive art style that would be well received overseas as had his previous work for wii title no more heroes during development kusakihara and kozaki had lengthy meetings about various aspects of game these meetings became so time consuming that kusakihara compared his situation to legend of taro due to declining sales for series developers were told by nintendo that awakening would be last fire emblem game if it failed to sell above 250 000 units this caused panic for team with them considering including a high number of elements new to game among concepts were a modern day setting or using planet mars as a setting eventually team decided that these elements would alienate rather than attract players and stuck to medieval setting and style of previous fire emblem titles as a compromise team decided to make it culmination of all games in fire emblem series to that point incorporating gameplay elements from multiple titles this approach was approved by team and proposal was completed within a month though decision also created difficulties with choosing which elements to include and how to balance them so they did not clash with one another game s final title awakening was born from this concept of an ultimate fire emblem game it was initially just casually suggested by yamagami when discussing ideas for a title with yokota and yokota liked it as development progressed team continued to come up with ideas that increased workload but they maintained a positive attitude and pushed forward in spite of consequent pressures internally game was known as fire emblem fin children from brink maeda was mainly responsible for original scenario thinking out rough outline before team created events of each chapter in detail some plot points such as true identity of marth were planned from an early stage while many of other plot twists came about during its development many of them were added at suggestion of team members from both intelligent systems and nintendo two key story themes while developing game were love for characters and bonds characters developed over course of story latter theme was expressed in gameplay through cooperative behavior of adjacent characters while voice acting was included it was limited to snappy lines meant to evoke a certain feeling this was because team had concerns about amount of content in game which would increase a great deal with full voice acting and its effect on pacing team also used multiple well known japanese voice actors for characters special voice overs and visuals were created for character confession sequences all main characters had a personalized back story and appropriate personalities were chosen for them first one to be finalized was child character inigo who was created by character planner nami a large team of writers were employed to create character dialogue and a story bible containing characters personality traits was created for writers to work from while developing playable and enemy characters team used feedback from fans saying they should name all characters including foot soldiers wanting to give impression of every character having their own lives they created full artwork for all characters creating characters proved to be one of hardest parts of development while designing characters kozaki took their backstories into account for example thief character gaius was drawn with a sack of sweets as he had a love for them kozaki was also responsible for creating 2d artwork which represented characters during conversations design thumb game s optional first person perspective during battle one of several features new to fire emblem series was included to increase player freedom and show off platform s 3d effects once nintendo gave go ahead for development intelligent systems formed a small internal development team to handle project awakening was first fire emblem game for nintendo 3ds platform was as yet unreleased and still undergoing final development because of this team had a large number of ideas for features to include but they also only had a limited idea of what system was capable of consequently they had difficulties deciding how 2d sprites and 3d environments would interact with each other and ensuring they did not clip through objects one notable feature missing from in game character models was their feet original idea was to add a unique and uniform deformation to characters as team did not have much knowledge of platform s cpu strength number of character bones they could include were intentionally limited this meant that bones needed for operation of ankles and feet were omitted later it was discovered that ankles and feet could be included but team decided to leave that for a future game if it came to pass a different explanation was that team wanted players to focus on top half of characters so made their heads largest part of their character models while shrinking their feet concept for character graphics on map underwent changes initially some of team felt that accurately displaying a character s equipment and class would be enough but later it was decided to give them all individual characteristics they were also able to add more unique character expressions than previous fire emblem games enabling a greater emotional range during scenes of drama a different element was environmental effects team incorporated such as dust clouds when characters performed actions in battle for full motion cutscenes team wanted to create a sense of grandeur and spectacle using openings of taiga drama series as inspiration japanese animation company kamikaze douga was in charge of supervising production and art assets of game s cutscenes cutscene animation was handled by studio anima according to team members their request to studio anima was to make world come alive during full motion sequences which were included at crucial moments in plot first part of game to receive full attention from team was gameplay as a test map team used opening map for mystery of emblem one of early options was switching between 16x16 and pixel characters depending on camera s overhead distance in end team used a hardware based scaling system instead of switching between graphics types so as to keep frame rate consistent in battle while designing levels team created both maps with a plot driven structure and maps that allowed for player freedom an aspect of battle system new to series was inclusion of an optional first person viewpoint during battles this was done with western players in mind as developers wanted to both give players an option on their perspective in battle and demonstrate platform s 3d effects difficulty levels proved a point of debate amongst team ranging from naming of difficulties to whether to include ability to adjust it on fly which some felt was contrary to fire emblem traditions there was also debate about both inclusion and mechanics of marriage system while some aspects went smoothly there was contention about ability to marry any of characters and kusakihara s suggestion of having characters kissing at conclusion of each romance was vetoed by team an effort was made to make interface and graphics easy for players to understand an example of this was cursor which in previous games had been a triangular shape and for awakening was changed to a pointing hand one of more controversial ideas that made it into final game was casual mode first introduced in new mystery of emblem initially opposed by staff members at nintendo and intelligent systems yamagami and others successfully defended feature yamagami s stance was that modern gamers would not be pleased with needing to invest extra time because a character had died in another interview team members said that awakening was first time team conformed to popular image of nintendo games being easy to play and user friendly release game was first announced in september 2011 as part of nintendo s 2012 lineup for 3ds alongside titles such as monster hunter 4 and bravely default as part of its release nintendo created a limited edition nintendo 3ds bundle with awakening pre installed game s localization and western release was planned from an early stage hence inclusion of multiple aesthetic and gameplay elements meant to appeal to a western audience localization process was handled collaboratively by independent video game localization company 8 4 and nintendo of america localization process took

nintendo was fairly non committal on incident they did state that due to in shipping retailers could received stocks on different days downloadable content fire emblem awakening was first packaged title released by nintendo to receive downloadable content dlc after launch taking form of additional maps and characters from previous entries in fire emblem series idea for dlc content came up when game was close to completion due to this team could not do anything that would invalidate main story for additional playable characters team focused on main cast picked out most suitable and left
