in rhine campaign of 1796 june 1796 to february 1797 two first coalition armies under overall command of archduke charles outmaneuvered and defeated two french republican armies this was last campaign of war of first coalition part of french revolutionary wars french military strategy against austria called for a three pronged invasion to surround vienna ideally capturing city and forcing holy roman emperor to surrender and accept french revolutionary territorial integrity french assembled army of sambre and meuse commanded by jean baptiste jourdan against austrian army of lower rhine in north army of rhine and moselle led by jean victor marie moreau opposed austrian army of upper rhine in south a third army army of italy commanded by napoleon bonaparte approached vienna through northern italy early success of army of italy initially forced coalition commander archduke charles to transfer 25 000 men commanded by dagobert sigmund von wurmser to northern italy this weakened coalition force along front stretching along rhine from basel to north sea later a feint by jourdan s army of sambre and meuse convinced charles to shift troops to north allowing moreau to cross rhine at battle of kehl on 24 june and defeated archduke s imperial contingents both french armies penetrated deep into eastern and southern germany by late july forcing southern states of holy roman empire into punitive armistices by august french armies had extended their fronts too thinly and rivalry among french generals complicated cooperation between two armies because two french armies operated independently charles was able to leave maximilian anton karl count baillet de latour with a weaker army in front of moreau on southernmost flank and move many reinforcements to army of wilhelm von wartensleben in north at battle of amberg on 24 august and battle of wurzburg on 3 september charles defeated jourdan s northern army and compelled french army to retreat eventually to west bank of rhine with jourdan neutralized and retreating into france charles left franz von werneck to watch army of sambre and meuse making sure it did not try to recover a foothold on east bank of rhine after securing rhine crossings at bruchsal and kehl charles forced moreau to retreat south during winter austrians reduced french bridgeheads in sieges of kehl and huningen and forced moreau s army back to france despite charles success in rhineland austria lost war in italy which resulted in peace of campo formio background rulers of europe initially viewed french revolution as an internal dispute
