sir harrie stewart wilson massey 16 may 1908 27 november 1983 was an australian mathematical physicist who worked primarily in fields of atomic and atmospheric physics a graduate of university of melbourne and cambridge university where he earned his doctorate at cavendish laboratory massey became an independent lecturer in mathematical physics at queen s university of belfast in 1933 he was appointed goldsmid professor of applied mathematics at university college london in 1938 during second world war massey worked at admiralty research laboratory where he helped devise countermeasures for german magnetic naval mines and at admiralty mining establishment in havant where he helped develop british naval mines in 1943 mark oliphant persuaded admiralty to release massey to work on manhattan project he joined oliphant s british mission at radiation laboratory at university of california where they worked on electromagnetic isotope separation process when oliphant returned to britain in 1945 massey took over berkeley mission massey returned to university college london in october 1945 to find it badly damaged by bombing and mathematics department in dingy temporary accommodation in 1950 he was appointed quain professor of physics and head of university college london physics department department was merged with astronomy in 1973 but he remained its head until he retired in 1975 under his direction physics department was reoriented towards particle physics and upper atmosphere physics he worked with woomera rocket range to develop british skylark rocket and was on governing board of anglo australian telescope he was chairman of committee on space research cospar from 1959 to 1978 and of its british national chapter he was also first chairman of european space sciences committee and helped found european space research organization and mullard space science laboratory at university college london early life harrie stewart wilson massey was born in victoria australia on 16 may 1908 only child of harrie stewart massey a miner and his wife eleanor elizabeth nee wilson he grew up in rural community of hoddles creek and enrolled in local state school in 1913 he received his merit certificate normally awarded after completing eighth grade when he was nine but due to his age he still had to stay there for another three years he won a scholarship to university high school and moved to parkville with his mother in 1920 at university high school he was president of science club and vice captain of cricket team career at age of 16 massey won a scholarship to university of melbourne which he entered in 1925 he had thoughts of studying chemistry but was impressed by physics lectures given by eric this was a stroke of luck first year physics lectures were normally given by thomas laby massey recalled in 1980 that in a fairly wide experience i would rate laby worst lecturer i have heard at university he played cricket billiards tennis and baseball which he played for university he was awarded his bachelor of arts bsc in physics with first class honours in 1928 and a bachelor of arts ba in mathematics in 1929 at a meeting of australasian association for advancement of science in perth in august 1925 he met a schoolteacher jessica elizabeth bruce they were married on 11 january 1928 at district registrar s office in perth they had a daughter pamela lois at that time university did not offer a doctor of philosophy phd program so massey undertook a master of science msc course with both experimental and theoretical components former in cooperation with courtney mohr dealt with soft x ray deflection from metal surfaces latter with wave mechanics this involved translating numerous articles from german journals such as zeitschrift fur physik annalen der physik and physikalische zeitschrift his external examiner was ralph fowler from university of cambridge who was paul dirac s phd supervisor thumb left queen s university belfast in 1929 with benefit of an aitchison travelling scholarship from university of melbourne massey went to trinity college cambridge to perform research at cavendish laboratory led by ernest rutherford scholarship expired after two years but he was awarded an 1851 exhibition scholarship in 1931 at this time cavendish laboratory was one of leading centres of physics in world in 1932 cavendish laboratory scientists john cockcroft and ernest walton split atomic nucleus james chadwick discovered neutron and patrick blackett and giuseppe confirmed existence of positron fowler was appointed as massey s supervisor although it was clear that he did not need any supervision per se massey obtained his phd on collisions of material particles in 1932 shortly afterwards he co authored a book on atomic collision processes with nevill mott theory of atomic collisions 1933 he also applied theory of collisions to models of neutron structure at cavendish laboratory he also played hockey with cockcroft and cricket for cavendish cricket club becoming team captain in his final year there in june 1933 massey became an independent lecturer in mathematical physics at queen s university of belfast he was only member of department until r a buckingham arrived in 1934 despite having to give nine lectures a week he found time to write his second book negative ions 1938 and began working on upper atmospheric physics frustrated with tiresome and time consuming process of calculation he had his physics workshop superintendent john wylie build him a small scale differential analyzer an analog computer that could solve differential equations for just ps50 this was used to solve problems related to low temperature helium and photo ionisation of oxygen in upper atmosphere massey was appointed goldsmid professor of applied mathematics at university college london in 1938 following death of l n g previous year he brought with him buckingham now an 1851 exhibition scholar himself and david bates a promising graduate student they brought differential analyser with them to london where it was destroyed by an air raid during second world war second world war thumb right upright a german magnetic mine soon after outbreak of war in september 1939 germans began a naval mine campaign against britain results were devastating nineteen ships totaling 59 027 tons were sunk by mines in october and 27 totaling 120 958 tons in november along with destroyer many more ships were damaged including cruiser nature of mines was initially unknown but on 23 november 1939 a bomb disposal team under lieutenant commander j g d recovered an intact aerial mine from a mudflat at shoeburyness and threat was revealed to be a magnetic mine in december 1939 massey joined a group at admiralty research laboratory in teddington led by stephen butterworth they were soon joined by a number of other physicists including bates buckingham francis crick and john gunn together they came up with a series of countermeasures that enable navy to successfully sweep mines with this in hand massey became deputy chief scientist to scientific section of mine design department at admiralty mining establishment in havant in early 1941 this time job was to create mines as good as german ones massey brought his team with him while bates worked on packaging to protect mine when it was dropped from an aircraft buckingham and gunn calculated its theoretical effectiveness and crick designed circuitry their mine codenamed mx was soon in service and group turned its attention to developing acoustic or pressure mines on retirement of a b wood in 1943 massey became chief scientist at havant after august 1943 quebec agreement merged british and american atomic bomb projects mark oliphant persuaded admiralty to release massey to work on manhattan project in november 1943 massey set out with oliphant for radiation laboratory at university of california in berkeley in a b 24 liberator bomber radiation laboratory s part was to develop an electromagnetic isotope separation process massey was in charge of its theoretical group which included american david bohm and australian eric burhop they studied characteristics of electric discharges in magnetic fields today known as bohm diffusion and studied ionization of uranium compounds used as feed in electromagnetic uranium enrichment process such as uranium tetrachloride and uranium hexafluoride oliphant returned to britain in march 1945 and was replaced as head of british mission in berkeley by massey wartime papers produced by group were collected and published in characteristics of electrical discharges in magnetic fields 1949 later life massey returned to university college london in october 1945 to find it badly damaged by bombing and mathematics department in dingy temporary accommodation he was allowed to pick his own lecturers so he chose bats burhop buckingham and gunn while they had to teach mathematics they were free to choose their own research topics so they chose to research physics carrying out physical experiments this situation lasted until 1950 when edward andrade retired and massey was appointed quain professor of physics and head of university college london physics department department was merged with astronomy in 1973 but he remained its head until he retired in 1975 he also served as university college london s vice provost from 1969 to 1973 thumb left 40 telescope dome at siding spring observatory new south wales when massey took over physics department most of his physicists including bates buckingham burhop and robert boyd moved with him like mathematics department it was still in temporary accommodation owing to bomb damage during war a new building was under construction but to develop technical infrastructure massey hired harry tomlinson who had worked for him in british mission in berkeley department acquired several accelerators including a 20 mev synchrotron from atomic energy authority dick jennings and franz heymann built two under massey physics department moved away from researching physics of metals and liquids and focused on particle physics and upper atmosphere physics massey saw potential of computers he arranged with andrew booth for a copy of his all purpose electronic computer and recruited two programmers joan lawson and jane wallace when university of london established a computing unit buckingham left to head it elected a fellow of royal society of london in 1940 massey was awarded its hughes medal in 1955 and its royal medal in 1958 he was a member of its council from 1949 to 1951 and again from 1959 to 1960 before serving as its physical secretary and vice president from 1969 to 1978 he became a member of department of scientific and industrial research s nuclear physics sub committee in 1956 when national institute for research in nuclear science was founded in 1957 he became one of initial members of its governing board he became a member of research grants committee in 1959 and was chairman of council for scientific policy from 1965 to 1970 he was knighted for his services in 1960 thumb right upright a black arrow launch vehicle in rocket park at woomera south australia similar to one that launched only satellite launched with a british launcher rockets had seen enormous development for military purposes during second world war and massey saw their potential for studying upper atmosphere he became a major supporter of space science and wrote a book on subject history of british space science 1984 he was chairman of committee on space research cospar which was established by international council of scientific unions from its founding in 1959 until 1978 and also of british national committee for space research its british national chapter he was also first chairman of european space sciences committee and helped found european space research organization and mullard space science laboratory at university college london space science also gave massey an excuse to visit australia he made some twenty trips he was involved in testing of balloons for upper atmosphere research at university of melbourne s site in mildura victoria as chairman of rocket subcommittee of royal society s committee he visited weapons research establishment near adelaide and woomera rocket range to discuss collaboration on british skylark rocket which was test fired from woomera in 1957 he sought to develop a uk space program in cooperation in space with australia united states and european countries he was successful in building international cooperation although his black knight project was cancelled in favour of black arrow which launched prospero only satellite launched with a british launch vehicle from woomera in 1971 he was involved in negotiations leading to establishment of anglo australian telescope at siding spring mountain in new south wales massey received an honorary doctorate from heriot watt university in 1975 he was a united kingdom member and deputy chairman its governing board from 1975 to 1980 and chairman from 1980 to 1983 death and legacy after a long illness massey died at his home in esher surrey which jessica had named from australian aboriginal word for area in western australia where she had once lived on 27 november 1983 he was survived by his wife and daughter royal society cospar massey award is named after him as is harrie massey lecture theatre and harrie massey prize at university college london and harrie massey
