george mason iv october 7 1792 was an american planter politician and delegate to u s constitutional convention of 1787 one of three delegates who refused to sign constitution his writings including substantial portions of fairfax resolves of 1774 virginia declaration of rights of 1776 and his objections to this constitution of government 1787 opposing ratification have exercised a significant influence on american political thought and events virginia declaration of rights which mason principally authored served as a basis for united states bill of rights of which he has been deemed father mason was born in 1725 most likely in what is now fairfax county virginia his father died when he was young and his mother managed family estates until he came of age he married in 1750 built gunston hall and lived life of a country squire supervising his lands family and slaves he briefly served in house of burgesses and involved himself in community affairs sometimes serving with his neighbor george washington as tensions grew between britain and american colonies mason came to support colonial side using his knowledge and experience to help revolutionary cause finding ways to work around stamp act of 1765 and serving in pro independence fourth virginia convention in 1775 and fifth virginia convention in 1776 mason prepared first draft of virginia declaration of rights in 1776 and his words formed much of text adopted by final revolutionary virginia convention he also wrote a constitution for state thomas jefferson and others sought to have convention adopt their ideas but they found that mason s version could not be stopped during american revolutionary war mason was a member of powerful house of delegates of virginia general assembly but to irritation of washington and others he refused to serve in continental congress in philadelphia citing health and family commitments in 1787 mason was named one of his state s delegates to constitutional convention and traveled to philadelphia his only lengthy trip outside virginia many clauses in constitution bear his stamp as he was active in convention for months before deciding that he could not sign same he cited lack of a bill of rights most prominently in his objections but also wanted an immediate end to slave trade and a supermajority for navigation acts which might force exporters of tobacco to use more expensive american ships he failed to attain these objectives and again at virginia ratifying convention of 1788 but his prominent fight for a bill of rights led fellow virginian james madison to introduce same during first congress in 1789 these amendments were ratified in 1791 a year before mason died obscure after his death mason has come to be recognized in 20th and 21st centuries for his contributions to early united states and to virginia ancestry and early life upright thumb left coat of arms of george mason george mason s great grandfather george mason i had been a cavalier militarily defeated in english civil war some of them came to america in 1640s and 1650s he had been born in 1629 at pershore in english county of worcestershire immigrant george mason settled in what is now stafford county virginia having obtained land as a reward for bringing his party to colony as 50 acres were awarded for each person transported into colony of virginia his son george mason ii 1660 1716 was first to move to what in 1742 became fairfax county then at frontier between english and native american areas george mason iii 1690 1735 served in house of burgesses and like his father was county lieutenant george mason iv s mother ann thomson mason was daughter of a former attorney general of virginia who had immigrated from london and was of a yorkshire family masons lived in a colonial virginia that had few roads as most commerce was carried on chesapeake bay or along waters of its tributaries such as potomac and rappahannock rivers most settlement took place near rivers through which planters could trade with world thus colonial virginia initially developed few towns since estates were largely self sufficient and could get what they needed without need to purchase locally even capital williamsburg saw little activity when legislature was not in session local politics was dominated by large landowners like masons virginia economy rose and fell with tobacco main crop which was raised mostly for export to britain into this world was born george mason fourth of that name on december 11 1725 he may have been born at his father s plantation on dogue s neck later mason neck but this is uncertain as his parents also lived on their lands across potomac in maryland on march 5 1735 george mason iii died when his boat capsized while crossing potomac his widow ann raised their son george then 10 and two younger siblings as co guardian with lawyer john mercer who was their uncle by marriage having wed george mason iii s sister catherine ann mason selected property at chopawamsic creek today in prince william county virginia as her dower house and there lived with her children and administered lands that her elder son would control upon reaching his 21st birthday at age twenty one mason inherited his father s large estate it consisted of thousands of acres of farmland in virginia and maryland as well as thousands of acres of uncleared land in western country mason also inherited his father s slaves said to number about three hundred in 1736 george began his education with a mr williams hired to teach him for price of of tobacco per annum george s studies began at his mother s house but following year he was boarded out to a mrs simpson in maryland with williams continuing as teacher through 1739 by 1740 george mason was again at chopawamsic under tutelage of a dr bridges mason s biographers have speculated that this was charles bridges who helped develop schools run in britain by society for promotion of christian knowledge and who came to america in 1731 in addition mason and his brother thomson doubtlessly had run of mercer s library one of largest in virginia and conversations of mercer and book lovers who gathered around him were likely an education in themselves mercer was a brilliant man of strong opinions who expressed his views in ways that sometimes gave offense mason proved similar in brilliance of mind and ability to anger george mason attained his majority in 1746 and continued to reside at chopawamsic with his siblings and mother virginia landed gentleman public figure obligations and offices that came with being one of largest local landowners descended on mason as they had on his father and grandfather in 1747 he was named to fairfax county court mason was elected as a vestryman for truro parish serving 1749 1785 encyclopedia virginia george mason 1725 1792 george mason was on truro parish vestry from 1749 to 1785 during that time he was required to be a member in good standing of anglican communion he took a position among officers of county militia eventually rising to rank of colonel in 1748 he sought a seat in house of burgesses process was controlled by more senior members of court and he was not then successful but he would win in 1758 county court not only heard civil and criminal cases but decided matters such as local taxes membership fell to most major landowners mason was a justice for much of rest of his life though he was excluded because of nonattendance at court from 1752 to 1764 and resigned in 1789 when continued service meant swearing to uphold a constitution he could not support even while a member he often did not attend joseph horrell in a journal article on mason s court service noted that he was often in poor health and lived furthest of any of major from fairfax county courthouse whether at its original site near today s tyson s corner or later in newly founded alexandria robert rutland editor of mason s papers considered court service a major influence on mason s later thinking and writing but horrell denied it if fairfax court provided a course for mason s early training he chiefly distinguished himself by skipping classes alexandria was one of towns founded or given corporate status in mid 18th century in which mason had interests he purchased three of original lots along king and royal streets and became a municipal trustee in 1754 he also served as a trustee of dumfries in prince william county and had business interests there and in georgetown on maryland side of potomac today in district of columbia squire of gunston hall thumb gunston hall postage stamp 1958 issue on april 4 1750 mason married ann eilbeck only child of william and sarah eilbeck of charles county maryland masons and had adjacent lands in maryland and had joined together in real estate transactions by his death in 1764 william eilbeck was one of wealthiest men in charles county at time of his marriage mason was living at dogue s neck possibly at sycamore point george and ann mason would have nine children who survived to adulthood ann mason died in 1773 their marriage judging by surviving accounts was a happy one george mason began to build his home gunston hall likely beginning in 1755 exterior typical of local buildings of that time was probably based on architectural books sent from britain to america for use of local builders one of these craftsmen perhaps william waite or james wren constructed gunston hall mason was proud of gardens which still surround house there were outbuildings including slave quarters a schoolhouse and kitchens and beyond them four large plantations forests and shops and other facilities that made gunston hall mostly self sufficient mason avoided overdependence on tobacco as a source of income by leasing much of his land holdings to tenant farmers and diversified his crops to grow wheat for export to british west indies as virginia s economy sank because of tobacco overproduction in 1760s and 1770s mason was a pioneer in virginia wine industry subscribing along with other virginians such as thomas jefferson to philip mazzei s scheme for growing wine grapes in america mason sought to expand his land and wealth he greatly expanded boundaries of gunston hall estate so that it occupied all of dogue s neck which became known as mason s neck one project that mason was involved in for most of his adult life was ohio company in which he invested in 1749 and became treasurer in 1752 an office he held forty years until his death in 1792 ohio company had secured a royal grant for to be surveyed near forks of ohio river today site of pittsburgh pennsylvania war revolution and competing claims from pennsylvania eventually defeated ohio company s plans although company failed mason acquired considerable western lands independently his defense against pennsylvania claims selections from virginia charters 1772 originally intended to promote ohio company s claims was widely applauded as a defense of rights of americans against royal decrees involvement with ohio company also brought mason into contact with many prominent virginians including his fairfax county neighbor george washington mason and washington were friends for many years until they finally broke over their differences regarding federal constitution peter r henriques in his journal article on their relationship suggested that mason cultivated friendship more than washington did as mason sent many more letters and gifts and stayed more often at washington s plantation though last can be explained in part as mount vernon lay on road from gunston hall to alexandria henriques suggested that as mason was older intellectually superior and owner of a flourishing plantation as washington struggled to establish mount vernon it would not have been in future president s character to be close to mason washington had a deep respect for mason s intellectual abilities several times asking for his advice and writing in 1777 when learning that mason had taken charge of an issue before general assembly i know of no person better qualified than colonel mason and shall be very happy to hear he has taken it in hand despite his involvement in western real estate schemes mason saw that land was being cleared and planted with tobacco faster than market for it could expand meaning that its price would drop even as more and more capital was tied up in land and slaves thus although a major slaveholder he opposed slave system in virginia he believed that slave importation together with natural population increase would result in a huge future slave population in virginia a system of leased lands though not as profitable as slave labor would have little trouble risque risk political thinker 1758 1775 from burgess to rebel little is known of mason s political views prior to 1760s when he came to oppose british colonial policies in 1758 mason successfully ran for house of burgesses when george william fairfax holder of one of fairfax county s two seats chose not to seek re election also elected were mason s brother thomson for stafford county george washington for frederick county where he was stationed as commander of virginia s militia as french and indian war continued and richard henry lee who would work closely with mason through their careers left thumb alt chamber of house of burgesses house of burgesses in williamsburg virginia where mason served when house assembled george mason was initially appointed to a committee concerned with raising additional militia during that time of war in 1759 he was appointed to powerful committee on privileges and elections he was also placed during latter year on committee on propositions and grievances which mostly considered local matters mason dealt with several local concerns presenting a petition of fairfax county planters against being assessed for a tobacco wharf at alexandria funds they felt should be raised through wharfage fees he also played a major role as burgesses deliberated how to divide prince william county as settlement expanded in march 1759 fauquier county was created by legislative act in this mason opposed interest of family of thomas lord fairfax who wanted existing counties expanded instead including fairfax this difference may have contributed to mason s decision not to seek re election in 1761 mason biographer jeff broadwater noted that mason s committee assignments reflected esteem his colleagues held him in or at least potential they saw broadwater did not find it surprising that mason did not seek re election as he did not attend sessions between 1759 and 1761 although british were victorious over french in war king george iii s government felt that north american colonies were not paying their way since little direct tax revenue from colonies was received sugar act of 1764 had its greatest effect in new england and did not cause widespread objection stamp act following year affected all 13 colonies as it required revenue stamps to be used on papers required in trade and in law when word of passage of stamp act reached williamsburg house of burgesses passed virginia resolves asserting that virginians had same rights as if they resided in britain and that they could only be taxed by themselves or their elected representatives resolves were mostly written by a fiery spoken new member for louisa county patrick henry mason slowly moved from being a peripheral figure towards center of virginia politics but his published response to stamp act which he opposed is most notable for inclusion of his anti slavery views george washington or george william fairfax burgesses for fairfax county may have asked mason s advice as to what steps to take in crisis mason drafted an act to allow for one of most common court actions replevin to take place without use of stamped paper and sent it to george washington by then one of fairfax county s burgesses to gain passage this action contributed to a boycott of stamps with courts and trade paralyzed british parliament repealed stamp act in 1766 but continued to assert right to tax colonies following repeal a committee of london merchants issued a public letter to americans warning them not to declare victory mason published a response in june 1766 satirizing british position we have with infinite difficulty fatigue got you excused this one time do what your papa and mamma bid hasten to return your most grateful acknowledgements for condescending to let you keep what is your own townshend acts of 1767 were britain s next attempt to tax colonies placing duties on substances including lead and glass and provoking calls from northern colonies for a boycott of british goods virginia more dependent on goods imported from britain was less enthusiastic and as local planters tended to receive goods at their river landings a boycott would be difficult to enforce in april 1769 washington sent a copy of a philadelphia resolution to mason asking his advice on what action virginia should take it is unknown who adapted that text for use in virginia broadwater concluded it was mason but mason sent washington a corrected draft on april 23 1769 washington took it to williamsburg but governor lord botetourt dissolved legislature because of radical resolutions it was passing burgesses adjourned to a nearby tavern and there passed a non importation agreement based on mason s although resolution was not as strong as mason had liked he wanted virginia to threaten to cut off tobacco mason worked in following years for non importation repeal of most of townshend duties excepting that on tea made his task more difficult in march 1773 his wife ann died of illness contracted after another pregnancy mason was sole parent to nine children and his commitments made him even more reluctant to accept political office that would take him from gunston hall in may 1774 mason was in williamsburg on real estate business word had just arrived of passage of intolerable acts as americans dubbed legislative response to boston tea party and a group of lawmakers including lee henry and jefferson asked mason to join them in formulating a course of action burgesses passed a resolution for a day of fasting and prayer to obtain divine intervention against destruction of our civil rights but governor lord dunmore dissolved legislature rather than accept it mason may have helped write resolution and likely joined members after dissolution when they met at raleigh tavern new elections had to be held for burgess and for delegate to convention which had been called by rump of dissolved house of burgesses and fairfax county s were set for july 5 1774 washington planned to run for one seat and tried to get mason or bryan fairfax to seek other but both men declined although poll was postponed to 14th due to poor weather washington met that day with other local leaders including likely mason in alexandria and selected a committee to draft a set of resolutions which washington hoped would define our constitutional rights resulting fairfax resolves were largely drafted by mason he met with newly elected washington on july 17 at mount vernon and stayed night two men rode together to alexandria following day 24 propositions that made up resolves protested loyalty to british crown but denied right of parliament to legislate for colonies that had been settled at private expense and which had received charters from monarch resolves called for a continental congress if americans did not receive redress by november 1 exports including that of tobacco would be cut off freeholders of fairfax county approved resolves appointing mason and washington to a special committee in emergency according to early virginia historian hugh grigsby at alexandria mason made his first great movement on theatre of revolution washington took resolves to virginia convention in williamsburg and although delegates made some changes adopted resolution closely tracks both fairfax resolves and scheme for non exportation of tobacco mason had proposed some years earlier convention elected delegates to first continental congress in philadelphia including lee washington and henry and in october 1774 congress adopted a similar embargo much of mason s efforts in 1774 and 1775 was in organizing a militia independent of royal government washington by january 1775 was drilling a small force and he and mason purchased gunpowder for company mason wrote in favor of annual election of militia officers in words that would later echo in virginia declaration of rights we came equal into this world and equals shall we go out of it all men are by nature born equally free and independent washington s election as a delegate to second continental congress created a vacancy in fairfax county s delegation to third virginia convention and he wrote from philadelphia in may 1775 urging that it be filled by this time blood had been shed between colonial and briton at battles of lexington and concord mason attempted to avoid election on grounds of poor health and that he was needed to parent his motherless children nevertheless he was elected and journeyed to richmond which being further inland than williamsburg was deemed better protected from possible british attack when richmond convention began in july 1775 mason was assigned to crucial committees including one attempting to raise an army to protect colony according to robert a rutland sick or healthy mason was needed for his ability mason sponsored a non exportation measure it was passed by a large majority though it had to be repealed later in session to coordinate with one passed by maryland despite pressure from many delegates mason refused to consider election as a delegate to continental congress in place of washington when latter became commanding general of continental army but could not avoid election to committee of safety a powerful group that took over many functions in governmental vacuum when mason proffered his resignation from this committee it was refused declaration of rights illness forced mason to absent himself from committee of safety for several weeks in 1775 and he did not attend fourth convention held in december 1775 and january 1776 with independence from britain widely accepted as necessary among prominent virginians fifth convention to meet in may 1776 at williamsburg would need to decide how virginia would be administered henceforth as royal government was dead in all but name accordingly convention was seen as so important that richard henry lee arranged for his temporary recall from congress to be a part of convention and jefferson tried but failed to arrange to leave congress as well other notables elected to convention were henry george wythe and a young delegate from orange county james madison mason was elected for fairfax county though with great difficulty that convention in may 1776 unanimously instructed jefferson and other virginia delegates to congress to seek a clear and full declaration of independency at same time convention resolved to pass a declaration of rights due to ill health mason did not arrive until may 18 1776 after vote but was appointed to a committee led by archibald cary which was to compose a declaration of rights and constitution mason was skeptical that thirty person cary committee could collectively compose anything worthwhile but was surprised at how quickly it moved though his membership had a role in that speed on may 24 convention president edmund pendleton wrote to jefferson about committee s deliberations as colo nel mason seems to have ascendancy in great work i have sanguine hopes it will be framed so as to answer it s end prosperity to community and security to individuals mason working in a room at raleigh tavern drafted a declaration of rights and plan of government likely to prevent frivolous plans with no chance of adoption from being put forward edmund randolph later recalled that mason s draft swallowed up all rest virginia declaration of rights and 1776 constitution of virginia were joint works but mason was main author mason likely worked closely with thomas ludwell lee earliest surviving draft shows first ten articles in mason s handwriting with other two written by lee draft for declaration of rights drew on magna carta english petition of right of 1628 and that nation s 1689 bill of rights mason s first article would be paraphrased by jefferson soon after in drafting american declaration of independence from first article cataloguing rights of man mason derived following articles which make clear that role of government is to secure and protect those rights and if it fails to do so people have a right to amend or abolish it property could not be taken for public use without owner s consent and a citizen could only be bound by a law accepted by that person or by elected representatives if accused a person had right to a speedy and local trial based on an accusation made known to him with right to call for evidence and witnesses in his favor when convention began to debate declaration it quickly bogged down on first sentence of article 1 which conservatives feared would imply that slaves were their masters equals this was resolved by convention adding words when they enter into a state of society thus excluding slaves mason spoke repeatedly in five days of debate using oratory one hearer described as neither flowing nor smooth but his language was strong his manner most impressive and strengthened by a bit of biting cynicism when provocation made it seasonable declaration of rights was passed by convention on june 12 1776 thumb left upright alt young thomas jefferson mason s plan for virginia s constitution was adopted over proposals by thomas jefferson pictured and others in later years there was a flurry of contradictory statements from convention members including mason about who composed which articles randolph credited henry with articles 15 and 16 but latter dealing with religious freedom was written by madison mason had imitated english law in drafting language requiring toleration of those of minority religions but madison insisted on full religious liberty and mason supported madison s amendment once made committee draft likely for most part written by mason received wide publicity final version much less so and mason s words all men are born equally free and independent were later reproduced in state constitutions from pennsylvania to montana jefferson tweaked prose and included sentiments in declaration of independence in 1778 mason wrote that declaration of rights was closely imitated by other united states this was true as seven of original states and vermont joined virginia in promulgating a bill of rights four in addition specified rights that were protected within body of their constitutions feelings were so strong in massachusetts that voters there in 1778 rejected a constitution drafted by a convention insisting that a bill of rights had to come first virginia constitution even before convention approved declaration of rights mason was busy at work on a constitution for virginia he was not only one occupying himself so jefferson sent several versions from philadelphia one of which supplied eventual constitution s preamble essex county s meriwether smith may have prepared a draft but text is unknown as an original writing in mason s hand is not known extent to which final draft was written by him is uncertain nevertheless william fleming on june 22 1776 sent jefferson a copy of draft before cary committee telling him printed plan was drawn by colo g mason and by him laid before committee mason had submitted his plan sometime between june 8 and 10 1776 it named new state commonwealth of virginia a name chosen pointedly by mason to indicate that power stemmed from people constitution provided for a popularly elected house of delegates chosen annually by men who owned or leased property or who had fathered three or more virginians most governmental power resided in house of delegates governor could not even veto a bill and could only act as head of state militia on advice of his council of state whose members were elected by legislature draft was considered by committee and it issued a report on june 24 at which time jefferson s preamble and several amendments authored by him were included george wythe who advocated for jefferson s draft before committee found discussion far enough advanced that members were only willing to yield to jefferson on a few points entire convention considered document between june 26 and 28 and it was signed on 29th richard henry lee wrote day prior to constitution s passage by unanimous vote i have had pleasure to see our new plan of government go on well this day will put a finishing hand to it tis very much of democratic kind when convention chose patrick henry as virginia s first post independence governor mason led committee of notables sent to inform henry of his election there was criticism of constitution edmund randolph later wrote that document s faults indicated that even such a great mind as mason s was not immune from oversights and it did not have an amending process and granted two delegates to each county regardless of population 1776 constitution remained in force until 1830 when another convention replaced it according to henry c riely in his journal article on mason virginia constitution of 1776 whatever may have been question raised long afterwards as to contribution of other great leaders stands on authority of jefferson madison and randolph to mention only highest authority as his creation wartime legislator thumb upright letter from mason to washington 1776 congratulating general on his victory in siege of boston mason devoted much effort during american revolutionary war to safeguarding fairfax county and rivers of virginia since british several times raided areas along potomac control of rivers and of chesapeake bay was urgent as virginians tried to obtain hard currency by trading tobacco to french and other european nations export of tobacco generally via west indies allowed mason and others to obtain via france and holland british made items such as cloth clothing patterns medicines and hardware mason served as a member of house of delegates from 1776 to 1781 his longest continuous political service outside fairfax county which he represented in richmond other fairfax county seat turned over several times washington s stepson jackie custis was elected late in war but mason remained county s choice throughout nevertheless mason s health often caused him to miss meetings of legislature or to arrive days or weeks late mason in 1777 was assigned to a committee to revise virginia s laws with expectation that he would take on criminal code and land law mason served a few months on committee before resigning on ground he was not a lawyer most of work fell to jefferson returned from philadelphia pendleton and wythe due to illness caused by a botched smallpox inoculation mason was forced to miss part of legislature s spring 1777 session in his absence delegates on may 22 elected him to continental congress mason who may have been angry that lee had not been chosen refused on ground that he was needed at home and did not feel he could resign from general assembly without permission from his constituents lee was elected in his place this did not end desire of virginians to send mason to continental congress in 1779 lee resigned from congress expressing hope that mason wythe or jefferson would replace him in philadelphia general washington was frustrated at reluctance of many talented men to serve in congress writing to benjamin harrison that states should compel their ablest men to attend congress where is mason wythe jefferson nicholas pendleton nelson general wrote to mason directly in spite of washington s pleas mason remained in virginia plagued by illness and heavily occupied both on committee of safety and elsewhere in defending fairfax county area most of legislation mason introduced in house of delegates was war related often aimed at raising men or money needed by congress for washington s continental army new federal and state governments short on cash issued paper money by 1777 value of virginia s paper money had dropped precipitously and mason developed a plan to redeem notes with a tax on real estate due to illness mason was three weeks late in arriving at richmond to frustration of washington who had faith in mason s knowledge of financial affairs general wrote to custis it is much to be wished that a remedy could be applied to depreciation of our currency i know of no person better qualified to do this than colonel mason mason retained his interest in western affairs hoping in vain to salvage ohio company s land grant he and jefferson were among few delegates to be told of george rogers clark s expedition to secure control of lands north of ohio river mason and jefferson secured legislation authorizing governor henry to defend against unspecified western enemies expedition was generally successful and mason received a report directly from clark mason sought to remove differences between virginia and other states and although he felt 1780 settlement of boundary dispute with pennsylvania mason dixon line not named for george mason was unfavorable to virginia he voted for it enthusiastically also in 1780 mason remarried to sarah brent from a nearby plantation who had never been married and was 52 years old it was a marriage of convenience with new bride able to take some of burden of parenting mason s many children off his hands peace 1781 1786 by signing of 1783 treaty of paris life along potomac had returned to normal among visits between elite that returned with peace was one by madison to gunston hall in december 1783 while returning from congress in philadelphia 1781 articles of confederation had tied states in a loose bond and madison sought a sounder federal structure seeking proper balance between federal and state rights he found mason willing to consider a federal tax madison had feared subject might offend his host and wrote to jefferson of evening s conversation same month mason spent christmas at mount vernon only larger estate than his in fairfax county a fellow houseguest described mason as slight in figure but not tall and has a grand head and clear gray eyes mason retained his political influence in virginia writing patrick henry who had been elected to house of delegates a letter filled with advice as that body s 1783 session opened mason scuttled efforts to elect him to house of delegates in 1784 writing that sending him to richmond would be an oppressive and unjust invasion of my personal liberty his refusal disappointed jefferson who had hoped that likelihood that legislature would consider land legislation would attract mason to richmond legislature nevertheless appointed mason a commissioner to negotiate with maryland over navigation of potomac mason spent much time on this issue and reached agreement with maryland delegates at meeting in march 1785 known as mount vernon conference although meeting at washington s home came later to be seen as a first step towards 1787 constitutional convention mason saw it simply as efforts by two states to resolve differences between them mason was appointed to annapolis convention of 1786 at which representatives of all states were welcome but like most delegates did not attend sparsely attended annapolis meeting called for a conference to consider amendments to articles of confederation to deter smuggling madison proposed a bill to make norfolk state s only legal port of entry five other ports including alexandria were eventually added but port act proved unpopular despite support of washington mason an opponent of act accepted election to house of delegates in 1786 and many believed that his influence would prove decisive for repeal effort due to illness mason did not come to richmond during initial session though he sent a petition as a private citizen to legislature port act survived though additional harbors were added as legal entry points constitutional convention 1787 building a constitution although annapolis convention saw only about a dozen delegates attend representing only five states it called for a meeting to be held in philadelphia in may 1787 to devise amendments to articles of confederation which would result in a more durable constitutional arrangement accordingly in december 1786 virginia general assembly elected seven men as commonwealth s delegation washington mason henry randolph madison wythe and john blair henry declined appointment and his place was given to dr james mcclurg randolph who had just been elected governor sent three notifications of election to mason who accepted without any quibbles roads were difficult because of spring flooding and mason was last virginia delegate to arrive on may 17 three days after convention s scheduled opening but it was not until may 25 that convention formally opened with arrival of at least one delegate from ten of twelve states which sent representatives rhode island sent no one thumb left independence hall s assembly room where convention for most part was held journey to philadelphia was mason s first beyond virginia and maryland according to josephine t pacheco in her article about mason s role at philadelphia since virginia s leaders regarded mason as a wise trustworthy man it is not surprising that they chose him as a member of virginia delegation though they must have been surprised when he accepted broadwater suggested that mason went to philadelphia because he knew federal congress needed additional power and because he felt that body could act as a check on powers of state legislatures as virginians waited for other delegates to arrive they met each day and formulated what became known as virginia plan they also did some sightseeing and were presented to pennsylvania s president benjamin franklin within a week of arrival mason was bored with social events to which delegates were invited i begin to grow tired of etiquette and nonsense so fashionable in this city going into convention mason wanted to see a more powerful central government than under articles but not one that would threaten local interests he feared that more numerous northern states would dominate union and would impose restrictions on trade that would harm virginia so he sought a supermajority requirement for navigation acts as was his constant objective he sought to preserve liberty he and other free white males enjoyed in virginia guarding against tyranny he and others had decried under british rule he also sought a balance of powers seeking thereby to make a durable government according to historian brent tarter mason designed his home gunston hall so that no misplaced window or missing support might spoil effect or threaten to bring down roof he tried to design institutions of government in same way so that wicked or unprincipled men could not knock loose any safeguards of liberty mason had hope coming into convention that it would yield a result that he felt would strengthen united states impressed by quality of delegates mason expected sound thinking from them something he did not think he had often encountered in his political career still he felt that hopes of all union centre in this convention and wrote to his son george revolt from great britain formations of our new government at that time were nothing compared with great business now before us mason knew few of delegates who were not from virginia or maryland but his reputation preceded him once delegates representing sufficient states had arrived in philadelphia by late may convention held closed sessions at pennsylvania state house today independence hall washington was elected convention s president by unanimous vote and his tremendous personal prestige as victorious war general helped legitimize convention but also caused him to abstain from debate mason had no such need to remain silent and only four or five delegates spoke as frequently as he did though he ended up not signing constitution according to broadwater mason won as many convention debates as he lost in early days of convention mason supported much of virginia plan which was introduced by randolph on may 29 this plan would have a popularly elected lower house which would choose members of upper house from lists provided by states most of delegates had found weak government under articles insufficient and randolph proposed that new federal government should be supreme over states mason agreed that federal government should be more powerful than states virginia plan if implemented would base representation in both houses of federal legislature on population this was unsatisfactory to smaller states delaware s delegates had been instructed to seek an equal vote for each state and this became new jersey plan introduced by that state s governor william paterson divisions in convention became apparent in late june when by a narrow vote convention voted that representation in lower house be based on population but motion of connecticut s oliver ellsworth for each state to have an equal vote in upper house failed on a tie with convention deadlocked on july 2 1787 a grand committee was formed with one member from each state to seek a way out mason had not taken as strong a position on legislature as had madison and he was appointed to committee mason and benjamin franklin were most prominent members committee met over convention s july 4 recess and proposed what became known as great compromise a house of representatives based on population in which money bills must originate and a senate with equal representation for each state records do not survive of mason s participation in that committee but clause requiring money bills to start in house most likely came from him or was price of his support as he had inserted such a clause in virginia constitution and he defended that clause once convention debate resumed according to madison s notes mason urged convention to adopt compromise road to dissent by mid july as delegates began to move past stalemate to a framework built upon great compromise mason had considerable influence in convention north carolina s william blount was unhappy that those from his state were in sentiment with virginia who seemed to take lead madison at their head tho randolph and mason also great mason had failed to carry his proposals that senators must own property and not be in debt to united states but successfully argued that minimum age for service in congress should be 25 telling convention that men younger than that were too immature mason was first to propose that national seat of government not be in a state capital lest local legislature be too influential voted against proposals to base representation on a state s wealth or taxes paid and supported regular reapportionment of house of representatives on august 6 1787 convention received a tentative draft written by a committee of detail chaired by south carolina s john rutledge randolph had represented virginia draft was acceptable to mason as a basis for discussion containing such points important to him as requirement that money bills originate in house and not be amendable in senate nevertheless mason felt upper house was too powerful as it had powers to make treaties appoint supreme court justices and adjudicate territorial disputes between states draft lacked provision for a council of revision something mason and others considered a serious lack convention spent several weeks in august in debating powers of congress although mason was successful in some of his proposals such as placing state militias under federal regulation and a ban on congress passing an export tax he lost on some that he deemed crucial these losses included convention deciding to allow importation of slaves to continue to at least 1800 later amended to 1808 and to allow a simple majority to pass navigation acts that might require virginians to export their tobacco in american flagged ships when it might be cheaper to use foreign flagged vessels convention also weakened requirement that money bills begin in house and not be subject to amendment in senate eventually striking latter clause after debate that stretched fitfully over weeks despite these defeats mason continued to work constructively to build a constitution serving on another grand committee that considered customs duties and ports on august 31 1787 massachusetts elbridge gerry spoke against document as a whole as did luther martin of maryland when gerry moved to postpone consideration of final document mason seconded him stating according to madison that he would sooner chop off his right hand than put it to constitution as it now stands still mason did not rule out signing it saying that he wanted to see how certain matters still before convention were settled before deciding a final position whether to sign or ask for a second convention as final touches were made to constitution mason and gerry held meetings in evening to discuss strategy bringing in delegates representing states from connecticut to georgia mason s misgivings about constitution were increased on september 12 when gerry proposed and mason seconded that there be a committee appointed to write a bill of rights to be part of text of constitution connecticut s roger sherman noted that state bills of rights would remain in force to which mason responded laws of united states are to be paramount supreme to state bills of rights although massachusetts abstained in deference to gerry virginians showed no desire to conciliate mason in their votes as motion failed with no states in favor and ten opposed also on september 12 committee on style charged with making a polished final draft of document reported and mason began to list objections on his copy on 15th as convention continued a clause by clause consideration of draft mason randolph and gerry stated they would not sign constitution on 17th members of twelve delegations then present in philadelphia signed constitution except for three men who had stated they would not as document was sent to articles of confederation s congress in new york mason sent a copy of his objections to richard henry lee a member of congress ratification battle broadwater noted given difficulty of task he had set for himself his stubborn independence and his lack by 1787 of any concern for his own political future it is not surprising that he left philadelphia at odds with great majority of his fellow delegates madison recorded that mason believing that convention had given his proposals short shrift in a hurry to complete its work began his journey back to virginia in an exceeding ill humor mason biographer helen hill miller noted that before mason returned to gunston hall he was injured in body as well as spirit due to an accident on road word of mason s opposition stance had reached fairfax county even before convention ended most local sentiment was in favor of document washington made a statement urging ratification but otherwise remained silent knowing he would almost certainly be first president mason sent washington a copy of his objections but general believed that only choice was ratification or disaster constitution was to be ratified by state conventions with nine approvals necessary for it to come into force in practice opposition by large states such as new york or virginia would make it hard for new government to function mason remained a member of house of delegates and in late october 1787 legislature called a convention for june 1788 in language crafted by john marshall it decreed that virginia ratifying convention would be allowed free and ample discussion mason was less influential in his final session in house of delegates because of his strong opposition to ratification and his age 61 may also have caused him to be less effective as smaller states ratified constitution in late 1787 and early 1788 there was an immense quantity of pamphlets and other written matter for and against approval most prominent in support were pamphlets later collected as federalist written by madison and two new yorkers alexander hamilton and john jay mason s objections were widely cited by opponents mason had begun his objections to this constitution of government in philadelphia in october 1787 it was published though without his permission madison complained that mason had gone beyond reasons for opposing he had stated in convention but broadwater suggested major difference was one of tone since written work dismissed as useless constitution and proposed federal government nevertheless both lee and mason believed that if proper amendments were made constitution would be a fine instrument of governance objections were widely cited in opposition to ratification and mason was criticized for placing his own name on it at a time when political tracts were signed if at all with pen names such as junius so that author s reputation would not influence debate despite this mason s objections were among most influential anti federalist works and its opening line there is no declaration of rights likely their most effective slogan virginians were reluctant to believe that greatly respected figures such as washington and franklin would be complicit in setting up a tyrannical system there were broad attacks on mason new haven gazette suggested that he had not done much for his country during war in marked contrast to washington oliver ellsworth blamed virginia opposition on lee family who had long had tensions with washington family and on madness of mason tarter in his american national biography article on mason wrote that rigidity of mason s views and his increasingly belligerent personality produced an intolerance and intemperance in his behavior that surprised and angered madison with whom he had worked closely at beginning of convention and washington who privately condemned mason s actions during ratification struggle mason faced difficulties in being elected to ratifying convention from fairfax county since most freeholders there were federalist and he was at odds with many in alexandria over local politics statute governing elections to convention in richmond allowed him to seek election elsewhere and he campaigned for a seat from stafford county assuring electors that he did not seek disunion but rather reform he spoke against unamended constitution in strong terms george nicholas a federalist friend of mason believed that mason felt he could lead virginia to gain concessions from other states and that he was embittered by continuing attacks on him on march 10 1788 mason finished first in polls in stafford county winning one of its two seats he apparently was only person elected for a constituency in which he did not live voter turnout was low as many in remote areas without newspapers knew little about constitution federalists were believed to have a slight advantage in elected delegates mason thought that convention would be unlikely to ratify document without demanding amendments by time richmond convention opened randolph had abandoned anti federalist cause which damaged efforts by mason and henry to co ordinate with their counterparts in new york mason moved that convention consider document clause by clause which may have played into hands of federalists who feared what outcome of an immediate vote might be and who had more able leadership in richmond including marshall and madison nevertheless broadwater suggested that as most delegates had declared their views before election mason s motion made little difference henry far more a foe of a strong federal government than was mason took lead for his side in debate mason spoke several times in discussion on topics ranging from pardon power which he predicted president would use corruptly to federal judiciary which he warned would lead to suits in federal courts by citizens against states where they did not live john marshall a future chief justice of united states downplayed concern regarding judiciary but mason would later be proved correct in case of chisholm v georgia 1793 which led to passage of eleventh amendment federalists initially did not have a majority with balance held by undeclared delegates mainly from western virginia today s kentucky anti federalists suffered repeated blows during convention due to defection of randolph and as news came other states had ratified mason led a group of anti federalists which drafted amendments even federalists were open to supporting them though constitution s supporters wanted document drafted in philadelphia ratified first after some of kentuckians had declared for ratification convention considered a resolution to withhold ratification pending approval of a declaration of rights at google books supported by mason but opposed by madison light horse harry lee marshall nicholas randolph and bushrod washington resolution failed 88 80 mason then voted in minority as virginia ratified constitution on june 25 1788 by a vote of 89 79 following ratification vote mason served on a committee chaired by george wythe charged with compiling a final list of recommended amendments and mason s draft was adopted but for a few editorial changes unreconciled to result mason prepared a fiery written argument but some felt tone too harsh and mason agreed not to publish it final years defeated at richmond mason returned to gunston hall where he devoted himself to family and local affairs though still keeping up a vigorous correspondence with political leaders he resigned from fairfax county court after an act passed by new congress required officeholders to take an oath to support constitution and in 1790 declined a seat in senate which had been left vacant by william grayson s death stating that his health would not permit him to serve even if he had no other objection seat went to james monroe who had supported mason s anti federalist stance and who had in 1789 lost to madison for a seat in house of representatives judging by his correspondence mason softened his stance towards new federal government telling monroe that constitution wisely properly directs that ambassadors be confirmed by senate although mason predicted that amendments to be proposed to states by first congress would be milk water propositions he displayed much satisfaction at what became bill of rights ratified in 1791 and wrote that if his concerns about federal courts and other matters were addressed i could cheerfully put my hand heart to new government washington who was in 1789 elected first president resented mason s strong stances against ratification of constitution and these differences destroyed their friendship although some sources accept that mason dined at mount vernon on november 2 1788 peter r henriques noted that washington s diary states that mr george mason was guest and as washington elsewhere in his diary always referred to his former colleague at philadelphia as colonel mason visitor was likely george mason v son mason always wrote positively of washington and president said nothing publicly but in a letter referred to mason as a quondam friend who would not recant his position on constitution because pride on one hand and want of manly candour on other will not i am certain let him acknowledge error in his opinions respecting it federal government though conviction should flash on his mind as strongly as a ray of light rutland suggested that two men were alike in their intolerance of opponents and suspicion of their motives mason had long battled against alexandria merchants who he felt unfairly dominated county court if only because they could more easily get to courthouse in 1789 he drafted legislation to move courthouse to center of county though it did not pass in his lifetime in 1798 legislature passed an authorizing act and courthouse opened in 1801 most of those at gunston hall both family and slaves fell ill during summer of 1792 experiencing chills and fever when those subsided mason caught a chest cold when jefferson visited gunston hall on october 1 1792 he found mason long a martyr to gout needing a crutch to walk though still sound in mind and memory additional ailments possibly pneumonia set in less than a week after jefferson s visit on october 7 george mason died at gunston hall and was subsequently buried on estate within sight of house he had built and of potomac river although mason s death attracted little notice aside from a few mentions in local newspapers jefferson mourned a great loss another future president monroe stated that mason s patriotic virtues thro ugh revolution will ever be remembered by citizens of this country views on slavery mason owned many slaves in fairfax county only george washington owned more and mason is not known to have freed any even in his will in which his slaves were divided among his children childless washington in his will ordered his slaves be freed after his wife s death and jefferson manumitted a few slaves mostly of hemings family likely including his own children by sally hemings according to broadwater in all likelihood mason believed or convinced himself that he had no options mason would have done nothing that might have compromised financial futures of his nine children peter wallenstein in his article about how writers have interpreted mason argued that he could have freed some slaves without harming his children s future if he had wanted to thumb 300px gunston hall in may 2006 seen from front mason s biographers and interpreters have long differed about how to present his views on slavery related issues a two volume biography 1892 by kate mason rowland who broadwater noted was a sympathetic white southerner writing during heyday of jim crow denied that mason her ancestor was an abolitionist in modern sense of term she noted that mason regretted that there was slavery and was against slave trade but wanted slavery protected in constitution in 1919 robert c mason published a biography of his prominent ancestor and asserted that george mason agreed to free his own slaves and was first known abolitionist refusing to sign constitution among other reasons because as it stood then it did not abolish slavery or make preparation for its gradual extinction rutland writing in 1961 asserted that in mason s final days only coalition between new england and deep south at constitutional convention in philadelphia that had bargained away any hope of eliminating slavery left a residue of disgust catherine drinker bowen in her widely read 1966 account of constitutional convention miracle at philadelphia contended that mason believed slaves to be citizens and was a fervent abolitionist before word was coined others took a more nuanced view copland and macmaster deemed mason s views similar to other virginians of his class mason s experience with slave labor made him hate slavery but his heavy investment in slave property made it difficult for him to divest himself of a system that he despised according to wallenstein whatever his occasional rhetoric george mason was if one must choose proslavery not antislavery he acted in behalf of virginia slaveholders not virginia slaves broadwater noted mason consistently voiced his disapproval of slavery his 1787 attack on slavery echoes a similar speech to virginia convention of 1776 his conduct was another matter according to wallenstein historians and other writers have had great difficulty coming to grips with mason in his historical context and they have jumbled story in related ways misleading each other and following each other s errors some of this is due to conflation of mason s views on slavery with that of his desire to ban african slave trade which he unquestionably opposed and fought against his record otherwise is mixed virginia banned importation of slaves from abroad in 1778 while mason was in house of delegates in 1782 after he had returned to gunston hall it enacted legislation that allowed manumission of adult slaves young enough to support themselves not older than 45 but a proposal supported by mason to require freed slaves to leave virginia within a year or be sold at auction was defeated broadwater asserted mason must have shared fears of jefferson and countless other whites that whites and free blacks could not live together contradiction between wanting protection for slave property while opposing slave trade was pointed out by delegates to richmond convention such as george nicholas a supporter of ratification mason stated of slavery it is far from being a desirable property but it will involve us in great difficulties and to be now deprived of them sites and remembrance thumb right george mason university fairfax virginia in 2015 with statue of mason

great lawmakers mason s image is located above and to right of speaker s chair he and jefferson are only americans recognized legacy and historical view right thumb declaration of rights of man and of citizen written mainly by lafayette under jefferson s influence was based on ideals codified by mason according to miller succession of new world constitutions of which virginia s with mason as its chief architect was first declared source of political authority to be people in addition to making clear what a government was entitled to do most of them were prefaced by a list of individual rights of citizens rights whose maintenance was government s primary reason for being mason wrote first of these lists diane d in her article prepared for bicentennial of u s bill of rights wrote that mason made declaration of rights as his personal crusade tarter deemed mason celebrated as a champion of constitutional order and one of fathers of bill of rights justice sandra day o connor agreed george mason s greatest contribution to present day constitutional law was his influence on our bill of rights mason s legacy extended overseas doing so even in his lifetime and though he never visited europe his ideals did lafayette s declaration of rights of man and of citizen was written in early days of french revolution under influence of jefferson u s minister to france according to historian r r palmer there was in fact a remarkable parallel between french declaration and virginia declaration of 1776 another scholar richard morris concurred deeming resemblance between two texts too close to be coincidental virginia statesman george mason might well have instituted an action of plagiarism donald j senese in conclusion to collection of essays on mason published in 1989 noted that several factors contributed to mason s obscurity in century after his death older than many who served at philadelphia and came into prominence with new federal government mason died soon after constitution came into force and displayed no ambition for federal office declining a seat in senate mason left no extensive paper trail no autobiography like franklin no diary like washington or john adams washington left papers collected into 100 volumes for mason with many documents lost to fire there are only three mason fought on side that failed both at philadelphia and richmond leaving him a loser in a history written by winners even his speeches to constitutional convention descend through pen of madison a supporter of ratification after richmond convention he was according to senese a prophet without honor in his own country increased scrutiny of mason which has accompanied his rise from obscurity has meant according to tarter that his role in creation of some of most important texts of american liberty is not as clear as it seems rutland suggested that mason showed only belated concern over personal rights of citizens focusing on mason s dissent from constitution miller pointed to intersectional bargain struck over navigation acts and slave trade mason lost on both counts and double defeat was reflected in his attitude thereafter wallenstein concluded personal and economic interests of mason s home state took precedence over a bill of rights whatever his motivations mason proved a forceful advocate for a bill of rights whose objections helped accomplish his aims rutland noted that from opening phrase of his objections to bill of rights that james madison offered in congress two years later line is so direct that we can say that mason forced madison s hand federalist supporters of constitution could not overcome protest caused by mason s phrase there is no declaration of rights o connor wrote that mason lost his battle against ratification but his ideals and political activities have significantly influenced our constitutional jurisprudence wallenstein felt that there is much to be learned from mason see also history of united states
