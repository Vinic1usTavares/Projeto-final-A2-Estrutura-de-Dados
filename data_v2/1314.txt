adapter ega but not video graphics array vga writers for ugo networks have commented that fact that bart s house of weirdness was released exclusively for dos more than likely tells why its critical

that graphics in house of weirdness are sharp and colorful and look much like television show music from real show is also included along with digitized samples of bart s rather whining voice computer gaming world liked graphics resemblance to tv show and concluded that house of weirdness stands up as well as any super arcade game in 2009 eighteen years after bart s house of weirdness was released 1up com editor bob mackey reviewed game in 1up s official retro gaming blog he praised game for its graphics but was critical of gameplay mackey wrote that graphics are far more impressive than any other simpsons title at time outside of arcade brawler in fact graphics alone were responsible for my childlike excitement over house of weirdness they re pretty lush even if they re not entirely faithful to show bart s pc translation might be just a little off model but it s a gigantic leap over his duck like visage seen on nes he added however that game is completely unintuitive your goals aren t made clear it s never certain if you re doing right thing and you re often locked into screens with no apparent way out but death mackey also criticized levels structure that seems more generated than anything and fact that big beautiful sprites sometimes do not move well references external links simpsons bart s house of weirdness at gamefaqs category 1992 video games category dos
