meal sova 263 couple then had a short honeymoon in petersburg virginia debate has raged regarding how unusual this pairing was based on couple s age and blood relationship noted poe biographer arthur hobson quinn argues it was not particularly unusual nor was poe s nicknaming his wife sissy or sis hoffman 26 another poe biographer kenneth silverman contends that though their first cousin marriage was not unusual her young age was it has been suggested that clemm and poe had a relationship more like that between brother and sister than between husband and wife krutch 52 biographer arthur hobson quinn disagreed with this view citing a fervent love letter to argue that poe loved his little cousin not only with affection of a brother but also with passionate devotion of a lover and prospective husband some scholars including marie bonaparte have read many of poe s works as autobiographical and have concluded that virginia died a virgin hoffman 27 it has been speculated that she and her husband never consummated their marriage although no evidence is given richard claude and jean marie bonnet raising wind or french editions of works of edgar allan poe poe newsletter vol i no 1 april 1968 p 12 this interpretation often assumes that virginia is represented by title character in poem annabel lee a maiden by name of annabel lee poe biographer joseph wood krutch suggests that poe did not need women in way that normal men need them but only as a source of inspiration and care krutch 54 and that poe was never interested in women sexually krutch 25 friends of poe suggested that couple did not share a bed for at least first two years of their marriage but that from time she turned 16 they had a normal married life until onset of her illness sova 53 virginia and poe were by all accounts a happy and devoted couple poe s one time employer george rex graham wrote of their relationship his love for his wife was a sort of rapturous worship of spirit of beauty oberholtzer 299 poe once wrote to a friend i see no one among living as beautiful as my little wife phillips 1184 she in turn by many contemporary accounts nearly idolized her husband hoffman 318 she often sat close to him while he wrote kept his pens in order and folded and addressed his manuscripts phillips 1183 she showed her love for poe in an acrostic poem she composed when she was 23 dated february 14 1846 thumb right virginia s handwritten valentine poem to her husband osgood ellet scandal right thumb frances sargent osgood of many tongues in virginia s valentine poem was a reference to actual incidents moss 214 in 1845 poe had begun a flirtation with frances sargent osgood a married 34 year old poet silverman 280 virginia was aware of friendship and might even have encouraged it meyers 190 she often invited osgood to visit them at home believing that older woman had a restraining effect on poe who had made a promise to give up use of stimulants and was never drunk in osgood s presence silverman 287 at same time another poet elizabeth f ellet became enamored of poe and jealous of osgood though in a letter to sarah helen whitman poe called her love for him loathsome and wrote that he could do nothing but repel it with scorn he printed many of her poems to him in broadway journal while he was its editor moss 212 ellet was known for being meddlesome and vindictive silverman 288 and while visiting poe household in late january 1846 she saw one of osgood s personal letters to poe meyers 191 according to ellet virginia pointed out fearful paragraphs in osgood s letter moss 213 ellet contacted osgood and suggested she should beware of her indiscretions and asked poe to return her letters motivated either by jealousy or by a desire to cause scandal osgood then sent margaret fuller and anne lynch botta to ask poe on her behalf to return letters angered by their interference poe called them busy bodies and said that ellet had better look after her own letters suggesting indiscretion on her part silverman 290 he then gathered up these letters from ellet and left them at her house though these letters had already been returned to her ellet asked her brother to demand of me letters her brother colonel william lummis did not believe that poe had already returned them and threatened to kill him in order to defend himself poe requested a pistol from thomas dunn english english poe s friend and a minor writer who was also a trained doctor and lawyer likewise did not believe that poe had already returned letters and even questioned their existence easiest way out of predicament he said was a retraction of unfounded charges moss 220 angered at being called a liar poe pushed english into a fistfight poe later claimed he was triumphant in fight though english claimed otherwise and poe s face was badly cut by one of english s rings in poe s version he said i gave e a flogging which he will remember to day of his death either way fight further sparked gossip over osgood affair silverman 291 osgood s husband stepped in and threatened to sue ellet unless she formally apologized for her insinuations she retracted her statements in a letter to osgood saying letter shown me by mrs poe must have been a forgery created by poe himself moss 215 she put all blame on poe suggesting incident was because poe was intemperate and subject to acts of lunacy silverman

with her husband virginia however had been very affected by whole affair she had received anonymous letters about her husband s alleged indiscretions as early as july 1845 it is presumed that ellet was involved with these letters and they so disturbed virginia that she allegedly declared on her deathbed that mrs e had been her murderer moss 213 214 illness by this time virginia had developed consumption first seen sometime in middle of january 1842 while singing and playing piano virginia began to bleed from mouth though poe said she merely ruptured a blood vessel silverman 179 her health declined and she became an invalid which drove poe into a deep depression especially as she occasionally showed signs of improvement in a letter to a friend poe described his resulting mental state each time i felt all agonies of her death and at each accession of disorder i loved her more dearly clung to her life with more desperate pertinacity but i am constitutionally sensitive nervous in a very unusual degree i became insane with long intervals of horrible sanity meyers 208 virginia s condition might have been what prompted poe family to move in hopes of finding a healthier environment for her they moved several times within philadelphia in early 1840s and their last home in that city is now preserved as edgar allan poe national historic site in spring garden silverman 183 in this home virginia was well enough to tend flower 385 and entertain visitors by playing harp or piano and singing oberholtzer 287 family then moved to new york sometime in early april 1844 traveling by train and steamboat virginia waited on board ship while her husband secured space at a boarding house on greenwich street silverman 219 220 by early 1846 family friend elizabeth oakes smith said that

newspapers picked up on story great god said one is it possible that literary people of union will let poor poe perish by starvation and lean faced in new york for so we are led to believe from frequent notices in papers stating that poe and his wife are both down upon a bed of misery death and disease with not a ducat in world saturday evening post asserted that virginia was in a hopeless condition and that poe was bereft it is said that edgar a poe is lying dangerously with brain fever and that his wife is in last stages of consumption they are without money and without friends even editor hiram fuller whom poe had previously sued for libel attempted in new york mirror to garner support for poe and his wife we whom he has quarrelled with will take lead he wrote virginia was described as having dark hair and violet eyes with skin so pale it was called pure white krutch 55 56 causing a bad complexion that spoiled her looks one visitor to poe family noted that rose tint upon her cheek was too bright possibly a symptom of her illness silverman 182 another visitor in fordham wrote mrs poe looked very young she had large black eyes and a pearly whiteness of complexion which was a perfect pallor her pale face her brilliant eyes and her raven hair gave her an unearthly look meyers 204 that unearthly look was mentioned by others who suggested it made her look not quite human krutch 56 william gowans who once lodged with family described virginia as a woman of matchless beauty and loveliness her eye could match that of any and her face defy genius of a canova

reburials was also present at rites which brought his body to rest with virginia and virginia s mother maria clemm effect and influence on poe virginia s death had a significant effect on poe after her death poe was deeply saddened for several months a friend said of him loss of his wife was a sad blow to him he did not seem to care after she was gone whether he lived an hour a day a week or a year she was his all meyers 207 a year after her death he wrote to a friend that he had experienced greatest evil a man can suffer when he said a wife whom i loved as no man ever loved before had fallen ill while virginia was still struggling to recover poe turned to alcohol after abstaining for quite some time how often and how much he drank is a controversial issue debated in poe s lifetime and also by modern biographers poe referred to his emotional response to his wife s sickness as his own illness and that he found cure to it in death of my wife this i can do endure as becomes a man it was horrible never ending oscillation between hope despair which i could not longer have endured without total loss of reason moss 233 poe regularly visited virginia s grave as his friend charles

poe courted several other women including nancy richmond of lowell massachusetts sarah helen whitman of providence rhode island and childhood sweetheart sarah elmira royster in richmond even so frances sargent osgood whom poe also attempted to woo believed that virginia was only woman whom he ever loved krutch 57 references in literature many of poe s works are interpreted autobiographically with much of his work believed to reflect virginia s long struggle with tuberculosis and her eventual death most discussed example is annabel lee this poem which depicts a dead young bride and her mourning lover is often assumed to have been inspired by virginia though other women in poe s life are potential candidates including frances sargent osgoodmeyers 244 and sarah helen whitman sova 12 a similar poem is also believed to be a memorial tribute to virginia meyers 211 as is lenore whose title character is described as most lovely dead that ever died so young silverman 202 after poe s death george of london based critic said poe was responsible for his wife s death hurrying her to a premature grave that he might write annabel lee and raven campbell killis poe griswold controversy

illness sova 78 it was shortly thereafter that couple moved to new york city by boat and poe published oblong box 1844 this story which shows a man mourning his young wife while transporting her corpse by boat seems to suggest poe s feelings about virginia s impending death as ship sinks husband would rather die than be separated from his wife s corpse silverman 228 229 short story ligeia whose title character suffers a slow and lingering death may also be inspired by virginia hoffman 255 256 after his wife s death poe edited his first published story metzengerstein to remove narrator
