middle east theatre east africa burma and elsewhere territory s most important contribution to war is commonly held to be its contribution to empire air training scheme eats under which 8 235 british commonwealth and allied airmen were trained in southern rhodesian flight schools colony s operational casualties numbered 916 killed and 483 wounded of all races southern rhodesia had no diplomatic powers but largely oversaw its own contributions of manpower and materiel to war effort being responsible for its own defence rhodesian officers and soldiers were distributed in small groups throughout british and south african forces in an attempt to prevent high losses most of colony s men served in britain east africa and mediterranean particularly at first a more broad dispersal occurred from late 1942 rhodesian servicemen in operational areas were mostly from country s white minority with rhodesian african rifles made up of black troops and white officers providing main exception in burma from late 1944 other non white soldiers and white servicewomen served in east africa and on home front within southern rhodesia tens of thousands of black men were conscripted from rural communities for work first on aerodromes and later on white owned farms world war ii prompted major changes in southern rhodesia s financial and military policy and accelerated process of industrialisation territory s participation in eats brought about major economic and infrastructural developments and led to post war immigration of many former airmen contributing to growth of white population to over double its pre war size by 1951 war remained prominent in national consciousness for decades afterwards since country s reconstitution as zimbabwe in 1980 modern government has removed many references to world wars such as memorial monuments and plaques from public view regarding them as unwelcome vestiges of white minority rule and colonialism southern rhodesia s dead of war today have no official commemoration either in zimbabwe or overseas background thumb southern rhodesia in red other commonwealth territories in pink when world war ii broke out in 1939 southern african territory of southern rhodesia had been a self governing colony of united kingdom for 16 years having gained responsible government in 1923 it was unique in british empire and commonwealth in that it held extensive autonomous powers including defence but not foreign affairs while lacking dominion status in practice it acted as a quasi dominion and was treated as such in many ways by rest of commonwealth southern rhodesia s white population in 1939 was 67 000 a minority of about 5 black population was a little over a million and there were about 10 000 residents of coloured mixed or indian ethnicity franchise was non racial and in theory open to all contingent on meeting financial and educational qualifications but in practice very few black citizens were on electoral roll colony s prime minister was godfrey huggins a physician and veteran of world war i 1914 18 who had emigrated to rhodesia from england in 1911 and held office since 1933 territory s contribution to british cause during world war i had been very large in proportion to its white population though troops had been mostly raised from scratch as there had been no professional standing army beforehand since start of self government in 1923 colony had organised all white rhodesia regiment into a permanent defence force complemented locally by partly paramilitary british south africa police bsap rhodesia regiment comprised about 3 000 men including reserves in 1938 country had fielded black troops during world war i but since then had retained them only within bsap a nucleus of airmen existed in form of southern rhodesian air force sraf which in august 1939 comprised one squadron of 10 pilots and eight hawker hardy aircraft based at belvedere airport near salisbury occupation of czechoslovakia by nazi germany in march 1939 convinced huggins that war was imminent seeking to renew his government s mandate to pass emergency measures he called an early election in which his united party won an increased majority huggins rearranged his cabinet on a war footing making minister of justice robert tredgold minister of defence as well territory proposed forces not only for internal security but also for defence of british interests overseas self contained rhodesian formations were planned including a mechanised reconnaissance unit but tredgold opposed this remembering catastrophic casualties suffered by units such as royal newfoundland regiment and 1st south african infantry brigade on western front in world war i he argued that one or two heavy defeats for a white southern rhodesian brigade might cause crippling losses and have irrevocable effects on country as a whole he proposed to instead concentrate on training white rhodesians for leadership roles and specialist units and to disperse colony s men across forces in small groups these ideas met with approval in both salisbury and london and were adopted southern rhodesia would be automatically included in any british declaration of war due to its lack of diplomatic powers but that did not stop colonial government from attempting to demonstrate its loyalty and legislative independence through supportive parliamentary motions and gestures southern rhodesian parliament unanimously moved to support britain in event of war during a special sitting on 28 august 1939 outbreak of war when britain declared war on germany on 3 september 1939 following invasion of poland southern rhodesia issued its own declaration of war almost immediately before any of dominions did huggins backed full military mobilisation and a war to finish telling parliament that conflict was one of national survival for southern rhodesia as well as for britain mother country s defeat would leave little hope for colony in post war world he said this stand was almost unanimously supported by white populace as well as most of coloured community though with world war i a recent memory this was more out of a sense of patriotic duty than enthusiasm for war in itself majority of black population paid little attention to outbreak of war british had expected italy with its african possessions to join war on germany s side as soon as it began but fortunately for allies this did not immediately occur no 1 squadron sraf was already in northern kenya having been posted to italian east african frontier at britain s request in late august first southern rhodesian ground forces to be deployed abroad during world war ii were 50 territorial troops under captain t g standing who were posted to nyasaland in september at request of colonial authorities there to guard against a possible uprising by german expatriates they returned home after a month having seen little action white rhodesian officers and non commissioned officers left colony in september and october 1939 to command units of black africans in west and east of continent with most joining royal west african frontier force rwaff in colony of nigeria gold coast and neighbouring colonies deployment of white rhodesian officers and ncos to command black troops from elsewhere in africa met with favour from military leadership and became very prevalent as in world war i white rhodesians volunteered for forces readily and in large numbers over 2 700 had come forward before war was three weeks old somewhat ironically southern rhodesian recruiters main problem was not sourcing manpower but rather persuading men in strategically important occupations such as mining to stay home manpower controls were introduced to keep certain men in their civilian jobs sraf accepted 500 recruits in days following outbreak of war prompting its commander group captain charles meredith to contact air ministry in london with an offer to run a flying school and train three squadrons this was accepted in january 1940 southern rhodesian government announced establishment of an independent air ministry to oversee rhodesian air training group southern rhodesia s contribution to empire air training scheme eats huggins set up a defence committee within cabinet to co ordinate colony s war effort in early 1940 this body comprised prime minister finance minister jacob smit tredgold and lieutenant colonel ernest lucas guest minister of mines and public works who was put in charge of new air ministry about 1 600 of colony s whites were serving overseas

more appropriate partner in geographical logistical and cultural terms huggins feared that alternative joining british east africa command might detract from autonomous nature of southern rhodesia s

allied victory an assertion corroborated by robert blake in his 1977 history of rhodesia rhodesian air training group ratg under air vice marshal sir c w meredith eventually operated 11 aerodromes requiring a huge national effort to build maintain and staff at scheme s peak more than a fifth of white population was involved this judicious management of skills and resources allowed territory to make a much larger contribution to allied war effort than if it had simply sent all its manpower into field southern rhodesia was regarded as an ideal location for air training for a number of reasons it was far from hostilities firmly pro british and had excellent weather throughout year british air ministry resolved to training to colony amid some urgency in late 1939 after eats took a long time to get going in canada ratg was last eats group to be formed but first to start training airmen it also turned out fully qualified pilots before any of others doing so for first time in november 1940 programme originally called only for an initial training wing and six schools but this was expanded to eight flying schools and a school for bomb aimers navigators and air gunners there were two air firing and bombing ranges six reserve landing grounds were constructed for landing and take off instruction to prevent congestion on main airstrips later in war a dedicated air station was designated for training of instructors small administrative units were established in south africa at cape town durban and port elizabeth to handle incoming equipment and arrivals and departures of personnel complete pilot s course initially lasted six months split into two months each of elementary intermediate and advanced instruction ground subjects were also taught and each trainee had to fly at least 150 hours to qualify by end of war each period had been shortened by a week to speed up output of trained pilots trainees were mostly british but came from all over world diversity of nationalities

guarded air bases and also provided manpower for non armed labour perceived possibility that japan might attempt an invasion of southern africa via madagascar led to consolidation of a few hundred rural whites into southern rhodesia commando a part time cadre intended as basis for a guerrilla style resistance movement from 1942 mobilisation of white british south africa police officers for military service led to black male and white female constables taking on higher responsibilities bsap recruited more black patrolmen to accommodate growth of urban black population during war going from 1 067 black and 547 white personnel in 1937 to 1 572 blacks and 401 whites in 1945 this africanisation led to higher appreciation for black constables among senior policemen and public police

services began in june 1941 most volunteers were married women many of them wives of military men air and military services both offered a wide variety of positions in addition to jobs as typists clerks caterers and like women served as drivers and in stores and workshops many of women in air service did skilled work checking flying instruments testing parts and doing minor repairs women of auxiliary police service served as bsap officers both in stations and on streets members of southern rhodesia s white female population who did not join forces still contributed to war in various ways women worked in munitions factories and engineering workshops in salisbury and bulawayo women s national service league which thousands of women joined before war even started revived role white rhodesian women had played in world war i sending colony s servicemen overseas parcels containing warm clothes newspapers razor blades soap food and minor luxuries such as sweets tobacco and novels efforts such as these did much to keep troops morale up domestic politics on outbreak of war huggins invited leader of opposition labour party harry davies to join a coalition government davies accepted without consulting his party caucus much to indignation of many of his contemporaries labour promptly split two labour factions reconciled in 1943 and briefly threatened huggins s premiership until a heated dispute over whether labour should become multiracial led to party s disintegration in 1944 economic impact conscripted labour southern rhodesian economy grew considerably during war despite concurrent rise of war expenditure to pay for expansion of military and air training scheme expenditure on war grew from ps1 793 367 in financial year 1940 41 to ps5 334 701 in 1943 44 total southern rhodesian expenditure on air training scheme was ps11 215 522 these sums while tiny compared to those incurred by larger nations were enormous when scaled against white population of less than 70 000 that accounted for most of colony s economic output annual costs for air training scheme alone far exceeded pre war national budget southern rhodesia was then second largest gold producer in world after south africa colony s gold output had expanded greatly during 1930s and it remained territory s main source of income during war though many extracting operations were diverted towards strategic minerals most prominently chrome and asbestos southern rhodesia became one of two main sources of chrome for allies south africa was other and world s third largest producer of asbestos after canada and soviet union by end of war mines at shabani and were turning out 1 5 million tonnes of asbestos a year in addition to 600 000 tonnes of chrome gold output reached peak levels in 1941 42 and thereafter subsided southern rhodesia also exported tungsten mica and tin and provided coal for copper mines of northern rhodesia and congo southern rhodesian government encouraged private enterprise to form secondary industries to exploit colony s natural resources and increase production but also set up some state industries in an attempt to spark growth establishment of ratg prompted a minor economic boom and also caused primary direct demand placed on southern rhodesia s black population during early stages of war a programme of conscripted labour to build aerodromes government assigned labour quotas for each district to native commissioners across territory who in turn called on local chiefs and headmen to provide workers tribal leaders decided who was required at kraal and who would report to district native commissioner for work this system known locally as chibaro or according to charles van onselen synonymous etymologically with concepts ranging from contract labour to slavery had been relatively widespread during company rule 1890 1923 but had fallen out of use by 1930s some tribal communities were resettled to make room for airstrips chibaro workers received pay and provisions but salary of per month compared unfavourably with generally received on white owned farms it met with widespread opposition with many men electing to run away rather than join work parties hundreds if not thousands according to kenneth vickery crossed into bechuanaland or south africa to avoid call up some suspected that after finishing conscripted aerodrome work they might be drafted to fight overseas rumours to this effect abounded enough that chief native commissioner h h d simmonds distributed a circular in november 1940 instructing commissioners to make clear that drafted men were required for labour only voluntary employment increased sharply during 1940 and 1941 both among indigenous blacks and migrant labourers but many white farmers still complained about a lack of manpower a severe drought during 1941 42 season led to a food shortage in colony prompting passing in june 1942 of compulsory native labour act under which unemployed black males between 18 and 45 years of age could be conscripted for work on white owned farms announcing act tredgold by now minister of native affairs in addition to defence and justice commented that its principle would be intolerable under ordinary circumstances but that war made it necessary act required each draftee to work at least three months at per month pay rose to if he agreed to stay a further three months this conscription of labour contributed to rise in country s overall agricultural yield but had a negative impact on localised production of many kraals either because too many men had been drafted for work elsewhere or because they had fled to avoid it scheme continued until act s repeal in 1946 a central food production committee set up in early 1942 organised conscripted labourers and attempted to help white farmers to grow all crops they could maize production grew by 40 between 1942 and 1944 potato harvest doubled and onion crop grew sixfold by end of war production of colony s most important cash crop tobacco was high throughout war averaging about 40 million pounds 18 million kg annually number of cattle slaughtered by beef industry increased by 134 from 71 000 head in 1937 to 160 000 head in 1945 vegetable dehydration one of food production committee s main initiatives proved a great success allowing rhodesia to export many products to uk that would previously have

for co ordinating investigation into enemy aliens in central africa to southern rhodesian government which set up a system whereby criminal investigation department cid identified potential detainees while a body called internment camps corps oversaw camps many of those held in southern rhodesia were sent there by britain or authorities elsewhere in empire five internment camps were set up in two waves no 1 general internment camp opened to north east of salisbury in october 1939 and no 2 tanganyika internment camp just south of city opened following year mostly housing germans formerly resident in tanganyika first two camps together had less than 800 inmates third fourth and fifth camps were set up near gatooma umvuma and fort victoria in 1941 42 to accommodate roughly 5 000 italians from somaliland and abyssinia internment camps corps reliance on elderly infirm and so called friendly aliens to staff three new camps led to indiscipline poor living conditions and dozens of escapes a 1943 government commission into quality of internment camps reported second wave camps to be of far worse quality than those of first wave polish refugees were housed at dedicated settlements set up at marandellas and two towns about apart to south east of salisbury from 1943 there were similar camps in kenya nyasaland tanganyika northern rhodesia and south africa polish settlements in southern rhodesia were run jointly by local authorities and polish consulate in salisbury polish government in exile in london provided funding transport back to europe picked up sharply as war came to a close and by october 1945 less than 2 000 polish refugees remained colonial officials were reluctant to let poles stay indefinitely asserting that they were not culturally british enough and might have communist connections or sympathies but most of those who remained showed little inclination to leave southern rhodesia ultimately allowed around 726 polish refugees to
