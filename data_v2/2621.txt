after winning battles to synthesize rooms properties of each room including quality of items and strength of enemies are determined by map cards player chooses each card has a specific effect red cards affect number and type of enemies green cards affect power of player s deck and blue cards affect properties of room itself such as allowing treasure chests or a save point to appear game features three modes of gameplay first two are story modes that feature either sora or riku and third is a two player battle mode initially only sora s story mode is available once completed reverse rebirth mode becomes available reverse rebirth allows player to play a second story mode featuring riku and a link mode where players can battle each other via a game link cable combat combat uses a card based battle system executed in real time player can jump and maneuver around battle screen as they would on field map but all physical attacks magic items and summonings are activated by playing cards cards are ranked from zero to nine and are used for making attack combos or breaking enemy cards with exception of zero ranked cards which are more expensive in terms of card points cp compared to other cards of same type and have other ranks more cp are required to place higher ranked cards in player s deck card points increased through level up limit number of cards player can use in a deck cards with rank zero can break any opposing card or combo if played after opposing card or combo but they can be broken by any card or combo as well if it is played after zero card is played breaking an opposing card will cancel that attack and stun loser of a card break for a short time special enemy cards may be obtained by defeating enemies and bosses and are used to give player a temporary ability ranging from enhanced offensive and defensive capabilities to modifying attributes of certain cards combining cards in sets of three will create combo attacks that are usually more difficult to break because rank of combo will be sum of ranks of three cards in combo certain card combinations will create a sleight a special combination that will create a powerful physical attack magical spell or summon attack when player runs out of cards deck must be reloaded additionally using a card combination will cause first card in combo to become unusable until end of combat sora s and riku s stories differ gameplay wise in several ways in sora s story sora obtains cards by defeating enemies or through moogle shops in some cases sora must earn specific card first through a plot event before it becomes available sora can create and store three different decks in pause menu unlike sora riku has a closed deck that cannot be customized cards in his deck change depending on world in which he is traveling riku is limited to mainly physical attacks enemy cards and mickey mouse ally cards he can activate dark mode and unlock his sleight attacks if he accumulates enough dark points dark points are earned by breaking enemy cards and combos and difference between riku s card or combo and enemy s card or combo is how many dark points he will accumulate for that card break

develop ideas for second kingdom hearts game which he had intended to be set a year after original originally titled kingdom hearts lost memories nomura changed name to match overall outline of story while still reflecting theme of memories chain of memories was developed to bridge gap between kingdom hearts and kingdom hearts ii like most sequels kingdom hearts ii was planned to have character start from beginning ability wise to explain loss of abilities gained in previous game nomura had story revolve around sora s memories getting corrupted and implemented card battle system to symbolize sora s various memories nomura was hesitant about releasing a kingdom hearts title on game boy advance feeling that 3d graphics of original game would not translate well into 2d nomura changed his position after hearing that children wanted to play kingdom hearts on gba after exploring ideas for gameplay he felt that a 2d kingdom hearts game would be possible and that it could still feel like and play like what gamers were used to in original meanwhile nomura wanted to give game a lighter tone than playstation2 games chain of memories was announced along with kingdom hearts ii at tokyo game show in september 2003 initial details included switch to 2d graphics use of cards to perform attacks and that compressed movies would be utilized in some cut scenes cut scene animations were rendered using graphical engine of playstation2 iteration and then encoded for game boy advance by using a technology developed by japanese company am3 to help market game disney and square enix launched official japanese websites a playable demo was first made available to public at 2003 jump festa in japan this demo and subsequent demos highlighted card based combat system aside from information gathered from opening sequences most details regarding story were kept secret until release card based gameplay of chain of memories would later serve to inspire gameplay of jupiter s next
