7 3 10 based on 23 reviews from critics leia calderon of comic book resources cbr gave it four out of five stars writing overall bendis and coipel s civil war ii 0 serves sole purpose of laying out foundation for series despite being driven almost entirely by dialogue it s never once boring and only real issue is question on everyone s minds where is iron man jesse schedeen of ign gave it an 8 3 out of 10 saying between lackluster special and marvel s general track record with major crossovers there s plenty of reason to worry about civil war ii but good news is that this prologue issue makes a strong case for upcoming event it clearly lays out brewing conflict and makes a strong case for both viewpoints david pepose of newsarama gave it an 8 out of 10 and said minor flaws in premise aside bendis and coipel deliver some surprisingly charming work with civil war ii 0 which at least thus far doesn t feel like shameless cash in that you might expect from this summer event sequel issue 1 received an average score of 7 3 10 based on 26 reviews from critics on comic book roundup greg mcelhatton of cbr gave it four stars writing overall civil war ii 1 is a good launching point for this miniseries even as it integrates information from civil war ii 0 and free comic book day special i m curious to see if bendis and marquez can maintain this level of tension and what they ll add into mix to keep conflict burning strong for now though it s more than enough to get readers coming back for more schedeen gave it a 7 1 saying this first issue cleanly establishes conflict and delivers a nonstop stream of gorgeous artwork however it offers few surprises for those not already familiar with basics of this crossover and it often fails to elicit a strong emotional response in way first issue of civil war did ten years ago richard gray of newsarama gave it a 7 and said at this early stage civil war ii suffers some of problems that have beleaguered similar narratives in recent years principally in seeing heroes all too quick to take sides against comrades on a possible future yet this is also just beginning of something much larger and while it may seem at times like this is an extended version of zero issue that preceded it all pieces are now in place for war proper to commence issue 2 received an average score of 6 0 10 based on 26 reviews from critics on comic book roundup schedeen gave it a 6 5 saying given that this is technically fourth civil war ii comic bendis has written now it s disappointing that story is still in such a nascent stage this isn t a civil war so much as everybody is mad at tony stark tony s characterization is sound and visuals in this book are downright fantastic but those qualities aren t enough to give this civil war sequel spark it needs pepose gave it a 3 and said right now there s none of thematic or dramatic weight of original civil war in this sequel which is quickly burning off initial goodwill from its zero issue and its free comic book day special issue 3 received an average score of 6 3 10 based on 23 reviews from critics on comic book roundup schedeen gave it a 5 1 saying civil war ii looks every bit as good as you d expect from marvel s flagship event comic unfortunately this series doesn t have nearly enough to offer beneath that gorgeous exterior there s too much dialogue and exposition and not enough progress or dramatic weight to story pepose gave it a 6 and said civil war ii 3 is a decent chapter of an event story that feels like plenty of other event stories but as far as memorials go it s unfortunately pretty forgettable fare issue 4 received an average score of 5 7 10 based on 20 reviews from critics on comic book roundup schedeen gave it a 7 3 saying civil war ii 4 picks up pace and boasts more stunning art but characterization remains flawed pepose gave it a 3 and said i want to like this series i want to like this story but we re already halfway through this series and civil war ii has barely even shown up issue 5 received an average score of 5 7 10 based on 19 reviews from critics on comic book roundup schedeen gave it a 4 4 saying this issue on an extended superhero brawl that lacks dramatic weight or even narrative logic before transitioning into a very disappointing twist that threatens to derail series for good pepose gave it an 8 and said while it appears that superhero fisticuffs might be taking yet a breather sic after this chapter it s hard to deny sheer fun civil war ii 5 has to offer issue 6 received an average score of 5 8 10 based on 17 reviews from critics on comic book roundup schedeen gave it a 6 3 saying civil war ii has had trouble building momentum from beginning and this issue does nothing to address that problem there are some strong emotional moments here and plenty of stunning artwork from marquez and ponsor but sluggish pace and generally listless nature of conflict continue to frustrate pepose gave it a 3 and said we have two issues left on this series and judging by cliffhanger it might mean something but at this point civil war ii has largely been about circling a conflict rather than diving into it head on leaving this event book about as unsatisfying as it gets issue 7 received an average score of 6 3 10 based on 15 reviews from critics on comic book roundup schedeen gave it a 7 8 saying issue 7 is easily one of stronger chapters of civil war ii that doesn t say a great deal at this point but it is still nice to see bendis focusing on a smaller more intimate cast here pepose gave it a 6 and said with only one issue left to go civil war ii remains a disappointing chapter for house of ideas even this series biggest moments feel calculated rather than organic trying to goose sales with a handful of character deaths without really digging in too deeply about underlying issues underneath issue 8 received an average score of 5 0 10 based on 20 reviews from critics on comic book roundup schedeen gave it a 5 3 saying civil war ii ends with what is easily one of weakest chapters of entire crossover this issue is anticlimactic and fails to wring much emotion from final battle between captain marvel and iron man justin partridge of newsarama gave it a 3 and said to summarize civil war ii 8 was basically an episode of whose line is it anyway everything was made up and stakes didn t matter brian michael bendis who has delivered some fantastic events in his long career limps across finish line in this eighth issue employing a hefty bit of deus ex cosmic power of universe for what can only be described as opposite of a game changer war ii 0 sold an estimated 177 283 copies in may 2016 making it second best selling comic of month behind dc universe rebirth 1 strong orders for issue led marvel to
