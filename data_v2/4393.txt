chilembwe uprising was a rebellion against british colonial rule in nyasaland modern day malawi in january 1915 it was led by john chilembwe an american educated baptist minister influenced by millenarian christianity based around his church in village of mbombwe in south east of country revolt was centred on black middle class and encouraged by grievances against colonial system including forced labour discrimination and new demands on indigenous population caused by outbreak of world war i revolt broke out in evening of 23 january 1915 when rebels incited by chilembwe attacked a l bruce plantation s headquarters at magomero and killed three white colonists and a largely unsuccessful attack on a weapons store in blantyre followed during night by morning of 24 january colonial authorities had mobilised white settler militia and redeployed regular military forces south after a failed attack on mbombwe by troops of king s african rifles kar on 25 january a group of rebels attacked a christian mission at nguludi and burned it down kar and militia took mbombwe without encountering resistance on 26 january after many of rebels including chilembwe fled hoping to reach safety in neighbouring portuguese east africa modern mozambique about 40 rebels were executed in revolt s aftermath and 300 were imprisoned chilembwe was shot dead by a police patrol near border on 3 february although rebellion did not itself achieve lasting success it is commonly cited as a watershed moment in nyasaland history rebellion had lasting effects on british system of administration in nyasaland and some reform was enacted in its aftermath after world war ii growing malawian nationalist movement reignited interest in chilembwe revolt and after independence of malawi in 1964 it became celebrated as a key moment in nation s history chilembwe s memory which remains prominent in collective national consciousness has often been invoked in symbolism and rhetoric by malawian politicians today uprising is celebrated annually and chilembwe himself is considered a national hero background thumb nyasaland modern day malawi highlighted in dark red on a map of pre world war i africa british colonial rule in region of modern day malawi where revolt occurred began between 1899 and 1900 when british sought to increase their formal control over territory to preempt encroachment by german or portuguese colonial empires region became a british protectorate in 1891 as british central africa and in 1907 was named nyasaland unlike many other parts of africa where british rule was dependent on support of local factions in nyasaland british control rested on military superiority during 1890s colonial authorities put down numerous rebellions by local yao ngoni and peoples british rule in nyasaland radically altered local indigenous power structures early colonial period saw some immigration and settlement by white colonists who bought large swathes of territory from local chiefs often for token payments in beads or guns most of land acquired particularly in shire highlands was converted into white owned plantations where tea coffee cotton and tobacco were grown enforcement of colonial institutions such as hut tax compelled many indigenous people to find paid work and demand for labour created by plantations led to their becoming a major employer once employed on plantations black workers found that they were frequently beaten and subject to racial discrimination increasingly plantations were also forced to rely on a system of forced labour or corvee known locally at thangata chilembwe and his church john chilembwe born locally in around 1871 received his early education at a church of scotland mission and later met joseph booth a radical baptist missionary who ran zambezi industrial mission booth preached a form of egalitarianism and his progressive attitude towards race attracted chilembwe s attention under booth s patronage chilembwe travelled to united states to study at a theological college in virginia there he mixed in african american circles and was influenced by stories of abolitionist john brown and booker t washington thumb left view of mbombwe with providence industrial mission in background chilembwe returned to nyasaland in 1900 and with assistance of african american national baptist convention he founded his independent church providence industrial mission in village of mbombwe he was considered a model of non violent african advancement by colonial authorities during mission s early years he established a chain of independent black african schools with over 900 pupils in total and founded natives industrial union a form of cooperative union that has been described as an embryo chamber of commerce nevertheless chilembwe s activities led to friction with managers of local alexander livingstone bruce plantation who feared chilembwe s influence over their workers in november 1913 employees of local a l bruce estates burnt down churches that chilembwe or his followers had built on estate land information about chilembwe s church before rebellion is scant but his ideology proved popular and he developed a strong local following for at least first 12 years of his ministry he preached ideas of african self respect and advancement through education hard work and personal

teaching and anti colonialism many of his followers came from local middle class who had similarly adopted european customs chilembwe s acceptance of european culture created an unorthodox anti colonial ideology based around a form of nationalism rather than a desire to restore pre colonial social order however after 1912 he became more radical and began to predict liberation of africans and

known as in democratic republic of congo but some of his followers may have been influenced by it leader of watch tower charles taze russell had predicted that armageddon would begin in october 1914

1914 by september 1914 war had spread to africa as british and belgians began a long military campaign against german colonial army in german east africa in nyasaland major effect of war was massive recruitment of africans to serve as porters in support of allied armies porters lived in extremely poor conditions which left them exposed to disease and mortality rates among them during campaigns were high at same time recruitment of porters created a shortage of labour which increased economic pressures on africans in nyasaland millenarians at time believed that world war i would be a form of armageddon which they believed would destroy colonial powers and pave way for emergence of independent african states chilembwe opposed recruitment of people to fight what he considered to be a war totally unconnected to them he promoted a form of christian pacifism and argued that lack of civil rights for africans in colonial system should exempt them from duties of military service in november 1914 following reports of large loss of life during fighting at karonga chilembwe wrote a letter to nyasaland times in blantyre explicitly appealing to colonial authorities not to recruit black troops preparations preparations for uprising had begun by end of 1914 exactly what chilembwe s objectives were remains unclear but some contemporaries believed that he planned to make himself king of nyasaland he soon acquired a military textbook and began to organise his followers and wider support in particular he formed close ties with filipo chinyama in ncheu to north west and received his assurance that he would also mobilise his followers to join rebellion when it broke out colonial authorities received two warnings that a revolt was imminent a disaffected follower of chilembwe reported preacher s worrying intentions to philip mitchell a colonial civil servant and future governor of uganda and kenya in august 1914 a catholic mission was also warned but neither took any action rebellion outbreak during night of saturday 23 24 january rebels met at mission church in mbombwe where chilembwe gave a speech stressing that none of them should expect to survive reprisals that would follow revolt but that uprising would draw greater attention to their conditions and destabilise colonial system this chilembwe believed was only way change would ever occur a contingent of rebels was sent to blantyre and limbe about to south where most of white colonists lived and where insurgents hoped to capture african lakes company s store of weapons another group headed towards alexander livingstone bruce plantation s headquarters at magomero chilembwe sent a messenger to ncheu to alert chinyama that rebellion was starting chilembwe also sought support for his uprising from german forces in german east africa on nyasaland s far northern border hoping that a german offensive from north combined with a native insurrection in south might force british out of nyasaland permanently on 24 january he sent a letter to german governor by courier through portuguese east africa courier was intercepted and letter was never received during latter stages of east african

colonial order attack on livingstone bruce plantation major action of chilembwe uprising involved an attack on bruce plantation at magomero plantation spanned about and grew both cotton and tobacco around 5 000 locals worked on it as part of their thangata obligations plantation had a reputation locally for poor treatment of its workers and for brutality of its managers who closed local schools beat their workers and paid them less than had been promised their burning of chilembwe s church in november 1913 created a personal animosity with rebel leadership insurgents launched two roughly concurrent attacks one group targeted magomero plantation headquarters and home of main manager william jervis livingstone and a few other white staff while a second assaulted plantation owned village of mwanje where there were two white households thumb left modern day view of a tea plantation at mlanje rebels moved into magomero in early evening while livingstone and his wife were entertaining some dinner guests estate official duncan maccormick was in another house nearby a third building occupied by emily stanton roach and five children contained a small cache of weapons and ammunition belonging to local rifle club insurgents quietly broke into livingstone s house and injured him during hand to hand fighting prompting him to take refuge in bedroom where his wife attempted to treat his wounds rebels forced their way into bedroom and after capturing his wife decapitated livingstone maccormick who had been alerted was killed by a rebel spear attackers took women and children of village prisoner but shortly released them unhurt having reportedly treated them well it has been suggested that chilembwe may have hoped to use women and children as hostages but this remains unclear attack on magomero and in particular killing of livingstone had great symbolic significance for chilembwe s men two mauser rifles captured from plantation formed basis of rebel armoury for rest of uprising mwanje had little military value but it has been proposed that rebels may have hoped to find weapons and ammunition there led by jonathan insurgents stormed one of houses and killed plantation s stock manager robert ferguson with a spear as he lay in bed reading a newspaper two of colonists john robertson and his wife charlotte escaped into cotton fields and walked to a neighbouring plantation to raise alarm one of robertsons african servants who remained loyal was killed by attackers later actions rebels cut zomba tete and blantyre telephone lines delaying spread of news african lakes company weapons store in blantyre was raided by a force of around 100 rebels at around 02 00 on 24 january before general alarm had been raised by news of magomero and mwanje

rebels was taken by david kaduya a former soldier in king s african rifles kar under kaduya s command rebels ambushed a small party of government soldiers near mbombwe on 24 january described as one reverse suffered by government during uprising by morning of 24 january government had levied nyasaland volunteer reserve a settler militia and redeployed 1st battalion kar from north of colony rebels did not mount any further attack any of many other isolated plantations in region they also did not occupy boma fort at chiradzulu just from mbombwe even though it was ungarrisoned at time rumours of rebel attacks spread but despite earlier offers of support there were no parallel uprisings elsewhere in nyasaland and promised reinforcements from ncheu did not materialise mlanje or zomba regions likewise refused to join uprising siege of mbombwe and attempted escape thumb view of providence industrial mission shortly after its destruction by government troops troops of kar launched a tentative attack on mbombwe on 25 january but engagement proved inconclusive chilembwe s forces held a strong defensive position along mbombwe river and could not be pushed back two african government soldiers were killed and three were wounded chilembwe s losses have been estimated as about 20 on 26 january a group of rebels attacked a catholic mission at nguludi belonging to father swelsen mission was defended by four african armed guards one of whom was killed father swelsen was also wounded in fighting and church was burnt down military and militia forces assaulted mbombwe again same day but encountered no resistance many rebels including chilembwe had fled village disguised as civilians mbombwe s fall and government troops subsequent demolition of chilembwe s church with dynamite ended rebellion kaduya was captured and brought back to magomero where he was publicly executed after defeat of rebellion most of remaining insurgents attempted to escape eastwards across shire highlands towards portuguese east africa from where they hoped to head north to german territory chilembwe was seen by a patrol of nyasaland police and shot dead on 3 february near mlanje many other rebels were captured 300 were imprisoned following rebellion and 40 were executed around 30 rebels evaded capture and settled in portuguese territory near nyasaland border aftermath colonial authorities responded quickly to uprising with as much force and as many troops police and settler volunteers it could muster to hunt down and kill suspected rebels there was no official death toll but perhaps 50 of chilembwe s followers were killed in fighting when trying to escape after or summarily executed s hynde 2010 extreme penalty of law mercy and death penalty as aspects of state power

african population including mass hut burnings all weapons were confiscated and fines of 4 shillings per person were levied in districts affected by revolt regardless of whether people in question had been involved as part of repression a series of courts were hastily convened which passed death sentences on forty six men for offences of murder and high treason and 300 others were given prison sentences thirty six were executed and to increase deterrent effect some of ringleaders were hanged in public on a main road close to magomero estate where europeans had been killed d d phiri 1999 let

and although anglican missions those of scottish churches and catholic missions were not affected it banned many smaller often american originated churches including churches of christ and watchtower society from nyasaland and placed restrictions on other african run churches public gatherings especially those associated with african initiated religious groups were banned until 1919 fear of similar uprisings in other colonies notably northern rhodesia also led to similar repression of independent churches and foreign missions beyond nyasaland though rebellion failed threat to colonial rule posed by chilembwe revolt compelled local authorities to introduce some reform colonial government proposed to undermine power of independent churches like chilembwe s by promoting secular education but lack of funding made this impossible government began to promote tribal loyalties in colony through system of indirect rule which was expanded after revolt in particular muslim yao people who attempted to distance themselves from chilembwe were given more power and autonomy although delayed by war nyasaland police which had been primarily composed of african askaris levied by local white officials was restructured as a professional force of white colonists forced labour was retained and would remain a resentment for decades afterwards commission of enquiry in aftermath of revolt colonial administration formed a commission of enquiry to examine causes and handling of rebellion commission which presented its conclusions in early 1916 found that revolt was chiefly caused by mismanagement of bruce plantation commission also blamed livingstone himself for treatment of natives that was often unduly harsh and for poor management of estate commission found that systematic discrimination lack of freedoms and respect were key causes of resentment among local population it also emphasised effect of booth s ideology on chilembwe commission s reforms were not far reaching though it criticised thangata system it made only minor changes aimed at ending casual brutality though government passed laws banning plantation owners from using services of their tenants as payment of rent in 1917 effectively abolishing thangata it was uniformly ignored a further commission in 1920 concluded that thangata could not be effectively abolished and it remained a constant source of friction into 1950s in later culture thumb upright hastings banda malawi s independence leader championed chilembwe s legacy in 1960s despite its failure chilembwe rebellion has since gained an important place in modern malawian cultural memory with chilembwe himself gaining iconic status uprising had local notoriety in years immediately after it and former rebels were kept under police observation over next three decades anti colonial activists idealised chilembwe and began to see him as a semi mythical figure nyasaland african congress nac of 1940s and 1950s used him as a symbolic figurehead partly because its president james chinyama had a family connection to filipo chinyama who had been believed to be an ally of chilembwe s when nac announced that it intended to mark 15 february annually as chilembwe day colonial officials were scandalised one wrote that to venerate memory of fanatic and blood thirsty chilembwe seems to us to be nothing less than a confession of violent intention d d phiri a malawian historian characterised chilembwe s uprising as an early expression of malawian nationalism as did george shepperson and thomas price in their 1958 book independent african an exhaustive study of chilembwe and his rebellion that was banned during colonial era but still widely read by educated classes chilembwe became viewed as an unproblematic hero by many of country s people malawi congress party mcp which ultimately led country to independence in 1964 made a conscious effort to identify its leader hastings banda with chilembwe through speeches and radio broadcasts bakili muluzi who succeeded banda in 1994 similarly invoked chilembwe s memory to win popular support inaugurating a new annual national holiday chilembwe day on 16 january 1995 chilembwe s portrait was soon added to national currency kwacha and reproduced on malawian stamps it has been argued that for malawian politicians chilembwe has become symbol legitimising myth instrument and propaganda historical analysis revolt has been subject of much research and has been interpreted in various ways by historians at time uprising was generally considered to mark a turning point in colonial rule governor of nyasaland george smith declared that revolt marked a new phase in existence of nyasaland according to military historian hew strachan chilembwe uprising tarnished british prestige in east africa which contributed after appointment of future prime minister bonar law as secretary of state for colonies to renewed pressure for an anglo belgian offensive against german east africa chilembwe s aims have also come under scrutiny according to robert i rotberg chilembwe s speech of 23 january appeared to stress importance and inevitability of martyrdom as a principal motivation same speech depicted uprising as a manifestation of desperation but because of his desire to strike a blow and die he did not have any idea of what he would replace colonialism with if revolt succeeded rotberg concludes that chilembwe planned to seize power in shire highlands or perhaps in all of nyasaland john mccracken attacks idea that revolt could be considered nationalist arguing that chilembwe s ideology was instead fundamentally utopian and created in opposition to localised abuses of colonial system particularly thangata according to mccracken uprising failed because chilembwe was over reliant on a small europeanised petite bourgeoisie and did not gain enough mass support rotberg s examination chilembwe revolt from a psychoanalytical perspective concludes that chilembwe s personal situation his psychosomatic asthma and financial debt may have been contributory factors in his decision to plot rebellion see also rebellion a 1915 uprising
