weinreb nahm ketone synthesis is a chemical reaction used in organic chemistry to make carbon carbon bonds it was discovered in 1981 by steven m weinreb and steven nahm as a method to synthesize ketones original reaction involved two subsequent nucleophilic acyl substitutions conversion of an acid chloride with n o dimethylhydroxylamine to form a weinreb nahm amide and subsequent treatment of this species with an organometallic reagent such as a grignard reagent or organolithium reagent nahm and weinreb also reported synthesis of aldehydes by reduction of amide with an excess of lithium aluminum hydride see amide reduction center 500px weinreb nahm ketone synthesis major advantage of this method over addition of organometallic reagents to more typical acyl compounds is that it avoids common problem of over addition for these latter reactions two equivalents of incoming group add to form an alcohol rather than a ketone or aldehyde this occurs even if equivalents of nucleophile are closely controlled center 400px of nucleophiles weinreb nahm amide has since been adopted into regular use by organic chemists as a dependable method for synthesis of ketones these functional groups are present in a large number of natural products and can be reliably reacted to form new carbon carbon bonds or converted into other functional groups this method has been used in a number of syntheses including macrosphelides a and b j and spirofungins a and b see scope below mechanism weinreb and nahm originally proposed following reaction mechanism to explain selectivity shown in reactions of weinreb nahm amide their suggestion was that tetrahedral intermediate a below formed as a result of nucleophilic acyl substitution by organometallic reagent is stabilized by chelation from methoxy group as shown this intermediate is stable only at low temperatures requiring a low temperature quench center 460px chelation mechanism this chelation is in contrast to mechanism for formation of over addition product wherein collapse of tetrahedral intermediate allows a second addition mechanistic conjecture on part of weinreb was immediately accepted by academic community but it was not until 2006 that it was confirmed by spectroscopic and kinetic analyses preparation in addition to original procedure shown above which may have compatibility issues for sensitive substrates weinreb amides can be synthesized from a variety of acyl compounds vast majority of these procedures utilize commercially available salt n o dimethylhydroxylamine hydrochloride meo me nh hcl which is typically easier to handle than free amine treatment of an ester or lactone with or affords corresponding weinreb amide in good yields alternatively non nucleophilic grignard reagents such as magnesium chloride can be used to activate amine before addition of ester center 410px example of syntheses from esters and lactones a variety of peptide coupling reagents can also be used to prepare weinreb nahm amides from carboxylic acids various and triphenylphosphine based couplings have been reported specifically for this purpose center 460px example of syntheses from acids finally an aminocarbonylation reaction reported by stephen buchwald allows conversion of aryl halides directly into aryl weinreb nahm amides center 500px aminocarbonylation to form weinreb nahm amides scope standard conditions for weinreb nahm ketone synthesis are known to tolerate a wide variety of functional groups elsewhere in molecule including alpha halogen substitution n protected amino acids a b unsaturation silyl ethers various and lactones and phosphonate esters a wide variety of nucleophiles can be used in conjunction with amide and grignard reagents are most commonly employed examples involving aliphatic vinyl aryl and carbon nucleophiles have been reported however with highly basic or sterically hindered nucleophiles elimination of moiety to release formaldehyde can occur as a significant side reaction center 350px side reaction nonetheless weinreb nahm amide figures prominently into many syntheses serving as an important coupling partner for various fragments shown below are key steps involving weinreb amides in synthesis of several natural products including members of immunosuppressant family of macrosphelides and antibiotic family of spirofungins center 600px syntheses using weinreb nahm amide variations reaction of weinreb nahm amides with wittig reagents has been performed to avoid sometimes harsh conditions required for addition of hydride reagents or organometallic compounds this yields an n methyl n methoxy that converts to corresponding ketone or aldehyde upon hydrolytic workup center 350px reaction of weinreb nahm amides with wittig reagents additionally a one pot magnesium halogen exchange with subsequent arylation has been developed showcasing stability of weinreb nahm amide and providing an operationally simple method for synthesis of aryl ketones center one pot arylation reaction more unusual reagents with multiple weinreb nahm amide functional groups have been synthesized serving as co2 and a synthons center 500px synthons based on weinreb nahm amides finally stephen g davies of oxford has designed a chiral auxiliary that combines functionality of weinreb amide with that of myers auxiliary allowing diastereoselective alkylation followed by facile cleavage to corresponding aldehyde or ketone center 500px davies auxiliary with weinreb nahm like functionality see also n o dimethylhydroxylamine ketone synthesis
