isopoda is an order of crustaceans that includes woodlice and their relatives isopods live in sea in fresh water or on land all have rigid segmented exoskeletons two pairs of antennae seven pairs of jointed limbs on thorax and five pairs of branching appendages on abdomen that are used in respiration females brood their young in a pouch under their thorax isopods have various feeding methods some eat dead or decaying plant and animal matter others are grazers or filter feeders a few are predators and some are internal or external parasites mostly of fishes aquatic species mostly live on seabed or bottom of freshwater bodies of water but some taxa can swim for a short distance terrestrial forms move around by crawling and tend to be found in cool moist places some species are able to roll themselves into a ball as a defence mechanism or to conserve moisture there are over 10 000 species of isopod worldwide with around 4 500 species found in marine environments mostly on seabed 500 species in fresh water and another 5 000 species on land order is divided into eleven suborders fossil record of isopods dates back to carboniferous period in pennsylvanian epoch at least 300 million years ago when isopods lived in shallow seas name isopoda is derived from greek roots from meaning equal and from stem of meaning foot description thumb left woodlouse showing head with eyes and antennae carapace and relatively uniform limbs classified within arthropods isopods have a chitinous exoskeleton and jointed limbs isopods are typically flattened dorsoventrally broader than they are deep although many species deviate from this rule particularly parasitic forms and those living in deep sea or in ground water habitats their colour may vary from grey to white or in some cases red green or brown isopods vary in size ranging from some species of just 0 3 mm to deep sea bathynomus spp of nearly isopods lack an obvious carapace shell which is reduced to a cephalic shield covering only head this means that gill like structures which in other related groups are protected by carapace are instead found on specialised limbs on abdomen dorsal upper surface of animal is covered by a series of overlapping articulated plates which give protection while also providing flexibility isopod body plan consists of a head cephalon a thorax pereon with eight segments pereonites and an abdomen with six segments some of which may be fused head is fused with first segment of thorax to form cephalon there are two pairs of unbranched antennae first pair being vestigial in land dwelling species eyes are compound and and mouthparts include a pair of maxillipeds and a pair of mandibles jaws with palps segmented appendages with sensory functions and spine like movable appendages seven free segments of thorax each bear a pair of unbranched pereopods limbs in most species these are used for locomotion and are of much same size morphology and orientation giving order its name isopoda from greek equal foot in a few species front pair are modified into gnathopods with clawed gripping terminal segments pereopods are not used in respiration as are equivalent limbs in amphipods but coxae first segments are fused to tergites dorsal plates to form epimera side plates in mature females some or all of limbs have appendages known as oostegites which fold underneath thorax and form a brood chamber for eggs in males gonopores genital openings are on ventral surface of segment eight and in females they are in a similar position on segment six one or more of abdominal segments starting with sixth segment is fused to telson terminal section to form a rigid pleotelson first five abdominal segments each bear a pair of biramous branching in two pleopods lamellar structures which serve function of gas exchange and in aquatic species serve as gills and propulsion and last segment bears a pair of biramous uropods posterior limbs in males second pair of pleopods and sometimes also first are modified for use in transferring sperm endopods inner branches of pleopods are modified into structures with thin permeable cuticles flexible outer coverings which act as gills for gas exchange in some terrestrial isopods these resemble lungs diversity and classification upright thumb numbers of marine isopoda except asellota and crustacean symbionts in biogeographic regions thumb representative marine isopod forms isopods belong to larger group which are united by presence of a special chamber under thorax for brooding eggs they have a cosmopolitan distribution and over 10 000 species of isopod classified into 11 suborders have been described worldwide around 4 500 species are found in marine environments mostly on sea floor about 500 species are found in fresh water and another 5 000 species are terrestrial woodlice which form suborder oniscidea in deep sea members of suborder asellota predominate to near exclusion of all other isopods having undergone a large adaptive radiation in that environment largest isopod is in genus bathynomus and some large species are fished commercially for human food in mexico japan and hawaii some isopod groups have evolved a parasitic lifestyle particularly as external parasites of fish they can damage or kill their hosts and can cause significant economic loss to commercial fisheries in reef aquariums parasitic isopods can become a pest endangering fish and possibly injuring aquarium keeper some members of family suck blood of fish and others in family consume blood fins tail and flesh and can kill fish in process world marine freshwater and terrestrial isopod crustaceans database subdivides order into eleven suborders asellota suborder containing majority of freshwater isopod species found in both surface and subterranean waters along with some deepwater marine species a small suborder consisting of two marine species in family and one freshwater species in family which is found in subterranean locations cymothoida chiefly marine isopods with over 2 700 species members are mostly carnivorous or parasitic includes family gnathiidae juveniles of which are parasitic on fishes previously recognised suborder is included as two superfamilies within this suborder and cymothoida now includes part of formerly recognised suborder flabellifera mainly tropical isopods some of which are herbivorous microcerberidea tiny worm like isopods that live between particles on bed of freshwater and shallow marine habitats oniscidea semi terrestrial and terrestrial isopods fully adapted for life on land there are over 4 000 species of woodlice inhabiting forests mountains deserts and littoral zone a single marine species which warrants its own suborder because of its unique characteristics phreatoicidea small suborder of freshwater isopods resembling amphipods limited to south africa india australia and new zealand benthic isopods mostly from southern hemisphere with respiratory pleopods inside a branchial chamber this suborder now includes part of formerly recognised suborder flabellifera freshwater isopods in a relictual environment a large group of benthic marine isopods with respiratory pleopods inside a branchial chamber under abdomen evolutionary history isopods first appeared in fossil record during carboniferous period of paleozoic some 300 million years ago they were primitive short tailed members of suborder phreatoicidea at that time were marine organisms with a cosmopolitan distribution nowadays members of this formerly widespread suborder form relic populations in freshwater environments in south africa india and oceania greatest number of species being in tasmania other primitive short tailed suborders include asellota microcerberidea and terrestrial oniscidea short tailed isopods have a short pleotelson and terminal stylus like uropods and have a sedentary lifestyle on or under sediment on seabed long tailed isopods have a long pleotelson and broad lateral uropods which can be used in swimming they are much more active and can launch themselves off seabed and swim for short distances more advanced long tailed isopods are mostly endemic to southern hemisphere and may have radiated on ancient supercontinent of gondwana soon after it broke away from laurasia 200 million years ago short tailed forms may have been driven from shallow seas in which they lived by increased predatory pressure from marine fish their main predators development of long tailed forms may also have provided competition that helped force short tailed forms into refugia latter are now restricted to environments such as deep sea freshwater groundwater and dry land isopods in suborder asellota are by far most species rich group of deep sea isopods locomotion unlike amphipods marine and freshwater isopods are entirely benthic this gives them little chance to disperse to new regions and may explain why so many species are endemic to restricted ranges crawling is primary means of locomotion and some species bore into seabed ground or timber structures some members of flabellifera can swim to a limited extent and have their front three pairs of pleopods modified for this purpose with their respiratory structures limited to hind pleopods most terrestrial species are slow moving and conceal themselves under objects or hide in crevices or under bark semi terrestrial sea slaters spp can run rapidly on land and many terrestrial species can roll themselves into a ball when threatened a feature that has evolved independently in different groups and also in marine feeding and nutrition left thumb parasitising fish italy isopods have a simple gut which lacks a midgut section instead there are caeca connected to back of stomach in which absorption takes place food is sucked into esophagus a process enhanced in blood sucking parasitic species and passed by peristalsis into stomach where material is processed and filtered structure of stomach varies but in many species there is a dorsal groove into which indigestible material is channelled and a ventral part connected to caeca where intracellular digestion and absorption take place indigestible material passes on through hindgut and is eliminated through anus which is on pleotelson isopods are detritivores browsers carnivores including predators and scavengers parasites and filter feeders and may occupy one or more of these feeding niches only aquatic and marine species are known to be parasites or filter feeders some exhibit coprophagia and will also consume their own fecal pellets terrestrial species are in general herbivorous with woodlice feeding on moss bark algae fungi and decaying material in marine isopods that feed on wood cellulose is digested by enzymes secreted in caeca for example bores into wood and additionally feeds on mycelia of fungi attacking timber thus increasing nitrogen in its diet land based wood borers mostly house symbiotic bacteria in hindgut which aid in digesting cellulose there are numerous adaptations to this simple gut but these are mostly correlated with diet rather than by taxonomic group parasitic species are mostly external parasites of fish or crustaceans and feed on blood larvae of gnathiidae family and adult have piercing and sucking mouthparts and clawed limbs adapted for clinging onto their hosts in general isopod parasites have diverse lifestyles and include elegans found in gill chambers of crabs attached to abdomen of hermit crabs living inside barnacle balanus perforatus living inside ostracods and free living isopods living in gill chambers or on carapace of shrimps and crabs and causing a characteristic bulge which is even recognisable in some fossil crustaceans and living inside some species of crab and shrimp exigua is a parasite of spotted rose snapper guttatus in gulf of california it causes tongue of fish to atrophy and takes its place in what is believed to be first instance discovered of a parasite functionally replacing a host structure in animals reproduction and development in most species sexes are separate and there is little sexual dimorphism but a few species are hermaphroditic and some parasitic forms show large differences between sexes some are hermaphrodites starting life as males and later changing sex and some are reverse being hermaphrodites that are born female some males are sessile and live with a group of females males have a pair of penises which may be fused in some species sperm is transferred to female by modified second pleopod which receives it from penis and which is then inserted into a female gonopore sperm is stored in a special receptacle a swelling on oviduct close to gonopore fertilisation only takes place when eggs are shed soon after a moult at which time a connection is established between semen receptacle and oviduct eggs which may number up to several hundred are brooded by female in marsupium a chamber formed by flat plates known as oostegites under thorax this is filled with water even in terrestrial species eggs hatch as a post larval stage which resembles adult except for absence of last pair of pereopods lack of a swimming phase in life cycle is a limiting factor in isopod dispersal and may be responsible for high levels of endemism in order as adults isopods differ from other crustaceans in that moulting occurs in two stages known as biphasic moulting first they shed exoskeleton from posterior part of their body and later shed anterior part giant antarctic isopod antarcticus is an exception and moults in a single process terrestrial isopods majority of crustaceans are aquatic and isopods are one of few groups of which some members now live on land only other crustaceans which include a small number of terrestrial species are amphipods like and decapods crabs shrimp etc terrestrial isopods play an important role in many tropical and temperate ecosystems by aiding in decomposition of plant material through mechanical and chemical means and by enhancing activity of microbes macro detritivores including terrestrial isopods are absent from arctic and sub arctic regions but have potential to expand their range with increased temperatures in high latitudes woodlice suborder oniscidea are most successful group of terrestrial crustaceans and show various adaptations for life on land they are subject to evaporation especially from their ventral area and as they do not have a waxy cuticle they need to conserve water often living in a humid environment and sheltering under stones bark debris or leaf litter desert species are usually nocturnal spending day in a burrow and emerging at night moisture is obtained through food sources or by drinking and some species can form their paired appendages into a tube and funnel water from dewdrops onto their pleopods in many taxa respiratory structures on endopods are internal with a spiracle and which resemble lungs in others is folded inside adjoining outer branch of pleopod both these arrangements help to prevent evaporation from respiratory surfaces many species can roll themselves into a ball a behaviour used in defence that also conserves moisture members of families and commonly known as rock lice or sea slaters are least specialised of woodlice for life on land they inhabit splash zone on rocky shores jetties and pilings may hide under debris washed up on shore and can swim if immersed in water references external links category malacostraca category extant
