territories these included but may not have been limited to southern half of northumbria his background is obscure because of poor source documentation latter has facilitated disagreement amongst historians regarding his family and ethnicity it is believed that he took over position of ealdorman of york in 966 holding position until his downfall in 975 he may have been first ealdorman of southern as opposed to a united northumbria though an alternative tradition puts division of northumbria into two after his death little is known of his career as ealdorman except for a legend that he escorted scottish king kenneth ii to english royal court and that he was expelled from england in 975 his life is unattested after this he had one known son but it is not clear if that son ever succeeded him origins oslac s origins are unclear and no specific relationship with any previous known figure can be established from available sources oslac s name suggests to some historians that he was a norseman dorothy whitelock points out that name oslac is often an anglicisation of old scandinavian name whitelock dealings of kings p 79 while writers of biographical dictionary of dark age
