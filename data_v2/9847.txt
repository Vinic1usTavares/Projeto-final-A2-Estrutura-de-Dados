write home about remains their most widely acclaimed album and is considered to be one of quintessential albums of second wave emo movement however like many early emo bands get up kids sought to dissociate themselves with term as it was considered dismissive to be seen as an emo band band departed heavily from their established style with release of their 2002 album on a wire which saw band take on a much more layered alternative rock sound years later guitarist jim suptic even apologized for having influence they did on many of modern third wave emo bands commenting that t he punk scene we came out of and punk scene now are completely different it s like glam rock now if this is world we helped create then i apologize due to internal conflicts band broke up in 2005 three years later

up kids were formed band originally planned on calling themselves suburban get up kids until reasoning that there were fewer band names beginning with letter g than there are with letter s and that

rapidly created an overseas fanbase while band was receiving rapidly increasing national and international attention they became unhappy with doghouse records ability to keep up with increasing popularity of band get up kids announcement to leave doghouse records brought interest from prominent record labels including sub pop geffen and mojo records band made a decision to sign to mojo but before contracts were signed they began to have second thoughts main issue was over label s insistence on owning merchandising rights a large source of band s income moreover band was insulted label requested they re record don t hate me from four minute mile for their next record feeling that label believed it was best that they could write before deal with mojo was official band met rich egan

songs himself he asked matt pryor and rob pope to help record some of instrumentals resulting album greatest hits 1984 1987 leaned heavily on use of synthesizer keyboards for its sound their work together on reggie and full effect album led pryor to invite dewees to collaborate with get up kids on red letter day a five track ep produced by ed rose to fulfill their two record deal with doghouse cleaner more focused sound of ep provided chance to experiment with inclusion of keyboards and acts as a sonic bridge between raw sound of four minute mile and more dynamic produced style of their next studio album after release of red letter day dewees became a full time member as band began recording their second studio album in los angeles in june 1999 with producer alex brahl before album went into production vagrant records co owner john cohen borrowed money from his parents who had mortgaged their house in order to fund production of album on september 21 1999 band released something to write home about on vagrant records album s lyrics reflected record label strife band had experienced and their distance between friends and family back home after their move to los angeles something to write home about has been singled out as band s only true emo album as album s aesthetic fit more into contemporary definition of genre furthermore album single handedly turned struggling vagrant label into one of top indie labels in country selling over 140 000 copies after its release not only did album make get up kids poster children for emo but it also launched genre into a public consciousness broader than scattered local scenes that had previously embraced it album gave vagrant records financial backing to grow and sign a string of other bands at same time addition of keyboards alienated some fans who thought it moved band away from contemporary punk scene s diy ethic get up kids toured relentlessly for almost three years in promotion of record as well as touring europe japan and australia they shared bills with acts such as green day anniversary koufax hot rod circuit jebediah weezer and ozma their 2000 tour with anniversary and koufax was sponsored by napster their fanbase kept expanding through word of mouth venues booked months in advance could no longer hold demand by time band arrived in town and fans were forced to stand outside to see them perform to capitalize on anticipation for band s next album vagrant records released a rarities compilation eudora in 2001 eudora consisted of alternate takes covers and b sides since band s formation likewise doghouse released a re mastered edition of four minute mile and a compilation entitled eps woodson and red letter day combining two doghouse owned eps on one compact disc on a wire 2002 2003 after three years of touring for something to write home about band was beginning to feel burned out and wished to depart from upbeat power pop sound with which they had become associated they also wanted to find a new producer to challenge them creatively approaching nigel godrich and gil norton with offers although both declined finally band settled on scott litt best known for his work with r e m and nirvana band s third studio album on a wire was released on may 14 2002 debuting a more measured alternative style just as something to write home about alienated some fans with its more produced sound on a wire was criticized by fans who were disappointed with album s softer musical direction specifically reviewer for alternative press wrote unfortunately visceral energy of their early days is lost in their newfound maturity while many fans were upset with this sudden change of direction album was generally well received by mainstream publications entertainment weekly was highly positive writing that this is group at their best in his review of album rolling stone writer barry walters wrote on a wire quivers with anxieties that must have arisen as get up kids left behind what originally made them straining vocals racing tempos and walls of distortion give way to softer singing spacious guitars and prominent keyboards get up kids dig deeper into themselves what they find is often subtle less visceral but far more tender poor public reception of album had a larger impact on band s popularity as a whole band embarked on a tour to promote album in late spring soon after album was released only to find that they had far less support from both their fans and their record label using financial and critical success of something to write home about vagrant signed several other headlining emo bands such as alkaline trio dashboard confessional and saves day get up kids were no longer label s top priority and certainly not after lukewarm reception of on a wire in an interview with alternative press lead singer matt pryor considered dramatic change in style on on a wire seriously dented momentum band had built up since something to write home about allowing later bands such as dashboard confessional to take much of fan base that get up kids had previously earned in an interview pryor confessed that he did not think that anyone including vagrant gave that record a chance even though they had avoided term since its inception it was at this point band actively began trying to shed term emo a word that had defined them for years but had come to be associated with more pop oriented acts pryor commented on album saying we really didn t give two shits if anyone liked record or not we were really confident that we were going to kill this emo stigma that we had and take people with open minds with us and leave everyone else in dust guilt show 2003 2004 in 2003 band began recording their fourth studio album album would be first recorded in black lodge studios in eudora kansas a studio renovated and owned by pope brothers and producer ed rose writing process for album was different from their past efforts as most of songs were written by only three of band members in early stages of writing jim suptic was on his honeymoon james dewees was involved in a difficult divorce and much of his creative efforts inspired by those events went into fourth reggie and full effect album songs not to get married to while this led to a less collaborative effort than in past it gave pope brothers a more substantial role in writing than ever before in an interview with alternative press pryor confirmed song never be alone was written by rob pope about his 2003 divorce from anniversary keyboardist adrianne verhoeven this fractured approach to writing process began to strain relationships in band at one point leading suptic to consider quitting band pryor drew lyrical inspiration from lives of friends and people he knew extracting stories of abuse betrayal and guilt album s lyrics also delve into incidents of adultery wouldn t believe it how long is too long and album s first single one you want is said to be about a woman who pryor says sucks soul out of people in march 2004 band released their fourth studio album guilt show produced by ed rose sonically album combined more measured sophisticated sound of on a wire with frenetic style of their earlier work guilt show which was titled after a misreading of a flier saying quilt show was very well received both critically and commercially more pop driven tone of album reunited band with many fans who were disenchanted after on a wire while also staying close enough to evolution of last album to interest newer fans and critics however their return was overshadowed by booming popularity of other contemporary emo bands such as dashboard confessional who invited band to open for them on 2004 honda civic tour breakup and solo activity 2004 2008 thumb right uptown theater marquee on july 2 2005 before band s farewell concert over course of tour with dashboard confessional relationships between band members continued to decline band s live shows had deteriorated and rob and suptic had both threatened to quit multiple times matt pryor s wife had recently given birth to their first child and being away from his family had made him irritable and standoffish after honda civic tour ended band embarked on their world tour including stops throughout europe japan and australia however their live performance hit an all time low with pryor at times refusing to even sing large portions of songs at one tour date in england tensions came to a head when ryan pope confronted pryor over his recent despondence leading to a band meeting where pryor confessed his desire to reduce his commitment to rest of group after some discussion band agreed that their hearts were no longer in it and at end of tour they would quietly end band once tour ended band went on an
