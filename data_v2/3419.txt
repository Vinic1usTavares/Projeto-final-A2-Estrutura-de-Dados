verite was a pre dreadnought battleship built for french navy in mid 1900s she was second member of which included three other vessels and was a derivative of preceding with primary difference being inclusion of a heavier secondary battery verite carried a main battery of four guns like republique but mounted ten guns for her secondary armament in place of guns of earlier vessels like many late pre dreadnought designs verite was completed after revolutionary british battleship had entered service and rendered her obsolescent even before being commissioned into service with fleet verite carried president armand fallieres on a tour of baltic sea in 1908 after formally entering service verite was assigned to 2nd division of mediterranean squadron based in toulon she then embarked on normal peacetime training routine of squadron and fleet maneuvers and cruises to various ports in mediterranean she also participated in several naval reviews for a number of french and foreign dignitaries in september 1909 ships of 2nd division crossed atlantic to united states to represent france at hudson fulton celebration following outbreak of world war i in july 1914 justice was used

zeppelin over salonika in may and joined a blockade of country in december verite saw little further activity for rest of war was placed in reserve in 1919 after war ended and was sold to italian ship breakers in 1921 design thumb left line drawing of liberte class liberte class battleships were originally intended to be part of but construction of british s with their heavy secondary battery of guns prompted french naval general staff to request that last four republiques be redesigned to include a heavier secondary battery in response ironically designer louis emile bertin had proposed such an armament for republique class but general staff had rejected it since larger guns had a lower rate of fire than smaller guns that had been selected for republique design because ships were broadly similar apart from their armament libertes are sometimes considered to be a sub class of republique type verite was long overall and had a beam of and an average draft of she displaced up to at full load battleship was powered by three vertical triple expansion steam engines with twenty two belleville boilers they were rated at and provided a top speed of coal storage amounted to which provided a maximum range of at a cruising speed of she had a crew of 32 officers and 710 enlisted men main battery consisted of four modele 1893 96 guns mounted in two twin gun turrets one forward and one aft secondary battery consisted of ten modele 1902 guns six were mounted in single turrets and four in casemates in hull she also carried thirteen modele 1902 guns and ten modele 1902 guns ship was also armed with two torpedo tubes which were submerged in hull on broadside ship s main belt was thick in central citadel and was connected to two armored decks upper deck was thick while lower deck was thick with sloped sides main battery guns were protected by up to of armor on fronts of turrets while secondary turrets had of armor on faces casemates were protected with of steel plate conning tower had thick sides modifications over course of 1912 through 1914 navy tried to modify verite and her sister to allow 305 mm guns to be aimed continuously tests to determine whether main battery turrets could be modified to increase elevation of guns and hence their range proved to be impossible but navy determined that tanks on either side of vessel could be flooded to induce a heel of 2 degrees this increased maximum range of guns from new motors were installed in secondary turrets in 1915 1916 to improve their training and elevation rates also in 1915 47 mm guns located on either side of bridge were removed and two on aft superstructure were moved to roof of rear turret on 8 december 1915 naval command issued orders that light battery was to be revised to eight of 47 mm guns and ten guns light battery was revised again in 1916 with four 47 mm guns being converted with high angle anti aircraft mounts they were placed atop rear main battery turret and number 7 and 8 secondary turret roofs in 1912 1913 ship received two barr stroud rangefinders to direct anti aircraft guns she received a rangefinder which was installed on aft superstructure service history construction 1910

when crewmen noticed thick black smoke pouring from magazines prompting fears that magazines had caught fire instead it turned out that there was a problem with ventilation system from boiler rooms leading to an accumulation of smoke in boilers thumb map of western mediterranean where verite spent majority of her peacetime career in early 1913 verite and rest of 2nd squadron took part in training exercises off le lavandou french fleet which by then included sixteen battleships held large scale maneuvers between toulon and sardinia beginning on 19 may exercises concluded with a fleet

for a cruise to ajaccio corsica from there she carried gauthier to bizerte after arriving there on 24 may he transferred to new dreadnought for voyage back to france squadron visited various ports in june but following assassination of archduke franz ferdinand and ensuing july crisis prompted fleet to remain close to port making only short training sorties as international tensions rose world war i adriatic and dardanelles operations following outbreak of world war i in july 1914 france announced general mobilization on 1 august next day boue de lapeyrere ordered entire french fleet to begin raising steam at 22 15 so ships could sortie early next day faced with prospect that german mediterranean division centered on battlecruiser might attack troopships carrying french army in north africa to metropolitan france french fleet was tasked with providing heavy escort to convoys accordingly verite and rest of 2nd squadron were sent to algiers where they joined a group of seven passenger ships that had a contingent of 7 000 troops from xix corps aboard while at sea new dreadnought battleships courbet and and danton class battleships and which took over as convoy s escort instead of attacking convoys goeben bombarded bone and philippeville and then fled east to ottoman empire thumb austro hungarian and under fire from french fleet at battle of antivari on 12 august france and britain declared war on austro hungarian empire as war continued to widen 1st and 2nd squadrons were therefore sent to southern adriatic sea to contain austro hungarian navy on 15 august two squadrons arrived off strait of otranto where they met patrolling british cruisers and north of othonoi boue de lapeyrere then took fleet into adriatic in an attempt to force a battle with austro hungarian fleet following morning british and french cruisers spotted vessels in distance that on closing with them turned out to be protected cruiser and torpedo boat which were trying to blockade coast of montenegro in ensuing battle of antivari boue de lapeyrere initially ordered his battleships to fire warning shots but this caused confusion among fleet s gunners that allowed ulan to escape slower zenta attempted to evade but she quickly received several hits that disabled her engines and set her on fire she sank shortly thereafter and anglo french fleet withdrew on 1 september french battleships then bombarded austrian fortifications at cattaro on 1 september in an attempt to draw out austro hungarian fleet which again refused to take bait in addition many of ships still had shells loaded from battle with zenta and guns could not be emptied apart from by firing them on 18 19 september fleet made another incursion into adriatic steaming as far north as island of lissa on 24 september verite was detached to reinforce dardanelles division under command of contre amiral rear admiral emile guepratte then based at tenedos french and british fleets began to amass a naval force that could defend against a possible sortie by goeben from dardanelles fleet comprised british battlecruisers and which were to engage goeben while verite and suffren were to engage old ottoman battleships and when predicted sortie of german and ottoman ships failed to materialize british commander admiral sackville carden ordered four ships to bombard ottoman coastal fortifications to test defenses british battlecruisers attacked fortifications on european side of straits while french battleships engaged those on asian side both groups made a single pass past their targets that lasted about ten minutes suffren led verite at a speed of closing to ranges between to shell and fortresses verite expended a total of twenty five 194 mm shells at targets while suffren employed her 305 mm main battery battlecruisers destroyed magazine in fortress at sedd el bahr and french ships inflicted significant casualties on ottoman garrison with estimates ranging from 150 to 600 killed and wounded guepratte s squadron which shortly consisted of verite battleships and his flagship was employed as part of blockade of dardanelles they were also tasked with patrolling for contraband that was being shipped into ottoman empire either by port of smyrna or bulgaria british and french were concerned with maintaining naval strength elsewhere and so verite left dardanelles division on 18 december operations in greece following evacuation of forces from gallipoli campaign in early 1916 french began gathering forces in aegean sea to put pressure on greek government which had remained neutral in war king constantine i s wife sophie was sister of german kaiser wilhelm ii and so he was reluctant to go to war against his brother in law but by that time french and british had grown weary over his refusal to enter war on side of allies verite joined former members of dardanelles division in salonika greece where on 5 may she and patrie shot down a german zeppelin conducting reconnaissance in area in june fleet was formally reorganized with verite her two sisters two republique class ships and suffren forming 3rd squadron which was tasked with pressuring greek government over course of june and july ships alternated between salonika and mudros and later that month fleet was transferred to cephalonia in august a pro allied group launched a coup against monarchy in noemvriana which allies sought to support several french ships sent men ashore in athens on 1 december to support coup but they were quickly defeated by royalist greek army in response british and french fleet imposed a blockade of royalist controlled parts of country by june 1917 french and british began to prepare to intervene more directly in country and elements of french fleet was dispersed throughout ports in country verite was stationed in piraeus with cruiser but before they could intervene constantine abdicated in favor of a pro allied government and allies lifted blockade on 16 june 3rd squadron was disbanded and verite returned to 2nd squadron on 1 july which included other liberte class ships and three of danton class battleships they remained in corfu largely immobilized due to shortages of coal preventing training or any significant operations which had a negative effect on crew efficiency and morale in march 1918 ship was transferred to mudros to replace republique on eastern division with arrival of justice and patrie in april and later two british s unit was renamed salonika division meant to counter possibility of a sortie by russian warships that had been captured by germans at sevastopol earlier that year this arrangement did not last long however as in july verite and justice returned to 2nd squadron where they again faced coal shortages that crippled french fleet operations in late october members of central powers began signing armistices with british and french signaling end of war 2nd squadron ships were sent to constantinople to oversee surrender of ottoman forces postwar fate verite returned to france and was not involved in allied intervention in russian civil war unlike her sisters she was reduced to reserve status on 1 august 1919 and did not see further service she was stricken from naval register on 18 may 1921 and she was towed to savona italy in september to be broken up footnotes references category liberte
