includes no content or plot elements from film game was released on subor a famicom clone series though it can also be played on famicom and nes consoles through use of an adapter due to famicom s restricted hardware capabilities remake is entirely two dimensional special compensation was made for some of in battle sprites such as cloud strife s combining two pixel sprites side by side instead of usual single sprite to account for weapons such as cloud s sword or barret s gun while most japanese games use only 8x8 pixel hiragana or katakana fonts and most chinese games use 4 color 16x16

single two megabyte prg program rom chips a ram chip is used instead of a rom for character graphics data similar to method used in some nintendo games as a result data is strewn across prg rom in
