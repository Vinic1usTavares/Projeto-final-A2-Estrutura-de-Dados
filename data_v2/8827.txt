tribe reservation origins of state boundaries marked by monument occurred just prior to and during american civil war when united states congress acted to form governments in area to combat spread of slavery to region when early territories were formed their boundaries were designated along meridian and parallel lines beginning in 1860s these lines were surveyed and marked these early surveys included some errors but even so markers placed became legal boundaries superseding written descriptions of geographical meridians and parallels this includes four corners monument which has been legally established as corner of four states monument monument is maintained as a tourist attraction by navajo nation parks and recreation department it is an example of a political boundary that is a tourist destination in its own right monument consists of a granite disk embedded with a smaller bronze disk around point surrounded by smaller appropriately located state seals and flags representing

was initially american indian land and beginning in 16th century it was claimed by spain as part of new spain after mexico gained independence from spain in 1821 area was governed by mexico until being ceded to united states by treaty of guadalupe hidalgo in 1848 following united states victory in mexican american war first boundary which would become part of monument was set as part of compromise of 1850 which created new mexico territory and utah territory border between two territories was congressionally defined as 37th parallel north by 31st united states congress in 1861 36th united states congress transferred land previously allocated to utah territory to newly created colorado territory colorado territory s southern border would remain as 37th parallel north but a new border between colorado and utah territories was declared to be 32nd meridian west from washington this line was derived from reference used at time washington meridian in 1860 just prior to outbreak of american civil war a group of people in southern portion of new mexico territory passed a resolution condemning united states for creating such a vast territory with only a single small government in place at santa fe they claimed that by doing so u s had ignored needs of southern portion left it without a functional system of law and order and allowed situation to deteriorate into a state of chaos and near anarchy group declared secession from united states and announced their intent to join confederate states of america under name of arizona territory u s congress responded in 1863 by creating another arizona territory with different but partially overlapping boundaries confederate boundaries split new mexico along an east west line 34th parallel north allowing for a single state connection from texas to colorado river this would give confederacy access to california and pacific coast union definition split new mexico along a north south line 32nd meridian west from washington which simply extended boundary between colorado and utah southward union plan eventually became reality and this created quadripoint at modern four corners after split new mexico resembled its modern form with only slight differences surveying boundaries after civil war efforts began to survey and mark actual borders in 1868 general land office glo had ehud n darling survey and set markers along border between colorado and new mexico territories 37th parallel north this border has become known as darling line in 1875 another glo surveyor chandler robbins surveyed and marked border between arizona and new mexico territories 32nd meridian west of washington robbins began near mexico united states border and worked his way north marking border every so often near 37th parallel north he intersected darling line and here he erected a sandstone shaft this sandstone shaft marked today s location of four corners monument in 1878 rollin j reeves surveyed and marked border between newly created state of colorado and utah territory reeves located sandstone shaft marker placed by robbins at today s four corners monument he then began to survey and mark border between colorado and utah from this point northward in 1901 howard b carpenter surveyed and marked border between arizona and utah completing survey of borders making up four corners monument results of these surveys and markers placed were later accepted as legal boundaries between various states marker s transformation into a monument thumb a child straddling all four states on monument as it looked following 1962 reconstruction alt a child with one arm or leg in each of four states by 1899 sandstone shaft marker placed by chandler robbins in 1875 had been disturbed and broken so it was replaced with a new stone by two u s surveyors hubert d page and james m lentz in 1912 a simple concrete pad was poured around marker first modern navajo government convened in 1923 in an effort to organize and regulate an increasing amount of oil exploration activities on navajo lands and they would play a big role in monument s further development in 1931 everett h kimmell another u s surveyor found this newer stone had broken too and he replaced it with a brass disc marker set in concrete in 1962 bureau of land management and bureau of indian affairs poured an elevated concrete pad around 1931 brass marker this pad included state border lines and names in tile monument was completely rebuilt in 1992 and 1931 brass marker was replaced with a disc shaped aluminum bronze plate set in granite monument was again rebuilt in 2010 although disc shaped plate from 1992 remained in place misplacement controversy thumb left flags surrounding four corners monument in clockwise order starting from frontmost flag state flag of arizona flag of navajo nation twice utah ute mountain ute tribe reservation colorado new mexico navajo nation third instance and flag of united states since early 20th century controversies have arisen regarding accuracy of monument s placement after initial surveys it was found that borders did not always follow lines of meridian and parallel as they had been intended to due to primitive surveying technology available at time of construction this discrepancy left four states asking if correct borders were exact lines of meridian and parallel and if new more accurate surveys needed to be done or if markers placed during initial surveys were now actual border issue was resolved when new mexico sued colorado in 1919 and in 1925 supreme court ruled that markers placed during initial surveys were actual borders even if markers were off in some locations this includes four corners monument today s legal description of these border lines is based on original markers and not written description of borders created when territories were formed because of this borders between these states are not perfectly straight and often zigzag one example is border between colorado and utah where in one area border jogs west about from where it was intended to be placed because this error occurred in original survey which superseded written description being simply 32nd meridian west of washington border set out by markers remains border between two states thumb four corners monument as it looked following 1992 reconstruction alt a concrete pad with state seals of four states in center of pad is a red disk reading here meet in freedom under god four states inside that disk is a smaller bronze disk in 2009 this issue was again brought to forefront due to u s media reports that monument was placed west of its intended location these reports were quickly corrected after it was discovered that sources had forgotten that when initial surveys were conducted that washington meridian was used this meridian has an offset from modern reference prime meridian which has been used in united states since 1912 this offset is often missed by those not familiar with history of u s surveying even after mistakes in reports were discovered a spokesperson for u s national geodetic survey admitted monument is placed east of where modern surveyors would mark point however he defended accuracy of original survey stating surveyors nailed it considering primitive tools of day pointing out achievement given conditions he further stated their ability to replicate that exact point what they did was phenomenal what they did was spot on he concluded by stating that any claims of errors in location of monument are irrelevant once a survey commissioned to establish a boundary has been accepted by involved parties survey markers are legally binding regardless of any error that is later discovered similar statements were issued by navajo nation defending their work in maintaining and promoting monument in addition general u s land principles boundary lines actually run and marked in surveys returned by surveyor general shall be established as proper boundary lines of sections or subdivisions for which they were intended law title u s c 43 sec 752 and supreme court have established that location of monument is legal corner of four states see also
