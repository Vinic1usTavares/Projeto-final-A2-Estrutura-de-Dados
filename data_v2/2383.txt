upsilon andromedae d u andromedae d abbreviated upsilon and d u and d formally named majriti is a super jupiter exoplanet orbiting within habitable zone of sun like star upsilon andromedae a approximately 44 light years 13 5 parsecs or nearly km away from earth in constellation of andromeda its discovery made it first multiplanetary system to be discovered around a main sequence star and first such system known in a multiple star system exoplanet was found by using radial velocity method where periodic doppler shifts of spectral lines of host star suggest an orbiting object name in july 2014 international astronomical union launched a process for giving proper names to certain exoplanets and their host stars nameexoworlds an iau worldwide contest to name exoplanets and their host stars iau org 9 july 2014 process involved public nomination and voting for new names nameexoworlds process in december 2015 iau announced winning name was majriti for this planet final results of nameexoworlds public vote released international astronomical union 15 december 2015 winning name was submitted by vega astronomy club of morocco honoring 10th century scientist maslama al majriti nameexoworlds approved names characteristics mass radius and temperature upsilon andromedae d is a super jupiter an exoplanet that has a mass larger than that of planet jupiter it has a temperature of http www upr edu abel phl hec plots hec orbit hec orbit ups and d png it has a mass of 10 25 and a likely radius of around 1 02 based on its mass host star planet orbits a f type star named upsilon andromedae a star has a mass of 1 27 and a radius of around 1 48 it has a temperature of k and is 3 12 billion years old in comparison sun is about 4 6 billion years old and has a temperature of 5778 k star is slightly metal rich with a metallicity fe h of 0 09 or about 123 of solar amount its luminosity is 3 57 times that of sun star s apparent magnitude or how bright it appears from earth s perspective is 4 09 therefore upsilon andromedae can be seen with naked eye orbit upsilon andromedae d orbits its star nearly every 3 5 years about 1 276 days in an eccentric orbit more eccentric than that of any of known planets in solar system web version to explain planet s orbital eccentricity some have proposed a close encounter with a now lost outer planet of upsilon andromedae a encounter would have moved planet d into an eccentric orbit closer to star and ejected outer planet habitability thumb left 300px artist s impression of a potentially habitable exomoon orbiting a gas giant upsilon andromedae d lies in habitable zone of upsilon andromedae a as defined both by ability for an earthlike world to retain liquid water at its surface and based on amount of ultraviolet radiation received from star for a stable orbit ratio between moon s orbital period ps around its primary and that of primary around its star pp must be 1 9 e g if a planet takes 90 days to orbit its star maximum stable orbit for a moon of that planet is less than 10 days simulations suggest that a moon with an orbital period less than about 45 to 60 days will remain safely bound to a massive giant planet or brown dwarf that orbits 1 au from a sun like star in case of upsilon andromedae d orbital period would have to be no greater than 120 days around 4 months in order to have a stable orbit tidal effects could also allow moon to sustain plate tectonics which would cause volcanic activity to regulate moon s temperature and create a geodynamo effect which would give satellite a strong magnetic field to support an earth like atmosphere for about 4 6 billion years age of earth moon would have to have a mars like density and at least a mass of 0 07 one way to decrease loss from sputtering is for moon to have a strong magnetic field that can deflect stellar wind and radiation belts nasa s galileo s measurements hints large moons can have magnetic fields it found that jupiter s moon ganymede has its own magnetosphere even though its mass is only 0 025 discovery and further studies upsilon andromedae d was detected by measuring variations in its star s radial velocity as a result of planet s gravity this was done by making precise measurements of doppler shift of spectrum of upsilon andromedae a at time of discovery upsilon andromedae a was already known to host one extrasolar planet hot jupiter upsilon andromedae b however by 1999 it was clear that inner planet could not explain velocity curve in 1999 astronomers at both san francisco state university and harvard smithsonian center for astrophysics independently concluded that a three planet model best fit data two new planets were designated upsilon andromedae c and upsilon andromedae d preliminary astrometric measurements suggest orbit of upsilon andromedae d may be inclined at 155 5deg to plane of sky however these measurements were later proved useful only for upper limits and contradict even inner planet u and b s inclination of 30deg mutual inclination between c and d meanwhile is 29 9 degrees true inclination of upsilon andromedae d was determined as 23 8deg after combined results were measured from hubble space telescope and radial velocity measurements when it was discovered a limitation of radial velocity method used to detect upsilon andromedae d is that orbital inclination is unknown and only a lower limit on planet s mass can be obtained which was estimated to be about 4 1 times as massive as jupiter however by combining radial velocity measurements from ground based telescopes with astrometric data from hubble space telescope astronomers have determined orbital inclination as well as actual mass of planet which is about 10 25 times mass of jupiter see also
