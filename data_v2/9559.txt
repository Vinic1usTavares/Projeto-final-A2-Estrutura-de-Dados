holocaust denial is act of denying genocide of jews in holocaust during world war ii holocaust deniers make one or more of following false statements that nazi germany s final solution was aimed only at deporting jews from reich and did not include their extermination that nazi authorities did not use extermination camps and gas chambers for genocidal mass murder of jews or that actual number of jews murdered is significantly lower than accepted figure of 5 to 6 million typically around a tenth of that figure because holocaust denial is commonly associated with certain racist propaganda it is considered a serious societal problem in many places where it occurs and is illegal in several european countries and israel holocaust denial is sponsored by some middle eastern governments including iran and syria scholars use term denial to describe views and methodology of holocaust deniers in order to distinguish them from legitimate historical revisionists who challenge orthodox interpretations of history using established historical methodologies holocaust deniers generally do not accept denial as an appropriate description of their activities and use euphemism revisionism instead methodologies of holocaust deniers are often based on a predetermined conclusion that ignores overwhelming historical evidence to contrary in some post soviet states holocaust deniers do not deny very fact of mass murder of jews but they deny participation of their own nationals in holocaust most holocaust deniers claim either explicitly or implicitly that holocaust is a hoax or an exaggeration arising from a deliberate jewish conspiracy designed to advance interest of jews at expense of other people for this reason holocaust denial is generally considered to be an antisemitic conspiracy theory terminology and etymology holocaust deniers prefer to refer to their work as historical revisionism and object to being referred to as deniers emory university professor deborah lipstadt has written that deniers selection of name revisionist to describe themselves is indicative of their basic strategy of deceit and distortion and of their attempt to portray themselves as legitimate historians engaged in traditional practice of illuminating past lipstadt deborah 1993 denying holocaust growing assault on truth and memory new york penguin books p 25 scholars consider this misleading since methods of holocaust denial differ from those of legitimate historical revision two leading critical exposes of holocaust denial in united states were written by historians deborah lipstadt 1993 and michael shermer and alex grobman 2000 these scholars make a distinction between historical revisionism and denial revisionism in their view entails a refinement of existing knowledge about a historical event not a denial of event itself that comes through examination of new empirical evidence or a reexamination or reinterpretation of existing evidence legitimate historical revisionism acknowledges a certain body of irrefutable evidence or a convergence of evidence that suggest that an event like black plague american slavery or holocaust did in fact occur lipstadt 1993 21 shermer grobman 200 34 denial on other hand rejects entire foundation of historical evidence legitimate historical revisionism is explained in a resolution adopted by duke university history department november 8 1991 and reprinted in duke chronicle november 13 1991 in response to an advertisement produced by bradley r smith s committee for open debate on holocaust lipstadt writes that modern holocaust denial draws its inspiration from various sources including a school of thought which used an established method to question government policies in 1992 donald l niewyk gave some examples of how legitimate historical revisionism re examination of accepted history and its updating with newly discovered more accurate or less biased information may be applied to study of holocaust as new facts emerge to change historical understanding of it in contrast holocaust denial movement bases its approach on predetermined idea that holocaust as understood by mainstream historiography did not occur sometimes referred to as negationism from french term negationnisme introduced by henry rousso see alain mary byrd kelly richard j golsan future of a negation reflections

by holocaust deniers french collaboration in archive destruction in occupied france situation with respect to preserving war records was not much better partly as a result of french state secrecy rules dating back to well before war aimed at protecting french government and state from embarrassing revelations and partly to avoid culpability for example at liberation prefecture of police destroyed nearly all of massive archive of jewish arrest and deportation efforts to preserve historical record during war one of earliest efforts to save historical record of holocaust occurred during war in france where internment camp records were carefully preserved and turned over to new national office for veterans and victims of war however bureau then held them in secret refusing to release copies later even to center of contemporary jewish documentation cdjc in 1943 isaac anticipating need for a center to document and preserve memory of persecution for historical reasons and also support claims post war gathered together 40 representatives from jewish organizations in grenoble which was under italian occupation at time in order to form a centre de documentation as quoted in exposure meant death penalty and as a result little actually happened before liberation serious work began after center moved to paris in late 1944 and was renamed cdjc immediate post war period in 1945 general dwight d eisenhower supreme allied commander anticipated that someday an attempt would be made to documentation of nazi crimes as propaganda and took steps against it eisenhower upon finding victims of death camps ordered all possible photographs to be taken and for german people from surrounding villages to be ushered through camps and even made to bury dead he wrote following to general george marshall after visiting a german internment camp near gotha germany nuremberg trials nuremberg trials took place in germany after war in 1945 1946 stated aim was to dispense justice in retribution for atrocities of german government this allied intention to administer justice post war was first announced in 1943 in declaration on german atrocities in occupied europe and reiterated at yalta conference and at berlin in 1945 while intention was not specifically to preserve historical record of holocaust some of core documents required to prosecute cases were provided to them by cdjc and much of huge trove of archives were then transferred to cdjc after trials and became core of future holocaust historiography nuremberg trials were important historically but events were still very recent television was in its infancy and not present and there was little public impact there were isolated moments of limited public awareness from hollywood films such as diary of anne frank 1959 or 1961 judgment at nuremberg which had some newsreel footage of actual scenes from liberated nazi concentration camps including scenes of piles of naked corpses laid out in rows and bulldozed into large pits which was considered exceptionally graphic for time public awareness changed when eichmann trial riveted world s attention fifteen years after nuremberg trial of adolf eichmann in 1961 israeli government captured adolf eichmann in argentina and brought him to israel to stand trial for war crimes chief prosecutor gideon hausner s intentions were not only to demonstrate eichmann s guilt personally but to present material about entire holocaust thus producing a comprehensive record israeli government arranged for trial to have prominent media coverage many major newspapers from all over globe sent reporters and published front page coverage of story israelis had opportunity to watch live television broadcasts of proceedings and videotape was flown daily to united states for broadcast following day post world war ii history in immediate aftermath of war prior to extensive documentation efforts by allied forces a sense of disbelief caused many to deny initial reports of holocaust compounding this disbelief was memory of forged newspaper accounts of german corpse factory an anti german atrocity propaganda campaign during wwi which was widely known to be false by 1945 during 1930s nazi government used this propaganda against british claiming allegations of concentration camps were malicious lies put forward by british government and historians joachim neander and randal marlin note that this story encouraged later disbelief when early reports circulated about holocaust under hitler victor cavendish bentinck chairman of british joint intelligence committee noted that these reports were similar to stories of employment of human corpses during last war for manufacture of fat which was a grotesque lie likewise christian century commented that parallel between this story and corpse factory atrocity tale of first world war is too striking to be overlooked neander joachim german corpse factory master hoax of british propaganda in first world war saarland university press 2013 pp 8 9 neander notes that there can be no doubt that reported commercial use of corpses of murdered jews undermined credibility of news coming from poland and delayed action that might have rescued many jewish lives neo nazi movement has been revitalized by holocaust denial small but vocal numbers of neo nazis realized that recreation of a hitlerite style regime may be impossible but a replica might be produced in future and realized that to rehabilitate nazism required discrediting of holocaust first person to openly write after end of world war ii that he doubted reality of holocaust was french journalist maurice bardeche in his 1948 book nuremberg ou la terre promise nuremberg or promised land harry elmer barnes harry elmer barnes at one time a mainstream american historian assumed a holocaust denial stance in his later years between world war i and world war ii barnes was an anti war writer and a leader of historical revisionism movement starting in 1924 barnes worked closely with centre for study of causes of war a german government funded think tank whose sole purpose was to disseminate official government position that germany was victim of allied aggression in 1914 and that versailles treaty was morally invalid herwig holger clio deceived pp 5 44 from international security volume 12 issue 2 fall 1987 pp 22 23 26 headed by major alfred von a volkisch activist organization portrayed itself as a scholarly society but historians later described it as a clearinghouse for officially desirable views on outbreak of war herwig holger clio deceived pp 5 44 from international security volume 12 issue 2 fall 1987 pp 21 23 26 following world war ii barnes became convinced that allegations made against germany and japan including holocaust were wartime propaganda which had been used to justify united states involvement in world war ii barnes claimed that there were two false claims made about world war ii namely that germany started war in 1939 and holocaust which barnes claimed did not happen lipstadt deborah denying holocaust new york free press 1993 p 75 in his 1962 pamphlet revisionism and brainwashing barnes claimed that there was a lack of any serious opposition or concerted challenge to atrocity stories and other modes of defamation of german national character and conduct lipstadt deborah denying holocaust free press new york 1993 pp 73 74 barnes argued that there was a failure to point out atrocities of allies were more brutal painful mortal and numerous than most extreme allegations made against germans lipstadt deborah denying holocaust new york free press 1993 p 74 he claimed that in order to justify horrors and evils of second world war allies made nazis scapegoat for their own misdeeds barnes cited french holocaust denier paul rassinier whom barnes called a distinguished french historian who had exposed exaggerations of atrocity stories in a 1964 article zionist fraud published in american mercury barnes wrote courageous author rassinier lays chief blame for misrepresentation on those whom we must call swindlers of crematoria israeli politicians who derive billions of marks from nonexistent mythical and imaginary cadavers whose numbers have been reckoned in an unusually distorted and dishonest manner using rassinier as his source barnes claimed that germany was victim of aggression in both 1914 and 1939 and that reports of holocaust were propaganda to justify a war of aggression against germany beginnings of modern denial movement thumb kkk nazi salute and holocaust denial in 1961 a protege of barnes david hoggan published der erzwungene krieg forced war in west germany which claimed that germany had been victim of an anglo polish conspiracy in 1939 though der erzwungene krieg was primarily concerned with origins of world war ii it also down played or justified effects of nazi antisemitic measures in pre 1939 period lipstadt deborah denying

companies and alleged that no jews were killed in kristallnacht in fact 91 german jews were murdered in kristallnacht subsequently hoggan explicitly denied holocaust in 1969 in a book entitled myth of

century books 2001 page 29 in 1964 paul rassinier published drama of european jews rassinier was himself a concentration camp survivor he was held in buchenwald for having helped french jews escape nazis and modern day deniers continue to cite his works as scholarly research that questions accepted facts of holocaust critics argued that rassinier did not cite evidence for his claims and ignored information that contradicted his assertions he nevertheless remains influential in holocaust denial circles for being one of first deniers to propose that a vast zionist allied soviet conspiracy

canadian high school teacher was charged under canadian criminal code for promoting hatred against an identifiable group by communicating anti semitic statements to his students during class he would describe jews as a people of profound evil who had created holocaust to gain sympathy he also tested his students in exams on his theories and opinion of jews keegstra was charged under s 281 2 2 of

appeal that court agreed with keegstra and he was acquitted crown then appealed case to supreme court of canada which ruled by a 4 3 majority that promoting hatred could be justifiably restricted under s 1 of charter supreme court restored keegstra s conviction he was fired from his teaching position shortly afterward trouble erupted when teacher s anti jewish and incidentally anti catholic views attracted complaints from certain eckville parents thereby inviting intervention from district school superintendent robert david in 1981 a train of events was launched that finally led to

perhaps holocaust deniers are on to something in a 1990 interview nolte implied that there was something to leuchter report if revisionists holocaust deniers and leuchter among them have made it clear to public that even auschwitz must be an object of scientific inquiry and controversy then they should be given credit for this even if it finally turned out that number of victims was even greater

of gas chambers in which they looked for remnants of chemical process engendered by zyklon b and that of course i am against revisionists but fred leuchter s study of nazi gas ovens has to be given attention because one has to stay open to other ideas british historian richard j evans in his 1989 book in hitler s shadow expressed view that nolte s reputation as a scholar was in ruins as a result

comprehensive essay for court summarizing voluminous evidence for reality of holocaust and under cross examination effectively countered all of irving s principal arguments to contrary cambridge

academic publication journal of historical review they appeal to our objectivity our sense of fair play and our distrust of figurative language thus they rely on facts to grab readers attention these facts however are strung by what najarian calls fabricated decorum and are re interpreted for their use for example they pay particular attention to inconsistencies in numbers holocaust denial propaganda in all forms has been shown to influence audiences that it reaches in fact even well educated that is college graduates and current university students alike are susceptible to such propaganda when it is presented before them this stems from growing disbelief that audiences feel after being exposed to such information especially since holocaust witnesses themselves are decreasing in number studies centered on psychological effects of holocaust denial propaganda confirm this assertion linda m and william f stone in particular show that denial essays decrease readers belief in
