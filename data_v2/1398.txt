recording girl is mine it was completed on final day of mixing november 8 1982 several members of band toto were involved in album s recording and production jackson wrote four songs for record wanna be startin somethin girl is mine beat it and billie jean unlike many artists jackson did not write these songs on paper instead he dictated into a sound recorder when recording he would sing from memory relationship between jackson and jones became strained during recording jackson spent much of his time rehearsing dance steps alone when album was completed both jones and jackson were unhappy with result and remixed every song spending a week on each jackson was inspired to create an album where every song was a killer and developed thriller with that in mind jones and songwriter rod temperton gave detailed accounts of what occurred for 2001 reissue of album jones discussed billie jean and why it was so personal to jackson who struggled with obsessed fans jones wanted to shorten long introduction but jackson insisted that it remain because it made him want to dance ongoing backlash against disco made it necessary to move in a different musical direction from disco heavy off wall jones and jackson were determined to make a rock song that would appeal to all tastes and spent weeks looking for a suitable guitarist for song beat it eventually they found steve lukather of toto to play rhythm guitar parts and eddie van halen of rock band van halen to play solo when rod temperton wrote song thriller he wanted to call it starlight or midnight man but settled on thriller because he felt name had merchandising potential wanting a notable person to recite closing lyrics jones brought in actor vincent price an acquaintance of jones wife price completed his part in two takes temperton wrote spoken portion in a taxi on way to recording studio jones and temperton said that some recordings were left off final cut because they did not have edginess of other album tracks music and lyrics thriller explores genres including pop post disco rock and funk according to steve huey of allmusic it refined strengths of off wall dance and rock tracks are more aggressive while pop tunes and ballads are softer and more soulful album includes ballads lady in my life human nature and girl is mine funk tracks billie jean and wanna be startin something and disco songs baby be mine and p y t pretty young thing have a similar sound to off wall wanna be startin somethin climaxes in an african inspired chant often misidentified as swahili but actually syllables based on duala giving song an international flavor girl is mine tells of two friends fight over a woman arguing over who loves her more and concludes with a rap album s songs have a tempo ranging from 80 beats per minute on girl is mine to 138 on beat it thriller foreshadows contradictory themes of jackson s later works with thriller jackson began using a motif of paranoia and darker themes including supernatural imagery in title track this is evident on songs billie jean wanna be startin somethin and thriller in billie jean jackson sings about an obsessive fan who alleges he fathered her child in wanna be startin somethin he argues against media gossip for billie jean jones had jackson sing overdubs through a six foot 180 cm cardboard tube and brought in jazz saxophonist tom scott to play a wind controlled synthesizer bassist louis johnson ran through his part on a yamaha bass guitar song opens with a long bass and drums introduction thriller includes sound effects such as creaking doors thunder footsteps wind and howling dogs anti gang violence beat it became a homage to west side story and was jackson s first successful rock cross over piece jackson later said of beat it point is no one has to be tough guy you can walk away from a fight and still be a man you don t have to die to prove you re a man human nature co written by steve porcaro of band toto is moody and introspective as conveyed in lyrics such as looking out across morning city s heart begins to beat reaching out i touch her shoulder i m dreaming of street by late 1970s jackson s abilities as a vocalist were well regarded allmusic described him as a blindingly gifted vocalist rolling stone critic stephen holden likened his vocals to breathless dreamy stutter of stevie wonder and wrote that jackson s feathery tenor is extraordinarily beautiful it slides smoothly into a startling falsetto that s used very daringly with release of thriller jackson could sing low down to a basso low c but he preferred to sing higher because pop tenors have more range to create style rolling stone critic christopher connelly wrote that jackson was now singing in a fully adult voice that was tinged by sadness p y t pretty young thing credited to james ingram and quincy jones and lady in my life by rod temperton both gave album a stronger r b direction latter song was described as closest jackson has come to crooning a sexy soulful ballad after his motown years by j randy taraborrelli jackson had already adopted a vocal hiccup first used in 1973 on it s too late to change time which he continued to implement in thriller purpose of hiccup somewhat like a gulping for air or gasping is to help invoke a certain emotion be it excitement sadness or fear cover cover for thriller features jackson in a white suit that belonged to photographer dick zimmerman gatefold sleeve reveals a tiger cub at jackson s leg which according zimmerman jackson kept away from his face fearing he would be scratched another picture from shoot with jackson embracing cub was used for 2001 special edition of thriller release and sales thriller was released on november 30 1982 by epic records and internationally by cbs records it peaked at no 1 on billboard 200 on february 26 1983 seven singles were released girl is mine was criticized as a poor choice of lead single and its release led to predictions by critics that listeners would find album disappointing and to suggestions that jackson was bowing to a white audience girl is mine was followed by hit single billie jean which made thriller a chart topper success continued with single beat it which featured guitarists eddie van halen and steve lukather title track was released as a single and also became a hit internationally thriller sold one million copies worldwide per week at its peak by end of 1983 it became world s best selling album having sold 32 million copies thriller was best selling album in united states in 1983 and 1984 making it first album to be best selling for two years it also spent a record 37 weeks at no 1 on billboard 200 from february 26 1983 to april 14 1984 and has remained on chart for 387 weeks on december 16 2015

album worldwide of 1983 and 1984 it remains best selling album of all time having sold over 66 million copies worldwide critical reception in a contemporaneous review for rolling stone christopher connelly called thriller a zesty lp with a harrowing dark message he compared songs on album with life challenges that 24 year old jackson had faced since off wall while observing that he dropped boyish falsetto and was facing his challenges head on with a feisty determination and a full adult voice john rockwell wrote in new york times that perhaps jackson was a sometimes too practiced performer that at times quincy jones may his individuality with his slightly anonymous production and that jackson may be hiding his true emotions behind layers of impenetrable gauzy veils rockwell nonetheless deemed thriller a wonderful pop record latest statement by one of great singers in popular music today and that there are hits here too lots of them rockwell believed it helped breach destructive barriers that spring up regularly between white and black music especially as white publications and radio stations that normally avoid black music seem willing to pretend he isn t black after all in village voice robert christgau said this is virtually a hits plus filler job but at such a high level it s almost classic anyway he later wrote in christgau s record guide 80s 1990 what we couldn t know is how brilliantly every hit but p y t would thrive on mass exposure and public pleasure a year after album s release time summed up three main singles from album saying pulse of america and much of rest of world moves irregularly beating in time to tough strut of billie jean asphalt aria of beat it supremely cool chills of thriller in 1989 toronto star music critics reflected on albums they had reviewed in past ten years in order to create a list judging them on basis of commercial impact to social import to strictly musical merit thriller was placed at number 1 on list where it was referred to as his master work and that commercial success has since overshadowed jackson s artistic accomplishments on thriller and that s a pity it was a record for times brimming with breathless anticipation and a dread fear of adult world a brilliant fantasy that pumped with sexual heat yet made room for serious reflection album won a record breaking eight grammy awards in 1984 including album of year jackson won seven of grammy awards for album while eighth grammy award went to bruce swedien that same year jackson won eight american music awards special award of merit and three mtv video music awards thriller was recognized as world s best selling album on february 7 1984 when it was inducted into guinness book of world records it is one of four albums to be best seller of two years 1983 1984 in us influence and legacy music industry thumb thriller platinum record on display at hard rock cafe hollywood in universal city california 260x260px thumb 314x314px jackson center with president ronald reagan and first lady nancy reagan at white house in 1984 blender described jackson as late 20th century s preeminent pop icon while new york times gave opinion that he was a musical phenomenon and that in world of pop music there is michael jackson and there is everybody else jackson changed way industry functioned both as an artistic persona and as a financial profitable entity his attorney john branca observed that jackson achieved highest royalty rate in music industry to that point approximately 2 us in dollars for each album sold as a result jackson earned record breaking profits from compact disc sales and from sale of copies of documentary making of michael jackson s thriller produced by jackson and john landis funded by mtv film sold over 350 000 copies in its first few months in a market then driven by singles thriller raised significance of albums yet its multiple hit singles changed perceived notions as to number of successful singles that could be taken from an individual album era saw arrival of novelties like michael jackson doll that appeared in stores in may 1984 at a price of 12 us in dollars thriller retains a position in american culture biographer j randy taraborrelli explains at some point thriller stopped selling like a leisure item like a magazine a toy tickets to a hit movie and started selling like a household staple at time of album s release a press statement from gil friesen then president of a m records read that whole industry has a stake in this success time magazine speculated that fallout from thriller has given music business its best years since heady days of 1978 when it had an estimated total domestic revenue of 4 1 billion time summed up thrillers impact as a restoration of confidence for an industry bordering on ruins of punk and chic regions of synthesizer pop publication described jackson s influence at that point as star of records radio rock video a one man rescue team for music business a songwriter who sets beat for a decade a dancer with feet on street a singer who cuts across all boundaries of taste and style and color too when thriller and billie jean were searching to reach their market demographic mtv and cable tv had a smaller market share than much larger reach of broadcast television stations in united states a national broadcast tv audience on abc nbc and cbs affiliate stations as well as major independent tv stations was desired by cbs epic records to promote thriller national broadcast tv premiere of thriller album s first video billie jean was during week of halloween in october 1984 and was idea of video concert hall executive producers charles henderson and jerry crowe video concert hall first nationwide music video tv network taped one hour special in hollywood and atlanta where tv studios of video concert hall were located thriller tv special was hosted by thriller video co star vincent price distributed by henderson crowe inc and aired in top 20 tv markets and much of united states including tv stations wnew new york wfld chicago los angeles miami boston and atlanta for a total of 150 tv stations epic records reflected on importance of album saying more than just an album thriller has remained a global cultural multi media phenomenon for both 20th and 21st centuries smashing musical barriers and changing frontiers of pop forever music on thriller is so dynamic and singular that it defied any definition of rock pop or soul that had gone before from moment thriller was released it set standard for music industry artists record labels producers marketers and even choreographers music video was ahead of its time and it is considered a monumental one not only in jackson s career but also in history of pop music epic records approach to creating a song and video that would appeal to mass market ended up influencing way that professionals now market and release their songs john landis production of a mini movie rather than usual short music video would raise bar for other directors and producers music videos and racial equality thumb upright thrillers music videos and singles including paul mccartney duet girl is mine are credited with helping promote racial equality in united states before success of thriller many felt jackson had struggled to get mtv airing because he was black in an effort to attain air time for jackson cbs records president walter pressured mtv and declared i m not going to give you any more videos and i m going to go public and fucking tell them about fact you don t want to play music by a black guy his position persuaded mtv to begin airing billie jean and later beat it along with prince s little red corvette which led to a long partnership and later helped other black music artists to gain mainstream recognition mtv denies claims of racism in their broadcasting popularity of his videos such as beat it and billie jean helped to place young channel on map and mtv s focus shifted in favor of pop and r b jackson transformed medium of music video into an art form and promotional tool through use of complex story lines dance routines special effects and cameo appearances by well known personalities when 14 minute long thriller video aired mtv ran it twice an hour to meet demand short film marked an increase in scale for music videos and has been routinely named best music video ever popularity of video sent album back to number one in album chart but jackson s label did not support release of third music video from album they were already pleased with its success so jackson convinced mtv to fund project author music critic and journalist nelson george wrote in 2004 it s difficult to hear songs from thriller and disengage them from videos for most of us images define songs in fact it could be argued that michael is first artist of mtv age to have an entire album so intimately connected in public imagination with its imagery short films like thriller largely remained unique to jackson while group dance sequence in beat it has been frequently imitated choreography in thriller has become a part of global pop culture replicated everywhere from bollywood to prisons in philippines for a black artist in 1980s to that point jackson s success was unprecedented according to washington post thriller paved way for other african american artists to achieve mainstream recognition such as prince christgau credited girl is mine for giving radio exposure to idea of interracial love time wrote jackson is biggest thing since beatles he is hottest single phenomenon since elvis presley he just may be most popular black singer ever reappraisal thriller has continued to receive positive reviews stephen thomas erlewine of allmusic wrote that it had something to interest everyone he believed it showcased harder funk and hard rock while remaining undeniably fun and wrote that wanna be startin somethin was freshest funk on album but most claustrophobic scariest track jackson ever recorded erlewine felt it was an improvement on jackson s previous album although he was critical of title track describing it as ridiculous and sucked out momentum of record in new rolling stone album guide 2004 jon pareles wrote that jackson had doubled his ambitions and multiplied his audience thriller had extra musical help in becoming best selling non compilation album of all time jackson s dancing feet and dazzling stage presence amplified by newfound promotional reach of music video and reagan era s embrace of glossy celebrity but especially in album s seven hit singles out of nine songs music stands on its own sputnikmusic reviewer tyler fisher wrote that thriller stands one of jackson s greatest efforts giving him an eternal legacy in pop music culture critic nelson george wrote that jackson has educated r kelly usher justin timberlake and countless others with thriller as a textbook in 2002 as a sign of album s longevity
