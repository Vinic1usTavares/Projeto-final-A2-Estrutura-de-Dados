a double tuned amplifier is a tuned amplifier with transformer coupling between amplifier stages in which inductances of both primary and secondary windings are tuned separately with a capacitor across each scheme results in a wider bandwidth and steeper skirts than a single tuned circuit would achieve there is a critical value of transformer coupling coefficient at which frequency response of amplifier is maximally flat in passband and gain is maximum at resonant frequency designs frequently use a coupling greater than this over coupling in order to achieve an even wider bandwidth at expense of a small loss of gain in centre of passband cascading multiple stages of double tuned amplifiers results in a reduction of bandwidth of overall amplifier two stages of double tuned amplifier have 80 of bandwidth of a single stage an alternative to double tuning that avoids this loss of bandwidth is staggered tuning stagger tuned amplifiers can be designed to a prescribed bandwidth that is greater than bandwidth of any single stage however staggered tuning requires more stages and has lower gain than double tuning typical circuit thumb center upright 3 a typical 2 stage double tuned amplifier circuit shown consists of two stages of amplifier in common emitter topology bias resistors all serve their usual functions input of first stage is coupled in conventional way with a series capacitor to avoid affecting bias however collector load consists of a transformer which serves as inter stage coupling instead of capacitors windings of transformer have inductance capacitors placed across transformer windings form resonant circuits which provide tuning of amplifier a further detail that may be seen in this kind of amplifier is presence of taps on transformer windings these are used for input and output connections of transformer rather than top of windings this is done for impedance matching purposes bipolar junction transistor amplifiers kind shown in circuit have a quite high output impedance and a quite low input impedance this problem can be avoided by using mosfets which have a very high input impedance bhargava et al pp 382 383 capacitors connected between bottom of transformer secondary windings and ground do not form part of tuning rather their purpose is to decouple transistor bias resistors from ac circuit properties double tuning as compared to single tuning has effect of widening bandwidth of amplifier and skirt of response gulati p 432 tuning both sides of transformer forms a pair of coupled resonators which is source of increased bandwidth gain of amplifier is a function of coupling coefficient k which is related to mutual inductance m and primary and secondary winding inductances lp and ls respectively by there is a critical value of coupling at which gain of amplifier is a maximum at resonance below this critical value there is a single peak in frequency response with amplitude peaking at resonance and peak decreasing as k decreases such a response is said to be at values of k above critical coupling response starts to split into two peaks these peaks become narrower and further apart as k increases and gap between them centred on resonant frequency becomes progressively deeper such a response is said to be overcoupled a critically coupled amplifier has a response that is maximally flat this response can also be achieved without transformers with two stages of a stagger tuned amplifier unlike staggered tuning double tuning usually tunes both resonators to same resonant frequency chattopadhyay p 196 however a designer might choose to design an overcoupled amplifier in order to achieve a wider bandwidth at expense of a small dip typically to maximize bandwidth in centre of frequency response bakshi godse p 5 26 like synchronous tuning adding more stages of double tuned amplifiers has effect of reducing bandwidth bandwidth of n identical stages as a fraction of bandwidth of a single stage is given approximately by this expression applies only to small fractional bandwidths bakshi godse p 5 29 analysis circuit can be represented in a more generic way by replacing amplifiers with a generalised amplifier as shown thumb center upright 3 generic representation of one stage of a double tuned amplifier and part of following stage where omitting stage number suffixes go is output conductance of amplifiers gi is input conductance of amplifiers typically a design will make resonant frequencies and qs on primary and secondary sides identical such that and where is resonant frequency expressed in units of angular frequency and subscripts p and s refer respectively to components on primary and secondary side of transformer stage gain thumb upright 1 5 double tuned amplifier frequency response for various values of coupling with above assumptions voltage gain a of one stage of amplifier can be expressed as where is imaginary unit is maximum gain by stage and is frequency expressed as fractional frequency deviation from resonant frequency peak frequency with less than critical coupling there is one peak in response occurring at resonance above critical coupling there are two peaks at frequencies given by where dl and dh are respectively low and high frequencies of peaks expressed as fractional deviation with critical coupling or above peaks reach maximum gain available from amplifier critical coupling critical coupling occurs when two peaks just coincide that is when or bakshi godse pp 5 20 5 26 for entire analysis section references bibliography bakshi uday a godse
