to have electro gradually propel himself up tower with several electrical blasts cook retained classic silhouette of electro s suit from original comics but removed his star shaped mask cook made green key color in electro design noting that in 1960s it seems like majority of spider man s rogues gallery had green as part of their costumes in cook s broader color scheme for cartoon green is used to symbolize negative situations in peter s life while positive settings and occurrences such as peter s biology class feature other key colors like yellow electro was voiced by crispin freeman
