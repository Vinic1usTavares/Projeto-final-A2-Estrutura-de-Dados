mayflies also known as canadian soldiers in united states and as shadflies or in canada and upper midwestern u s also up winged flies in united kingdom are aquatic insects belonging to order ephemeroptera this order is part of an ancient group of insects termed which also contains dragonflies and damselflies over 3 000 species of mayfly are known worldwide grouped into over 400 genera in 42 families mayflies exhibit a number of ancestral traits that were probably present in first flying insects such as long tails and wings that do not fold flat over abdomen their immature stages are aquatic fresh water forms called naiads or nymphs whose presence indicates a clean unpolluted environment they are unique among insect orders in having a fully winged terrestrial adult stage subimago which moults into a sexually mature adult imago mayflies hatch emerge as adults from spring to autumn not necessarily in may in enormous numbers some hatches attract tourists fly fishermen make use of mayfly hatches by choosing artificial fishing flies that resemble species in question one of most famous english mayflies is germanica fisherman s march brown mayfly brief lives of mayfly adults have been noted by naturalists and since aristotle and pliny elder in classical times german engraver albrecht durer included a mayfly in his 1495 engraving holy family with mayfly to suggest a link between heaven and earth english poet george crabbe compared brief life of a daily newspaper with that of a mayfly in satirical poem newspaper 1785 both being known as ephemera description nymph thumb upright 0 6 left mayfly nymph dorsal view showing paired gills and three projections on abdomen wing buds are visible on thorax immature mayflies are aquatic and are referred to as nymphs or naiads in contrast to their short lives as adults they may live for several years in water they have an elongated cylindrical or somewhat flattened body that passes through a number of instars stages molting and increasing in size each time when ready to emerge from water nymphs vary in length depending on species from head has a tough outer covering of often with various hard ridges and projections it points either forwards or downwards with mouth at front there are two large compound eyes three ocelli simple eyes and a pair of antennae of variable lengths set between or in front of eyes mouthparts are designed for chewing and consist of a flap like labrum a pair of strong mandibles a pair of maxillae a membranous and a labium thumb upright 1 3 nymph of mayfly showing seven pairs of gills along sides of abdomen thorax consists of three segments hindmost two mesothorax and metathorax being fused each segment bears a pair of legs which usually terminate in a single claw legs are robust and often clad in bristles hairs or spines wing pads develop on mesothorax and in some species hindwing pads develop on metathorax abdomen consists of ten segments some of which may be obscured by a large pair of operculate gills a thoracic shield expanded part of prothorax or developing wing pads in most taxa up to seven pairs of gills arise from top or sides of abdomen but in some species they are under abdomen and in a very few species gills are instead located on coxae of legs or bases of maxillae abdomen terminates in a pair of or three slender thread like projections subimago final moult of nymph is not to full adult form but to a winged stage called a subimago that physically resembles adult but which is usually sexually immature and duller in colour subimago or dun often has partially cloudy wings fringed with minute hairs its eyes legs and genitalia are not fully developed subimagos are generally poor fliers and typically lack colour patterns used to attract mates after a period usually lasting one or two days but in some species only a few minutes subimago moults to full adult form making mayflies only insects where a winged form undergoes a further moult imago thumb upright adult with cylindrical dorsal or turban eyes visible adult mayflies or are relatively primitive in structure exhibiting traits that were probably present in first flying insects these include long tails and wings that do not fold flat over abdomen mayflies are delicate looking insects with one or two pairs of membranous triangular wings which are extensively covered with veins at rest wings are held upright like those of a butterfly hind wings are much smaller than forewings and may be vestigial or absent second segment of thorax which bears forewings is enlarged to hold main flight muscles adults have short flexible antennae large compound eyes three ocelli and non functional mouthparts in most species males eyes are large and front legs unusually long for use in locating and grasping females during mid air mating in males of some families there are two large cylindrical turban eyes that face upwards in addition to lateral eyes they are capable of detecting ultraviolet light and are thought to be used during courtship to detect females flying above them in some species all legs are apart from front pair in males abdomen is long and roughly cylindrical with ten segments and two or three long cerci tail like appendages at tip uniquely among insects mayflies possess paired genitalia with male having two penis like organs and female two gonopores sexual openings biology reproduction and life cycle thumb upright subimago of marginata mayflies are hemimetabolous they have incomplete metamorphosis they are unique among insects in that they moult one more time after acquiring functional wings this last but one winged alate instar usually lives a very short time and is known as a subimago or to fly fishermen as a dun mayflies at subimago stage are a favourite food of many fish and many fishing flies are modelled to resemble them subimago stage does not survive for long rarely for more than 24 hours in some species it may last for just a few minutes while mayflies in family palingeniidae have sexually mature subimagos and no true adult form at all thumb mayflies known locally as shadflies swarm briefly in enormous numbers in ontario often all mayflies in a population mature at once a hatch and for a day or two in spring or autumn mayflies are everywhere dancing around each other in large groups or resting on every available surface in many species emergence is synchronised with dawn or dusk and light intensity seems to be an important cue for emergence but other factors may also be involved baetis for example usually emerges just after sunset in july and august but in one year a large hatch was observed at midday in june soft bodied subimagos are very attractive to predators synchronous emergence is probably an adaptive strategy that reduces individual s risk of being eaten lifespan of an adult mayfly is very short varying with species primary function of adult is reproduction adults do not feed and have only vestigial unusable mouthparts while their digestive systems are filled with air americana has shortest adult lifespan of any mayfly adult females of species live for less than five minutes male adults may patrol individually but most congregate in swarms a few metres above water with clear open sky above it and perform a nuptial courtship dance each insect has a characteristic up and down pattern of movement strong wingbeats propel it upwards and forwards with tail sloping down when it stops moving its wings it falls passively with abdomen tilted upwards females fly into these swarms and mating takes place in air a rising male clasps thorax of a female from below using his front legs bent upwards and her copulation may last just a few seconds but occasionally a pair remains in tandem and flutters to ground males may spend night in vegetation and return to nuptial dance following day although they do not feed some briefly touch surface to drink a little water before flying off females typically lay between four hundred and three thousand eggs eggs are often dropped onto surface of water sometimes female deposits them by dipping tip of her abdomen into water during flight releasing a small batch of eggs each time or deposits them in bulk while standing next to water in a few species female submerges and places eggs among plants or in crevices underwater but in general they sink to bottom incubation time is variable depending at least in part on temperature and may be anything from a few days to nearly a year eggs can go into a quiet dormant phase or diapause larval growth rate is also temperature dependent as is number of moults at anywhere between ten and fifty these post embryonic moults are more numerous in mayflies than in most other insect orders nymphal stage of mayflies may last from several months to several years depending on species and environmental conditions many species breed in moving water where there is a tendency for eggs and nymphs to get washed downstream to counteract this females may fly upriver before depositing their eggs for example female tisza mayfly largest european species with a length of flies up to upstream before depositing eggs on water surface these sink to bottom and hatch after 45 days nymphs burrowing their way into sediment where they spend two or three years before hatching into subimagos when ready to emerge several different strategies are used in some species transformation of nymph occurs underwater and subimago swims to surface and launches itself into air in other species nymph rises to surface bursts out of its skin remains quiescent for a minute or two resting on exuviae cast skin and then flies upwards and in some nymph climbs out of water before transforming ecology thumb rainbow trout are among main predators of mayflies nymphs live primarily in streams under rocks in decaying vegetation or in sediments few species live in lakes but they are among most prolific for example emergence of one species of hexagenia was recorded on doppler weather radar by shoreline of lake erie in 2003 in nymphs of most mayfly species paddle like gills do not function as respiratory surfaces because sufficient oxygen is absorbed through integument instead serving to create a respiratory current however in low oxygen environments such as mud at bottom of ponds in which ephemera burrows filamentous gills act as true accessory respiratory organs and are used in gaseous exchange in most species nymphs are herbivores or detritivores feeding on algae diatoms or detritus but in a few species they are predators of chironomid and other small insect larvae and nymphs nymphs of povilla burrow into submerged wood and can be a problem for boat owners in asia some are able to shift from one feeding group to another as they grow thus enabling them to utilise a variety of food resources they process a great quantity of organic matter as nymphs and transfer a lot of phosphates and nitrates to terrestrial environments when they emerge from water thus helping to remove pollutants from aqueous systems along with caddisfly larvae and gastropod molluscs grazing of mayfly nymphs has a significant impact on primary producers plants and algae on bed of streams and rivers nymphs are eaten by a wide range of predators and form an important part of aquatic food chain fish are among main predators picking nymphs off bottom or ingesting them in water column and feeding on emerging nymphs and adults on water surface carnivorous stonefly caddisfly alderfly and dragonfly larvae feed on bottom dwelling mayfly nymphs as do aquatic beetles leeches crayfish and amphibians besides direct mortality caused by these predators behaviour of their potential prey is also affected with nymphs growth rate being slowed by need to hide rather than feed nymphs are highly susceptible to pollution and can be useful in of water bodies once they have emerged large numbers are preyed on by birds bats and by other insects mayfly nymphs may serve as hosts for parasites such as nematodes and trematodes some of these affect nymphs behaviour in such a way that they become more likely to be predated other nematodes turn adult male mayflies into quasi females which haunt edges of streams enabling parasites to break their way out into aqueous environment they need to complete their life cycles nymphs can also serve as intermediate hosts for horsehair worm varius which causes its definitive host a grasshopper to jump into water and drown effects on ecosystem functioning mayflies are involved in both primary production and bioturbation a study in laboratory simulated streams revealed that mayfly genus increased export of periphyton thus indirectly affecting primary production positively which is an essential process for ecosystems mayfly can also reallocate and alter nutrient availability in aquatic habitats through process of bioturbation by burrowing in bottom of lakes and redistributing nutrients mayflies indirectly regulate phytoplankton and epibenthic primary production once burrowing to bottom of lake mayfly nymphs begin to billow their respiratory gills this motion creates current that carries food particles through burrow and allows nymph to filter feed other mayfly nymphs possess elaborate filter feeding mechanisms like that of genus nymph have forelegs that contain long bristle like structures that have two rows of hairs interlocking hairs form filter by which insect traps food particles action of filter feeding has a small impact on water purification but an even larger impact on convergence of small particulate matter into matter of a more complex form that goes on to benefit consumers later in food chain distribution mayflies are distributed all over world in clean freshwater habitats though absent from antarctica they tend to be absent from oceanic islands or represented by one or two species that have dispersed from nearby mainland female mayflies may be dispersed by wind and eggs may be transferred by adhesion to legs of waterbirds greatest generic diversity is found in neotropic ecozone while holarctic has a smaller number of genera but a high degree of speciation some thirteen families are restricted to a single bioregion main families have some general habitat preferences baetidae favour warm water heptageniidae live under stones and prefer fast flowing water and relatively large ephemeridae make burrows in sandy lake or river beds conservation nymph is dominant life history stage of mayfly different insect species vary in their tolerance to water pollution but in general larval stages of mayflies stoneflies plecoptera and caddis flies trichoptera are susceptible to a number of pollutants including sewage pesticides and industrial effluent in general mayflies are particularly sensitive to acidification but tolerances vary and certain species are exceptionally tolerant to heavy metal contamination and to low ph levels ephemerellidae are among most tolerant groups and siphlonuridae and caenidae least adverse effects on insects of pollution may be either lethal or sub lethal in latter case resulting in altered enzyme function poor growth changed behaviour or lack of reproductive success as important parts of food chain pollution can cause knock on effects to other organisms a dearth of herbivorous nymphs can cause overgrowth of algae and a scarcity of nymphs can result in an over abundance of their prey species fish that feed on mayfly nymphs that have bioaccumulated heavy metals are themselves at risk adult female mayflies find water by detecting polarization of reflected light they are easily fooled by other polished surfaces which can act as traps for swarming mayflies threat to mayflies applies also to their eggs modest levels of pollution in rivers in england are sufficient to kill 80 of mayfly eggs which are as vulnerable to pollutants as other life cycle stages numbers of blue winged olive mayfly baetis have fallen dramatically almost to none in some rivers major pollutants thought to be responsible are fine sediment and phosphate from agriculture and sewage status of many species of mayflies is unknown because they are known from only original collection data four north american species are believed to be extinct among these robusta was originally collected from ohio river near cincinnati but this species has not been seen since its original collection in 1800s ephemera compar is known from a single specimen collected from foothills of colorado in 1873 but despite intensive surveys of colorado mayflies reported in 1984 it has not been rediscovered international union for conservation of nature iucn red list of threatened species includes one mayfly large blue

mickoleitiidae from lower cretaceous crato formation of brazil c 108 mya over 3 000 species of mayfly in 42 families and over 400 genera are known worldwide including about 630 species in north america mayflies are an ancient group of winged insects putative fossil stem group representatives e g like are already known from late carboniferous largest mayfly of all times may have been from upper carboniferous of moravia with a wingspan of name ephemeroptera is from greek short lived literally lasting a day cf english ephemeral and pteron wing referring to brief lifespan of adults english common name is for insect s emergence in or around month of may in uk name is from atlantic fish shad which runs up american east coast rivers at same time as many mayflies emerge from permian numerous stem group representatives of mayflies are known which are often lumped into a separate taxon permoplectoptera e g including in and larvae of permoplectoptera still had 9 pairs of abdominal gills and adults still had long hindwings maybe fossil family from lower cretaceous crato formation of brazil also belongs as last offshoot to permoplectoptera crato outcrops otherwise yielded fossil specimens of modern mayfly families or extinct but modern family however from same locality strange larvae and adults of extinct family mickoleitiidae order coxoplectoptera have been described which represents fossil sister group of modern mayflies even though they had very peculiar adaptations such as raptorial forelegs oldest mayfly inclusion in amber is leptophlebiidae from lower cretaceous of siberia in much younger baltic amber numerous inclusions of several modern families of mayflies have been found ephemeridae potamanthidae leptophlebiidae ametropodidae siphlonuridae isonychiidae heptageniidae and ephemerellidae modern genus is represented in fossil record by ypresian species n antiqua from washington state grimaldi and engel reviewing phylogeny in 2005 commented that many cladistic studies had been made with no stability in ephemeroptera suborders and infraorders traditional division into schistonota and pannota was wrong because pannota is derived from schistonota phylogeny of ephemeroptera was first studied using molecular analysis by ogden and whiting in 2005 they recovered baetidae as sister to other clades mayfly phylogeny was further studied using morphological and molecular analyses by ogden and others in 2009 they found that asian genus was sister to all other mayflies some existing lineages such as ephemeroidea and families such as ameletopsidae were found not to be monophyletic through convergence among nymphal features following traditional classification is based on peters and campbell 1991 in insects of australia suborder pannota superfamily ephemerellidae superfamily caenidae suborder schistonota superfamily siphlonuridae baetidae ameletopsidae ametropodidae superfamily isonychiidae heptageniidae superfamily

day of existence in fly fishing thumb left upright 1 3 fishing flies from charles and richard s art of angling 1854 2 blue dun mayfly 3 march brown mayfly mayflies are primary source of models for artificial flies hooks tied with coloured materials such as threads and feathers used in fly fishing these are based on different life cycle stages of mayflies for example flies known as in north america are designed by fly fishermen to resemble subimago mayflies and are intended to lure freshwater trout in 1983 patrick recorded that artificial flies had been based on 36 genera of north american mayfly from a total of 63 western species and 103 eastern central species a large number of these species have common names among fly fishermen who need to develop a substantial knowledge of mayfly habitat distribution seasonality morphology and behavior in order to match precisely look and movements of insects that local trout are expecting izaak walton describes use of mayflies for catching trout in his 1653 book compleat angler for example he names green drake for use as a natural fly and duns mayfly subimagos as artificial flies these include for example great dun and great blue dun in february whitish dun in march whirling dun and yellow dun in april green drake little yellow may fly and grey drake in may and black blue dun in july nymph or wet fly fishing was restored to popularity on chalk streams of england by g e m skues with his 1910 book minor tactics of chalk stream in book skues discusses use of duns to catch trout march brown is probably most famous of all british mayflies having been copied by anglers to catch trout for over 500 years some english public houses beside trout streams such as river test in hampshire are named mayfly as a spectacle hatch

content of any edible insect by dry weight in malawi kungu a paste of mayflies kungu and mosquitoes is made into a cake for eating adult mayflies are collected and eaten in many parts of china and japan near lake victoria povilla mayflies are collected dried and preserved for use in food preparations as a name for ships and aircraft mayfly was crew s nickname for his majesty s airship no 1 an aerial scout airship built by vickers but wrecked by strong winds in 1911 before her trial flights two vessels of royal navy were named hms mayfly a torpedo boat launched in january 1907 and a fly class river gunboat constructed in sections at yarrow in 1915 seddon mayfly which was constructed in 1908 was an aircraft that was unsuccessful in early flight first aircraft designed by a woman lillian bland was titled bland mayfly other human uses in pre 1950s france chute de manne was obtained by pressing mayflies into cakes and using them as bird food and fishbait from an economic standpoint mayflies also provide fisheries with an excellent diet for fish mayflies could find uses in biomedical pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries their exoskeleton contains chitin which has applications in these industries mayfly larvae do not survive in polluted aquatic habitats and thus have been chosen as bioindicators markers of water quality in ecological assessments in marketing
