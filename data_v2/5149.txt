culture arlington heights illinois daily heralds mark guarino observed that revival was cheered and scrutinized as a staunch revivalist of depression era music only because her originals sounded so much like that era he attributed this to biblical imagery of lyrics burnett s threadbare production and plainly sung bleakness in welch s vocals ann powers of rolling stone gave revival a lukewarm review and criticized welch for not singing of her own experiences and manufacturing emotion robert christgau echoed powers welch just doesn t have voice eye or way with words to bring her simulation

elements of rhythm and blues rock n roll jazz and punk rock new yorkers alec wilkinson maintained their musical style is not easily classified it is at once innovative and obliquely reminiscent of past rural forms left thumb alt a middle aged man wearing a dark suit playing guitar while welch in a black striped dress plays a banjo and sings on stage gillian welch playing banjo in a performance

guitar with a 1956 gibson j 50 or banjo while rawlings plays lead on a 1935 epiphone olympic guitar new yorkers wilkinson described rawlings as a strikingly inventive guitarist who plays solos that are daring melodic leaps a review in no depression by andy moore observed that rawlings squeezes strokes chokes and does just about everything but blow into his guitar themes many songs performed by welch and rawlings contain dark themes about social outcasts struggling against such elements as poverty drug addiction death a disconnection from their family and an unresponsive god despite welch being lead singer several of these characters are male welch has commented to be commercial everybody wants happy love songs people would flat out ask me don t you have any happy love songs well as a matter of fact i don t i ve got songs about orphans and morphine addicts to reflect these themes welch and rawlings often employ a slow pace to their songs their tempo is compared to a slow heartbeat

generation in 2003 tom of boston globe observed that she was quietly establishing one of most impressive catalogs in contemporary roots music and a 2007 piece in guardian by john harris called welch one of decade s greatest talents critic robert hilburn of los angeles times wrote at every turn she demonstrates a spark and commitment that should endear her to anyone from country and folk to pop and rock fans who appreciate imagination and heart when welch s first two albums came out critics questioned authenticity of her music as she was raised in southern california but performed appalachian themed songs for revival welch was criticized for manufacturing emotion and a review of hell among yearlings by chris herrington of city pages stated welch is someone who discovered old time music in college and decided that her own sheltered life could never be worth writing about and that she is completely devoid of individuality other critics rejected notion that her background affects authenticity of her music music critic mark kemp defended welch in a new york times piece first person protagonist of ms welch s song caleb meyer may be a young girl from a time and place that ms welch will never fully understand but feelings singer expresses about rape and respect she displays for her chosen musical genre are nothing if not poignantly authentic likewise it matters not whether ms welch has ever walked streets of black dust towns of east tennessee about which she sings in miner s refrain because sense of foreboding that she expresses for men who once labored in coal mines with futile hopes of a better life comes through loud and clear wall street journal s taylor holliday echoed this stingy critics give ms welch a hard time because she s a california city girl not an appalachian coal miner s daughter but as lucinda or emmylou might attest love of music is not a birthright but an earned right listen to ms welch yodel in a tune about that no good gal morphine and you know she s as mountain as they come on september 16 2015 duo was awarded lifetime achievement award for songwriting by americana music association influences and collaborations left thumb alt

and see what s really relevant welch has acknowledged inspiration from several traditional country artists including stanley brothers carter family louvin brothers and blue sky boys she explained her relationship with traditional music by saying i ve never tried to be traditional it s been a springboard for me and i love it and revere it and would not be doing what i do without music of monroe brothers stanley brothers and carter family however it was clear i was never going to be able to do exactly that i m a songwriter in addition to strong country influence welch also draws on a repertoire of such rock n roll artists as bob dylan chuck berry neil young grateful dead and velvet underground she has noted alternative rock bands throwing muses pixies and camper van beethoven don t directly inform my music but they re in there her cover of black star by radiohead became notorious and was released as a single in 2005 welch has recorded songs with a variety of notable artists
