creek and gully you would see their simple aboriginal homes made out of twigs and grass and their fires at night often as many as 500 to 600 would be camped in various places some behind botanic gardens on banks of river some toward ranges some on waterfall gully stringer 1986 their main presence demarcated by use of fire against purchasers of land was on river torrens and creeks that flowed into it including waterfall gully s first creek kleinig mt lofty a view down through early years land around waterfall gully provided original inhabitants with a number of resources bark from local stringybark trees eucalyptus obliqua was used in construction of winter huts and stones and native timbers were used to form tools food was also present and cossid moth larvae along with other species of plants and animals were collected nevertheless there were only a few resources that could only be found on slopes and both hunting and food gathering would in general have been easier on rich plains early colonial exploration thumb right 150px waterfall gully in 1866 one of earliest accounts of waterfall gully comes from a mr kent who along with captain collet barker and barker s servant miles climbed mount lofty in 1831 in making their ascent party skirted a ravine described by mr kent as possessing smooth and grassy sides which is believed by anne hardy to have been waterfall gully subsequent to barker s ascent first settlers who were recorded as having climbed mount lofty were bingham hutchinson and his servant william burt pair made three attempts to scale mount before succeeding and for their first attempt they attempted to traverse waterfall gully hardy 1989 p 6 attempt was unsuccessful but in july 1837 hutchinson wrote about gully through which they had travelled waterfall gully he wrote had proven difficult as plants were so thickly grown as to provide a significant barrier to their progress near point of surrender hutchinson described how they were agreeably surprised by seeing a wall of rock about fifty or sixty feet fifteen to eighteen metres high which stretched across ravine and from top of it leapt brook which had so long been their companion hutchinson in warburton 1981 pp 187 188 hutchinson reported that they continued climb but surrendered after being faced with another steep ravine separating them from their goal brook was first creek and waterfall they sighted is today known as first falls warburton 1977 p 28 nevertheless hutchinson was not first to see first falls first known recorded sighting of waterfall by a colonial was that of john william adams an emigrant of in early january 1837 who named it adams waterfall he was traveling with his wife susanna and a party consisting of nicholson s and breaker s who had use of a dray to go into hills adams states we were opposite spot where eagle on hill now is and question was put who would volunteer to go down hillside to try for water stringer 1980 development area soon became a tourist attraction for early south australian colonists and was a popular destination for picnickers in 1851 francis clark wrote that waterfall gully is most picturesque place for a picnic that i have ever visited clark francis in warburton 1981 p 188 and by 1860s area had become known throughout adelaide use of waterfall gully as picnic spot was facilitated by decision of government of day not to subdivide area containing waterfalls section 920 as it was designated did not enter into private hands and thus members of public were able to access area from nearby suburb of eagle on hill on mount barker road warburton 1981 p 188 position of eagle on hill hotel proved advantageous for this as it permitted visitors to stop by for lunch before walking down hill in afternoon warburton 1981 p 102 thumb left view of waterfall gully in south australia as seen from eagle on hill in 1910 other parts of waterfall gully area were subdivided though and much of area was owned by samuel davenport davenport used land for timber grazing and cultivation of various crops including olives and grapes for wine production warburton 1977 pp 28 31 other local residents ran market gardens and nurseries for example local residents wilhelm mugge and his wife auguste schmidt operated one of best nurseries and market gardens near adelaide and gained a reputation for cheeses produced from their local dairy farm warburton 1981 pp 188 189 along with farming hills and creek were prized areas for sawyers and splitters and a number of mines were established in region from mid to late 19th century in 1844 first silver lead manganese and iron mines were established in area while 1890s saw a minor gold rush although only small quantities were extracted warburton 1981 p 193 of greater success was stone quarrying in chambers gully which began in 1863 and increased in scale in 1912 waterfall gully was also site of burnside s first secondary industry ifould 1956 p 43 in late 1830s thomas cain built a watermill on first creek for john cannan which was then employed to power a sawmill on cannan s property cannan operated mill as mill for approximately two years before selling venture to a mr finniss finniss opted to run mill as a flour mill instead and mill was rebuilt and renamed mill mill continued to operate under a variety of owners until late 1850s but it was dismantled during 1880s and today only traces of earthworks remain jones 1981 pp 106 107 thumb first falls in late 1800s with weir visible in foreground during this period population of nearby village of burnside was expanding and required a new water supply first creek which runs down waterfall gully and enters river torrens near today s botanic gardens was seen as perfect solution to water shortage a weir was built during 1881 and 1882 and was made to hold approximately two 530 000 us gallons of water a pipeline was constructed to reservoir at burnside south 1956 p 87 and from there water was used throughout surrounding area warburton 1981 p 190 as a side effect weir also reduced volume of water available to local market gardeners and over many years that aspect of region disappeared warburton 1981 p 192 while route to falls from eagle on hill was on public land alternative route along gully was through private properties nevertheless many visitors chose this route and a combination of public demand and a desire from some of landowners for improved access to and from their properties especially from mugge family led to pressure to build a road through gully although there was opposition from some of locals waterfall gully road was built in late 1880s warburton 1981 pp 189 190 completion of road led to an increase in visitor numbers rather than a bumpy horse ride warburton 1981 p 189 visitors could now catch horse tram to start of gully and walk cycle or ride to falls warburton 1981 pp 191 192 to provide for tourists area gained a number of road side kiosks and produce

boundaries were established melbourne p 11 government of day chose to retain control of a significant portion of waterfall gully hardy 1989 p 7 thus it was not until 1884 that remaining land was transferred to control of burnside council largely through efforts of samuel davenport and g f cleland land remained under burnside council s control until 1915 when waterfall gully reserve was reclaimed by government as first national pleasure resort in state initially reserve was placed under jurisdiction of national parks advisory board but later it was moved to tourist bureau before finally becoming part of national park commission s portfolio hardy 1989 pp 8 11 in 1945 much of area that is today s cleland conservation park was purchased by state government largely thanks to
