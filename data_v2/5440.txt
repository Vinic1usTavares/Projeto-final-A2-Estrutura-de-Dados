awhile melanie andrews jackson jimmy jam terry lewis and christopher bolden s not like you do reception just chillin received less than favorable critical reception allmusic s matt collar awarded album two out of five stars and noted his preference for brown s 1994 studio album after storm collar thought that brown incorporated too many programmed drums and mid tempo jams producing more urban and gritty tracks than his other instrumental albums he compared feeling i get to instrumental maxwell and called janet jackson s let s wait awhile a standout track which reflects brown s overall vision to turn jazz to pop and vice versa chris walker of jazztimes also noted album s laid back pace almost too relaxed and thought it lacked brown s trademark walker complimented vocalists performances which produced a pleasant soulful aura but felt they were far removed from brown he wrote that just chillin and dancing in house displayed brown s acumen walker also complimented night drive in part because of braun s trumpet performance and considered let s wait awhile highlight of album in 2003 album earned brown grammy award for best pop instrumental album track listing track
