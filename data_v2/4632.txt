europa or as jupiter ii is smallest of four galilean moons orbiting jupiter and sixth closest to planet of all 79 known moons of jupiter it is also sixth largest moon in solar system europa was discovered in 1610 by galileo galilei and was named after europa phoenician mother of king minos of crete and lover of zeus greek equivalent of roman god jupiter slightly smaller than earth s moon europa is primarily made of silicate rock and has a water ice crust and probably an iron nickel core it has a very thin atmosphere composed primarily of oxygen its surface is striated by cracks and streaks but craters are relatively few in addition to earth bound telescope observations europa has been examined by a succession of space probe flybys first occurring in early 1970s europa has smoothest surface of any known solid object in solar system apparent youth and smoothness of surface have led to hypothesis that a water ocean exists beneath it which could conceivably harbor extraterrestrial life predominant model suggests that heat from tidal flexing causes ocean to remain liquid and drives ice movement similar to plate tectonics absorbing chemicals from surface into ocean below sea salt from a subsurface ocean may be coating some geological features on europa suggesting that ocean is interacting with sea floor this may be important in determining whether europa could be habitable in addition hubble space telescope detected water vapor plumes similar to those observed on saturn s moon enceladus which are thought to be caused by erupting in may 2018 astronomers provided supporting evidence of water plume activity on europa based on an updated critical analysis of data obtained from galileo space probe which orbited jupiter from 1995 to 2003 such plume activity could help researchers in a search for life from subsurface europan ocean without having to land on moon galileo mission launched in 1989 provides bulk of current data on europa no spacecraft has yet landed on europa although there have been several proposed exploration missions european space agency s jupiter icy moon explorer juice is a mission to ganymede that is due to launch in 2022 and will include two flybys of europa nasa s planned europa clipper should be launched in 2025 discovery and naming europa along with jupiter s three other large moons io ganymede and callisto was discovered by galileo galilei on 8 january 1610 and possibly independently by simon marius first reported observation of io and europa was made by galileo on 7 january 1610 using a magnification refracting telescope at university of padua however in that observation galileo could not separate io and europa due to low magnification of his telescope so that two were recorded as a single point of light following day 8 january 1610 used as discovery date for europa by iau io and europa were seen for first time as separate bodies during galileo s observations of jupiter system europa is named after europa daughter of king of tyre a phoenician noblewoman in greek mythology like all galilean satellites europa is named after a lover of zeus greek counterpart of jupiter europa was courted by zeus and became queen of crete naming scheme was suggested by simon marius who attributed proposal to johannes kepler marius s 1614 mundus iovialis anno m dc ix ope where he attributes suggestion to johannes kepler names fell out of favor for a considerable time and were not revived in general use until mid 20th century in much of earlier astronomical literature europa is simply referred to by its roman numeral designation as a system also introduced by galileo or as second satellite of jupiter in 1892 discovery of amalthea whose orbit lay closer to jupiter than those of galilean moons pushed europa to third position voyager probes discovered three more inner satellites in 1979 so europa is now considered jupiter s sixth satellite though it is still sometimes referred to as orbit and rotation thumb right galilean moons around jupiter thumb right animation showing io s laplace resonance with europa and ganymede europa orbits jupiter in just over three and a half days with an orbital radius of about 670 900 km with an orbital eccentricity of only 0 009 orbit itself is nearly circular and orbital inclination relative to jupiter s equatorial plane is small at 0 like its fellow galilean satellites europa is tidally locked to jupiter with one hemisphere of europa constantly facing jupiter because of this there is a sub jovian point on europa s surface from which jupiter would appear to hang directly overhead europa s prime meridian is a line passing through this point research suggests that tidal locking may not be full as a non synchronous rotation has been proposed europa spins faster than it orbits or at least did so in past this suggests an asymmetry in internal mass distribution and that a layer of subsurface liquid separates icy crust from rocky interior slight eccentricity of europa s orbit maintained by gravitational disturbances from other causes europa s sub jovian point to oscillate around a mean position as europa comes slightly nearer to jupiter jupiter s gravitational attraction increases causing europa to elongate towards and away from it as europa moves slightly away from jupiter jupiter s gravitational force decreases causing europa to relax back into a more spherical shape and creating tides in its ocean orbital eccentricity of europa is continuously pumped by its mean motion resonance with io thus tidal flexing kneads europa s interior and gives it a source of heat possibly allowing its ocean to stay liquid while driving subsurface geological processes ultimate source of this energy is jupiter s rotation which is tapped by io through tides it raises on jupiter and is transferred to europa and ganymede by orbital resonance analysis of unique cracks lining europa yielded evidence that it likely spun around a tilted axis at some point in time if correct this would explain many of europa s features europa s immense network of crisscrossing cracks serves as a record of stresses caused by massive tides in its global ocean europa s tilt could influence calculations of how much of its history is recorded in its frozen shell how much heat is generated by tides in its ocean and even how long ocean has been liquid its ice layer must stretch to accommodate these changes when there is too much stress it cracks a tilt in europa s axis could suggest that its cracks may be much more recent than previously thought reason for this is that direction of spin pole may change by as much as a few degrees per day completing one precession period over several months a tilt could also affect estimates of age of europa s ocean tidal forces are thought to generate heat that keeps europa s ocean liquid and a tilt in spin axis would cause more heat to be generated by tidal forces such additional heat would have allowed ocean to remain liquid for a longer time however it has not yet been determined when this hypothesized shift in spin axis might have occurred cook jia rui c 18 september 2013 long stressed europa likely off kilter at one time jpl nasa gov physical characteristics thumb size comparison of europa lower left with moon top left and earth right europa is slightly smaller than moon at just over in diameter it is sixth largest moon and fifteenth largest object in solar system though by a wide margin least massive of galilean satellites it is nonetheless more massive than all known moons in solar system smaller than itself combined mass of europa 48 kg mass of triton plus all smaller moons 39 5 kg see note g here its bulk density suggests that it is similar in composition to terrestrial planets being primarily composed of silicate rock internal structure it is estimated that europa has an outer layer of water around thick a part frozen as its crust and a part as a liquid ocean underneath ice recent magnetic field data from galileo orbiter showed that europa has an induced magnetic field through interaction with jupiter s which suggests presence of a subsurface conductive layer this layer is likely a salty liquid water ocean portions of crust are estimated to have undergone a rotation of nearly 80deg nearly flipping over see true polar wander which would be unlikely if ice were solidly attached to mantle europa probably contains a metallic iron core surface features thumb approximate natural color left and enhanced color right galileo view of leading hemisphere europa is smoothest known object in solar system lacking large scale features such as mountains and craters however according to one study europa s equator may be covered in icy spikes called penitentes which may be up to 15 meters high due to direct overhead sunlight on equator causing ice to sublime forming vertical cracks europa may have towering ice spikes on its surface paul

geoscience 8 october 2018 although imaging available from galileo orbiter does not have resolution needed to confirm this radar and thermal data are consistent with this interpretation prominent markings crisscrossing europa appear to be mainly albedo features that emphasize low topography there are few craters on europa because its surface is tectonically too active and therefore young arnett bill 7 november 1996 europa astro auth gr europa s icy crust has an albedo light reflectivity of 0 64 one of highest of all moons this indicates a young and active surface based on estimates of

cratering record of galilean satellites pp 427 ff in jupiter planet satellites and magnetosphere cambridge university press there is currently no full scientific consensus among sometimes contradictory explanations for surface features of europa radiation level at surface of europa is equivalent to a dose of about 5400 msv 540 rem per day an amount of radiation that would cause severe illness or death in human beings exposed for a single day effects of nuclear weapons revised ed us dod 1962 pp 592 593 lineae alt thumb realistic color galileo mosaic of europa s anti jovian hemisphere showing numerous lineae thumb right enhanced color view showing intricate pattern of linear fractures on europa s surface europa s most striking surface features are a series of dark streaks crisscrossing entire globe called close examination shows that edges of europa s crust on either side of cracks have moved relative to each other larger bands are more than across often with dark diffuse outer edges regular striations and a central band of lighter material most likely hypothesis is that lineae on europa were produced by a series of eruptions of warm ice as europan crust spread open to expose warmer layers beneath effect would have been similar to that seen in earth s oceanic ridges these various fractures are thought to have been caused in large part by tidal flexing exerted by jupiter because europa is tidally locked to jupiter and therefore always maintains approximately same orientation towards jupiter stress patterns should form a distinctive and predictable pattern however only youngest of europa s fractures conform to predicted pattern other fractures appear to occur at increasingly different orientations older they are this could be explained if europa s surface rotates slightly faster than its interior an effect that is possible due to subsurface ocean mechanically decoupling europa s surface from its rocky mantle and effects of jupiter s gravity tugging on europa s outer ice crust comparisons of voyager and galileo spacecraft photos serve to put an upper limit on this hypothetical slippage a full revolution of outer rigid shell relative to interior of europa takes at least 12 000 years studies of voyager and galileo images have revealed evidence of subduction on europa s surface suggesting that just as cracks are analogous to ocean ridges so plates of icy crust analogous to tectonic plates on earth are recycled into molten interior together evidence for crustal spreading at bands and convergence at other sites marks first evidence for plate tectonics on any world other than earth other geological features other features present on europa are circular and elliptical lenticulae latin for freckles many are domes some are pits and some are smooth dark spots others have a jumbled or rough texture dome tops look like pieces of older plains around them suggesting that domes formed when plains were pushed up from below one hypothesis states that these lenticulae were formed by diapirs of warm ice rising up through colder ice of outer crust much like magma chambers in earth s crust smooth dark spots could be formed by meltwater released when warm ice breaks through surface rough jumbled lenticulae called regions of chaos for example chaos would then be formed from many small fragments of crust embedded in hummocky dark material appearing like icebergs in a frozen sea an alternative hypothesis suggest that lenticulae are actually small areas of chaos and that claimed pits spots and domes are artefacts resulting from over interpretation of early low resolution galileo images implication is that ice is too thin to support convective diapir model of feature formation in november 2011 a team of researchers from university of texas at austin and elsewhere presented evidence in journal nature suggesting that many chaos terrain features on europa sit atop vast lakes of liquid water these lakes would be entirely encased in europa s icy outer shell and distinct from a liquid ocean thought to exist farther down beneath ice shell full confirmation of lakes existence will require a space mission designed to probe ice shell either physically or indirectly for example using radar subsurface ocean thumb two possible models of europa scientists consensus is that a layer of liquid water exists beneath europa s surface and that heat from tidal flexing allows subsurface ocean to remain liquid europa s surface temperature averages about at equator and only at poles keeping europa s icy crust as hard as granite first hints of a subsurface ocean came from theoretical considerations of tidal heating a consequence of europa s slightly eccentric orbit and orbital resonance with other galilean moons galileo imaging team members argue for existence of a subsurface ocean from analysis of voyager and galileo images greenberg richard 2005 europa ocean moon search for an alien biosphere springer praxis books most dramatic example is chaos terrain a common feature on europa s surface that some interpret as a region where subsurface ocean has melted through icy crust this interpretation is controversial most geologists who have studied europa favor what is commonly called thick ice model in which ocean has rarely if ever directly interacted with present surface greeley ronald et al 2004 chapter 15 geology of europa pp 329 ff in jupiter planet satellites and magnetosphere cambridge university press best evidence for thick ice model is a study of europa s large craters largest impact structures are surrounded by concentric rings and appear to be filled with relatively flat fresh ice based on this and on calculated amount of heat generated by europan tides it is estimated that outer crust of solid ice is approximately 10 30 km 6 19 mi thick including a ductile warm ice layer which could mean that liquid ocean underneath may be about deep this leads to a volume of europa s oceans of 3 x 1018 m3 between two or three times volume of earth s oceans thin ice model suggests that europa s ice shell may be only a few kilometers thick however most planetary scientists conclude that this model considers only those topmost layers of europa s crust that behave elastically when affected by jupiter s tides one example is flexure analysis in which europa s crust is modeled as a plane or sphere weighted and flexed by a heavy load models such as this suggest outer elastic portion of ice crust could be as thin as if ice shell of europa is really only a few kilometers thick this thin ice model would mean that regular contact of liquid interior with surface could occur through open ridges causing formation of areas of chaotic terrain composition galileo orbiter found that europa has a weak magnetic moment which is induced by varying part of jovian magnetic field field strength at magnetic equator about 120 nt created by this magnetic moment is about one sixth strength of ganymede s field and six times value of callisto s existence of induced moment requires a layer of a highly electrically conductive material in europa s interior most plausible candidate for this role is a large subsurface ocean of liquid saltwater since voyager spacecraft flew past europa in 1979 scientists have worked to understand composition of reddish brown material that coats fractures and other geologically youthful features on europa s surface spectrographic evidence suggests that dark reddish streaks and features on europa s surface may be rich in salts such as magnesium sulfate deposited by evaporating water that emerged from within sulfuric acid hydrate is another possible explanation for contaminant observed spectroscopically in either case because these materials are colorless or white when pure some other material must also be present to account for reddish color and sulfur compounds are suspected another hypothesis for colored regions is that they are composed of abiotic organic compounds collectively called tholins mise a search for organics on europa whalen kelly jonathan i blaney diana l american astronomical society aas meeting 229 id 138 04 january 2017 morphology of europa s impact craters and ridges is suggestive of fluidized material welling up from fractures where pyrolysis and radiolysis take place in order to generate colored tholins on europa there must be a source of materials carbon nitrogen and water and a source of energy to make reactions occur impurities in water ice crust of europa are presumed both to emerge from interior as cryovolcanic events that resurface body and to accumulate from space as interplanetary dust tholins bring important implications as they may play a role in prebiotic chemistry and prebiotic chemistry

sodium chloride in internal ocean has been suggested by a 450 nm absorption feature characteristic of irradiated nacl crystals that has been spotted in hst observations of chaos regions presumed to be areas of recent subsurface upwelling sources of heat tidal heating occurs through tidal friction and tidal flexing processes caused by tidal acceleration orbital and rotational energy are dissipated as heat in core of moon internal ocean and ice crust tidal friction ocean tides are converted to heat by frictional losses in oceans and their interaction with solid bottom and with top ice crust in late 2008 it was suggested jupiter may keep europa s oceans warm by generating large planetary tidal waves on europa because of its small but non zero obliquity this generates so called rossby waves that travel quite slowly at just a few kilometers per day but can generate significant kinetic energy for current axial tilt estimate of 0 1 degree resonance from rossby waves would contain 7 3 j of kinetic energy which is two thousand times larger than that of flow excited by dominant tidal forces dissipation of this energy could be principal heat source of europa s ocean tidal flexing tidal flexing kneads europa s interior and ice shell which becomes a source of heat depending on amount of tilt heat generated by ocean flow could be 100 to thousands of times greater than heat generated by flexing of europa s rocky core in response to gravitational pull from jupiter and other moons circling that planet europa s seafloor could be heated by moon s constant flexing driving hydrothermal activity similar to undersea volcanoes in earth s oceans experiments and ice modeling published in 2016 indicate that tidal flexing dissipation can generate one order of magnitude more heat in europa s ice than scientists had previously assumed their results indicate that most of heat generated by ice actually comes from ice s crystalline structure lattice as a result of deformation and not friction between ice grains greater deformation of ice sheet more heat is generated radioactive decay in addition to tidal heating interior of europa could also be heated by decay of radioactive material radiogenic heating within rocky mantle but models and values observed are one hundred times higher than those that could be produced by radiogenic heating alone thus implying that tidal heating has a leading role in europa plumes thumb right 150px water plumes on europa detected by galileo space probe thumb left 150px photo composite of suspected water plumes on europa hubble space telescope acquired an image of europa in 2012 that was interpreted to be a plume of water vapour erupting from near its south pole image suggests plume may be high or more than 20 times height of mt everest it has been suggested that if they exist they are episodic and likely to appear when europa is at its farthest point from jupiter in agreement with tidal force modeling predictions additional imaging evidence from hubble space telescope was presented in september 2016 in may 2018 astronomers provided supporting evidence of water plume activity on europa based on an updated critical analysis of data obtained from galileo space probe which orbited jupiter between 1995 and 2003 galileo flew by europa in 1997 within of moon s surface and researchers suggest it may have flown through a water plume such plume activity could help researchers in a search for life from subsurface european ocean without having to land on moon tidal forces are about 1 000 times stronger than moon s effect on earth only other moon in solar system exhibiting water vapor plumes is enceladus estimated eruption rate at europa is about 7000 kg s compared to about 200 kg s for plumes of enceladus if confirmed it would open possibility of a flyby through plume and obtain a sample to analyze in situ without having to use a lander and drill through miles of ice atmosphere observations with goddard high resolution spectrograph of hubble space telescope first described in 1995 revealed that europa has a thin atmosphere composed mostly of molecular oxygen o2 surface pressure of europa s atmosphere is 0 1 mpa or 10 12 times that of earth in 1997 galileo spacecraft confirmed presence of a tenuous ionosphere an upper atmospheric layer of charged particles around europa created by solar radiation and energetic particles from jupiter s magnetosphere providing evidence of an atmosphere thumb left upright magnetic field around europa red line shows a trajectory of galileo spacecraft during a typical flyby e4 or e14 unlike oxygen in earth s atmosphere europa s is not of biological origin surface bounded atmosphere forms through radiolysis dissociation of molecules through radiation solar ultraviolet radiation and charged particles ions and electrons from jovian magnetospheric environment collide with europa s icy surface splitting water into oxygen and hydrogen constituents these chemical components are then adsorbed and sputtered into atmosphere same radiation also creates collisional ejections of these products from surface and balance of these two processes forms an atmosphere molecular oxygen is densest component of atmosphere because it has a long lifetime after returning to surface it does not stick freeze like a water or hydrogen peroxide molecule but rather from surface and starts another ballistic arc molecular hydrogen never reaches surface as it is light enough to escape europa s surface gravity observations of surface have revealed that some of molecular oxygen produced by radiolysis is not ejected from surface because surface may interact with subsurface ocean considering geological discussion above this molecular oxygen may make its way to ocean where it could aid in biological processes one estimate suggests that given turnover rate inferred from apparent 0 5 gyr maximum age of europa s surface ice subduction of generated oxidizing species might well lead to oceanic free oxygen concentrations that are comparable to those in terrestrial deep oceans molecular hydrogen that escapes europa s gravity along with atomic and molecular oxygen forms a gas torus in vicinity of europa s orbit around jupiter this neutral cloud has been detected by both cassini and galileo spacecraft and has a greater content number of atoms and molecules than neutral cloud surrounding jupiter s inner moon io models predict that almost every atom or molecule in europa s torus is eventually ionized thus providing a source to jupiter s

missions two voyager probes traveled through jovian system in 1979 providing more detailed images of europa s icy surface images caused many scientists to speculate about possibility of a liquid ocean

that would melt through ice until it reached an ocean below once it reached water it would deploy an autonomous underwater vehicle hydrobot that would gather information and send it back to earth both cryobot and hydrobot would have to undergo some form of extreme sterilization to prevent detection of earth organisms instead of native life and to prevent contamination of subsurface ocean this suggested approach has not yet reached a formal conceptual planning stage habitability potential thumb upright a black smoker in atlantic ocean driven by geothermal energy this and other types of hydrothermal vents create chemical that can provide energy sources for life so far there is no evidence that life exists on europa but europa has emerged as one of most likely locations in solar system for potential habitability life could exist in its under ice ocean perhaps in an environment similar to earth s deep ocean hydrothermal vents even if europa lacks volcanic hydrothermal activity a 2016 nasa study found that earth like levels of hydrogen and oxygen could be produced through processes related to serpentinization and ice derived oxidants which do not directly involve volcanism in 2015 scientists announced that salt from a subsurface ocean may likely be coating some geological features on europa suggesting that ocean is interacting with seafloor this may be important in determining if europa could be habitable likely presence of liquid water in contact with europa s rocky mantle has spurred calls to send a probe there phillips cynthia 28 september 2006 time for

obvious degree on its sister moon io although europa like earth may possess an internal energy source from radioactive decay energy generated by tidal flexing would be several orders of magnitude greater than any radiological source life on europa could exist clustered around hydrothermal vents on ocean floor or below ocean floor where are known to inhabit on earth alternatively it could exist clinging to lower surface of europa s ice layer much like algae and bacteria in earth s polar regions or float freely in europa s ocean if europa s ocean is too cold biological processes similar to those known on earth could not take place if it is too salty only extreme could survive in that environment in 2010 a model proposed by richard greenberg of university of arizona proposed that irradiation of ice on europa s surface could saturate its crust with oxygen and peroxide which could then be transported by tectonic processes into interior ocean such a process could render europa s ocean as oxygenated as our own within just 12 million years allowing existence of complex multicellular lifeforms evidence suggests existence of lakes of liquid water entirely encased in europa s icy outer shell and distinct from a liquid ocean thought to exist farther down beneath ice shell if confirmed lakes could be yet another potential habitat for life evidence suggests that hydrogen peroxide
