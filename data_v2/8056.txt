abu l abbas ahmad ibn talha al muwaffaq 853 4 or 860 1 5 april 902 better known by his regnal name al mu tadid bi llah seeking support in god was caliph of abbasid caliphate from 892 until his death in 902 al mu tadid was son of al muwaffaq who was regent and effective ruler of abbasid state during reign of his brother caliph al mu tamid as a prince future al mu tadid served under his father during various military campaigns most notably in suppression of zanj rebellion in which he played a major role when al muwaffaq died in june 891 al mu tadid succeeded him as regent he quickly sidelined his cousin and heir apparent al when al mu tamid died in october 892 he succeeded to throne like his father al mu tadid s power depended on his close relations with army these were first forged during campaigns against zanj and were reinforced in later expeditions which caliph led in person al mu tadid would prove to be most militarily active of all abbasid caliphs through his energy and ability he succeeded in restoring to abbasid state some of power and provinces it had lost during turmoil of previous decades in a series of campaigns he recovered provinces of jazira thughur and jibal and effected a rapprochement with saffarids in east and tulunids in west that secured their albeit largely nominal recognition of caliphal suzerainty these successes came at cost of gearing economy almost exclusively towards maintenance of army which resulted in expansion and rise to power of central fiscal bureaucracy and contributed to caliph s lasting reputation for avarice al mu tadid was renowned for his cruelty when punishing criminals and subsequent chroniclers recorded his extensive and ingenious use of torture his reign saw permanent move of capital back to baghdad where he engaged in major building activities a firm supporter of sunni traditionalist orthodoxy he nevertheless maintained good relations with alids and was interested in natural sciences renewing caliphal sponsorship of scholars and scientists despite his successes al mu tadid s reign was ultimately too short to effect a lasting reversal of caliphate s fortunes and revival that he spearheaded was too dependent on presence of capable personalities at helm of state brief reign of his less able son and heir al muktafi still saw some major gains notably annexation of tulunid domains but his later successors lacked his energy and new enemies appeared in form of qarmatians in addition factionalism within bureaucracy that had become apparent during later years of al mu tadid s reign would abbasid government for decades to come eventually leading to subjugation of caliphate by a series of military strongmen culminating in conquest of baghdad by buyids in 946 early life thumb right upright 1 2 alt family tree with caliphs marked in green family tree of abbasid dynasty in middle and late 9th century al mu tadid was born ahmad son of talha one of sons of abbasid caliph al mutawakkil and a greek slave named exact date of his birth is unknown as he is variously recorded as being thirty eight or thirty one years old at time of his accession he was born around either 854 or 861 in 861 al mutawakkil was murdered by his turkish guards in collusion with his oldest son al this began a period of internal turmoil known as anarchy at samarra from site of caliphate s capital which ended in 870 with rise to throne of ahmad s uncle al mu tamid real power however had come to lie with elite turkish slave soldiers ghilman and with ahmad s own father talha who as caliphate s main military commander served as chief intermediary between caliphal government and turks assuming honorific name al muwaffaq in style of caliphs talha soon became effective ruler of caliphate a position consolidated in 882 after a failed attempt by al mu tamid to flee to egypt led to his confinement in house arrest caliphal authority in provinces collapsed during anarchy at samarra with result that by 870s central government had lost effective control over most of caliphate outside metropolitan region of iraq in west egypt had fallen under control of turkish slave soldier ahmad ibn tulun who also disputed control of syria with al muwaffaq while khurasan and most of islamic east had been taken over by saffarids a dynasty who replaced abbasids loyal clients tahirids most of arabian peninsula was likewise lost to local potentates while in tabaristan a radical zaydi shi a dynasty took power even in iraq rebellion of zanj african slaves brought to work in plantations of lower iraq threatened baghdad itself and further south qarmatians were a nascent threat al muwaffaq s regency was thus a continuous struggle to save tottering caliphate from collapse his attempts to recover control of egypt and syria from ibn tulun failed with latter even able to expand his territory and obtain recognition as a hereditary ruler but he succeeded in preserving core of caliphate in iraq by repelling a saffarid invasion aimed at capturing baghdad and by subduing zanj after a long struggle campaigns against zanj and tulunids thumb right upright 1 2 alt geophysical map with regions and major cities map of region of iraq in 9th 10th centuries it was against zanj that future al mu tadid at this time usually referred to by his kunya of abu l abbas would acquire his first military experience and establish close army ties that would characterize his reign al muwaffaq gave his son a military upbringing from an early age and young prince became an excellent rider and a solicitous commander who showed personal attention to state of his men and their horses within a decade of outbreak of revolt in 869 zanj had seized most of lower iraq including cities of basra and wasit and expanded into khuzistan in 879 death of founder of saffarid state ya qub al saffar allowed abbasid government to fully concentrate its attention against zanj rebellion and abu l abbas appointment to command in december 879 at head of 10 000 troops marks turning point of war in long and hard struggle that followed which involved amphibious operations in mesopotamian marshes abu l abbas and his own ghilman of which long serving al turki was most eminent played major role although abbasid armies eventually swelled with reinforcements volunteers and zanj defectors it was few but elite ghilman who formed army s backbone filling its leadership positions and bearing brunt of battle often under personal command of abu l abbas after years of gradually tightening noose around zanj in august 883 abbasid troops stormed their capital of al putting an end to rebellion a detailed account of war by a former zanj rebel preserved in history written by al tabari stresses role of al muwaffaq and abu l abbas as heroes who in defence of embattled muslim state suppressed rebellion successful campaign would become a major tool in their propaganda effort to legitimize their de facto usurpation of caliph s power following death of ibn tulun in may 884 two caliphal generals ishaq ibn kundaj and ibn abu l saj sought to take advantage of situation and attacked tulunid domains in syria but their initial gains were rapidly reversed in spring of 885 abu l abbas was sent to take charge of invasion he soon succeeded in defeating tulunids and forcing them to retreat to palestine but after a quarrel with ibn kundaj and ibn abu l saj latter two abandoned campaign and withdrew their forces in battle of tawahin on 6 april abu l abbas confronted ibn tulun s son and heir khumarawayh in person abbasid prince was initially victorious forcing khumarawayh to flee but was in turn defeated and fled battlefield while much of his army was taken prisoner after this victory tulunids expanded their control over jazira and borderlands thughur with byzantine empire a peace agreement followed in 886 whereby al muwaffaq was forced to recognize khumarawayh as hereditary governor over egypt and syria for 30 years in exchange for an annual tribute over next couple of years abu l abbas was involved in his father s ultimately unsuccessful attempts to wrest fars from saffarid control imprisonment and rise to throne during this period relations between abu l abbas and his father deteriorated although reason is unclear already in 884 abu l abbas ghilman rioted in baghdad against al muwaffaq s vizier sa id ibn possibly over unpaid wages eventually in 889 abu l abbas was arrested and put in prison on his father s orders where he remained despite demonstrations of ghilman loyal to him he apparently remained under arrest until may 891 when al muwaffaq returned to baghdad after two years spent in jibal al muwaffaq suffering from gout was clearly close to death vizier isma il ibn bulbul and city commander of baghdad abu l called al mu tamid and his sons including heir apparent al mufawwad into city hoping to exploit situation for their own purposes this attempt to sideline abu l abbas failed due to his popularity with soldiers and common people he was set free to visit his father s deathbed and was able to immediately assume power when al muwaffaq died on 2 june baghdad mob ransacked his opponents houses and ibn bulbul was dismissed and thrown in prison where he died from maltreatment after a few months similar fates awaited any of ibn bulbul s supporters who were caught by abu l abbas s agents now all powerful abu l abbas succeeded his father in all his offices with title of al mu tadid bi llah and a position in line of succession after caliph and al mufawwad within a few months on 30 april 892 al mu tadid had his cousin removed from succession altogether thus when al mu tamid died on 14 october 892 al mu tadid took power as caliph reign thumb upright 1 2 alt blank map

follows like his father s al mu tadid s power rested on his close relations with military as historian hugh n kennedy writes he came to throne essentially as a usurper not by any legal right but because of support of his ghilman who ensured not only that he became caliph but also that their rivals in military were humiliated and disbanded thus it is unsurprising that military activities consumed his interest especially as he usually led his army in person on campaign this secured his reputation as a warrior caliph and champion of islamic faith ghazi as historian michael bonner comments t he role of ghazi caliph invented by harun al rashid and enhanced by al mu tasim now had its greatest performance in al mu tadid s tireless campaigning from start of his reign new caliph set out to reverse fragmentation of abbasid caliphate a goal towards which he worked with a mixture of force and diplomacy although an active and enthusiastic campaigner al mu tadid was also a skilful diplomat always prepared to make compromises with those who were too powerful to defeat according to kennedy relations with tulunids this policy became immediately evident in conciliatory attitude new caliph adopted towards his most powerful vassal tulunid regime in spring 893 al mu tadid recognized and reconfirmed khumarawayh in his office as autonomous emir over egypt and syria in exchange for an annual tribute of 300 000 dinars and a further 200 000 dinars in arrears as well as return to caliphal control of two jaziran provinces of diyar rabi a and diyar mudar to seal pact khumarawayh offered his daughter qatr al nada dew drop as bride to one of caliph s sons but al mu tadid chose to marry her himself tulunid princess brought with her a million dinars as her dowry a wedding gift that was considered most sumptuous in medieval arab history thierry bianquis her arrival in baghdad was marked by luxury and extravagance of her retinue which contrasted starkly with impoverished caliphal court according to a story after a thorough search al mu tadid s chief eunuch could find only five ornate silver and gold candlesticks to decorate palace while princess was accompanied by 150 servants each carrying such a candlestick thereupon al mu tadid is said to have remarked come let us go and hide ourselves lest we be seen in our poverty qatr al nada died soon after wedding and murder of khumarawayh in 896 left tulunid state in unsteady hands of khumarawayh s under age sons al mu tadid swiftly took advantage of this and in 897 extended his control over border emirates of thughur where in words of michael bonner he assumed after a long hiatus old caliphal prerogative of commanding annual summer expedition and arranging defence against byzantine empire in addition to secure caliphal recognition of his position new tulunid ruler harun ibn khumarawayh was forced into further concessions handing back all of syria north of homs and increasing annual tribute to 450 000 dinars over next few years increasing domestic turmoil in remaining tulunid domains and escalation of qarmatian attacks encouraged many tulunid followers to defect to resurgent caliphate jazira transcaucasia and byzantine front thumb right upright 1 2 alt geophysical map with regions and major cities al jazira is highlighted in red map of jazira upper mesopotamia with its provinces in medieval times modern borders are also shown in jazira new caliph struggled against a variety of opponents alongside an almost thirty year old kharijite rebellion there were various autonomous local magnates chiefly shaybani ruler of amid and diyar bakr ahmad ibn isa al shaybani and taghlibi chief hamdan ibn hamdun in 893 while kharijites were distracted by internal quarrels al mu tadid captured mosul from shayban in 895 hamdan ibn hamdun was evicted from his strongholds hunted down and captured finally kharijite leader harun ibn abdallah himself was defeated and captured by hamdan s son husayn in 896 before being sent to baghdad where he was crucified this exploit marked beginning of an illustrious career for husayn ibn hamdan in caliphal armies and gradual rise of hamdanid family to power in jazira ahmad al shaybani retained amid until his death in 898 being succeeded by his son muhammad in next year al mu tadid returned to jazira ousted muhammad from amid and reunified entire province under central government control by installing his oldest son and heir ali al muktafi as governor al mu tadid was unable however to restore effective caliphal control north of jazira in transcaucasia where armenia and adharbayjan remained in hands of virtually independent local dynasties ibn abu l saj who was now caliphal governor of adharbayjan proclaimed himself independent around 898 although he soon re recognized caliph s suzerainty during his conflicts with christian armenian princes when he died in 901 he was succeeded by his son marking consolidation of semi independent sajid dynasty in region in 900 ibn abu l saj was even suspected of plotting to seize diyar mudar province with co operation of notables of tarsus after which vengeful caliph ordered latter arrested and city s fleet burned this decision was a self inflicted handicap in centuries long war against byzantium in recent decades tarsians and their fleet had played a major role in raids against byzantine frontier provinces while a syrian fleet under renegade damian of tarsus sacked port of demetrias around 900 and arab fleets would go on to wreak havoc in aegean sea over next two decades byzantines were strengthened on land by an influx of armenian refugees such as melias byzantines began to expand their control over border regions scoring victories and founding new provinces themes in former no man s land between two empires east and saffarids in islamic east caliph was forced to acknowledge reality of saffarids domination and established a modus vivendi with them perhaps hoping according to kennedy to harness them in a partnership analogous to that which tahirids had enjoyed in previous decades consequently saffarid ruler amr ibn al layth was recognized in his possession of khurasan and eastern persia as well as fars while abbasids were to exercise direct control over western persia namely jibal rayy and isfahan this policy gave caliph a free hand to recover territories of dulafids another semi independent local dynasty that were centred on isfahan and when ahmad ibn abd al aziz ibn abi died in 893 al mu tadid moved swiftly to install his son al muktafi as governor in rayy qazvin and hamadan dulafids were confined to their core region around and isfahan before being deposed outright in 896 nevertheless abbasid hold over these territories remained precarious especially due to proximity of zaydi emirate in tabaristan and in 897 rayy was handed over to saffarid control abbasid saffarid partnership in iran was most clearly expressed in their joint effort against general rafi ibn harthama who had made his base in rayy and posed a threat to both caliphal and saffarid interests in region al mu tadid sent ahmad ibn abd al aziz to seize rayy from rafi who fled and made common cause with zaydis of tabaristan in an effort to seize khurasan from saffarids however with amr mobilizing anti alid sentiments of populace against him and expected assistance from zaydis failing to materialize rafi was defeated and killed in khwarazm in 896 amr now at pinnacle of his power sent defeated rebel s head to baghdad and in 897 caliph transferred control of rayy to him partnership finally collapsed after mu tadid appointed amr as governor of transoxiana in 898 which was ruled by his rivals samanids al mu tamid deliberately encouraged amr to confront samanids only for amr to be crushingly defeated and taken prisoner by them in 900 samanid ruler isma il ibn ahmad sent him in chains to baghdad where he was executed in 902 after al mu tadid s death al mu tadid in turn conferred amr s titles and governorships on isma il ibn ahmad caliph also moved to regain fars and kirman but saffarid remnant under amr s grandson tahir proved sufficiently resilient to thwart abbasid attempts to capture these provinces for several years it was not until 910 that abbasids managed to regain coveted fars province rise of sectarianism and fragmentation in periphery in course of 9th century a range of new movements emerged based on shi ite doctrines which replaced as main focus for opposition to established regimes they gained their first successes in periphery of abbasid empire zaydi takeover in tabaristan was repeated in 897 in yemen under al mu tadid a new danger appeared closer to caliphate s metropolitan areas qarmatians a radical isma ili sect founded in kufa around 874 qarmatians were originally a sporadic and minor nuisance in sawad lower iraq but their power grew swiftly to alarming proportions after 897 under leadership of abu sa id al they seized bahrayn in 899 and in next year defeated a caliphal army under al abbas ibn amr al in years following al mu tadid s death qarmatians were to prove most dangerous enemies abbasids had faced since time of zanj kennedy at same time a kufan isma ili missionary abu abdallah al shi i made contact with kutama berbers during a pilgrimage to mecca his proselytization efforts made rapid headway among them

under direct abbasid control in dark green areas under loose abbasid suzerainty but under autonomous governors in light green abbasid army following reforms of al mu tasim was a smaller and more professional fighting force than caliphal armies of past although it proved effective militarily it also posed a potential danger to stability of abbasid regime drawn from turks and other peoples from caliphate s periphery and lands beyond it was alienated from society of caliphate s heartlands with result that soldiers were entirely reliant on state not just for cash but for their very survival kennedy as a result any failure by central government to provide their pay resulted in a military uprising and a political crisis this had been repeatedly demonstrated during anarchy at samarra consequently ensuring regular payment of army became prime task of state according to kennedy based on a treasury document from time of al mu tadid s accession at same time caliphate s fiscal basis had shrunk dramatically after so many tax paying provinces were lost from central government s control caliphal government was now increasingly reliant on revenue of sawad and other areas of lower iraq which were witnessing a rapid decline in agricultural productivity due to disruption of civil wars and neglect of irrigation network in reign of harun al rashid 786 809 sawad had provided an annual revenue of 102 500 000 dirhams more than double revenue of egypt and three times that of syria by early 10th century it was providing less than a third of that figure situation was further exacerbated by fact that in remaining provinces semi autonomous governors grandees and members of dynasty were able to establish virtual latifundia aided by system of a a form of tax farming in exchange for a fixed tribute which they often failed to pay to maximize their revenue from territory remaining to them abbasids increased breadth and complexity of central bureaucracy dividing provinces into smaller tax districts as well as increasing number of fiscal departments diwans which allowed for close oversight of both revenue collection and activities of officials themselves to combat this fiscal crisis caliph would often personally devote himself to supervision of revenue acquiring a reputation according to f malti douglas for a spirit of economy verging on avarice he was said to examine petty accounts that a commoner would scorn to consider harold bowen fines and confiscations multiplied under his rule with resulting revenue along with income from crown domain and even a portion of provincial taxation flowing to caliphal privy purse bayt al mal al khassa latter now acquired a leading role among fiscal departments and it frequently held more money than public treasury bayt al mal al amma by end of al mu tadid s reign once empty privy purse would contain ten million dinars on other hand in a measure aimed to ease tax burden of farmers in 895 caliph changed start of tax year from persian new year in march to 11 june which became known as al mu tadid al mu tadid s new year so land tax kharaj was now collected after harvest instead of before rise of bureaucracy al mu tadid s policies strengthened position of civil bureaucracy which now reached apogee of its influence and especially that of vizier whom even army came to respect as spokesman of caliph in terms of personnel al mu tadid s reign was marked by continuity among senior leadership of state ubayd allah ibn sulayman ibn remained vizier from start of reign until his death in 901 and was succeeded by his son al qasim who had from start been for his father during latter s absences from capital freedman badr a veteran who had served under al muwaffaq and whose daughter married caliph s son remained commander of army fiscal departments especially of sawad were managed first by banu l furat brothers ahmad and ali and after 899 by banu l jarrah under muhammad ibn dawud and his nephew ali ibn isa original administrative team was so effective and harmonious according to 11th century historian hilal as sabi it was said by subsequent generations that there had never been such a quartet caliph vizier commander and chief of diwans as al mu tadid ubayd allah badr and ahmad ibn al furat on other hand as michel bonner points out later reign of al mu tadid saw a growth of factionalism within this bureaucracy observable also in army and in urban civilian life intense rivalry between two bureaucratic dynasties of banu l furat and banu l jarrah with their extensive networks of clients began at this time although a strong caliph and vizier could restrain this antagonism it would dominate abbasid government during following decades with factions alternating in office and often fining and torturing their predecessors to extract money according to well established practice known as in addition al qasim ibn ubayd allah was of an altogether different character than his father soon after his appointment to vizierate al qasim plotted to have al mu tadid assassinated and tried to involve badr in his scheming general rejected his proposals with indignation but al qasim was saved from discovery and execution by caliph s sudden death vizier then tried to dominate al muktafi moved swiftly to have badr denounced and executed and was involved in yet more intrigues against banu l furat return of capital to baghdad al mu tadid also completed return of capital from samarra to baghdad which had already served as his father s main base of operations city s centre however was relocated on eastern bank of tigris and further downstream from original round city founded by al mansur a century earlier it has there remained to this day as 10th century historian al mas udi wrote caliph s two main passions were women and building al nisa wa l bana and accordingly he engaged in major building activities in capital he restored and expanded great mosque of al mansur which had fallen into disuse enlarged hasani palace built new palaces of pleiades and paradise and began work on taj crown palace which was completed under al muktafi he also took care to restore city s irrigation network by clearing silted up dujayl canal paying for this with money from those landowners who stood to profit from it theological doctrines and promotion of science in terms of doctrine al mu tadid sided firmly with sunni traditionalist orthodoxy from outset of his reign forbidding theological works and abolishing fiscal department responsible for property in escheat which hanbali legal opinion regarded as illegal at same time he also tried to maintain good relations with alids to point of seriously considering ordering official cursing of mu awiya founder of umayyad caliphate and main opponent of ali he was dissuaded only at last moment by his advisers who feared any unforeseen consequences such an act might have al mu tadid also maintained good relations with breakaway zaydi imams of tabaristan but his pro alid stance failed to prevent establishment of a second zaydi state in yemen in 901 al mu tadid also actively promoted traditions of learning and science that had flourished under his early 9th century predecessors al ma mun al mu tasim and al wathiq court patronage for scientific endeavours had declined under al mutawakkil whose reign had marked a return to sunni orthodoxy and an aversion to scientific inquiry while his successors had lacked luxury to engage in intellectual pursuits himself keenly interested in natural sciences and able to speak greek al mu tadid promoted career of one of great translators of greek texts and mathematicians of era thabit ibn qurra and of grammarians ibn and al latter of whom became tutor of caliph s children one of leading intellectual figures of period was al mu tadid s own tutor ahmad ibn al al sarakhsi a pupil of great philosopher al kindi al sarakhsi became a close companion of caliph who appointed him to lucrative post of market supervisor of baghdad but was executed in 896 after angering caliph according to one account al qasim ibn ubayd allah who is frequently featured as villain in anecdotes of al mu tadid s court inserted al sarakhsi s name in a list of rebels to be executed caliph signed list and learned of his mistake only after his old master had been executed justice and punishment under al mu tadid in dispensation of justice he was characterized by what malti douglas describes as severity bordering on sadism while tolerant of error and not above displays of sentimentality and tenderness when his wrath was aroused he resorted to torture in most ingenious ways and had special torture chambers constructed underneath his palace chroniclers such as al mas udi and mamluk historian al safadi describe in great detail tortures inflicted by caliph on prisoners as well as his practice of making an example of them by having them publicly displayed in baghdad thus caliph is reported to have used bellows to inflate his prisoners or buried them upside down in pits at same time they justify his severity as legitimate being in interests of state malti douglas remarks that when al safadi compared al mu tadid with founder of abbasid state calling him al saffah second this was not only to emphasize his restoration of caliphate s fortunes but also a direct allusion to meaning of al saffah s name blood death and legacy al mu tadid died at hasani palace on 5 april 902 at age of either 40 or 47 there were rumours he had been poisoned but it is more likely that rigours of his campaigns coupled with his dissolute life severely weakened his health during his final illness he refused to follow advice of his physicians and even kicked one of them to death he left behind him four sons and several daughters of his sons three al muktafi al muqtadir and al qahir would rule as caliphs in turn and only one harun did not become caliph al mu tadid was first abbasid caliph to be buried within city of baghdad like his sons after him he was buried in former tahirid palace in western part of city which was now used by caliphs as a secondary residence according to orientalist karl vilhelm al mu tadid had inherited his father s gifts as a ruler and was distinguished alike for his economy and his military ability becoming one of greatest of abbasids in spite of his strictness and cruelty al mu tadid s capable reign is credited with having arrested abbasid caliphate s decline for a while but his successes were too dependent on presence of an energetic ruler at helm and ultimately his reign was too short to reverse long term trends and re establish abbasid power on a long term basis kennedy al mu tadid had taken care to prepare his son and successor al muktafi for his role by appointing him as governor in rayy and jazira although al muktafi tried to follow his father s policies he lacked his energy heavily militarized system of al muwaffaq and al mu tadid required caliph to actively participate in campaigns setting a personal example and forming ties of loyalty reinforced by patronage between ruler and soldiers al muktafi on other hand did not in his character and comportment being a sedentary figure instil much loyalty let alone inspiration in soldiers michael bonner caliphate was still able to secure major successes over next few years including reincorporation of tulunid domains in 904 and victories over qarmatians but with al muktafi s death in 908 so called abbasid restoration passed its high water mark and a new period of crisis began power was now wielded by senior bureaucrats who installed weak and pliable al muqtadir on throne over next decades expenditure of both court and army increased while maladministration increased and strife between military and bureaucratic factions intensified by 932 when al muqtadir was assassinated caliphate was effectively bankrupt and authority soon devolved on a series of military strongmen who competed for control of caliph and title of amir al umara this process culminated in capture of baghdad in 946 by buyids who put an end to caliphal independence even in name thereafter caliphs remained as symbolic figureheads but were divested of any military or political authority or independent financial resources references sources category 9th century births
