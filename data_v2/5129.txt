sequel to god of war was first teased at end of its credits which stated kratos will return god of war ii was officially announced at 2006 game developers conference gdc god of war game director david jaffe stepped down and became creative director of its sequel god of wars lead animator cory barlog assumed role of game director in an interview with computer and video games cvg in june 2006 barlog said that while working on first few drafts of script he studied mythology extensively he said that mythology is so large that real difficulty is picking things that really fit within story of kratos as well as being easy to swallow for audiences although he loves idea of teaching things through storytelling in this case greek mythology barlog said you can t let your story get bogged down by that he said that in game players would see a larger view of kratos role within mythological world he also said that he liked idea of a trilogy but there were no plans as of right now like god of war game uses santa monica s kinetica engine senior combat designer derek daniels said that for god of war ii they were basing magical attacks on elements e g air and earth he said combat system was updated so that it flowed smoothly between attacks and switching between weapons and magic he said that they were working for a similar balance of puzzle solving exploration and combat seen in first game and they used elements that worked in that game as a base for overall balance unlike god of war where magic had a small role daniels said that for god of war ii their goal was to make magic an integral part of combat system and to make it more refined barlog said game would feature new creatures and heroes from mythology and he wanted to put more boss battles in it commenting on multiplayer options barlog said that there are possibilities for that but it is not something we are doing right now he said that he felt that god of war is a single player experience and although multiplayer would be cool it did not appeal to him to work on as for a playstation portable psp installment he said that he thought it would be freaking awesome but not something he had time to work on and it was sony s decision whether or not to make a psp installment in an interview with ign in february 2007 barlog said that his goals for god of war ii were to continue previous game s story expand on several elements and to feature more epic moments as opposed to cinematics during gameplay he said there were many additions to game but they did not differ greatly from style of previous game set pieces and large scale epic moments were reworked so that each battle you have really feels epic and unique barlog also hinted that another sequel would be made he said story has not yet been completed end has only just begun in another interview with ign both jaffe and barlog said that they did not view god of war ii as a sequel but rather a continuation of previous game jaffe said that they did not want to include roman numeral number two ii in title for this reason but they did not want title to convey impression it was an expansion pack both jaffe and barlog said that reason god of war ii appeared on playstation 2 instead of playstation 3 which was released four months prior to god of war ii was because there s a 100 million people out there that will be able to play god of war ii as soon as it launches barlog assured that game would be playable on newer platform which had playstation 2 backwards compatibility four of voice actors from previous installment returned to reprise their roles including terrence c carson and keith ferguson who voiced kratos and boat captain respectively linda hunt returned as narrator who was revealed to be titan gaia and carole ruggier returned in her final voicing of character athena both paul eiding who had voiced zeus and gravedigger and fred tatasciore who had voiced poseidon returned but did not reprise those roles and instead voiced characters theseus and typhon respectively corey burton assumed role of zeus having previously voiced character in 1998 disney animated film hercules zero to hero and subsequent animated series hercules famed actors michael clarke duncan and leigh allyn baker lent their voices for characters atlas and lakhesis respectively actor harry hamlin was chosen to voice character perseus because of his previous portrayal of same character in 1981 feature film clash of titans although removed early in game s development cam clarke is credited for voice of hercules keythe farley was voice director

story instead of only being next to last boss fight of game they are introduced in chapter 2 and have several chapters dedicated to what they were doing throughout kratos journey for example they allowed titans to come back due to their boredom and in particular liked to toy with kratos due to how much sisters dabbled with kratos fate it allowed him to make it as far as he did and also allowed him to act on his own will due to many alterations to his life thread intentions of some characters actions are also explained and some characters are given more backstory titan typhon did not want to help kratos because if he failed zeus would kill typhon s wife echidna and their children who zeus had allowed to live in freedom while typhon was imprisoned theseus king of athens wanted sisters to give god dionysus a new lover so that he could have ariadne back and wanted to revive his father who committed suicide as he thought theseus had died theseus had aegean sea named after his father jason of argonauts had stolen golden fleece from aeetes of colchis he also loved a witch named medea who helped him steal fleece by killing her own brother she also convinced jason s nieces to murder his uncle pelias and eat him as pelias was going to betray jason due to a false prophecy jason forsook medea and married daughter of king creon creus who was killed by medea along with their children despite this jason wanted medea back because creus did not truly love him jason died by kratos hand instead of cerberus as jason tried to kill kratos to get fleece back perseus was also given some backstory he had fought a trio of witches he fought gorgons and killed a monster that king cepheus had tried to appease with a sacrifice he wanted sisters to revive andromeda who was not explicitly mentioned in game novel introduced some characters who were not present in game or any other game goddesses demeter and hestia both made a very brief appearance just prior to kratos joining spartans in rhodes where kratos overheard them discussing their displeasure of endless war in greece iris goddess of rainbow and an occasional messenger was another new character and had a more substantial role atropos contacted iris and had her lie to zeus about kratos on several instances and was cause of distrust among olympians due to her rumor spreading and half truths she eventually replaced hermes as messenger of gods she also told zeus that he would need to appoint a new god of war zeus pondered about making hercules new god of war athena wished kratos to be returned as god of war thinking by doing so it would stop chaos and dissension between gods hermes had thought to suggest perseus as new god of war and gifted him his invisibility helmet hermes eventually regained his position as messenger of gods when he finally convinced zeus that iris had been lying to him about kratos iris was subsequently banished from olympus only to appear at sunrise and sunset and when it rained novel also explained that titans rhea themis iapetus and mnemosyne along with hyperion were banished to tartarus after great war at end of novel titan atlas was one of titans brought back from past to reignite great war in game atlas was not brought back also in game kratos and theseus fight was to determine who was greatest warrior in all of greece this was not bases for their fight in novel another omission is that during kratos fight with barbarian king boat captain was not summoned to fight kratos kratos also did not keep euryale s head as a weapon first book omitted kratos receiving blades of athena this book did not explain how he received them as he already had them at start of novel reception regarded as one of best playstation 2 and action games of all time god of war ii received universal acclaim according to review aggregator metacritic with a score of 93 out of 100 and a score of 92 68 from gamerankings it has been praised for its story and improvements over its predecessor such as gameplay and graphics chris roper of ign said that god of war ii is one of gaming s most intense and engaging experiences available he said it is practically devoid of minor flaws of original citing an example that players can now quickly navigate wall climbing such as being able to vertically slide down walls furthering his praise of gameplay he said that it is one of most polished and refined experiences in gaming although he said that combat mechanics were practically identical to original he had no complaints stating it is for good reason as it was already perfect first time out kristan reed of eurogamer said that god of war ii sports one of most satisfyingly honed game designs we ve ever come across he said that it would not overwhelm players and that it motivates them to improve their skills he said that balance always feels spot on and learning curve is just right adding that magic attacks are more useful than those in god of war he also said that god of war iis gameplay like original finds a comfortable middle ground between hardcore and casual players alex navarro of gamespot praised pace of game and puzzle designs and said scale of some of levels is unbelievably massive he also said that story is interesting because it is more about what happens around kratos than what happens to him matt leone of 1up said that strongest aspect is how it excels as both a story and an action game and it is story that allows game to feel like a true sequel roper praised scale of levels as well as variety in environments in comparison to original installment and said art direction is once again absolutely outstanding reed praised amount of detail and said that at no stage did we ever see even a hint of frame rate drop or v syncing glitches he also said that playing game on ps3 sharpens up visuals navarro said that both sound and graphics were superb and technical graphics are impressive for playstation 2 gametrailers said that in terms of visuals there aren t that many playstation 2 games in same league as god of war ii gamezone said that despite issue of clipping game is unbelievably gorgeous roper said that there were a couple of puzzles that seemed a little rough around edges and whose otherwise straightforward solution suffered a bit from imperfect implementation he also criticized difficulty of unlocking some of bonus content as some requirements are punishingly hard for most everyone reed however said if players can find any flaws they are based on personal taste but also stated that regardless of refinement you can never quite replicate wow factor of original even if it ends up being a better game navarro said that at times combat is overly straightforward and still prone to button mashing and said that it was a bit disappointing that more was not done to combat system he criticized cliffhanger ending and said a few of bonus challenges aren t all that great gametrailers criticized invisible walls stating that there are places you should be able to go that you simply can t they also cited inconsistency issues in regards to navigation leone said his only real disappointment is that he did not feel game was evolving series awards and accolades both ign and gamespot consider god of war ii to be swan song of playstation 2 era in 2007 it was awarded playstation game of year at 25th annual golden joystick awards and ugo awarded it ps2 game of year at 2007 spike video game awards it was a nominee for best action game and best original score at 12th satellite awards god of war ii received
