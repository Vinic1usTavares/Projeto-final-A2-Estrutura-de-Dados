government in 1931 when stanley baldwin retired in may 1937 chamberlain took his place as prime minister his premiership was dominated by question of policy towards an increasingly aggressive germany and his actions at munich were widely popular among british at time when hitler continued his aggression chamberlain pledged britain to defend poland s independence if latter were attacked an alliance that brought his country into war when germany and soviet union invaded poland in 1939 chamberlain resigned premiership on 10 may 1940 as allies were being forced to retreat from norway as he believed that a government supported by all parties was essential and labour and liberal parties would not join a government he headed he was succeeded by winston churchill but remained very well regarded in parliament especially among conservatives before ill health forced him to resign he was an important member of churchill s war cabinet as lord president of council heading cabinet in new premier s absence chamberlain died of cancer six months after leaving premiership chamberlain s reputation remains controversial among historians initial high regard for him being entirely eroded by books such as guilty men published in july 1940 which blamed chamberlain and his associates for munich accord and for allegedly failing to prepare country for war most historians in generation following chamberlain s death held similar views led by churchill in gathering storm some later historians have taken a more favourable perspective of chamberlain and his policies citing government papers released under thirty year rule and arguing that going to war with germany in 1938 would have been disastrous as uk was unprepared nonetheless chamberlain is still unfavourably ranked amongst british

hatred chamberlain decided to stand for house of commons and was adopted as unionist candidate for birmingham ladywood after war ended a general election was called almost immediately campaign in this constituency was notable because his liberal party opponent was mrs margery corbett ashby one of seventeen women candidates who stood for parliament at first election at which women were eligible to

passed into law chamberlain sought abolition of elected poor law boards of guardians which administered relief and which in some areas were responsible for rates many of boards were controlled by labour and such boards had defied government by distributing relief funds to able bodied unemployed in 1929 chamberlain initiated legislation to abolish poor law boards entirely chamberlain spoke in commons for two and a half hours on second reading of bill and when he concluded he was applauded by all parties bill passed into law though chamberlain struck a conciliatory note during 1926 general strike in general he had poor relations with labour opposition future labour prime minister clement attlee complained that chamberlain always treated us like dirt and in april 1927 chamberlain wrote more and more do i feel an utter contempt for their lamentable stupidity his poor relations with labour party later played a major part in his downfall as prime minister opposition and second term as chancellor baldwin called a general election for 30 may 1929 resulting in a hung parliament with labour holding most seats baldwin and his government resigned and labour under macdonald again took office in 1931 macdonald government faced a serious crisis as may report revealed that budget was unbalanced with an expected shortfall of ps120 million labour government resigned on 24 august and

parliament easily chamberlain presented his first budget in april 1932 he maintained severe budget cuts that had been agreed at inception of national government interest on war debt was a major cost chamberlain reduced annual interest rate on most of britain s war debt from 5 to 3 5 between 1932 and 1938 chamberlain halved percentage of budget devoted to interest on war debt war debt chamberlain hoped that a cancellation of war debt owed to united states could be negotiated in june 1933 britain hosted world monetary and economic conference which came to nothing as us president franklin d roosevelt sent word that he would not consider any war debt cancellation by 1934 chamberlain was able to declare a budget surplus and reverse many of cuts in unemployment compensation and civil servant salaries he had made after taking office he told commons we have now finished story of bleak house and are sitting down this afternoon to enjoy first chapter of great expectations welfare spending unemployed assistance board uab established by unemployment act 1934 was largely chamberlain s creation and he wished to see issue of unemployment assistance removed from party political argument moreover chamberlain saw importance of providing some interest in life for large numbers of men never likely to get work and out of this realisation was to come responsibility of uab for welfare not merely maintenance of unemployed bruce p 371 defence spending defence spending had been heavily cut in chamberlain s early budgets by 1935 faced with a resurgent germany under hitler s leadership see german re armament he was convinced of need for rearmament chamberlain especially urged strengthening of royal air force realising that britain s historical bulwark english channel was no defence against air power in 1935 macdonald stood down as prime minister and baldwin became prime minister for third time in 1935 general election conservative dominated national government lost 90 seats from its massive 1931 majority but still retained an overwhelming majority of 255 in house of commons during campaign deputy labour leader arthur greenwood had attacked chamberlain for spending money on rearmament saying that rearmament policy was merest scaremongering disgraceful in a statesman of mr chamberlain s responsible position to suggest that more millions of money needed to be spent on armaments role in abdication crisis chamberlain is believed to have had a significant role in 1936 abdication crisis he wrote in his diary that wallis simpson edward viii s intended wife was an entirely unscrupulous woman who is not in love with king but is exploiting him for her own purposes she has already ruined him in money and jewels in common with rest of cabinet except duff cooper he agreed with baldwin that king should abdicate if he married simpson and on 6 december he and baldwin both stressed that king should make his decision before christmas by one account he believed that uncertainty was hurting christmas trade king abdicated on 10 december four days after meeting soon after abdication baldwin announced that he would remain until shortly after coronation of king george vi and queen elizabeth on 28 may two weeks after coronation baldwin resigned advising king to send for chamberlain sir austen did not live to see his brother s final climb to top of greasy pole having died two months earlier premiership 1937 1940 thumb right chamberlain as prime minister upon his accession chamberlain considered calling a general election but with three and a half years remaining in current parliament s term he decided to wait at age 68 he was second eldest person in 20th century behind sir henry campbell bannerman to become prime minister for first time and was widely seen as a caretaker who would lead conservative party until next election and then step down in favour of a younger man with foreign secretary anthony eden a likely candidate from start of chamberlain s premiership a number of would be successors were rumoured to be jockeying for position chamberlain had disliked what he considered to be overly sentimental attitude of both baldwin and macdonald on cabinet appointments and reshuffles although he had worked closely with president of board of trade walter runciman on tariff issue chamberlain dismissed him from his post instead offering him token position of lord privy seal which an angry runciman declined chamberlain thought runciman a member of liberal national party to be lazy soon after taking office chamberlain instructed his ministers to prepare two year policy programmes these reports were to be integrated with intent of co ordinating passage of legislation through current parliament term of which was to expire in november 1940 at time of his succession chamberlain s personality was not well known to public though he had made annual budget broadcasts for six years according to chamberlain biographer robert self these appeared relaxed and modern showing an ability to speak directly to camera chamberlain had few friends among his parliamentary colleagues an attempt by his parliamentary private secretary lord dunglass later prime minister himself as alec douglas home to bring him to commons smoking room to socialise with colleagues ended in embarrassing silence chamberlain compensated for these shortcomings by devising most sophisticated press management system employed by a prime minister up to that time with officials at number 10 led by his chief of press george steward convincing members of press that they were colleagues sharing power and insider knowledge and should espouse government line domestic policy thumb right caricature of chamberlain chamberlain saw his elevation to premiership as final glory in a career as a domestic reformer not realising that he would be remembered for foreign policy decisions one reason he sought settlement of european issues was hope it would allow him to concentrate on domestic affairs soon after attaining premiership chamberlain obtained passage of factories act 1937 this act was aimed at bettering working conditions in factories and placed limits on working hours of women and children in 1938 parliament enacted coal act 1938 which allowed for nationalisation of coal deposits another major law passed that year was holidays with pay act though act only recommended that employers give workers a week off with pay it led to a great expansion of holiday camps and other leisure accommodation for working classes housing act of 1938 provided subsidies aimed at encouraging slum clearance and maintained rent control chamberlain s plans for reform of local government were shelved because of outbreak of war in 1939 likewise raising of school leaving age to 15 scheduled for implementation on 1 september 1939 did not go into effect relations with ireland relations between united kingdom and irish free state had been strained since 1932 appointment of eamon de valera as president of executive council anglo irish trade war sparked by withholding of money that ireland had agreed to pay united kingdom had caused economic losses on both sides and two nations were anxious for a settlement de valera government also sought to sever remaining ties between ireland and uk such as ending king s status as irish head of state as chancellor chamberlain had taken a hard line stance against concessions to irish but as premier sought a settlement with ireland being persuaded that strained ties were affecting relations with other dominions talks had been suspended under baldwin in 1936 but resumed in november 1937 de valera sought not only to alter constitutional status of ireland but to overturn other aspects of anglo irish treaty most notably issue of partition as well as obtaining full control of three treaty ports which had remained in british control britain on other hand wished to retain treaty ports at least in time of war and to obtain money that ireland had agreed to pay irish proved very tough negotiators so much so that chamberlain complained that one of de valera s offers had presented united kingdom ministers with a three leafed shamrock none of leaves of which had any advantages for uk with talks facing deadlock chamberlain made irish a final offer in march 1938 which acceded to many irish positions though he was confident that he had only given up small things and agreements were signed on 25 april 1938 issue of partition was not resolved but irish agreed to pay ps10 million to british there was no provision in treaties for british access to treaty ports in time of war but chamberlain accepted de valera s oral assurance that in event of war british would have access conservative backbencher winston churchill attacked agreements in parliament for surrendering treaty ports which he described as sentinel towers of western approaches when war came de valera denied britain access to treaty ports under irish neutrality churchill railed against these treaties in gathering storm stating that he never saw house of commons more completely misled and that members were made to feel very differently about it when our existence hung in balance during battle of atlantic chamberlain believed that treaty ports were unusable if ireland was hostile and deemed their loss worthwhile to assure friendly relations with dublin european policy early days may 1937 march 1938 chamberlain sought to conciliate germany and make nazi state a partner in a stable europe he believed germany could be satisfied by restoration of some of her colonies and during rhineland crisis of march 1936 he had stated that if we were in sight of an all round settlement british government ought to consider question of restoration of colonies new prime minister s attempts to secure such a settlement were frustrated because germany was in no hurry to talk to britain foreign minister konstantin von neurath was supposed to visit britain in july 1937 but cancelled his visit lord halifax lord president of council visited germany privately in november and met hitler and other german officials both chamberlain and british ambassador to germany henderson pronounced visit a success foreign office officials complained that halifax visit made it appear britain was too eager for talks and foreign secretary anthony eden felt that he had been bypassed chamberlain also bypassed eden while foreign secretary was on holiday by opening direct talks with italy an international pariah for its invasion and conquest of ethiopia at a cabinet meeting on 8 september 1937 chamberlain indicated that he saw lessening of tension between this country and italy as a very valuable contribution toward pacification and appeasement of europe which would weaken rome berlin axis prime minister also set up a private line of communication with italian duce benito mussolini through italian ambassador count dino grandi in february 1938 hitler began to press austrian government to accept anschluss or union between germany and austria chamberlain believed that it was essential to cement relations with italy in hope that an anglo italian alliance would forestall hitler from imposing his rule over austria eden believed that chamberlain was being too hasty in talking with italy and holding out prospect of de jure recognition of italy s conquest of ethiopia chamberlain concluded that eden would have to accept his policy or resign cabinet heard both men out but unanimously decided for chamberlain and despite efforts by other cabinet members to prevent it eden resigned from office in later years eden tried to portray his resignation as a stand against appeasement churchill described him in second world war as one strong young figure standing up against long dismal drawling tides of drift and surrender but many ministers and mps believed there was no issue at stake worth resignation chamberlain appointed lord halifax as foreign secretary in eden s place road to munich march 1938 september 1938 in march 1938 austria became a part of germany in anschluss though beleaguered austrians requested help from britain none was forthcoming britain did send berlin a strong note of protest in addressing cabinet shortly after german forces crossed border chamberlain placed blame on both germany and austria chamberlain noted on 14 march day after anschluss chamberlain addressed house of commons and strongly condemned methods used by germans in takeover of austria chamberlain s address met with approval of house thumb left chamberlain arrives in munich september 1938 with austria absorbed by germany attention turned to hitler s obvious next target sudetenland region of czechoslovakia with three million ethnic germans sudetenland represented largest german population outside reich and hitler began to call for union of region with germany britain had no military obligations toward czechoslovakia but france and czechoslovakia had a mutual assistance pact and both french and czechoslovaks also had an alliance with soviet union after fall of austria cabinet s foreign policy committee considered seeking a grand alliance to thwart germany or alternatively an assurance to france of assistance if french went to war instead committee chose to advocate that czechoslovakia be urged to make best terms it could with germany full cabinet agreed with committee s recommendation influenced by a report from chiefs of staff stating that there was little that britain could do to help czechs in event of a german invasion chamberlain reported to an amenable house that he was unwilling to limit his government s discretion by giving commitments britain and italy signed an agreement in april 1938 in exchange for de jure recognition of italy s ethiopian conquest italy agreed to withdraw some italian volunteers from nationalist pro franco side of spanish civil war by this point nationalists strongly had upper hand in that conflict and they completed their victory following year later that month new french prime minister edouard daladier came to london for talks with chamberlain and agreed to follow british position on czechoslovakia in may czech border guards shot two sudeten german farmers who were trying to cross border from germany into czechoslovakia without stopping for border controls this incident caused unrest among sudeten germans and germany was then said to be moving troops to border in response to report prague moved troops to german border halifax sent a note to germany warning that if france intervened in crisis on czechoslovakia s behalf britain might support france tensions appeared to calm and chamberlain and halifax were applauded for their masterly handling of crisis though it was not known at time it later became clear that germany had had no plans for a may invasion of czechoslovakia nonetheless chamberlain government received strong and almost unanimous support from british press negotiations between czech government and sudeten germans dragged on through mid 1938 they achieved little result sudeten leader konrad henlein was under private instructions from hitler not to reach an agreement on 3 august walter runciman by now lord runciman travelled to prague as a mediator sent by british government over next two weeks runciman met separately with henlein czechoslovak president edvard benes and other leaders but made no progress on 30 august chamberlain met his cabinet and ambassador henderson and secured their backing with only first lord of admiralty duff cooper dissenting against chamberlain s policy to pressure czechoslovakia into making concessions on ground that britain was then in no position to back up any threat to go to war chamberlain realised that hitler would likely signal his intentions in his 12 september speech at annual nuremberg rally and so prime minister discussed with his advisors how to respond if war seemed likely in consultation with his close advisor sir horace wilson chamberlain set out plan z if war seemed inevitable chamberlain would fly to germany to negotiate directly with hitler september 1938 munich preliminary meetings lord runciman continued his work attempting to pressure czechoslovak government into concessions on 7 september there was an altercation involving sudeten members of czechoslovak parliament in north moravian city of ostrava in german germans made considerable propaganda out of incident though prague government tried to conciliate them by dismissing czech police who had been involved as tempest grew runciman concluded that there was no point in attempting further negotiations until after hitler s speech

invade czechoslovakia on 25 september convinced that french would not fight daladier was privately proposing a three power summit to settle sudeten question chamberlain decided to implement plan z and sent a message to hitler that he was willing to come to germany to negotiate hitler accepted and chamberlain flew to germany on morning of 15 september this was first time excepting a short jaunt at an industrial fair that chamberlain had ever flown chamberlain flew to munich and then travelled by rail to hitler s retreat at berchtesgaden face to face meeting lasted about three hours hitler demanded annexation of sudetenland and through questioning him chamberlain was able to obtain assurances that hitler had no designs on remainder of czechoslovakia or on areas in eastern europe which had german minorities after meeting chamberlain returned to london believing that he had obtained a breathing space during which agreement could be reached and peace preserved under proposals made at berchtesgaden sudetenland would be annexed by germany if a plebiscite in sudetenland favoured it czechoslovakia would receive international guarantees of its independence which would replace existing treaty obligations principally french pledge to czechoslovaks french agreed to requirements under considerable pressure czechoslovaks also agreed causing czechoslovak government to fall thumb left

claims on czechoslovakia be addressed chamberlain objected strenuously telling hitler that he had worked to bring french and czechoslovaks into line with germany s demands so much so that he had been accused of giving in to dictators and had been booed on his departure that morning hitler was unmoved that evening chamberlain told lord halifax that meeting with herr hitler had been most unsatisfactory following day hitler kept chamberlain waiting until mid afternoon when he sent a five page letter in german outlining demands he had made orally previous day chamberlain replied by offering to act as an intermediary with czechoslovaks and suggested that hitler put his demands in a memorandum which could be circulated to french and czechoslovaks leaders met again late on evening of 23 september a meeting which stretched into early morning hours hitler demanded that fleeing czechs in zones to be occupied take nothing with them he extended his deadline for occupation of sudetenland to 1 october date he had long before secretly set for invasion of czechoslovakia meeting ended amicably with chamberlain confiding to hitler his hopes they would be able to work out other problems in europe in same spirit hitler hinted that sudetenland fulfilled his territorial ambitions in europe chamberlain flew back to london saying it is up to czechs now munich conference hitler s proposals met with resistance not only from french and czechoslovaks but also from some members of chamberlain s cabinet with no agreement in sight war seemed inevitable prime minister issued a press

thanking those who wrote to him stated on 28 september chamberlain called on hitler to invite him to germany again to seek a solution through a summit involving british french germans and italians

to war october 1938 august 1939 in aftermath of munich chamberlain continued to pursue a course of cautious rearmament he told cabinet in early october 1938 i t would be madness for country to stop rearming until we were convinced that other countries would act in same way for time being therefore we should relax no particle of effort until our deficiencies had been made good later in october he resisted calls to put industry on a war footing convinced that such an action would show hitler that prime minister had decided to abandon munich chamberlain hoped that understanding he had signed with hitler at munich would lead toward a general settlement of european disputes but hitler expressed no public interest in following up on accord having considered a general election immediately following munich chamberlain instead reshuffled his cabinet by end of year public concerns caused chamberlain to conclude that to get rid of this uneasy and disgruntled house of commons by a general election would be suicidal despite hitler s relative quietness as reich absorbed sudetenland foreign policy concerns continued to preoccupy chamberlain he made trips to paris and rome hoping to persuade french to hasten their rearmament and mussolini to be a positive influence on hitler several of his cabinet members led by foreign secretary lord halifax began to draw away from appeasement policy halifax was by now convinced that munich though better than a european war had been a horrid business and humiliating public revulsion over pogrom of kristallnacht on 9 november 1938 made any attempt at a rapprochement with hitler unacceptable though chamberlain did not abandon his hopes still hoping for reconciliation with germany chamberlain made a major speech in birmingham on 28 january 1939 in which he expressed his desire for international peace and had an advance copy sent to hitler at berchtesgaden hitler seemed to respond in his reichstag speech on 30 january 1939 he stated that he wanted a long peace chamberlain was confident that improvements in british defence since munich would bring dictator to bargaining table this belief was reinforced by a german official s conciliatory speech welcoming ambassador henderson back to berlin after an absence for medical treatment in britain chamberlain responded with a speech in blackburn on 22 february hoping that nations would resolve their differences through trade and was gratified when his comments were printed in german newspapers with matters appearing to improve chamberlain s rule over house of commons was firm and he was convinced government would romp home in a late 1939 election on 15 march 1939 germany invaded czech provinces of bohemia and moravia including prague though chamberlain s initial parliamentary response was according to biographer nick smart feeble within 48 hours he had spoken more forcefully against german aggression in another birmingham speech on 17 march chamberlain warned that no greater mistake could be made than to suppose that because it believes war to be a senseless and cruel thing nation has so lost its fibre that it will not take part to utmost of its power in resisting such a challenge if it were ever made prime minister questioned whether invasion of czechoslovakia was end of an old adventure or beginning of a new and whether it was a step in direction of an attempt to dominate world by force colonial secretary malcolm macdonald said whereas prime minister was once a strong advocate of peace he has now definitely swung around to war point of view this speech was met with widespread approval in britain and recruitment for armed services increased considerably chamberlain set out to build an interlocking series of defence pacts among remaining european countries as a means of deterring hitler from war he sought an agreement among britain france ussr and poland whereby first three would go to assistance of poland if her independence were threatened but polish mistrust of soviet union caused those negotiations to fail instead on 31 march 1939 chamberlain informed an approving house of commons of british and french guarantees that they would lend poland all possible aid in event of any action which threatened polish independence in ensuing debate eden stated that nation was now united behind government even churchill and lloyd george praised chamberlain s government for issuing guarantee to poland prime minister took other steps to deter hitler from aggression he doubled size of territorial army created a ministry of supply to expedite provision of equipment to armed forces and instituted peacetime conscription italian invasion of albania on 7 april 1939 led to guarantees being given to greece and romania on 17 june 1939 handley page received an order for 200 hampden twin engined medium bombers and by 3 september 1939 chain of radar stations girdling british coast was fully operational chamberlain was reluctant to seek a military alliance with soviet union he distrusted joseph stalin ideologically and felt that there was little to gain given recent massive purges in red army much of his cabinet favoured such an alliance and when poland withdrew her objection to an anglo soviet alliance chamberlain had little choice but to proceed talks with soviet foreign minister vyacheslav molotov to which britain sent only a low level delegation dragged on over several months and eventually foundered on 14 august 1939 when poland and romania refused to allow soviet troops to be stationed on their territories a week after failure of these talks soviet union and germany signed molotov ribbentrop pact committing countries to non aggression toward each other a secret agreement divided up poland in event of war chamberlain had disregarded rumours of a soviet german rapprochement and was dismissive of publicly announced pact stating that it in no way affected british obligations toward poland on 23 august 1939 chamberlain had henderson deliver a letter to hitler telling him that britain was fully prepared to comply with its obligations to poland hitler instructed his generals to prepare for an invasion of poland telling them our enemies are small worms i saw them at munich war leader 1939 1940 declaration of war germany invaded poland in early morning of 1 september 1939 british cabinet met late that morning and issued a warning to germany that unless it withdrew from polish territory britain would carry out its obligations to poland when house of commons met at 6 00 pm chamberlain and labour deputy leader arthur greenwood deputising for sick clement attlee entered chamber to loud cheers chamberlain spoke emotionally laying blame for conflict on hitler no formal declaration of war was immediately made french foreign minister georges bonnet stated that france could do nothing until its parliament met on evening of 2 september bonnet was trying to rally support for a munich style summit proposed by italians to be held on 5 september british cabinet demanded that hitler be given an ultimatum at once and if troops were not withdrawn by end of 2 september that war be declared forthwith chamberlain and halifax were convinced by bonnet s pleas from paris that france needed more time for mobilisation and evacuation and postponed expiry of ultimatum which had in fact not yet been served chamberlain s lengthy statement to house of commons made no mention of an ultimatum and house received it badly when greenwood rose to speak for working classes conservative backbencher leo amery urged him speak for england arthur implying that prime minister was not doing so chamberlain replied that telephone difficulties were making it hard to communicate with paris and tried to dispel fears that french were weakening he had little success too many members knew of bonnet s efforts national labour mp and diarist harold nicolson later wrote in those few minutes he flung away his reputation seeming delay gave rise to fears that chamberlain would again seek a settlement with hitler chamberlain s last peacetime cabinet met at 11 30 that night with a thunderstorm raging outside and determined that ultimatum would be presented in berlin at nine o clock following morning to expire two hours later before house of commons convened at noon at 11 15 am chamberlain addressed nation by radio stating that united kingdom was at war with germany that afternoon chamberlain addressed house of commons first sunday session in over 120 years he spoke to a quiet house in a statement which even opponents termed restrained and therefore effective phoney war thumb alt first page of a letter from churchill to chamberlain 1939 first page of a letter from churchill to chamberlain 1 october 1939 chamberlain instituted a war cabinet and invited labour and liberal parties to join his government but they declined he restored churchill to cabinet as first lord of admiralty with a seat in war cabinet chamberlain also gave eden a government post dominions secretary but not a seat in small war cabinet new first lord proved to be a difficult cabinet colleague deluging prime minister with a sea of lengthy memos chamberlain castigated churchill for sending so many memos as two met in war cabinet every day chamberlain suspected correctly as it proved after war that these letters are for purpose of quotation in book that he will write hereafter chamberlain was also able to deter some of churchill s more extreme plans such as operation catherine which would have sent three heavily armoured battleships into baltic sea with an aircraft carrier and other support vessels as a means of stopping shipments of iron ore to germany with naval war only significant front involving british in early months of conflict first lord s obvious desire to wage a ruthless victorious war established him as a leader in waiting in public consciousness and among parliamentary colleagues with little land action in west initial months of war were dubbed bore war later renamed phoney war by journalists chamberlain in common with most allied officials and generals felt war could be won relatively quickly by keeping economic pressure on germany through a blockade while continuing rearmament prime minister was reluctant to go too far in altering british economy government submitted an emergency war budget about which chamberlain stated only thing that matters is to win war though we may go bankrupt in process government expenditures rose by little more than rate of inflation between september 1939 and march 1940 despite these difficulties chamberlain still enjoyed approval ratings as high as 68 and almost 60 in april 1940 downfall in early 1940 allies approved a naval campaign designed to seize northern part of norway a neutral country including key port of narvik and possibly also to seize iron mines at in northern sweden from which germany obtained much of its iron ore as baltic froze in winter iron ore was then sent south by ship from narvik allies planned to begin by mining norwegian waters thus provoking a german reaction in norway and then would occupy much of country unforeseen by allies germany had also planned to occupy norway and on 9 april german troops occupied denmark and began an invasion of norway german forces quickly overran much of country allies sent troops to norway but they met with little success and on 26 april war cabinet ordered a withdrawal prime minister s opponents decided to turn adjournment debate for whitsun recess into a challenge to chamberlain who soon heard about plan after initial anger chamberlain determined to fight erin redihan neville chamberlain and norway trouble with a man of peace in a time of war new england journal of history 2013 69 1 2 pp 1 18 what became known as norway debate opened on 7 may and lasted for two days initial speeches including chamberlain s were nondescript but admiral of fleet sir roger keyes member for portsmouth north in full uniform delivered a withering attack on conduct of norway campaign though he excluded churchill from criticism leo amery then delivered a speech which he concluded by echoing oliver cromwell s words on dissolving long parliament you have sat here too long for any good you are doing depart i say and let us have done with you in name of god go when labour announced that they would call for a division of house of commons chamberlain called upon his friends and i still have some friends in this house to support government tonight because use of word friends was a conventional term to refer to party colleagues and according to biographer robert self many mps took it that way it was an error of judgment for chamberlain to refer to party loyalty when gravity of war situation required national unity lloyd george joined attackers and churchill concluded debate with a vigorous speech in support of government when division took place government which had a normal majority of over 200 prevailed by only 81 with 38 mps in receipt of government whip voting against it with between 20 and 25 abstaining chamberlain spent much of 9 may in meetings with his cabinet colleagues many conservative mps even those who had voted against government indicated on 9 may and in days following that they did not wish chamberlain to depart but rather would seek to reconstruct his government chamberlain decided that he would resign unless labour party was willing to join his government and so he met with attlee later that day attlee was unwilling but agreed to consult his national executive then meeting in bournemouth chamberlain favoured halifax as next prime minister but halifax proved reluctant to press his own claims and churchill emerged as choice following day germany invaded low countries and chamberlain considered remaining in office attlee confirmed that labour would not serve under chamberlain though they were willing to serve under someone else accordingly chamberlain went to buckingham palace to resign and advise king to send for churchill churchill later expressed gratitude to chamberlain for not advising king to send for halifax who would have commanded support of most government mps in a resignation broadcast that evening chamberlain told nation queen elizabeth told chamberlain that her daughter princess elizabeth wept as she heard broadcast churchill wrote to express his gratitude for chamberlain s willingness to stand by him in nation s hour of need and lord baldwin only living former prime minister besides chamberlain and lloyd george wrote you have passed through fire since we were talking together only a fortnight ago and you have come out pure gold lord president of council in a departure from usual practice chamberlain did not issue any resignation honours list with chamberlain remaining leader of conservative party and with many mps still supporting him and distrusting new prime minister churchill refrained from any purge of chamberlain loyalists churchill wished chamberlain to return to exchequer but he declined convinced that this would lead to difficulties with labour party instead he accepted post of lord president of council with a seat in shrunken five member war cabinet when chamberlain entered house of commons on 13 may 1940 for first time since his resignation mps lost their heads they shouted they cheered they waved their order papers and his reception was a regular ovation house received churchill coolly some of his great speeches to chamber such as we shall fight on beaches met with only half hearted enthusiasm chamberlain s fall from power left him deeply depressed he wrote few men can have known such a reversal of fortune in so short a time he especially regretted loss of chequers as a place where i have been so happy though after a farewell visit there by chamberlains on 19 june he wrote i am content now that i have done that and shall put chequers out of my mind as lord president chamberlain assumed vast responsibilities over domestic issues and chaired war cabinet during churchill s many absences attlee later remembered him as free from any of rancour he might have felt against us he worked very hard and well a good chairman a good committeeman always very businesslike as chairman of lord president s committee he exerted great influence over wartime economy halifax reported to war cabinet on 26 may 1940 with low countries conquered and french prime minister paul reynaud warning that france might have to sign an armistice that diplomatic contacts with a still neutral italy offered possibility of a negotiated peace halifax urged following up and seeing if a worthwhile offer could be obtained battle over course of action within war cabinet lasted three days chamberlain s statement on final day that there was unlikely to be an acceptable offer and that matter should not be pursued at that time helped persuade war cabinet to reject negotiations thumb upright alt david lloyd george david lloyd george prime minister 1916 22 whose contempt for chamberlain was reciprocated twice in may 1940 churchill broached subject of bringing lloyd george into government each time chamberlain indicated that due to their longtime antipathy he would immediately retire if lloyd george were appointed a minister churchill did not appoint lloyd george but brought up subject with chamberlain again early in june this time chamberlain agreed to lloyd george s appointment provided lloyd george gave a personal assurance to put aside feud lloyd george declined to serve in churchill s government chamberlain worked to bring his conservative party in line behind churchill working with chief whip david to overcome members suspicions and dislikes of prime minister on 4 july after british attack on french fleet churchill entered chamber to a great cheer from conservative mps orchestrated by two and prime minister was almost overcome with emotion at first cheer he had received from his own party s benches since may churchill returned loyalty refusing to consider labour and liberal attempts to expel chamberlain from government when criticisms of chamberlain appeared in press and when chamberlain learned that labour intended to use an upcoming secret session of parliament as a platform to attack him he told churchill that he could only defend himself by attacking labour prime minister intervened with labour party and press and criticism ceased according to chamberlain like turning off a tap in july 1940 a polemic titled guilty men was released by cato a pseudonym for three journalists including future labour leader michael foot it attacked record of national government alleging that it had failed to prepare adequately for war it called for removal of chamberlain and other ministers who had allegedly contributed to british disasters of early part of war short book sold more than 200 000 copies many of which were passed from hand to hand and went into 27 editions in first few months despite not being carried by several major bookshops according to historian david dutton its impact upon chamberlain s reputation both among general public and within academic world was profound indeed chamberlain had long enjoyed excellent health except for occasional attacks of gout but by july 1940 he was in almost constant pain he sought treatment and later that month entered hospital for surgery surgeons discovered that he was suffering from terminal bowel cancer but they concealed it from him instead telling him that he would not require further surgery chamberlain resumed work in mid august he returned to his office on 9 september but renewed pain compounded by night time bombing of london which forced him to go to an air raid shelter and denied him rest sapped his energy and he left london for last time on 19 september returning to highfield park in chamberlain offered his resignation to churchill on 22 september prime minister was initially reluctant to accept but as both men realised that chamberlain would never return to work churchill finally allowed him to resign prime minister asked if chamberlain would accept highest order of british chivalry order of garter of which his brother had been a member chamberlain refused saying he would prefer to die plain mr chamberlain like my father before me unadorned by any title in short time remaining to him chamberlain was angered by short cold and for most part press comments on his retirement according to him written without slightest sign of sympathy for man or even any comprehension that there may be a human tragedy in background king and queen drove down from windsor to visit dying man on 14 october chamberlain received hundreds of sympathetic letters from friends and supporters he wrote to john simon who had served as chancellor of exchequer in chamberlain s government death chamberlain died of bowel cancer on 9 november 1940 at age of 71 a funeral service took place at westminster abbey due to wartime security concerns date and time were not widely publicised after cremation his ashes were interred in abbey next to those of bonar law churchill eulogised chamberlain in house of commons three days after his death though some chamberlain supporters found churchill s oratory to be faint praise of late prime minister churchill added less publicly whatever shall i do without poor neville i was relying on him to look after home front for me amongst others who paid tribute to chamberlain in commons and in house of lords on 12 november were lord halifax attlee and liberal party leader and air minister sir archibald sinclair lloyd george only former prime minister remaining in commons had been expected to speak but absented himself from proceedings ever close to his family executors of chamberlain s will were his cousins wilfred byng kenrick and sir wilfrid martineau both of whom like chamberlain were lord mayors of birmingham legacy and reputation thumb alt round blue plaque on a brick wall it says birmingham civic society

men was not only second world war tract that damaged chamberlain s reputation we were not all wrong published in 1941 took a similar tack to guilty men arguing that liberal and labour mps and a small number of conservatives had fought against chamberlain s appeasement policies author liberal mp geoffrey mander had voted against conscription in 1939 another polemic against conservative policies was why not trust tories 1944 written by gracchus who was later revealed to be future labour minister aneurin bevan which castigated conservatives for foreign policy decisions of baldwin and chamberlain though a few conservatives offered their own versions of events most notably mp quintin hogg in his 1945 left was never right by end of war there was a very strong public belief that chamberlain was culpable for serious diplomatic and military misjudgements that had nearly caused britain s defeat chamberlain s reputation was devastated by these attacks from left in 1948 with publication of gathering storm first volume of churchill s six volume set second world war chamberlain sustained an even more serious assault from right while churchill stated privately this is not history this is my case his series was still hugely influential churchill depicted chamberlain as well meaning but weak blind to threat posed by hitler and oblivious to fact that according to churchill hitler could have been removed from power by a grand coalition of european states churchill suggested that year s delay between munich and war worsened britain s position and criticised chamberlain for both peacetime and wartime decisions in years following publication of churchill s books few historians questioned his judgment anne chamberlain former premier s widow suggested that churchill s work was filled with matters that are not real misstatements that could easily be corrected but wholesale omissions and assumptions that certain things are now recognised as facts which actually have no such position many of chamberlain s family letters and his extensive personal papers were bequeathed by his family in 1974 to birmingham university archives during war chamberlain family had commissioned historian keith feiling to produce an official biography and gave him access to chamberlain s private diaries and papers while feiling had right of access to official papers as official biographer of a recently deceased person he may not have been aware of provision and cabinet secretary denied his requests for access though feiling produced what historian david dutton described in 2001 as most impressive and persuasive single volume biography of chamberlain completed during war and published in 1946 he could not repair damage already done to chamberlain s reputation conservative mp iain macleod s 1961 biography of chamberlain was first major biography of a revisionist school of thought on chamberlain same year a j p taylor in his origins of second world war found that chamberlain had adequately rearmed britain for defence though a rearmament designed to defeat germany would have taken massive additional resources and described munich as a triumph for all that was best and most enlightened in british life and for those who had courageously denounced harshness and short sightedness of versailles adoption of thirty year rule in 1967 made available many of papers of chamberlain government over subsequent three years helping to explain why chamberlain acted as he did resultant works greatly fuelled revisionist school although they also included books that strongly criticised chamberlain such as keith middlemas s 1972 diplomacy of illusion which portrayed chamberlain as a seasoned politician with strategic blindness when it came to germany released papers indicated that contrary to claims made in guilty men chamberlain had neither ignored advice of foreign office nor had he disregarded and run roughshod over his cabinet other released papers showed that chamberlain had considered seeking a grand coalition amongst european governments like that later advocated by churchill but had rejected it on ground that division of europe into two camps would make war more not less likely they also showed that chamberlain had been advised that dominions pursuing independent foreign policies under statute of westminster had indicated that chamberlain could not depend on their help in event of a continental war chiefs of staff report which indicated that britain could not forcibly prevent germany from conquering czechoslovakia was first publicly known at this time in reaction to revisionist school of thought regarding chamberlain a post revisionist school emerged beginning in 1990s using released papers to justify initial conclusions of guilty men oxford historian r a c parker argued that chamberlain could have forged a close alliance with france after anschluss in early 1938 and begun a policy of containment of germany under auspices of league of nations while many revisionist writers had suggested that chamberlain had had few or no choices in his actions parker argued that chamberlain and his colleagues had chosen appeasement over other viable policies in his two volumes chamberlain and appeasement 1993 and churchill and appeasement 2000 parker stated that chamberlain due to his powerful obstinate personality and his skill in debate caused britain to embrace appeasement instead of effective deterrence parker also suggested that had churchill held high office in second half of 1930s churchill would have built a series of alliances which would have deterred hitler and perhaps would have caused hitler s domestic opponents to procure his removal dutton observes that chamberlain s reputation for good or ill will probably always be closely tied to
