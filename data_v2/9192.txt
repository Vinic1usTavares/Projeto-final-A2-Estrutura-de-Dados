legislature in 1830s his term in congress in 1840s his emergence as a leader of new republican party in 1850s and his presidency during civil war book closely examines lincoln s speeches and writings and avoids direct engagement with previous lincoln historians fiery trial begins with lincoln s encounters with slavery in his early life growing up in kentucky and indiana he occasionally dealt with issues of slavery in his law practice in illinois book also discusses lincoln s position on slavery in context of his political career lincoln was a moderate attempting to bridge gap between abolitionist radical republicans and conservative democrats including those in slave holding states whom he hoped would choose preserving union over steadfastly defending slavery lincoln initially supported idea of voluntary colonization of freed blacks to africa a stance supported by some politicians at time although considered unethical by many however lincoln eventually abandoned his moderate stance on slavery when he determined that to win american civil war he needed to act to end slavery in epilogue foner praises lincoln s capacity for growth essence of his greatness and speculates that had he not been assassinated he could have helped to prevent disenfranchisement and segregation of blacks that followed emancipation foner concludes with a quotation by abolitionist lydia maria child i think we have reason to thank god for abraham lincoln with all his deficiencies it must be admitted that he has grown continuously and considering how slavery had weakened and perverted moral sense of whole country it was great good luck to have people elect a man who was willing to grow background thumb left eric foner book s author eric foner book s author is dewitt

prodigious research and his deep knowledge of era allow him to provide perhaps best account of this subject available today even seasoned scholars will find facts in this volume that are new to them

lincoln s views of slavery in an accessible and exciting way reviewing for washington post fred kaplan was more critical though kaplan stated that comprehensive review of mostly familiar material would make fiery trial book of first convenience to go to on subject he also argued that in contrast to foner s thesis of growth a stronger argument can be made that lincoln hardly grew at all on issue of slavery that he responded to changing circumstances that he did not create fiery trial won 2011 pulitzer prize for history bancroft prize and lincoln prize new york times book review listed
