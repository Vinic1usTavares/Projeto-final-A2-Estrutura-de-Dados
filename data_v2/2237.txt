ruled version of same state which also failed to win international recognition after an interim period under british control from december 1979 to april 1980 rli briefly remained active within armed forces of zimbabwe but did not see action under this government it disbanded on 31 october 1980 bush war involved counter insurgency operations by rhodesian security forces against two rival guerrilla armies zimbabwe african national liberation army zanla attached to zimbabwe african national union zanu and military wing of zimbabwe african people s union zapu zimbabwe people s revolutionary army zipra following its reorganisation as a specialised commando unit starting in late 1964 rli played a major role in war during its early phase effectively countering zanla and zipra incursions after zanla spent 1971 and 1972 covertly subverting local black population of north eastern rhodesia to their side in maoist fashion it attacked two white farms near north eastern village of centenary in december 1972 rli was one of first units despatched to counter infiltration and operation hurricane a major counter insurgency action was started in country s north east soon after hurricane would

this period rli reinforced reputation it had carved for itself during 1960s on 25 july 1975 it received freedom of city of salisbury its successful execution of new fireforce procedure from 1974 leads

assemble in mozambique and infiltrate once subverted area in question had been prepared with base camps ready and local contact men waiting in order not to frighten recruits wood goes on rhodesian firepower was not mentioned thus a first contact could be traumatic to new cadres and contributed to their poor performance in fire fights operation sable rli underwent extensive training during 1972 running a classical war exercise from march to april and then coordinating a larger scale exercise of same nature with rhodesia regiment for two months starting in june two weeks of counter insurgency training followed starting in early september 1972 this proved appropriate for what was to come immediately after operation sable rli s first battalion size operation in mozambique which began in late september sable followed on from a rhodesian special air service sas action in same area against several local frelimo base camps which were fighting portuguese armed forces and at same time assisting zanla plan called for 2 and 3 commandos and support group rli to march due north from where ruya river met border with rhodesia and set up a stop line about in after this 1 commando would be deployed

patches of thick bush slowed advance down considerably as did loss of tarr on first day during first day s lay up rod tarr somehow got boiling water in his boot and had to be casevaced writes ian buttenshaw then an rli lieutenant second night was just as bad although rli did not contact any insurgents during its advance several deserted but well established camps were discovered battalion found many more such bases during september and october but all were vacant cadres having become aware of rli presence and pulled out of area rli was ultimately withdrawn from mozambique without having encountered any guerrillas and operation was abandoned buttenshaw continues although no kills were achieved a lot of valuable lessons were learned which would eventually be of use when planning future externals major effect of operation was that it certainly delayed terr incursions and build up in area east of ruya river chimurenga bush war begins in earnest zanla attacks altena and whistlefield farms rhodesian intelligence which had been monitoring zanla s activity and preparations grew curious when over a four week period in november 1972 sources of information suddenly began to dry up in words of historian alexandre binda they sensed that something was afoot but their superiors brushed off their fears binda says senior rhodesian authorities had been lulled into a sense of arrogant self confidence based on security forces past successes this false veneer of security was smashed on 21 december 1972 when a group of ten zanla cadres led by rex nhongo attacked white owned altena farm near north eastern village of centenary about west of mount darwin zanla had planned for four attacks to take place simultaneously but in event only nhongo s men did so according to historian elaine nhongo was a former employee of tobacco farm s 37 year old owner marc de borchgrave and held a grudge against him cadres shot up farm house with ak 47 assault rifles and threw grenades through windows then retreated and hid amongst local population nobody was killed in attack but farmer s eight year old daughter jane was wounded in foot isolated house had no telephone or any other means of contacting neighbours and de borchgrave was wary of being ambushed should he drive his car out so after a short time comforting children he set out across country on foot to seek help and alert authorities this done he returned and took his wife and children to another farm nearby whistlefield which was owned by archie and his family despite warnings of their intelligence officers security chiefs were caught completely by surprise rli headquarters and all three commandos were deployed in zambezi valley on routine border control duty and support group was at cranborne barracks a troop of support group men under second lieutenant ian buttenshaw was despatched to centenary next day along with a troop of sas led by bert sachse in their preliminary sweep around altena farm they discovered a land mine planted in road but no insurgents while security forces were patrolling around altena nhongo s men approached whistlefield farm in late evening of 22 december and as at altena attacked farm house with rifle fire grenades and an rpg 7 rocket launcher which was aimed into bedroom in which de borchgrave was sleeping rocket hit window frame and lightly wounded tobacco farmer and his nine year old daughter anne zanla cadres then retreated and hid themselves news of second attack reached buttenshaw and sachse around midnight and they deployed immediately but having discovered a mine near altena they disembarked from vehicles from whistlefield and made final approach on foot anne was evacuated by helicopter as rli and sas men secured area for night next morning on 24 december 1972 two tracking teams arrived at whistlefield to assist buttenshaw and sachse in a 360 degree search one was from sas and led by ron while other was a british south africa police bsap team including tracking dogs security forces searched for tracks while also investigating reported sightings tracks of zanla fighters were discovered on 27 december on western side of farm and trackers asked buttenshaw and sachse to bring vehicles carrying heavy equipment around to meet them on way truck carrying buttenshaw ran over a mine with one of its rear wheels causing it to detonate buttenshaw himself who was sitting on bonnet of vehicle was thrown clear but corporal norman moore and trooper pete botha sitting in back were not as fortunate taking brunt of blast captain gordon holloway behind wheel and trooper rod boden in passenger seat went into severe shock but were ultimately unharmed moore on other hand died two days later from his wounds while botha survived but lost both legs in their haste nhongo s cadres had not attempted to conceal their tracks as they headed west towards musengezi river buttenshaw s pursuant rli men therefore realised how quickly guerrillas were moving and sped up their chase rhodesians stopped for night in a rocky area near a stream replenished their scanty water supply and continued at dawn about half an hour after setting off they crossed a vlei to discover a recently vacated guerrilla camp fire was still burning and food still warm buttenshaw writes from abandoned kit a hurried departure appeared evident support was summoned from sas who were tasked to set up stops along musengezi to west buttenshaw s men reached top of musengezi valley to see rhodesian helicopters dropping sas soldiers at regular intervals along river as well as zanla cadres who were moving straight towards one of sas stops stop opened fire and killed some rest of guerrillas scattered and ran buttenshaw s rli men were then withdrawn from follow up for a day and a half and placed in stop positions chase was temporarily taken over by sas under lieutenant chris schulenburg before buttenshaw s men returned on 30 december 1972 soon after setting out that morning they discovered an unarmed wounded zanla fighter who had been shot in arm by sas in initial contact two days earlier he had hidden himself after being abandoned by his comrades and since then had lost a great deal of blood after two years of patient preparation farm attacks by zanla near centenary marked effective start of its second chimurenga against rhodesian government effectiveness of zanla s adopted maoist tactics was demonstrated in particular by element of surprise they were now able to use against security forces and by ability they had achieved to melt seamlessly into local population between strikes rural black people in north east of country were now in binda s words almost totally subverted and intimidated by zanla and provided guerrillas with food shelter and manpower rather than having tribesmen actively volunteer information about insurgent movements and locations as had happened during previous infiltrations rhodesian security forces now met an increasingly silent and sometimes hostile welcome from rural blacks more farm attacks took place over following weeks during december 1972 and january 1973 leading security forces to set up operation hurricane in northern mashonaland this counter insurgency operation would continue right up to 1980 it was start of a whole new ball game writes lieutenant colonel r e h lockley war proper had started selous scouts are created rhodesian government and security forces were surprised and confused by these developments and by fact that they now with increasing regularity found dirt roads in country s north east rigged with zanla land mines rate at which security forces took casualties began to climb and morale concurrently dropped because new zanla tactics were based around avoiding direct confrontation with military and instead covertly bringing local villages onto their side security forces initially had difficulty countering campaign they adapted to new situation by creating selous scouts in november 1973 major ron reid daly a 10 year veteran of rli was brought out of retirement to head new unit which was a combat reconnaissance regiment made up of volunteers selous scouts were tasked with according to their charter clandestine elimination of terrorists terrorism both within and without country unlike rli it was a mixed race force including both black and white soldiers ratio of black to white oscillated during war between 50 black and 80 black these included rhodesian army s first black commissioned officers reid daly s special branch counterpart in selous scouts operations was police superintendent mac mcguiness whose men would persuade captured insurgents to change sides former guerrillas fighting for security forces were said to have been turned introduction of selous scouts in late 1973 countered new zanla tactics very effectively perhaps because those of scouts were deliberately similar a squad of selous scouts and turned insurgents would move into a captured area formerly occupied by guerrillas and give appearance of being cadres themselves in doing so they would win trust of both local people and any insurgents operating nearby which would allow them to discover enemy camps and gathering points these would then be given to conventional troops who would move in to attack with selous scouts escorting them scouts and their unorthodox tactics resolved problem encountered a year before when intelligence had suddenly become scarce security forces now once again knew where their enemy was and could confront him concept proved to be devastatingly effective against enemy says binda playing him at his own game so successfully that he was as a result hard pressed and confused to know whom he could trust however by same token selous scouts so resembled nationalist guerrillas that rhodesian security chiefs worried that their conventional units might mistake them for real thing indeed earlier in 1973 sergeant andre rabie had been killed by friendly fire in precisely these circumstances during a similar deep cover action rabie gave an incorrect grid reference while calling for reinforcements and when an rli patrol saw him they mistook him for a guerrilla and shot him dead to prevent this from happening to selous scouts large areas of bush were periodically declared frozen areas where only they were allowed to operate this gave rise to a common nickname for unit eskimos cordon sanitaire protected villages and minefields thumb existing and planned protected villages pvs on 6 january 1978 click here to enlarge map alt a map see description as another part of their tactical shift rhodesians set up protected villages pvs to protect tribesmen and their families and deny insurgents access to them starting in may 1974 they also set up a so called cordon sanitaire a vast mine field along borders with zambia and mozambique about long and varying between and wide zanla eventually estimated that during entire war it lost 8 000 of its fighters to minefield while attempting to cross it lieutenant colonel a n o macintyre was replaced as commanding officer of rli on 17 april 1973 by lieutenant colonel r w southey zanla cadres attacked school at st albert s mission between centenary and mount darwin in july 1973 and abducted 292 pupils and staff whom they force marched north into zambezi valley and towards mozambique they were intercepted by rhodesian security forces and all but eight of children and staff were recovered similar abductions were repeated over following years and security forces found themselves increasingly unable to prevent them captured schoolchildren would be marched to zanla bases in mozambique where they would undergo political re education abbott s and botham s words and guerrilla training security forces attempted to prevent rural blacks from cooperating with zanla by instituting collective punishment on villages where cadres were known to have received assistance for example curfews would be imposed and schools and stores closed a more extreme example came in april 1974 when nearly 200 local people from madziwa tribal trust lands were resettled to another part of country as punishment for assisting terrorists at this stage majority of local population were not necessarily supporters of either zanu or zapu writes historian jakkie cilliers collective punishment measures such as these could only have had serious negative effects on attitude of black rural masses protected village programme started on 27 july 1974 when operation overload began in chiweshe tribal trust lands where according to reid daly apparent support for zanla cause was without doubt overwhelming over course of six weeks 49 960 rural people were moved into 21 protected villages people in northern chiweshe area had been subject to violent political intimidation by zanla and so for most part moved willingly but in southern part of area where support for cadres was stronger resistance was encountered security forces destroyed old huts after their occupants had moved in short term benefits seemed substantial says cilliers as insurgent activities were severely disrupted in chiweshe for following six months security forces immediately set about a similar operation called overload two in madziwa tribal trust lands which met with further success this combined with effectiveness of recently formed selous scouts to reduce zanla influence in area and force cadres back to north towards mozambique after their lapse in concentration security forces had begun to regain control birth of fireforce doctrine which became rli s characteristic action fireforce had first been discussed by rli and rhodesian air force rhaf officers in early 1970s security forces considered how to contact guerrillas on their own terms new zanla tactics were based around deliberately avoiding confrontation so far as was possible and hiding amongst local population so it was difficult for rhodesians to fight them face to face chasing nationalists with trackers was ineffective as tracker in order to find guerrilla s tracks had to move slower and air pursuit when used alone was deemed similarly ineffective a tactic which combined two was developed jointly given name fireforce by lieutenant chris pearce of rli and first deployed in january 1974 at mount darwin when it was first used in action a month later on 24 february 1974 rli and rhaf air support eliminated a zanla group thumb left alt a small camouflaged military helicopter seen from right and from below south african markings can be seen on aircraft s tail fireforce was based largely around use of alouette iiis like this one of south african air force fireforce was a variant on vertical envelopment tactic in which ground troops would be carried directly to target by air and dropped it was designed to react instantly to guerrilla ambushes farm attacks and sightings and could also be called upon by members of security forces as reinforcements preparatory deployment was very flexible all that was required for a base was an airstrip there would usually be three main in operation at each time each of which would be handled by a company sized body of men usually one of rli commandos or a company of rhodesian african rifles unit in question would be posted at a forward airfield for six weeks though sometimes for longer and given responsibility for thousands of square kilometres of rhodesian countryside selous scouts hidden forward observation posts ops allowed for instant reactions by fireforce to sightings of enemy guerrillas when an attack contact or sighting was reported a siren would sound throughout base and troopers would rush out to react in two waves first wave of 32 soldiers would be transported to area aboard alouette iii helicopters commonly called g cars and would be accompanied by a further alouette iii acting as command gunship or k car and a cessna skymaster or lynx light support aircraft each alouette could carry a stick of four soldiers so on fireforce first wave was organised into eight four man stops remainder of commando second wave would either be carried by same aircraft which returned to collect them or move by truck at same time as first wave object of fireforce was to quickly trap and wipe out guerrilla groups before they could evacuate area so element of surprise was important but this was difficult to maintain because of noise of an alouette iii s jet engine on a windy day in quiet bush an alouette iii can be heard downwind many kilometres away hearing fireforce coming from this distance would give cadres plenty of time to hide themselves so rhaf pilots would attempt to approach their targets heading upwind to minimise this effect fireforce used in conjunction with selous scouts methods proved very effective for security forces who began to gain upper hand doubling of length of national service from six to 12 months also contributed as it gave rhodesians more troops conscripted men had first entered rli ranks in 1973 and were used in increasing numbers to make up shortages in manpower under leadership of a new commanding officer lieutenant colonel david parker nicknamed king by rli men battalion also embarked on a large and successful overseas recruitment drive starting in 1974 seeking foreign volunteers from europe americas and oceania security forces struck back strongly against zanla during 1974 killing 345 of its guerrillas and 75 of its leadership during october and november 1974 rhodesians killed more insurgents than they had during entire previous two years less than 300 zanla cadres remained in country at end of that year with cilliers giving an official rhodesian figure of 70 all were confined to north eastern rhodesia and were retreating towards mozambique political complications overseas affect conflict portuguese support for rhodesia is withdrawn that of south africa wavers impact of security forces decisive counter campaign was to be undone by two drastic changes to geopolitical situation in 1974 and 1975 each relating to one of rhodesian government s two main backers portugal and south africa in lisbon a military coup on 25 april 1974 replaced right wing estado novo administration with a leftist government opposed to unpopular colonial war in angola mozambique and portugal s other african territories following this coup which became known as carnation revolution portuguese leadership was hurriedly withdrawn from lisbon s overseas territories each of which was earmarked for an immediate handover to communist guerrillas brief frenzied negotiations with frelimo in mozambique preceded country s independence on 25 june 1975 frelimo took power without contesting an election while machel assumed presidency now that mozambique was under a friendly government zanla could freely base themselves there with full support of machel and frelimo with whom an alliance had already existed since late 1960s rhodesian security forces on other hand now had a further of border to defend and had to rely on south africa alone for imports government of south africa however had already altered its stance in late 1974 when it had adopted a doctrine of detente with frontline states in an attempt to resolve situation in rhodesia south african prime minister b j vorster negotiated a deal zambian president kenneth kaunda would prevent infiltrations by rhodesian guerrillas and in return rhodesian prime minister ian smith would agree to a ceasefire and release all political detainees leaders of zanu and zapu who would then attend a conference in rhodesia united under a single banner and led by bishop abel muzorewa and his african national council anc vorster hoped that if this were successful frontline states would grant recognition to south africa despite continuation of apartheid and enter full diplomatic relations under pressure from pretoria to accept terms rhodesians agreed on 11 december 1974 and followed terms of ceasefire rhodesian military actions were temporarily halted and troops were ordered to allow retreating guerrillas to leave unhindered vorster withdrew some 2 000 members of south african police sap from forward bases in rhodesia and by august 1975 had pulled sap out of rhodesia completely nationalists used sudden cessation of security force activity as an opportunity to regroup and re establish themselves both inside and outside country guerrilla operations continued an average of six incidents a day were reported inside rhodesia over following months far from being seen as a gesture of potential reconciliation ceasefire and release of nationalist leaders gave message to rural population that security forces had been defeated and that guerrillas were in process of emulating frelimo s victory in mozambique detente terms led to victoria falls conference of august 1975 which collapsed after nine and a half hours each side blaming other for break up an unsuccessful fireforce for 2 commando 19 july 1975 unsuccessful contacts were exception rather than norm for rli particularly on fireforce an example is an encounter with guerrillas in tribal trust lands north of mount darwin on 19 july 1975 on that day a territorial force tf unit engaged a group of cadres near a river and killed two without suffering casualties nationalist fighters retreated into a defensive ambush position on banks beneath roots of some overhanging trees territorials then summoned a fireforce made up of 7 and 10 troops 2 commando from mount darwin and on arrival made a sweep of river line accompanied by 10 troop when rhodesians rounded a bend in stream concealed insurgents opened fire immediately killing a territorial sergeant and rli rifleman hennie potgieter rifleman ken lucas an fn mag gunner suffered a wound to his leg after initial burst of fire insurgents remained behind their cover and waited concealed from security force eyes judging from silence and inactivity that guerrillas had fled and thinking that two downed men were still alive major hank meyer told lieutenant joe du plooy to sweep around river with two 7 troop sticks and send a medic out to give treatment lieutenant du plooy took his men around bend behind cover then sent his american medic corporal john alan coey of columbus ohio out into open streambed to render medical assistance though his prominent red cross flag was clearly visible hidden cadres immediately opened fire on coey who was killed almost instantly by a shot through head his body fell at du plooy s feet stand off continued for rest of day during which time du plooy and one other rli man were wounded security forces were only able to gather their dead for evacuation when darkness fell during night rhodesians deployed stops in ambush positions around insurgents position to prevent an escape when guerrillas attempted to sneak through security force perimeter in early hours they ran into corporal de beer s rli men and a fire fight ensued guerrillas shot de beer dead and wounded one of his troopers as they broke through and quickly left area morale of 2 commando s men took a noticeable hit after this unsuccessful fireforce in which cadres had killed four rhodesian soldiers and wounded four more freedom of city 25 july 1975 rli on town rli

through streets of capital with bayonets fixed men stood in line as parker reviewed troops followed by majors charlie aust and pat armstrong scroll bestowing freedom of city was then paraded past men followed by regimental colours which were carried by lieutenant richard awarding of freedom of city was controversial in some quarters because of far from clean reputation of rli soldiers while off duty rli s own brand of mayhem and havoc in binda s words was infamous while they were on rest and recuperation alcohol fuelled fights would routinely erupt in salisbury bars and nightclubs between rli men and their civilian counterparts over women perceived bad service or simple misunderstandings these sometimes led to summoning of police but soldiers vehement combative refusal to be arrested made this step somewhat counter productive apart from these violent confrontations with civilian men and policemen stunts pulled by off duty rli men often took form of immature pranks on women for example soldiers would defecate in a girl s handbag while she was on dancefloor or sneak into ladies lavatories to rub extremely itchy buffalo beans on seats and paper sometimes they went even further on one occasion two men were given a lift back to cranborne barracks by an elderly lady whose handbag they then stole on another night an rli soldier tossed a fragmentation grenade into a taxi then ran away in most extreme cases men would be disciplined but regiment s officers would often turn a blind eye to less serious incidents as they were so common presence of rli s two conflicting reputations excellent in field but appalling at home is evident from line of reporting taken by rhodesia herald on 25 july 1975 alongside front page article announcing award and day s parade through salisbury there prominently appears a cartoon satirising rli s off duty antics two rli officers in dress uniform are portrayed in a salisbury street both turning angrily to see a uniformed rli trooper

support group a commando in its own right new support commando was created on 6 january 1976 under command of major pat armstrong and moved out of base group headquarters into its own offices directly next door guerrilla incursions renewed in first months of 1976 with three waves of nationalists crossing from mozambique between january and april first group of 90 fighters crossed border south of nyamapanda on 21 january and was immediately repulsed four cadres being killed and one captured by security forces attack on nyamapanda was supposed to be one part of a three pronged invasion but nationalist operation did not go to plan second group of 130 guerrillas attacked melsetter area five weeks later and third assault in rhodesia s south east did not take place until another seven weeks after that in april 1976 three months behind schedule smith addressed nation on evening of 6 february 1976 warning that a new terrorist offensive has begun and to defeat it rhodesians will have to face heavier military commitments mozambique formally declared a state of war with rhodesia a month later on 3 march with security force reports indicating that around 1 000 fighters were active within rhodesia with a further 15 000 encamped in various states of readiness in mozambique three more rhodesian operational areas were defined in addition to operation hurricane operation thrasher covering rhodesia s eastern highlands was designated in february 1976 and operations repulse and tangent handling south east and west respectively followed in may and august zanla and zipra cadres were officially working together but in reality armies relationship was fraught with tension as well as tribal lines zanla s men were predominantly shona whilst zipra s were mostly ndebele there were political issues and differences of opinion regarding doctrine zanla favoured a continuation of their existing maoist tactics spreading themselves amongst rural people and politicising them by fair means or foul as wood says while zipra preferred to overtly recruit fighters and train them overseas for conventional invasions zipra s relative inactivity in war since 1970 also contributed to sentiment amongst some zanla cadres that their supposed allies in chimurenga were not pulling their weight as zanla were superior in number to zipra their men began to usurp positions of command and authority at joint training facilities abroad which made strain yet more potent mutual ill feeling finally boiled over into open clashes at two training camps in tanzania and in early 1976 in one incident 400 nationalists were killed while in another 200 died despite continued animosity combined guerrilla groups continued to enter rhodesia usually made up of eight zanla and two zipra men according to lockley zipra fighters so disliked their zanla comrades that they would sometimes deliberately become separated desert and go home rather than fight alongside them rhodesian foreign legion rli ranks are bolstered by conscripts and foreign volunteers rli s drive for foreign volunteers launched in earnest in 1974 proved very successful attracting hundreds of recruits from all over world increased inclusion of conscripted men combined with this to gradually change character and dynamics of regiment a watershed in history of rli says cocks is intake 150 which passed out in may 1976 rli intake 150 was largest ever and was made up mostly of 18 year old national servicemen many of whom cocks continues simply did not want to be there foreign volunteers alongside them were greater in number than ever before and absorption of men from overseas would increase yet further as war went on whereas conscripted men had previously been of a small enough volume that they could be gently assimilated into combat ranks over time intake 150 gave rli so many new inexperienced rookies that they would often outnumber veterans in field casualties were unusually high amongst intake 150 members during their first month in action and this trend continued for inexperienced men for rest of battalion s history in most extreme case on 10 june 1979 trooper robbie francis was killed on his first day as a member of 3 commando p k van der byl minister of defence reviewed new recruits and addressed them with fiery vigour as they passed out then answered questions from press in a similar vein when possibility of open cuban military intervention on side of guerrillas was raised van der byl declared that rhodesian army would beat life and soul out of them soldiers from overseas serving in rhodesian forces received same pay and conditions of service as locally based regulars almost all of them mustered into rli though some joined sas many were professional soldiers attracted by regiment s reputation most prevalent were former members of british armed forces and vietnam veterans from united states australian and new zealand forces but almost every first world nation was represented seasoned foreigners soon became an integral part of battalion cocks writes contributing to rli s fine reputation and also passing their experience onto young recently conscripted men some foreign volunteers had no military experience and found themselves in a similar situation to rhodesian teenagers these foreigners were generally motivated to enlist by anti communist political views

psychiatric hospital in june 1966 aged 18 he had killed two strangers in a shooting spree in his home town but avoided death penalty on a court ruling that at time of incident he had been insane keeping his past life a secret he became a popular and well regarded soldier in 3 commando and eventually rose to rank of lance corporal taking command of a fireforce stick on operation thrasher shortly before he was killed in action on 7 november 1976 by an errant shot from one of his own men selous scouts win a major external victory at nyadzonya but rli is held back most of nationalists still remained outside country where for fear of derailing peace process rhodesian politicians and generals would not allow security forces to overtly attack them as a result one major rhodesian external operation of 1976 was a covert attack by selous scouts later described by reid daly as classic operation of whole war on morning of 9 august 1976 72 scouts dressed themselves and their vehicles to look like frelimo then drove to nyadzonya in central mozambique where rhodesian intelligence said 5 000 guerrillas were encamped at a major zanla base scouts were so well disguised that zanla guards allowed them to drive straight into camp at 08 25 where they surrounded parade ground and opened fire more than 1 000 zanla insurgents were reported killed by rhodesians with no losses for selous scouts who suffered only four lightly wounded zanla s official internal report on matter corroborates these figures as well as fact that nyadzonya was a guerrilla base but publicly both zanu and zapu clamoured that nyadzonya had been a camp for refugees united nations high commissioner for refugees prince aga khan condemned rhodesian attack as an atrocity international press took a similar line and incident proved to be a public relations disaster for rhodesian government and armed forces edgar tekere then a top zanla lieutenant told british journalist david dimbleby after war that nyadzonya had indeed been a legitimate target and that guerrilla bases had been designated refugee camps in a successful attempt to deter rhodesian attacks and win international sympathy vorster was so angered by raid that he immediately terminated operation polo under which members of south african forces had secretly stayed on in rhodesia after their official withdrawal in august 1975 this and general international condemnation after nyadzonya made rhodesians very hesitant to authorise any more external operations even covertly while peace process crawled on during last months of 1976 two further unsuccessful rounds of negotiations took place between september and december first united states secretary of state henry kissinger thrashed out a deal which in september rhodesians accepted and nationalists rejected then from october to december 1976 government and nationalist parties took part in abortive british mediated geneva conference battle of hill 31 call sign 81a of k

valley about north of umtali and from mozambique border guerrillas were marching south in single file along a steep slope on western side of a rugged bush covered kopje which was tall and littered with gullies and other natural obstacles call sign 81a called up fireforce and 3 commando rli soon arrived commanded from k car by captain chris kip donald 3 commando men were dropped to west of area and four territorial force trackers headed by sergeant laurie ryan came down beside rr men and followed insurgents tracks to south along a footpath they found two cadres lying down in grass about away from path and shot and killed both as they continued around mountain ryan s men ran straight into main group of nationalists at about 05 45 a succession of frantic contacts followed at extremely close range as donald s rli sticks swept around and in towards area an armed insurgent was discovered in hiding by one of sticks and flushed out as he ran he pointed his ak 47 behind him and let off a burst of blind shots one of these hit and killed trooper francisco da costa of 11 troop 3 commando rli a 31 year old man from portugal who had recently volunteered because of unemployment in his home country his body was casevaced to ruda local special branch base as battle continued turning swiftly in security forces favour mg 151 20 20 mm cannon mounted on k car proved extremely effective binda says firing down on cadres to cut off escape routes and killing several of them as rhodesian soldiers advanced in from all directions support company of rhodesian african rifles rar was called as backup donald s stick leaders were all performing well with leader of stop 3 trooper pete garnett moving forward particularly aggressively rli rifleman grobler was lightly wounded and evacuated to ruda as were two privates of rar philip and saxon who were both hit by small arms fire from ground while still in helicopters cadres had taken up a defensive position near top of western side of mountain and were directing almost all of their rifle fire at aircraft an rpg was fired which narrowly missed a rhodesian g car carrying troops and exploded only behind it another helicopter was forced to land by damage caused by insurgent rifle fire rli and rar sticks who now had nationalist fighters surrounded continued to close in throughout day and by end of battle at 20 00 31 cadres had

killed donald was widely applauded for his conduct of rhodesian action with sergeant laurie graham telling rhodesia herald that it was a well commanded operation by captain donald at times exhilarating cocks agrees i remember how awed i was by kip donald s control of battle he writes he was controlling a good couple of hundred troops rli rar and tf all spread out over several square kilometres on all sides of mountain more cadres had been killed in battle than in any other internal contact up to that point but after hill 31 encounters such as this became more regular as war intensified and size of guerrilla incursions grew security forces would regularly engage groups of 50 insurgents or more inside rhodesia 1961 1972 history of rhodesian light infantry 1977 1980 notes
