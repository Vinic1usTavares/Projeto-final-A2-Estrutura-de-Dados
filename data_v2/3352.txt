movement fatah is also a word that was used in early islamic times to refer to conquest fatah dedicated itself to liberation of palestine by an armed struggle carried out by palestinians themselves this differed from other palestinian political and guerrilla organizations most of which firmly believed in a united arab response arafat s organization never embraced ideologies of major arab governments of time in contrast to other palestinian factions which often became satellites of nations such as egypt iraq saudi arabia syria and others in accordance with his ideology arafat generally refused to accept donations to his organization from major arab governments in order to act independently of them he did not want to alienate them and sought their undivided support by avoiding ideological alliances however to establish groundwork for fatah s future financial support he enlisted contributions from many wealthy palestinians working in kuwait and other arab states of persian gulf such as qatar where he met mahmoud abbas in 1961 these businessmen and oil workers contributed generously to fatah organization arafat continued this process in other arab countries such as libya and syria in 1962 arafat and his closest companions migrated to syria a country sharing a border with israel which had recently seceded from its union with egypt fatah had approximately three hundred members by this time but none were fighters in syria he managed to recruit members by offering them higher incomes to enable his armed attacks against israel fatah s manpower was incremented further

league in 1964 on 31 december a squad from al fatah s armed wing attempted to infiltrate israel but they were intercepted and detained by lebanese security forces several other raids with fatah s poorly trained and badly equipped fighters followed this incident some were successful others failed in their missions arafat often led these incursions personally arafat was detained in syria s mezzeh prison when a palestinian syrian army officer yusef urabi was killed urabi had been chairing a meeting to ease tensions between arafat and palestinian liberation front leader ahmed jibril but neither arafat nor jibril attended delegating representatives to attend on their behalf urabi was killed during or after meeting amid disputed circumstances on orders of defense minister hafez al assad a close friend of urabi arafat was subsequently arrested found guilty by a three man jury and sentenced to death however he and his colleagues were pardoned by president salah jadid shortly after verdict incident brought assad and arafat to unpleasant terms which would surface later when assad became president of syria leader of palestinians on 13 november 1966 israel launched a major raid against jordanian administered west bank town of as samu in response to a fatah implemented roadside bomb attack which had killed three members of israeli security forces near southern green line border in resulting skirmish scores of jordanian security forces were killed and 125 homes razed this raid was one of several factors that led to 1967 six day war six day war began when israel launched air strikes against egypt s air force on 5 june 1967 war ended in an arab defeat and israel s occupation of several arab territories including west bank and gaza strip although nasser and his arab allies had been defeated arafat and fatah could claim a victory in that majority of palestinians who had up to that time tended to align and sympathize with individual arab governments now began to agree that a palestinian solution to their dilemma was indispensable many primarily palestinian political parties including george habash s arab nationalist movement hajj amin al husseini s arab higher committee islamic liberation front and several syrian backed groups virtually crumbled after their sponsor governments defeat barely a week after defeat arafat crossed jordan river in disguise and entered west bank where he set up recruitment centers in hebron jerusalem area and nablus and began attracting both fighters and financiers for his cause at same time nasser contacted arafat through former s adviser mohammed and arafat was declared by nasser to be leader of palestinians in december 1967 ahmad resigned his post as plo chairman yahya hammuda took his place and invited arafat to join organization fatah was allocated 33 of 105 seats of plo executive committee while 57 seats were left for several other guerrilla factions battle of karameh throughout 1968 fatah and other palestinian armed groups were target of a major israeli army operation in jordanian village of karameh where fatah headquarters as well as a mid sized palestinian refugee camp were located town s name is arabic word for dignity which elevated its symbolism in eyes of arab people especially after collective arab defeat in 1967 operation was in response to attacks including rockets strikes from fatah and other palestinian militias within israeli occupied west bank according to said aburish government of jordan and a number of fatah commandos informed arafat that large scale israeli military preparations for an attack on town were underway prompting fedayeen groups such as george habash s newly formed popular front for liberation of palestine pflp and nayef hawatmeh s breakaway organization democratic front for liberation of palestine dflp to withdraw their forces from town though advised by a sympathetic jordanian army divisional commander to withdraw his men and headquarters to nearby hills arafat refused stating we want to convince world that there are those in arab world who will not withdraw or flee aburish writes that it was on arafat s orders that fatah remained and that jordanian army agreed to back them if heavy fighting ensued in response to persistent plo raids against israeli civilian targets israel attacked town of karameh jordan site of a major plo camp goal of invasion was to destroy karameh camp and capture yasser arafat in reprisal for attacks by plo against israeli civilians which culminated in an israeli school bus hitting a mine in negev killing two children however plans for two operations were prepared in 1967 one year before bus attack size of israeli forces entering karameh made jordanians assume that israel was also planning to occupy eastern bank of jordan river including balqa governorate to create a situation similar to golan heights which israel had captured just 10 months prior to be used a bargaining chip

environment profiles of arafat and fatah were raised by this important turning point and he came to be regarded as a national hero who dared to confront israel with mass applause from arab world financial donations increased significantly and fatah s weaponry and equipment improved group s numbers swelled as many young arabs including thousands of non palestinians joined ranks of fatah when palestinian national council pnc convened in cairo on 3 february 1969 yahya hammuda stepped down from his chairmanship of plo arafat was elected chairman on 4 february he became commander in chief of

and other palestinian militias began taking control of civil life in jordan they set up roadblocks publicly humiliated jordanian police forces molested women and levied illegal taxes all of which arafat either condoned or ignored king hussein considered this a growing threat to his kingdom s sovereignty and security and attempted to disarm militias however in order to avoid a military confrontation with opposition forces hussein dismissed several of his anti plo cabinet officials including some of his own family members and invited arafat to become deputy prime minister of jordan arafat refused citing his belief in need for a palestinian state with palestinian leadership despite hussein s intervention militant actions in jordan continued on 15 september 1970 pflp part of plo hijacked four planes and landed three of them at dawson s field located east of amman after foreign national hostages were taken off planes and moved away from them three of planes were blown up in

netanyahu s successor ehud barak at camp david 2000 summit in july 2000 due partly to his own politics barak was from leftist labor party whereas netanyahu was from rightist likud party and partly due

right thumbtime 0 09 footage of arafat speaking and meeting international leaders arafat s long personal and political survival was taken by most western commentators as a sign of his mastery of asymmetric warfare and his skill as a tactician given extremely dangerous nature of politics of middle east and frequency of assassinations some commentators believe his survival was largely due to israel s fear that he could become a martyr for palestinian cause if he were assassinated or even arrested by israel others believe that israel refrained from taking action against arafat because it feared arafat less than hamas and other islamist movements gaining support over fatah complex and fragile web of relations between us israel saudi arabia and other arab states contributed also to arafat s longevity as leader of palestinians israel attempted to assassinate arafat on a number of occasions but has never used its own agents preferring instead to turn palestinians close to intended target usually using blackmail according to alan hart mossad s specialty is poison according to abu iyad two attempts were made on arafat s life by israeli mossad and military directorate in 1970 in 1976 abu sa ed a palestinian agent working for mossad was enlisted in a plot to put poison pellets that looked like grains of rice in arafat s food abu iyad explains that abu sa ed confessed after he received order to go ahead explaining that he was unable to go through with plot because he was first of all a palestinian and his conscience wouldn t let him do it arafat claimed in a 1988 interview with time that because of his fear of assassination by israelis he never slept in same place two nights in a row relations with hamas and other militant groups arafat s ability to adapt to new tactical and political situations was perhaps tested by rise of hamas and pij organizations islamist groups espousing rejectionist policies with israel these groups often bombed non military targets
