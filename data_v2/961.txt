bay area rapid transit bart is a rapid transit public transportation system serving san francisco bay area in california heavy rail elevated and subway system connects san francisco and oakland with urban and suburban areas in alameda contra costa and san mateo counties bart serves 48 stations along six routes on of rapid transit lines including a spur line in eastern contra costa county which utilizes diesel multiple unit trains and a automated guideway transit line to oakland international airport with an average of 411 000 weekday passengers and 118 million annual passengers in fiscal year 2019 bart is fifth busiest heavy rail rapid transit system in united states bart is operated by bay area rapid transit district formed in 1957 initial system opened in stages from 1972 to 1974 silicon valley bart extension is scheduled to open in milpitas and berryessa san jose in 2020 in partnership with santa clara valley transportation authority vta history origins planning and geographical coverage some of bay area rapid transit system s current coverage area was once served by an electrified streetcar and suburban train system called key system this early 20th century system once had regular transbay traffic across lower deck of bay bridge but system was dismantled in 1950s with its last transbay crossing in 1958 and was superseded by highway travel a 1950s study of traffic problems in bay area concluded most cost effective solution for bay area s traffic woes would be to form a transit district charged with construction and operation of a new high speed rapid transit system linking cities and suburbs marvin e lewis a san francisco trial attorney and member of city s board of supervisors spearheaded a grassroots movement to advance idea of an alternative bay crossing and possibility of regional transit network formal planning for bart began with setting up in 1957 of bay area rapid transit district a county based special purpose district body that governs bart system district initially began with five members all of which were projected to receive bart lines alameda county contra costa county city and county of san francisco san mateo county and marin county although invited to participate santa clara county supervisors elected not to join bart due to their dissatisfaction that peninsula line only stopped at palo alto initially and that it interfered with suburban development in san jose preferring instead to concentrate on constructing freeways and expressways though system will expand into santa clara county in 2019 it is still not a district member in 1962 san mateo county supervisors voted to leave bart saying their voters would be paying taxes to carry mainly santa clara county residents district wide tax base was weakened by san mateo s departure forcing marin county to withdraw a month later despite fact that marin had originally voted in favor of bart participation at 88 level its marginal tax base could not adequately absorb its share of bart s projected cost another important factor in marin s withdrawal was an engineering controversy over feasibility of running trains on lower deck of golden gate bridge an extension forecast as late as three decades after rest of bart system see bart composite report prepared by parsons tutor bechtel 1962 withdrawals of marin and san mateo resulted in a downsizing of original system plans which would have had lines as far south as palo alto and northward past san rafael voters in three remaining participating counties approved truncated system with termini in fremont richmond concord and daly city in 1962 construction of system began in 1964 and included a number of major engineering challenges including excavating subway tunnels in san francisco oakland and berkeley constructing aerial structures throughout bay area particularly in alameda and contra costa counties tunneling through berkeley hills on concord line and lowering system s centerpiece transbay tube connecting oakland and san francisco into a trench dredged onto floor of san francisco bay early years and train control problems passenger service began on september 11 1972 initially just between macarthur and fremont rest of system opened in stages with entire system opening in 1974 when transbay service through transbay tube began new bart system was hailed as a major step forward in subway technology although questions were asked concerning safety of system and huge expenditures necessary for construction of network ridership remained well below projected levels throughout 1970s and direct service from daly city to richmond and fremont was not phased in until several years after system opened some of early safety concerns appeared to be well founded when system experienced a number of train control failures in its first few years of operation as early as 1969 before revenue service began several bart engineers identified safety problems with automatic train control atc system bart board of directors was dismissive of their concerns and retaliated by firing them less than a month after system s opening on october 2 1972 an atc failure caused a train to run off end of elevated track at terminal fremont station and crash to ground injuring four people fremont flyer led to a comprehensive redesign of train controls and also resulted in multiple investigations being opened by california state senate california public utilities commission and national transportation safety board hearings by state legislature in 1974 into financial mismanagement at bart forced general manager to resign in may 1974 and entire board of directors was replaced same year when legislature passed legislation leading to election of a new board and end of appointed members extensions even before bart system opened planners projected several possible extensions although marin county was left out of original system 1970 golden gate transportation facilities plan considered a tunnel under golden gate or second deck on bridge but neither of these plans was pursued over twenty years would pass before first extensions to bart system were completed to colma and pittsburg bay point in 1996 an extension to dublin pleasanton in 1997 added a fifth line to system for first time in bart s history system was expanded to san francisco international airport in 2003 and to oakland international airport via an automated guideway transit spur line in 2014 construction of ebart an extension using diesel multiple units along conventional railroad infrastructure between pittsburg and antioch opened on may 26 2018 bart s most significant current extension will take system to silicon valley first phase extended fremont line to warm springs south fremont in early 2017 and construction is underway on line to milpitas and berryessa further expansion has been proposed contingent upon allocation of funding this includes second phase of silicon valley extension which would bring system to downtown san jose and santa clara plans have long been floated for an extension from dublin to livermore but most recent proposal was rejected by bart board in 2018 other plans have included an extension to hercules a line along interstate highway 680 corridor and a fourth set of rail tracks through oakland at least four infill stations such as irvington and calaveras on existing lines have been proposed with transbay tube nearing capacity long range plans included a new four bore transbay tube beneath san francisco bay that would run parallel and south of existing tunnel and emerge at transbay transit terminal to connect to caltrain and future california high speed rail system four bore tunnel would provide two tunnels for bart and two tunnels for conventional high speed rail bart system and conventional u s rail use different and incompatible rail gauges and different loading gauges in 2018 bart announced that a feasibility study for installing a second transbay crossing would commence following year by 2019 capitol corridor joint powers authority had joined with bart to study a multi modal crossing which could also allow capitol corridor and san joaquin routes to serve san francisco directly bart has also been studying ways to improve service and reliability in its core system where density and ridership is highest recent exploratory ideas have included a line that would continue from transbay terminal through soma district northwards on van ness and terminating in western san francisco along geary corridor presidio or north beach system modernization since mid 1990s bart has been trying to modernize its system fleet rehabilitation is part of this modernization in 2009 fire alarms fire sprinklers yellow tactile platform edge domes and cemented mat rubber tiles were installed rough black tiles on platform edge mark location of doorway of approaching trains allowing passengers to wait at right place to board all faregates and ticket vending machines were replaced in 2007 bart stated its intention to improve non peak night and weekend headways for each line to 15 minutes current 20 minute headways at these times is a barrier to ridership in mid 2007 bart temporarily reversed its position stating that shortened wait times would likely not happen due to a 900 000 state revenue budget shortfall nevertheless bart eventually confirmed implementation of plan by january 2008 continued budgetary problems halted expanded non peak service and returned off peak headways to 20 minutes in 2009 in 2008 bart announced that it would install solar panels at two yards and maintenance facilities and orinda goes solar at orinda station by dennis cuff contra costa times july 10 2008 access date july 13 2008 only station with enough sun to justify installation cost in 2012 california transportation commission announced they would provide funding for expanding bart facilities

credit cards for payment for clipper cards only http www com bart add fare machines inside fare zones will finally start accepting credit cards earthquake safety during 1989 loma prieta earthquake bart equipment was mostly undamaged a 2010 study shows that along with some bay area freeways some of bart s overhead structures could collapse in a major earthquake which has a significant probability of occurring within three decades seismic retrofitting has been carried out in recent years to address these deficiencies especially in transbay tube infrastructure entirety of system runs in exclusive right of way bart s rapid transit revenue routes cover about with 48 stations on main lines approximately of lines run through underground sections with 32 miles on elevated tracks main system uses an unusual broad gauge mostly seen in india and pakistan and mostly track originally utilizing flat edge rail and wheelsets with cylindrical treads bart is now switching to conical tread to reduce noise caused by flange rail contact and loss of adhesion of one of wheels on curves dc electric current at 1 000 volts is delivered to trains over a third rail an automated guideway transit line and an additional station were opened in 2014 and utilize off shelf cable car technology developed by dcc doppelmayr cable car cable liner section of antioch sfo millbrae line east of pittsburg bay point station runs on conventional unelectrified rail schedules call for trains to operate at up to but certain segments in particular transbay tube are designed for operation when making up delays rapid transit trains have 4 10 cars maximum length of being longest of any metro system in united states and extending slightly beyond platforms cars are wide maximum gradient is four percent and minimum curve radius is left thumb location of third rail changes at station on left side of track in distance is emergency walkway third rail is across track from this walkway train frequencies are primarily limited by fact that most lines funnel into transbay tube and san francisco while small sections of track in oakland colma and daly city are triple and quadruple tracked there are few sidings which would allow limited stop or express trains to pass others many of original 1970s era stations especially aerial stations feature simple brutalist architecture but newer stations are a mix of and postmodern architecture additional double tracked four mile long upper deck of market street subway and its four underground stations were built by bart for s f municipal railway combination of unique loading gauges and unusual rail technologies has complicated maintenance and increased cost of system as rolling stock requires custom wheelsets brake systems and power systems lines and services bart operates six named and interlined heavy rail services plus one separate automated guideway line five of heavy rail services run through oakland and all of those but richmond warm springs south fremont line and sfo millbrae shuttle go through transbay tube to san francisco all six services run on weekdays until end of afternoon rush hour evenings after about 7 00 pm nights after about 9 00 pm and sundays have as few as three services operating three of services change terminals at certain times so that all stations are served during all service hours unlike most other rapid transit and rail systems around world bart lines are not primarily referred to by shorthand designations or their color names although colors used on maps have been constant since 1980 services are mainly identified on maps schedules and station signage by names of their termini however new fleet displays line colors more prominently and bart has begun to use color names in press releases

with older types are in process of manufacturing delivery and commissioning and are due to replace all older types by 2022 while simultaneously expanding fleet for future extensions they will all feature three sets of passenger doors on each side of car to speed up passenger boarding to run a typical peak morning commute bart requires 579 cars of those 535 are scheduled to be in active service others are used to build up four spare trains essential for maintaining on time service at any one time remaining 90 cars are in for repair maintenance or some type of planned modification work

bay local route was eliminated on june 17 2019 fares thumb right upright ticket vending machines at powell street station fares on bart are comparable to those of commuter rail systems and are higher than those of most subways especially for long trips fare is based on a formula that takes into account both length and speed of trip a surcharge is added for trips traveling through transbay tube to oakland international airport to san francisco international airport and or through san mateo county a county that is not a member of san francisco bay area rapid transit district passengers can use refillable paper plastic composite tickets on which fares are stored via a magnetic strip to enter and exit system exit faregate prints remaining balance on ticket each time passenger exits station a paper ticket can be refilled at a ticket machine remaining balance on any ticket can be applied towards purchase of a new one or a card is captured by exit gate when balance reaches zero multiple low value cards can be combined to create a larger value card but only at specific ticket exchange locations at some bart stations magnetic strip based technology was developed by cubic transportation systems with a contract awarded in 1974 bart relies on unused ticket values on discarded low value cards for additional revenue as much as 9 9 million paper ticket technology is identical to washington metro s former paper fare card though bart system does not charge higher fares during rush hour clipper a contactless smart card accepted on all major bay area public transit agencies may be used in lieu of a paper ticket thumb left upright a standard fare bart ticket initial purchased fare is printed parallel to magnetic strip and card s remaining balance is printed on left updated upon each exit minimum fare is 2 00 except san mateo county trips under maximum one way fare including all possible surcharges is 16 15 journey between san francisco international airport and oakland international airport farthest possible trip from antioch to millbrae costs less because of 4 additional charge added to sfo trips and 6 additional charge added to oak trips entering and exiting same station within three hours accrues an excursion fare of 5 75 passengers without sufficient fare to complete their journey must use a cash only machine to pay remaining balance in order to exit station special color coded tickets provide steep discounts for children disabled seniors and students bart plus a special high value ticket with flash pass privileges with some regional transit agencies is being phased out in favor of clipper system unlike many other rapid transit systems bart does not have an unlimited ride pass and only discount provided to public is a 6 25 discount when high value tickets are purchased with fare values of 48 and 64 for prices of 45 and 60 respectively amtrak s capitol corridor and san trains sell 10 bart tickets on board in cafe cars for only 8 resulting in a 20 discount a 62 5 discount is provided to seniors disabled and children age 6 to 12 middle and high school students 13 to 19 may obtain a 50 discount if their school participates in bart program these tickets are intended to be used only between students home station and school s station and for transportation to and from school events tickets can be used only on weekdays these school tickets and bart plus tickets have a last ride bonus where if remaining value is greater than 0 05 ticket can be used one last time for a trip of any distance most special discounted tickets must be purchased at selected vendors and not at ticket machines bart plus tickets can be purchased at ticket machines san francisco muni a monthly pass provides unlimited rides within san francisco with no fare credit applied for trips outside of city san francisco pays 1 02 for each trip taken under this arrangement thumb faregates with orange barrier wings retracted for a spare air day fares are enforced by station agent who monitors activity at fare gates adjacent to window and at other fare gates through closed circuit television and faregate status screens located in agent s booth all stations are staffed with at least one agent at all times proposals to simplify fare structure abound a flat fare that disregards distance has been proposed or simpler fare bands or zones either scheme would shift fare box recovery burden to urban riders in san francisco oakland and berkeley and away from suburban riders in east contra costa southern alameda and san mateo counties where density is lowest and consequently operational cost is highest in 2019 it was announced that paper tickets would be discontinued in favor of clipper card only payment by end of year bart plans to stop selling paper tickets

and dropping slightly during recessions a major exception occurred in 1989 in aftermath of loma prieta earthquake which severely damaged san francisco oakland bay bridge causing its closure for a month bart became only direct route between east bay and san francisco resulting in a nearly 17 ridership jump for 1990 fiscal year ridership did not drop back to previous levels after repair of bridge suggesting that many commuters chose to stick with bart between 2010 and 2015 bart ridership grew rapidly mirroring strong economic growth in bay area in 2015 system was carrying approximately 100 000 more passengers each day than it had five years earlier high gasoline prices also contributed to growth pushing ridership to record levels during 2012 with system recording five record ridership days in september and october 2012 after six straight years of expansion ridership growth began to slow in late 2016 dropping by 1 7 in october 2016 from prior year although fiscal year ending june 30 2017 showed an average weekday ridership of 423 395 second highest in bart s history this was a 2 3 drop from fy 2016 ridership continued to decline by approximately 3 per year between 2016 and 2019 mirroring a nationwide decline in mass transit ridership in second half of decade some see this decline as linked to changes in commute patterns fall in gasoline prices since 2014 and competition from private sector in form of ride sharing services such as uber and lyft ride sharing has especially affected ridership on lines to san francisco international airport and oakland international airport at sfo ride sharing services grew by a factor of almost six or nearly 500 at airport between 2014 and 2016 bart planners believe that competition from uber and lyft is reducing overall ridership growth and bart s share of airport transit stations in urban cores of san francisco oakland and berkeley have highest ridership while suburban stations record lower rider numbers during fiscal year 2017 busiest station was embarcadero with 48 526 average weekday exits followed by montgomery street with 45 386 busiest station outside of san francisco was 12th street oakland city center with 13 965 riders followed by 19th street oakland with 13 456 least busy station was oakland international airport with 1 517 riders while least busy standard bart station was north

commute hours each individual line operates at 15 minute intervals on weekdays and 20 minute intervals on weekends bart could be characterized as a commuter subway since it has many characteristics of
