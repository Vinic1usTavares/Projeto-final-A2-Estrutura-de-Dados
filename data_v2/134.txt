modern transmission tower on exterior walls of substation house ned khan s consisting of a strip of colored lights that change based on wind flows earlier design concepts featured a more standard

as part of their six year strategic plan specifications denny substation will have an initial capacity of 50 megavolt ampere mva and could increase to 405 mva with facilities expansions an underground distribution network scheduled to be completed in 2020 will direct electricity from substation to denny triangle and south lake union neighborhoods substation will be connected to massachusetts substation in sodo via a 115 kv transmission line through downtown seattle use of a gas insulated switchgear in denny substation will allow for a smaller footprint facility will also use solar cells to produce its electricity and a heat recovery system outside consultants hired by city government in 2018 later concluded that overall demand in denny triangle and south lake union area would rise to
