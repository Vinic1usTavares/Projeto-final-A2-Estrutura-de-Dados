tropical depression two was a short lived tropical cyclone that impacted portions of texas and mexico during highly active 2010 atlantic hurricane season it formed from a tropical wave that emerged off western coast of africa and crossed atlantic ocean without any development upon entering western gulf of mexico depression encountered a conducive environment for tropical cyclone development and was designated tropical depression two at 0600 utc on july 8 intensification into a tropical storm was initially anticipated by national hurricane center nhc but due to its proximity to land depression failed to attain status it made landfall on south padre island texas before degenerating into a remnant low on july 9 and dissipating following day due to system s weak intensity there were no reports of damage inflicted by winds across texas or mexico although cyclone did bring minimal rainfall totals to northern mexico an area severely affected by hurricane alex just one week previous meteorological history origins of tropical depression two can be traced back to a disorganized tropical wave that was first noted by nhc on june 24 as it moved off western coast of africa and into atlantic ocean moving towards west wave showed no signs of organization until july 3 as it entered western caribbean sea during 24 hours that followed it continued to coalesce and nhc subsequently increased disturbance s chance of developing into a tropical cyclone a defined surface circulation did not form as a result of wave s movement over yucatan peninsula and system lost organization system remained disorganized as it traversed peninsula and eventually emerged into gulf of mexico on july 7 situated over water once more wave was able to gradually develop as it moved in a northwesterly direction following a reconnaissance mission nhc noted in their tropical weather outlook that there was a high chance of system developing into a tropical cyclone within next 48 hours early on july 8 additional data from hurricane hunters indicated that system developed a closed circulation and nhc classified it as a tropical depression at 0000 utc making it second of hurricane season at this time system was situated roughly southeast of brownsville texas at this time depression also attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 35 mph 55 km h and a minimum barometric pressure of 1005 mbar hpa 29 68 inhg tropical depression two was anticipated to intensify into a tropical storm before making landfall in mexico however depression failed to gain strength before moving inland following a reconnaissance mission at 1200 utc hurricane hunters found winds near tropical storm intensity however land based observations did not support this and depression was not classified as a tropical storm later that day depression made landfall in south padre island texas at 1515 utc with winds of 35 mph 55 km h tropical depression weakened slightly while moving near texas mexico border when nhc discontinued advisories on system although nhc ceased monitoring tropical depression two hydrometeorological prediction center hpc issued advisories until it dissipated early on july 10 over northern mexico preparations and impact thumb right 250px rainfall from depression in mexico and united states immediately after tropical depression two was classified a tropical storm warning was issued for state of texas covering coastline from baffin bay to northern mouth of rio grande in addition a tropical storm warning was also issued by government of mexico stretching from rio san fernando northward also to mouth of rio grande subsequent coastal flooding and flash flood warnings were issued by local national weather service offices in southern and eastern texas as nhc predicted of rain with locally alerts were also issued for mexican states of tamaulipas nuevo leon and coahuila where officials warned people of potential for heavy rains flooding and landslides sistema nacional de proteccion civil national civil protection system raised a red alert highest level on scale for portions of tamaulipas and noted that extreme caution was necessary in areas between rio san fernando and texas mexico border after tropical depression two made landfall in texas all of tropical storm warnings associated with storm were discontinued upon making landfall along texas mexico border depression produced a storm surge between portions of mustang and padre island were flooded by storm however damage was minimal two funnel clouds were reported in relation to depression one near rockport and other near victoria after nhc issued their final advisory on tropical depression two hpc began to monitor system recording minimal rainfall across southern and eastern texas as tropical depression two dissipated it moved inland and hpc s advisories indicated that much of eastern and southern texas experienced rainfall of at least with exception of corpus christi and laredo rainfall associated with tropical depression two in texas peaked at along guadalupe river adjacent to city of victoria rainfall inside city of victoria itself was measured at while victoria regional airport reported precipitation at victoria regional airport tropical depression two contributed to localized flooding in southern texas and northeastern mexico adding to of rain caused by hurricane alex just south of rio grande throughout tamaulipas mexico relatively little rain fell in relation to depression matamoros recorded rainfall for roughly two hours before system passed through region resulting floods from alex and depression caused nearly 80 million in losses throughout region see also 2010 atlantic hurricane season timeline of 2010 atlantic hurricane season hurricane alex 2010
