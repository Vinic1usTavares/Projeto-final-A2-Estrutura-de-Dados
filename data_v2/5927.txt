caprella mutica commonly known as japanese skeleton shrimp is a species of skeleton shrimp they are relatively large caprellids reaching a maximum length of they are sexually dimorphic with males usually being much larger than females they are characterized by their hairy first and second thoracic segments and rows of spines on their bodies body color ranges from green to red to blue depending on environment they are omnivorous highly adaptable opportunistic feeders in turn they provide a valuable food source for fish crabs and other larger predators they are usually found in dense colonies attached to submerged man made structures floating seaweed and other organisms c mutica are native to shallow protected bodies of water in sea of japan in as little as 40 years they have become an invasive species in north atlantic north pacific and along coasts of new zealand they are believed to have been accidentally introduced to these areas through global maritime traffic and aquaculture outside of their native range c mutica are often exclusively synanthropic being found in large numbers in and around areas of human activity their ecological and economic impact as an invasive species is unknown but they pose a serious threat to native populations of skeleton shrimp in affected areas description like all caprellid amphipods caprella mutica are characterized by slender bodies and elongated appendages their skeletal appearance gives rise to common names of skeleton shrimp or ghost shrimp and coupled with their distinctive upright feeding posture give them a striking resemblance to stick insects and starved praying mantises c mutica vary in coloration from translucent pale green brown cream orange deep red purple and even turquoise depending on substrate they are found in brood pouches of females are speckled with red spots a relatively large amphipod c mutica are sexually dimorphic with males considerably larger than females males average at a length of though specimens have been recorded to reach in length females on other hand average at only long body can be divided into three parts cephalon head pereon thorax and abdomen pereon comprises most of length of body it is divided into seven segments known as pereonites rounded and smooth cephalon is fused to first pereonite while highly reduced and almost invisible abdomen is attached to posterior of seventh pereonite in males first two pereonites are elongated with second pereonite being longest of all pereonites they are densely covered with long setae bristles giving them a hairy appearance second pereonite also has two to three pairs of spines on back with an additional two pairs at sides near base of limbs remaining pereonites third to seventh lack dense setae of first two pereonites third pereonite has seven pairs of spines at back while fourth pereonite has eight pairs both have three to seven pairs of spines near base of gills fifth pereonite has five pairs of back spines and a pair of spines at sides sixth and seventh pereonites each have two pairs of back spines situated at their centers and near posterior females differ from males in having much shorter pereonites which lack dense covering of setae cephalon and first pereonite also possess a single pair of spines each though they can sometimes be absent thumb left 300px morphology of caprella mutica male like other crustaceans c mutica possess two pairs of antennae with first outer pair more than half total length of body segments of peduncles base are three times as long as flagellae whips at ends of antennae flagellae have 22 segments each second inner pair of antennae are less than half length of first they possess two rows of long setae on ventral surfaces of segments of their peduncles mandibles and maxillae are present at anterior ventral surface of cephalon maxillipeds a modified pair of appendages also serve as accessory mouthparts appendages that arise from pereonites are known as pereopods first two pairs of pereopods are highly modified raptorial grasping appendages known as gnathopods they somewhat resemble arms of praying mantises segments of gnathopods can be divided into two parts which fold into each other propodus plural propodi forelimb and tipmost segment known as dactylus plural dactyli finger first pair of gnathopods are considerably smaller than second pair and arise close to maxillipeds inside margins of propodi possess two spines both propodi and dactyli have serrated inner edges second pair of gnathopods are very large with two large spines on middle and upper edges of inside margin of palm of propodi upper spine is known as poison spine or poison tooth and may be of same size or much larger than lower spine closing spine despite name it remains unclear if poison spine is indeed venomous though they are perfectly capable of inflicting potentially lethal injuries on small organisms recent studies have associated spines with pores that lead to possible toxin producing glands their dactyli are powerful and curved into a scimitar like shape second pair of gnathopods are densely covered in hair like setae while first pair only has setae on posterior margins third and fourth pereopods are absent in their place are two pairs of elongated oval gills arising from third and fourth pereonites respectively in mature females two brood pouches also develop in third and fourth pereonites these are formed by oostegites expansions from basal segments coxae of appendages fifth to seventh pereopods function as clasping appendages they all have propodi with two spines on their inside margins seventh pair of pereopods are longest of three pairs followed by sixth pereopod pair and fifth pereopod pair c mutica closely resemble caprella acanthogaster also a native of east asian waters it may be difficult to distinguish two species particularly since caprella mutica can exhibit considerable morphological variations among males c mutica can only be reliably differentiated by their first and second pereonites smooth in c acanthogaster as well as elongated oval shape of their gills linear in c acanthogaster taxonomy and nomenclature caprella mutica were first described in 1935 by a schurin from specimens collected from peter great gulf in sea of japan it belongs to genus caprella in subfamily of family a group of highly specialized amphipods commonly known as skeleton shrimp caprellids are classified under superfamily of infraorder c mutica are known as spine waist skeleton shrimp in japanese in netherlands and belgium where first invasive populations of c mutica in europe were discovered they are known as in flemish literally macho ghost shrimp name is derived from junior synonym invalid name caprella macho applied in 1995 to species by dirk platvoet et al who initially believed they were a different species macho is a humorous reference to characteristic hairy chests of males of c mutica caprella acanthogaster humboldtiensis another invalid name of species was first applied to misidentified specimens of c mutica recovered from humboldt bay california by donald m martin in 1977 some specimens collected from firth of clyde scotland in 1999 were also initially misidentified as caprella tuberculata but have since been determined to be introduced c mutica ecology and biology caprella mutica inhabit shallow protected marine bodies of water they can often be found in dense colonies attached to submerged artificial structures marine macroalgae and other organisms they are primarily omnivorous detritivores but can adapt to other feeding methods depending on food availability they are preyed upon by fish crabs and several other predators c mutica are generally found in temperate and subarctic regions they can not tolerate water temperatures higher than they also die within five minutes if exposed to water temperatures of on lower end they can survive temperatures lower than but are rendered immobile if not altogether in a state of suspended animation salinity tolerance of c mutica does not go below 15 psu and they are unable to survive in freshwater habitats however in their native habitats it has been observed that they can survive salinities as low as 11 psu they are also sensitive to exposure to air and will die within an hour if taken out of water c mutica reproduce all throughout year with peak seasons in summer months males are highly aggressive and exhibit sexual competition over smaller females eggs which average at 40 per female ito a aoki mn

freie universitat berlin breton g m are incubated for about 5 days at in female s brood pouch upon hatching they reach sexual maturity in about 21 to 46 days their average lifespan in laboratory conditions is 68 8 days for males and 82 days for females habitat in their native habitat caprella mutica are found in or neritic and littoral zones of sheltered bodies of water to a depth of about they may spend their entire lives clinging to a substrate in an upright position these substrates are typically floating with filamentous leafy branching or turf like structures of same color as their body for camouflage as well as transportation c mutica are poor swimmers and move around predominantly in an undulating inchworm like fashion using their posterior pereopods and gnathopods they are generally reluctant to let go of their substrates and will only do so if agitated different populations in different substrates are known to exhibit different exoskeletal coloration suggesting that they can change color to blend in with their environments exact mechanisms for this color change however remains unknown substrates they are most commonly found on in their native habitats include beds and floating clumps of macroalgae like sargassum muticum sargassum sargassum pallidum crassipes japonica spp and viridis as well as in marine plants like eelgrass of genus zostera hydrozoans and bryozoans in their introduced ranges they also tend to seek out organisms that exhibit structures their slender bodies can easily blend with these include macroalgae like ulva lactuca spp spp spp chorda fucus vesiculosus spp and introduced sargassum muticum hydrozoans like spp and bryozoans tube building amphipods like and marmorata and even soft bodied tunicates like aspersa and intestinalis in both their native and introduced ranges c mutica are also synanthropic being found abundantly in fouling communities in artificial structures like submerged ropes fishing nets pilings docks buoys aquaculture equipment oil rig platforms ship hulls and even offshore wind farms in their introduced ranges particularly in europe they are primarily and even exclusively found inhabiting artificial structures c mutica can reach extremely high densities in their introduced range when colonizing artificial structures a survey of c mutica populations in chaleur bay quebec revealed concentrations of 468 800 individuals per while a survey in dunstaffnage bay firth of lorn scotland reported 319 000 individuals per in contrast c mutica in their native habitats reach maximum densities of only around 1 220 to 2 600 individuals per populations reach peak numbers during late summer august to september before experiencing a sharp decline in winter months diet and predators caprella mutica are omnivorous highly adaptable opportunistic feeders examinations of their stomach contents reveal a highly varied diet that depended on particular substrate they are found on they are predominantly detritivores but have remarkable ability of adjusting feeding methods from being grazers scavengers filter feeders and even predators depending on conditions of their environments c mutica sieve food particles or small organisms from water by waving their bodies back and forth with comb like setae on their second pair of antennae extended they then clean off trapped particles by bending their antennae down to their mouthparts they also use their antennae to scrape food particles from surfaces of their bodies or substrate that they are clinging to large gnathopods are used for striking at and grasping both mobile and sessile prey known prey organisms of c mutica include algae both planktonic and macroalgae dinoflagellates hydrozoans bryozoans diatoms copepods brine shrimps and other amphipods they are capable of feeding on suspended organic particles including fish feed and decaying organic matter c mutica are also known to engage in cannibalistic behavior on dead and dying individuals of their own species or genus like other caprellids c mutica are preyed upon predominantly by fish and crabs in their native habitats predators of caprella mutica include shore crab carcinus maenas and wrasse rupestris which consume them in large numbers other predators include nudibranchs starfish nemertean worms sea anemones and hydrozoans they constitute a valuable food source for these organisms due to their high levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids and carotenoids they also provide an important link in food chain between plankton and larger fish this in addition to their relative abundance and fast growth rates make them a potentially important resource for marine fish feed in aquaculture introduced populations of c mutica have become a major part of diets of native wild and farmed fish reproduction and life history wild populations of caprella mutica show a higher number of females than males this may be related to fact that females are aggressively defended by males from competing males resulting in high male mortality larger sizes and greater visibility of males also make them more vulnerable targets for predators that rely on eyesight like fish c mutica are r strategists they reproduce all throughout year with peak seasons in summer march to july thumb left gnathopods of caprella mutica males are used in aggressive boxing matches that can often be lethal males exhibit sexual competition and courting behavior they aggressively engage in boxing matches using their large second pair of gnathopods in presence of receptive females these encounters often have lethal results as gnathopods and their poison teeth can be used to impale or slice an opponent in half males will also repeatedly touch exoskeletons of females with their antennae to detect signs of moulting ecdysis like all crustaceans females are only capable of mating shortly after shedding their old hardened exoskeletons amplexus lasts for 10 to 15 minutes once mated males will defend females for a short period around 15 minutes after this period females begin to exhibit aggressive behavior and will drive off males they will then bend their fourth and fifth pereonites at a 90 degree angle once their genital openings located on fifth pereonite are aligned with opening of brood pouches they quickly deposit fertilized eggs into them females carrying fertilized eggs remain highly aggressive towards males throughout brooding period indicating maternal behavior intended to protect developing embryo from male aggression a brood pouch of a female can contain 3 to 363 eggs averaging at 74 eggs larger females tend to produce more eggs eggs are incubated inside brood pouch for 30 to 40 days before hatching like all amphipods caprellids lack a planktonic larval stage and hatchlings resemble miniature adults juveniles may cling to their mothers upon hatching and females continue to protect their offspring that remain close hatchlings measure around and grow to an average of per instar c mutica mature rapidly moulting at an average of once each week until they enter premature stage becoming sexually differentiated at fifth instar durations between moulting cycles then become longer in their seventh to ninth instars averaging at once every two weeks until sexual maturity this can occur in as early as 21 days and not later than 46 days after hatching depending on environmental conditions in wild populations however this can take as much as six months when juveniles are hatched in late summer males begin to increase in size at a faster rate with each successive moult after seventh instar females on other hand produce their first brood at seventh instar they may moult several times as adults becoming sexually receptive each time until death average lifespan of c mutica in laboratory conditions is 68 8 days for males and 82 days for females distribution and invasive ecology thumb 350px global distribution of caprella mutica location and date of first records in each area are also shown along with likely introduction pathways indicated by arrows caprella mutica are native to subarctic regions of sea of japan in northwestern asia they were first discovered in peter great gulf in federal subject of russia primorsky krai they were redescribed by japanese marine biologist arimoto in 1976 who noted that they were also present in island of hokkaido and surrounding regions in a span of only 40 years they have spread into other parts of world through multiple accidental introductions both primary and stepping stone secondary introductions from hulls or ballast water of international maritime traffic aquaculture equipment and shipments of pacific oyster crassostrea gigas genetic studies of mitochondrial dna mtdna of populations of c mutica reveal high genetic diversity in sea of japan region unequivocally identifying it as their native range in contrast non native populations in north america europe and new zealand had poor variation detection of genetic material present in non native populations however also make it probable that there are unknown regions that c mutica may also be native to though it might also be simply that sample groups used in studies were too small comparisons of mtdna of different populations make it possible to trace possible routes of introduction most likely of which is that original non native introduction was to west coast of north america which exhibit highest genetic diversity in non native populations multiple later introductions happened in europe and eastern north america from here additional populations were transported to nearby ports europe and eastern north america are also possible sources for new zealand c mutica population north america first specimens of c mutica outside of its native range was recovered from humboldt bay california by donald m martin in 1973 martin misidentified them as a subspecies of c acanthogaster he named them caprella acanthogaster humboldtiensis additional specimens also treated as c acanthogaster or c acanthogaster humboldtiensis were recovered between 1976 and 1978 from oakland estuary elkhorn slough and san francisco bay it wasn t until 1981 when specimens were correctly identified as c mutica by dan c marelli along with additional specimens discovered in 1983 in coos bay oregon these populations are believed to have been introduced to area as a result of importation of oyster spat of pacific oyster crassostrea gigas from japan for oyster farming oysters are usually transported with algae as a packing material particularly sargassum muticum in which c mutica are associated with populations of c mutica discovered in puget sound washington in 1970s as well as additional populations noted in states of oregon and california of united states in 2000s are believed to have been result of shipping activities and intracoastal secondary spreading of original populations c mutica were also discovered in ketchikan sitka juneau cordova kodiak bay prince william sound and unalaska in alaska between 2000 and 2003 this was first instance of a non native marine species being found in aleutian islands in 2009 they were discovered to have spread into british columbia canada this indicates that c mutica have completely expanded up entire west coast of north america in 2003 surveys by massachusetts institute of technology mit sea grant along atlantic coast of united states revealed multiple established populations in seaports along coastlines of connecticut to maine in same year c mutica were also reported in passamaquoddy bay and chaleur bay of new brunswick and quebec canada europe c mutica populations in europe were first found in netherlands in 1995 during a species inventory several specimens of an unknown caprellid were recovered by platvoet et al from artificial structures in and around jans and eastern scheldt storm surge barrier in zeeland as with case of first discovery of c mutica in north america platvoet et al initially misidentified them as a new species remarking upon resemblance of caprellids to c acanthogaster they named it caprella macho they were later discovered to be introduced populations of c mutica rather than a new species since then additional populations have been detected in belgium 1998 norway 1999 germany 2000 scotland 2000 england 2003 wales 2003 ireland 2003 france 2004 and denmark 2005 they exist in extremely dense populations and are all associated with areas of high human activity they are believed to have been introduced through shipping and aquaculture equipment from united states and asia as of 2011 there have been no recorded sightings of c mutica around iberian peninsula baltic sea or mediterranean sea new zealand caprella mutica were first detected in new zealand in port of timaru south island in 2002 this was first incident of c mutica being reported in southern hemisphere since then more well established populations of c mutica have been found in port lyttelton in 2006 and in marlborough sounds and wellington harbour in 2007 additional specimens were also recovered from hulls of vessels in other ports though they did not seem to have established colonies in ports themselves genetic studies of new zealand populations suggests a possibility that these were secondarily introduced from non native populations of c mutica in atlantic through ballast water in sea chests of international shipping impact direct environmental and economic impacts of introduced c mutica populations remain unknown they provide valuable food sources for larger predators particularly fish in new zealand for example they have become part of diet of native big belly seahorse hippocampus in europe wild and farmed fish like common dab limanda limanda european perch perca fluviatilis and atlantic salmon salmo salar consume large amounts of non native c mutica however their larger sizes and very aggressive behavior also make them a serious threat to native species of skeleton shrimp a study in 2009 on native populations of caprella linearis a smaller caprellid species in helgoland region of german bight in north sea have revealed that c linearis have more or less vanished and have been replaced by c mutica c mutica fouling populations may also incur minor economic effects through cost of their removal from submerged aquaculture equipment and ship hulls control there are no known effective control measures for invasive caprella mutica populations as of 2012 it has been suggested that seasonal population fluctuations may be taken advantage of eradication efforts done during winter months when c mutica populations are dormant and at their lowest numbers are potentially more effective in preventing their recovery during summer months because of great difficulty in detecting and removing them however control methods will likely focus on preserving native species populations rather than eradication of established c mutica see also list of invasive species list of world s 100 worst invasive species references external links category category crustaceans
