lamellerie s expedition was a french naval operation launched in february 1806 four french navy frigates and a brig all survivors of battle of trafalgar in october 1805 attempted to break past british blockade of cadiz on 23 february 1806 taking advantage of withdrawal of principal blockade squadron several months earlier at start of atlantic campaign of 1806 although squadron was intercepted by elements of british blockade force captain louis charles auguste delamarre de lamellerie escaped with four frigates by abandoning slower brig which was captured during next six months lamellerie s squadron cruised atlantic visiting senegal cayenne and west indies but failing to cause any significant disruption to british trade on 27 july as squadron neared rochefort it was spotted by hms mars a royal navy ship of line stationed off port to intercept french ships entering or leaving signalling to rest of british squadron captain robert dudley oliver took mars in pursuit chasing french squadron all through night and into next morning by which time frigate rhin had fallen far behind others recognising that rhin was in danger of being captured lamellerie turned back to her defence with his main squadron but then changed his mind turning once more and retreating to rochefort as oliver took possession of heavily outgunned rhin background on 21 october 1805 french and spanish allied fleet was almost destroyed at battle of trafalgar by a royal navy fleet under vice admiral lord nelson among scattered survivors of allied fleet were five french frigates untouched during action with rest of surviving ships frigates anchored in cadiz during week that followed battle and remained there for rest of year contained in harbour by a large british blockade squadron led by vice admiral sir john thomas duckworth james p 187 in december 1805 however duckworth abandoned station in search of a french squadron under vice admiral zacharie allemand that was raiding british convoys off savage islands although allemand escaped duckworth british admiral became embroiled in atlantic campaign of 1806 and did not return to cadiz eventually sailing to caribbean where he won battle of san domingo on 6 february 1806 clowes p 193 in his absence duckworth s squadron was replaced at cadiz by ships grudgingly despatched from mediterranean fleet under command of vice admiral lord collingwood clowes p 197 french navy was concerned about its ships trapped in cadiz and sought to bring them back to french harbours particularly to make up for heavy losses suffered in trafalgar campaign therefore four frigates and a brig were prepared for sea under most senior frigate captain captain louis charles auguste delamarre de lamellerie of hortense these ships were to break out of cadiz conduct a six month raiding mission in atlantic to distract attention from ongoing atlantic campaign and raid british merchant shipping at conclusion of six months lamellerie was to return to rochefort to join french atlantic fleet gardiner p 25 breakout word of lamellerie s preparations reached collingwood and he planned a ruse to lure french frigate squadron out into open water withdrawing all large vessels of blockade squadron collingwood kept only 36 gun frigate hms hydra and 18 gun sloop hms moselle in position to create impression that principal blockading force had been driven off this it was hoped would draw lamellerie into an attack on lone ships that would allow rest of collingwood s squadron hidden just beyond horizon to counterattack and annihilate french squadron however on 23 february a strong westerly wind blew up and main squadron hydra and moselle were all blown too far to east this was spotted by lookouts on shore and lamellerie took opportunity to leave port on 26 february while british ships were still out of position lamellerie s squadron was spotted late on 26 february by lookouts on hydra and captain george mundy supported by captain john surman carden on moselle steered a parallel course in hope of cutting off their advance at 23 00 carden was detached to look for collingwood and inform him of location and direction of french while mundy continued to follow enemy squadron although hydra was now isolated and hopelessly outnumbered lamellerie made no effort to attack british ship he even failed to respond when brig furet falling behind larger and faster frigates came within range of hydra james p 214 mundy opened fire at 04 30 lieutenant dumay on furet acknowledging that he was hopelessly outgunned and completely unsupported by immediately striking his colours clowes p 198 as collingwood s squadron was nowhere within sight and french were rapidly pulling ahead mundy abandoned chase secured his prize and turned back eastwards as french continued into atlantic it is not known why lamellerie fled from such an inferior force and allowed one of his ships to be captured without opposition modern historian richard woodman describes his conduct as astonishing given weakness of opposition and strength of his own combined force but in a separate work suggests that lamellerie s orders precluded any engagement until his force was safely off coast woodman p 219 operations in atlantic following escape from cadiz remaining four ships of lamellerie s squadron sailed southwards reaching french african trading post of senegal in march and then crossing atlantic to cayenne arriving on 27 march woodman p 225 taking on fresh supplies squadron sailed from cayenne on 7 april and operated with limited success against british merchant shipping in caribbean sea including 15 days cruising off barbados retiring to spanish colony of puerto rico lamellerie resupplied his ships again in preparation for journey back to france frigate squadron sailed on 18 may leaving caribbean just as a large french squadron under vice admiral jean baptiste willaumez arrived james p 203 capture of rhin journey back to france was largely uneventful lamellerie crossing atlantic during may june and july without meeting any royal navy vessels at 18 00 on 27 july however at in bay of biscay frigates were spotted by lookouts on british ship of line hms mars mars was a large and powerful ship a veteran of trafalgar that was operating as a scout for squadron under commodore richard goodwin keats detailed to blockade french atlantic port of rochefort immediately giving chase captain robert dudley oliver signaled from mars to nearest british ship hms africa warning of position and direction of french africa passed this information on to keats while mars set all sail in pursuit of lamellerie gardiner p 26 running before more powerful ship under all possible sail four french frigates gradually became separated from one another in dark mars too was alone dudley easily outrunning rest of his squadron but unable to catch leading french ships when dawn rose on 28 july it was clear that hortense and other leading vessels were stretching distance between themselves and mars but that rearmost french ship frigate rhin was struggling to keep up clowes p 387 realising that he was gaining on rhin oliver continued pushing his ship forward and lamellerie recognising danger to his rearmost frigate turned his squadron about and bore down on isolated ship of line james p 253 although mars was far larger than any of individual frigates together they carried more guns and could have made an effective defence if handled efficiently determined to engage french oliver continued to sail towards lamellerie and at 15 00 french captain suddenly reversed his direction and fled eastwards with his three faster ships abandoning rhin to oliver by time lamellerie had turned away chase had traveled over from its original position and rhin could no longer hold off british ship a fierce rain squall caused frigate to roll and oliver maintained pursuit so that at 18 00 he was close enough to fire a single shot at rhin a warning of that a full broadside was to follow aware that his ship could not hope to withstand an attack from ship of line captain michel chesneau hauled down his flag and surrendered without a fight woodman p 226 although rest of lamellerie s ships were still within sight approaching night increasingly stormy weather and large number of prisoners of war to be transferred from prize persuaded oliver to give up any further pursuit lamellerie steered his remaining squadron along coast where it split up during night following day hortense and hermione entered bordeaux while themis was only one of squadron to reach its intended destination of rochefort oliver secured his prize but was so far from his station that he did not manage to rejoin keats squadron until 31 july aftermath rhin and prisoners were taken to britain where frigate was immediately fitted out as a royal navy ship under her old name as hms rhin oliver was commended for his perseverance and he and his men shared in prize money from frigate in france there appears to have been no condemnation of lamellerie s repeated failure to engage royal navy forces that in terms of weight of shot at least were inferior of his squadron in his official report he inaccurately claimed that his frigates had all been too badly damaged during atlantic cruise to consider fighting a ship of line he was later made a peer after return of french monarchy and remained in french navy for many years in british histories his actions have been roundly condemned william james accuses him of lying in his official despatches and wrote in 1827 what then but a misrepresentation of facts could have saved this french commodore from being cashiered james p 254 while richard woodman wrote in 1998 that such apparent fed stories of british superiority against all odds and tended to breed a dangerous conceit order of battle commodore la marre la s squadron ship guns commander notes hortense 40 commodore louis charles auguste
